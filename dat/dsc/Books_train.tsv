I would have to say that this is the best book I 've ever read.. I could feel every word deep in my heart everytime , of the many times I 've read it ! I would never get enough of it ! its a treasure..	1
Loved this book since first I read it , years gone by . Purchased this copy for a friend who has not ever read Gibran .	1
Reading a classic such as & quot ; The Prophet & quot ; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often , the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran , listening to him speak . The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen , embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet .	1
Got this book for my son who was n't familiar with Kahlil Gabran . Everyone should read him at least once do n't you think ? The book was more attractive than pictured and small - fits in his pocket . He likes it .	1
My brother was looking for this book and I ordered it for him . I was pleased with the price and the fact I could have it shipped directly to him . Thanks Amazon !	1
Larkin published several books on Biblical studies.in the 1910 's and 20 's . Revelation has a constant narrative with a beginning , middle and end . It is also one of the essential sacred texts and required reading for anyone interested in religion.This book is a great reference whether they are & # 34 ; dispensationalists & # 34 ; on not . Highly recommended reading . Thanks Amazon	1
I enjoy reading these books with my 2YO . The words are short , the illustrations are entertaining and the story does n't drag on to bore him . He is able to turn the pages and tell me the story by just looking at the pictures ! He is especially fascinated by the animals- goose , moose , mouse , pig ... and always giggles at & # 34 ; kick the stone & # 34 ; - for whatever reason . Lol.I am completely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this as an addition to any toddler 's bookshelf ! If you do buy this and it 's a hit , consider alsoGo , Dog ! Go ! Are you my mother ? Big Dog , Little Dog	1
Beginning with & quot ; The first six words I 'll teach my pup are 'dig a hole ' and 'fill it up . ' & quot ; this book is absolutely hilarious . I had never heard of it before my son came along , but it is one of his favorites and mine . It is whimiscal , clever , and just plain fun : & quot ; have a care , do n't paint the mayor. & quot ; The cadence and flow of the words are masterful.This nugget will surprise you . I hope you enjoy it .	1
A favorite Berenstain book of my children I was happy to find it for my grandson .	1
This book is quite funny . Especially when you read it fast as I 'm always requested to do . How fast can you read , `` big brown bear , blue babboon , beautiful babboon blowing bubbles , biking backward , bump black bug 's banana boxes ... '' And and it goes from there ! It 's really fun to read aloud and plus it 's easy for little ones to memorize . A very cute book , and a very easy way to teach the letter 'b ' . Great book - ours gets taken to bed !	1
During the night , my little boy tipped over his toy bin and used it to scale his bookshelves . This morning there were a pile of about twenty books on the floor and he wanted me to read every one of them . For the most part , he would lose interest after a page or two , but a few he listened to right until the end . Those books deserve a write-up.That he listened all the way through The Berenstains ' B Book surprised me . I did lose interest after about the fourth page , but he was loving all those Bs , so I read it to the end . This is a silly little book , which , not shockingly emphasizes the letter B . It becomes quite a tricky tongue-twister long before you reach the end of the book . I could n't really tell you what specifically my three-year-old liked about the book , but he did really enjoy it.The illustrations feature the funnel-snouted animals of the Berenstains -- cute and colorful , but not easily recognizable , and , therefore not my favorite style . Again , my little boy liked all the silly images and colors , even if he did n't believe me that the bear was supposed to be a bear .	1
Water for Elephants is a tough one for me to review . I loved the theme and the split realities of it . You are basically following Jacob Jankowski , the protagonist , through two of his life 's biggest adventures . We are introduced to him at the circus and follow his story of how he becomes a vet for the Benzini Brother 's traveling circus . We are also switching back into his current reality where he is re-living these days from the nursing home that he now resides in.There are good plot points throughout , and I did find myself wanting to get back to the book to see what happens next . At times , however , I found certain events did not play out in a way that was realistic to the story that was being built . Even though I was enjoying the story and the narrative - I found myself aware of the fact that there was an author behind it all , pulling the strings . Not being able to quite put my finger on why , I was often pulled out of believing the story , almost as if the author was showing too many fingerprints of the process of writing . For this reason - it was hard for me to get lost completely in the book itself.All of that aside , however , I still found it beautiful . There was a moment in particular when I felt incredibly sad for our main character - to the point where I had to put the book down and step away for a moment to collect myself . There is a wonderfully commentary woven throughout that allows the reader to ponder where one is at when you are looking back at your life in old age . I really enjoyed that thread.I had heard a lot of really good things about the book , and was going into it that way . Unfortunately , there was something missing for me when I completed it , almost as if I had skipped an important part . For that reason , I give it four stars .	1
A friend recommended this book and I was thoroughly engulfed in it from the beginning . Such raw , real life and survival during the depression era . Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world , grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing . The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings . But , the wonderful , painful and thrilling story of his life , his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob !	1
A great read ! Warm and wonderful storytelling . Character , color , and story : it 's all here ! Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER Push Not the River and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Against a Crimson Sky : A Novel	1
Sure `` Water for Elephants '' has been around and even turned into a movie , but I 've only just now read the book . I 'll have to go and see the movie . . . if only to see the director 's interpretation of the glorious scenes of circus life this book conjures up in the reader 's mind.Judging by the number of people who took time out to write reviews for this book , I must say it lives up to the critical acclaim in just about every way possible . At least for this reader it did . Every writer knows that in order to keep the readers ' attention a novel must have tension on every page . This novel is almost the illustration of that rule . I loved taking the trip . I highly recommend this book to almost anyone . I think it will become a classic.This is masterful writing and I 've passed it on to my sister who is now devouring it whole . Congratulations to Sara Gruen for producing this stunning page-turner . I absolutely loved it ! 5 Stars . Great Read !	1
It took me a bit to get into this book . I 'm not sure why - but mostly it is probably because my days have started out so busy , I do n't get around to reading til I 'm already exhausted . Once I got into it , I could n't stop reading . I stayed up too late , I read until I fell asleep , and then got irritated when I woke up and did n't have time to finish the book . : ) It really only took a few hours , it was just finding those few hours to read.Great summer read , beautiful love story , and definitely makes me want to FINALLY see a circus . Yes , I 'm 35 and have not been to a circus ( that I remember ) ! ***SPOILER ALERT***Do n't read any further if you have n't read the book , or get upset by spoilers . Because this will give a few things away.First , a preface ... I love the line because it reminds me of the kind of person I *want* in my life . Faced with a 10ft thick , 100ft tall wall of obstacles , he KNOWS he 's on the losing end , but does n't give up or freak out.My favorite line in the book , `` Dear God . Not only am I unemployed and homeless , but I also have a pregnant woman , bereaved dog , elephant , and eleven horses to take care of . `` This line made me giggle out loud , and it brightened my whole day .	1
Water for Elephants was a fabulous book . I could not put it down . The photos of Circus life back in the 30 's added to the experience . You wo n't be disappointed with this book as it contained lots of action , great characters , and a wonderful love story between a young man and woman and their love of the circus animals.Water for Elephants : A Novel	1
What a great story ! My wife has been wanting to watch the movie so I had to hurry up and read the book . It is a very charming love story played out on the set of a traveling circus . The times are hard , but true love for both people and animals finds a way to shine through . Loved , loved the ending !	1
Water for Elephants is an entertaining read that chronicles the life of Jacob , a circus ' veterinarian ( well , would have been if he would have taken his final exams ) . The story is told in alternating time periods , Jacob recounting his youth from the confines of an assisted living facility . After the horrific death of his parents during the Great Depression , Jacob drops out of school and begins working with the Benzini Brothers circus . He quickly discovers the dark secrets so well-hidden behind the cheerful , humorous faade of circus shows . While on the road Jacob grows up and learns a great deal about life `` out in the real world '' while traveling with the circus , including lessons on friendship , trust , love and self-reliance.This novel is extremely plot driven and is not a literary challenge by any means . I appreciate the take on circus life ; this is n't something that is commonly written about . It was still very enjoyable and interesting , and I would recommend it for all readers .	1
This is such a nice book . I truely recommend it . You ca n't put it down after you start reading .	1
Well , I spent 30 minutes writing a thorough review for one of the best books I 've read in a long time , and -- it 's been three days -- and it 's not showing up . I ca n't recreate what took so long to write , so I 'll just say ... this book is woooonderful . I hated for it to end .	1
I loved how this story switched between the past and the present . I have n't read a book like that in awhile , so I was really happy for something different ... a little break from the norm . I could n't put this book down , and now heard it is being made into a movie . Woo hoo !	1
This book is very touching and entertaining . I was reluctant to read this but once I started , I just ca n't put it down . If you like to know about what it is like behind the circus ' life , being old and left alone..pick this one . You will understand more how to deal with old people and what its in their mind ... I have no doubt I will re read this book again in the future	1
I bought this book based on the reviews , and I loved it . It may not be perfect , but it is a great , fun , easy read . Loved the ending !	1
Water for Elephants is an awesome story about an engaging character that had me sneaking my kindle out at work to read a bit more.I loved it from start to finish . Some have criticized the amalgamation of the Jacob story from the Bible and post depression circuses but it works beautifully.The level of detail and insight into the train circus world shows an incredible amount of research but one of the most amazing things is none of those details come across as research . They are as natural to the story as the characters .	1
Saw the movie before getting the book which I downloaded from Kindle . Really liked the movie and then decided to buy the book . The book is an easy read and if you ever have been to a circus or were curious about behind the scenes then you will probably enjoy the book . If you are looking for a deep mystery then this is probably not for you but if you like love stories and do n't want to have to keep a notepad beside you to jot down things to remember so as not to get lost or confused in the story then this is the book for you . I loved reading it on lazy days when I did n't have to concentrate real hard but could let my mind and imagination get lost in the characters and their telling of the story . This Kindle book was downloaded immediately without any problems as usual .	1
OK - I admit it . I really liked this book . My wife was shocked that I wanted to read it , but she had loved it so much I thought I would give it a try . It is such an interesting story . You can tell it was well researched as it truly brings to life the way circus people lived nearly 100 years ago.The characters are memorable . You really feel that you know Jacob and all the performers in the Benzini Brothers Circus . The story revolves around a love triangle all set within the context of the depression and circus life . This does not come across at all like a romance novel . The story is well-crafted and keeps the reader 's interest . All key items I look for in a book . There were a few fights intermingled to keep my sense of action / adventure happy too.Pros : o well researched depression era circus lifeo wonderful characters who you grow to know and loveo full telling of story - you do n't feel like anything was left outCons : o none big enough to comment onOverall - I highly recommend this book . A great American novel .	1
This book left me with a insight into the circus world and wanting to read more and more . I loved the way she incorporated the thoughts of the older character into the story , it really makes a person realize how aging feels . I really liked the characters and felt like I knew them personally !	1
This is a great book . It has twists and turns and many surprises . One of those stories I would read again . There is so much I am sure I missed something .	1
A truly great read with a slice of American history thrown in . I recommend this book to history buffs and animal lovers , alike .	1
Such a great book . Flash back from the main character 's POV . Not my usual genre of book , but absolutely fell in love with this book . I could not put it down . I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read . Absolutely delightful !	1
This was a really good , enjoyable , authentic , endearing book . Thoroughly enjoyable read . One of a kind , leaves you wanting more of the circus on the rails of the depression era . I also love first-person novels that stay on plot and Gruen does n't disappoint there.I TOTALLY disagree with another reviewer who said Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story ! Hardly . If anything , if Jacob is a vet , we read very little of him doing his job in context of the story . And anyone who 's around animals or has worked with animals can hardly fail to form emotional attachments to them.When I finished WATER FOR ELEPHANTS , I like I felt when I finished reading FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE and SEABISCUIT .	1
The book was very interesting because of the time difference from young to old man . The ending was great . Not expected .	1
Do you know how difficult it is to run and cry at the same time ? Good books do that do me . And this was a good book.Brilliant , actually.That 's the best way to describe it . The words themselves , the characterization , the anticipation . It 's brilliant.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is the story of Jacob Jankowski at twenty-three and at ninety ( or ninety-three ) . At twenty-three , he ran away and joined the circus after his parents were killed in an accident . He had been studying to be a vet and was all but final exams . In the circus , Jacob encounters brutality , unexpected kindness , and love . At ninety ( or ninety-three ) , Jacob 's in a nursing home.The story fits well with Resurrection with it 's themes of dignity , redemption , and anticipation . Twenty-three-year-old Jacob 's Resurrection scene spread the resurrection and transformation to others . The Jacob in the end of the book is different from the Jacob in the beginning , and his transformation allows him to step in and fight for others . He may not always succeed in the way he desires , but he hands resurrection to others . It 's a story about coming home.It 's a story about dignity . Gruen frames the story so that you are hit by the fact that this old man , left to drool over Jello his last few years , is the twenty-three-year-old Jacob in the circus . These stories are n't just stories . They 're stories of people we 've forgotten about . It made me remember sitting at tea with my grandmother listening to her stories . I wish I 'd written them down.It 's about the dignity of the outcasts . In Depression-era America , especially on a circus , midgets , drunks , and the bottom-of-the-barrell working class were the outcasts . They were n't `` needed '' in society . They were easily disposed of . Because of this , Jacob becomes a Christ-figure restoring the dignity of a midget and a drunk , fighting for the oppressed , both human and animal.Gruen 's strongest point , I think , is her ability to build anticipation . One scene captures it : Grady has ( bad ) news for Jacob . In waiting for Grady to spill it , Jacob notices the two drops of grease leaking from Grady 's hamburger . Brilliance in these little details . The reader ( namely , me ) wants to shake Grady by the shoulders and scream at him to tell already ! It 's also about what Gruen does n't write , where she holds back . I think as writers , sometimes we think we have to fill in every detail . For example , in a fight scene , Gruen does n't give a blow-by-blow . Rather , she focuses on the confusion of the protag ( Jacob ) , his swirling thoughts , a moment of pain here or there , his inability to stop hitting . Rather than observing the fight as you would a movie , you 're caught up in the hero . I love this .	1
This is a good book that brings to light the underbelly of the circus that is not quite as glamerous as one might imagine . I book that leave you wondering what attracts performers to that type of life .	1
Seems to depict a type of circus life and it 's hectic life style.. it had fun , love , action , sadness and raw life . Interesting !	1
Water for Elephants captivates the reader with its deeply moving and touching storyline.It is charming , magical ... . laced with sadness , humour , joy . The story of a young man who loses everything dear to him in this world and then finds meaning and happiness in the most unexpected and least likely place ... .a traveling circus . The book really brings to life the spirit and times of a traveling circus ( set in the backdrop of the Great Depression ) . Its many colorful , unique characters vividly bring to life this largly forgotten bygone era.Water for Elephants is simply a pleasure to read . The only drawback to the book is that there is quite a bit of cursing and several sexually explicit passages that might offend certain readers.If you can overlook or skip these rough spots you will certainly experience great pleasure in reading Water for Elephants .	1
This book was a quick read , and I thought it was very interesting . The reader gets a close up view of the inner workings of the circus , the performers , animal caretakers , etc , mixed in with a love story of sorts . However , even though the book was good , it was not great . It 's not one I 'd want to keep , or read again . The author introduced too many characters too quickly , and only after reading on for awhile do you sort them out . I did n't really come to love any of the characters enough to care much about what happened to them . The plot seemed weak , character development weak . I liked the HBO series Carnivale , and although this is also a circus book , it was slightly disappointing to me .	1
I absolutly LOVED this book ! The characters jump off the page and you are transported into another time , in another world that is the circus life . Once I started this book I never wanted to put it down . I ca n't wait to read Sara Gruen 's other titles , she is obviously a very talented author.Take my word for it , you 'll LOVE this book !	1
Once I started reading this book , I could n't put it down ! Grabs you from the first page , and does n't let go ! A fast-moving read with lots of action , and no filler . It has love , romance , mystery , murder , animals and history . All while riding a circus train during the depression in 1931 . Cutting deftly back and forth from the eyes of an elderly man residing in a nursing home , to the days he spent traveling with the train circuses in the 1930 's , this story is gritty , realistic , fascinating and highly entertaining . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
The book was well researched and had an interesting plot . I would recommend it .	1
What a terrific read ! Water for Elephants has been lauded as a `` great pick for summer '' , but this book is so much more . It has a depth and a substance to it that you do n't usually find in your typical `` beach read '' . It 's obvious that the author did her research into the time period ( post-Depression America ) , and the subject matter ( traveling circuses ) . According to the author 's note at the end of the book , many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events , culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers . As a result , Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.The main character is a cantankerous , still-sharp 93-year-old man , and his frustration at being trapped in an old man 's body is palpable . The story of his incredible life and adventures with the Benzini Brothers circus unfolds in a way that is emotionally wrenching , and yet flashes of good humor pervade throughout . The characters are richly drawn , and even the animals are given complex personalities that make them a pivotal part of the story . There is something in the novel for everyone : it is equal parts adventure , mystery , fictional memoir , love story , and historical account.I highly recommend this book !	1
Loved the story and style . I couldnt put the book down and finished it in a couple of days . Every page made for compelling reading . An easy book to read .	1
This book is nice . It gives you a feel on how live was during the depression and also a great insight of the workings of a circus in the 30s . I enjoyed this book a lot . The characters are great and I am looking forward to read more books by this author .	1
`` Water for Elephants '' is one of those rare , enchanting novels that takes the reader into another world with complete believability . Reading this tale makes you believe you are on board this Depression-era circus train , complete with all the sounds and smells.A great novel must combine such a travelouge with interesting , human characters , and Sara Gruen has accomplished that . The New Yorker review complained that the protagonist , Jacob , was not interesting because he was `` relentlessly decent . '' Apparently the idea that some people really are decent escaped the jaded reviewer . Also , Jacob certainly commits his share of moral transgressions ( and is ready to commit murder ) in the course of his growth into the decent man who so bored the New Yorker.The Publisher 's Weekly reviewer complained of a predictable ending , and that 's not true , either : it took me until the last chapter to see where Jacob 's journey would end , and the final twist is a heartwarming one . Maybe that 's what some too-cynical professional reviewers really do n't like : the idea that , in literature as in real life , some stories are uplifting ones.I 'm a writer as well as a voracious and nit-picking reader , and I do n't give five-star reviews . In this case , though , nothing else would do .	1
I sampled this book because it 's so popular and the price was right . The author 's voice captured me with the authenticity of the elderly Jacob . Literally seconds after I finished reading the sample , I hit `` buy now . '' One of the most brilliant techniques in the book , and my personal favorite , is the little jolt the author created every time the point of view switches from young Jacob to old Jacob , and it makes you flinch as though you too have been wrenched from the prime of your life into the body of a decrepit codger in a nursing home.The ending is perfect and satisfyingThe scenes depicting cruelty to animals were emotionally difficult to read , though . If that kind of thing bothers you , you may not enjoy the story .	1
How many novels have you read about the circus ? This was certainly my first and that 's what I loved about it - it was something out of the ordinary . The story flowed smoothly and was full of great stories . I read a review stating that the characters were n't realistic , August was too horrid and Jacob was a coward . I definitely disagree and found most , if not all , the characters to be believable.My only complaint is the vocabulary in the novel . It seemed the author was going out of her way to use synonyms fairly close together within the plot . While I do n't mind challenges to my vocabulary I did n't find it believable as if the story was really told from one person 's point of view it is doubtful that they would use such extreme variety in word choices . This is nit-picking though , overall I really enjoyed the journey !	1
I enjoyed this book from start to finish . My only criticism is regarding a little to much explicit sexual description and violent animal abuse . Otherwise , I found it very well written , and a fascinating tale .	1
Well written at a good pace with events . Kind of weird with the flipping between timeline , but I see this type of conversation with my dad . Will not see the movie as I enjoyed the book more than I thought I would . Is a good read .	1
I read The Glass Castle and did n't think I could ever find another book that would grab my attention like that one did . WRONG ! ! If you liked Glass Castle ... your going to love this book . Do n't the title deter you.I totally enjoyed this book . Enjoy	1
Gruen got inside the circus . This story is told from an old man 's point of view , but we see Jacob clearly as a young man too.If you like action with a little romance , this is a good read .	1
Very nice interesting book -- a nice change from romances or killer/thrillers ! Relaxing and enjoyable ! I would definitely read this author again .	1
The book was better than the movie . Characters seemed real . Liked the detail about the animals and life on the rails .	1
Riding Lessons : A Novel , Flying Changes : A NovelSara Gruen 's gift for drawing her characters as complex , whole , fully real persons is what makes Water for Elephants and her other books achingly wonderful to read . She so skillfully sets up the reader for the crest of each wave of the plot , that one is rooting for a positive change , a win for the character , while at the same time feeling the reverberation of their flaws and weaknesses.The book reads very much like a memoir , making it is easy to forget that it is a work of fiction . And , in order to sketch such a complex setting , I know she had to spend a very great amount of time researching the complexities of a circus on the road . I immediately bought and read her two other novels and found them excellent reads while seeing how she has developed her skills with each book .	1
This book was hard to put down . This powerful story brought the pain of well developed characters to life . Sometimes I was afraid to read on knowing what I would read would be tragic but this story was told with such beauty I had to read on . The story is told as a life history of a gentleman living in a nursing home and the description of his days being cared for in the home are so real . The story of the circus performers , manager and all the tragedy was gripping . I just had to keep reading - then the ending was a complete shock . This was one of the best books I have read recently , but I ca n't think of seeing the movie . I want to remember this story as I envisioned the settings and characters while reading . It was a great book .	1
This is one of those fine books that you never want to end . I ca n't complain about how it ended , however . I just was n't ready to leave the characters and story behind . I recommend this book to anyone who loves reading . Let 's hope Ms Gruen writes another one like this .	1
What a haunting cast of characters , true voices , detailed descriptions that went on just long enough , plot twist at the end ... I devoured this book in just 24 hours . I keep thinking about Jacob and Marlena and August , and even Rosie . How wonderful that the author did so much research into the history ; it really came alive for me . I ca n't wait for the movie ! One of the best pieces of fiction I have read in some time .	1
An enjoyable three ring circus ! With many acts and clowns ( both more ways than one . ) The reader participated ... in sights and sounds ! This multi-layered book was a high flying wire show ! Bravo !	1
This book is one the best books I have ever read . I read a lot of books . This was a very good story .	1
What a delightful book . I was hesitant at first to pick up , but so very glad I did . It had me in it 's clutches on the first page , and I could n't put it down until the last . What a wonderful cast of characters , both good and evil . I have recommended to many , and hopefully they will read as well . Thank you Sara , for such a good time !	1
Great premiere book from this author . I thoroughly enjoyed the read . It gives a ringside appreciation for life in the traveling bigtop .	1
Never saw the movie but truly enjoyed the book . I think every kid ( especially two generations ago ) wanted to run off and join the circus . Seemed like such a glamorous life on the road , wearing glittering costumes , etc . This book gave the child in me a behind the scenes look at life on the road with the circus . And I can empathize with the passion Jacob has his memories . Quick read .	1
This was a great book , the only problem was I finished it too quickly because it was so good !	1
I loved this book . Regardless of what others have said about the authors writing , she did fabulous . Great story line , great characters . A little graphic is some scenes but wonderfully written . Ca n't wait to watch the movie even though I know it wo n't be as good .	1
I enjoyed reading this book . It kept my interest and I learned about the world of the traveling circus . I had no knowledge of this world . It was a very hard life for these people . Working so hard day in and day out and not getting paid . I knew elephants were very smart animals but Rosie was wonderful . I liked her spunk . I thought the story going back and forth from the present to the past kept the book interesting .	1
I really enjoyed this book . One of my all time favorites . After reading it , I became interested in circus/ carnival documentaries . I entertained myself with this subject for about 3 months . True carny people really love the life . Fascinating .	1
This book by Ms. Gruen is truly wonderful literature , not simply a story . The story is wonderful , but the methods she uses to weave the human existance into it is simply breathtaking . If you do not like to cry after reading a book , I recommend you avoid it . The bittersweet human connection in this book is outstanding and she has truly captured circus life in the depression years as no other book has ever done . A truly wonderful read .	1
Spellbinding novel . I found the story line kept you in suspense as well as wanting to read on and not put the book down .	1
I hated history in school because it was always just a jumble of dates and places . Books like this are always a pleasure to read as you get to see what happened through the eyes of someone who was either there or did the research so you could see what happened through their eyes . Mine were definitely opened . Thank you to the author .	1
To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking , hard living , hard loving , worldy writer . In this book , the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge . There , Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military . Once united with the militia , Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria . The fight scenes are incredible . The ending is even more incredible . I 'm not going give away the book , but the ending brought tears to my eyes- I guess it 's true , underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold .	1
Mark Twain once said that `` a classic is a book that everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read . '' It is a shame that `` For Whom the Bell Tolls '' is considered a classic , because unlike some of Hemingway 's works , this is such an exciting , vivid , impossible-to-put-down novel . It should never be required reading in high school , although intelligent young readers would certainly love it . ( Now that I think about it , some of the violent scenes are probably too gory for today 's politically correct curriculum anyway . ) It is the sort of book that someone 's older brother at college lends to them , and then they pass it on to their best friend , and so on . There 's a lot to this book beyond the plot , but unlike many other books that strive to explore deep human themes of life , sex and death , this one is approachable and very readable.The only reason I can think of not to drop everything and read this book right away ( look how cheap the used copies are , for crying out loud ! ) , is if you are planning a long voyage and want to make sure you have something really great to read along the way , in which case I would wait . While I am sorry that I did n't the book myself until I was 34 , I had the great gift of reading it on a camping trip amidst hills , streams , pine tress and a rocky coastline that made it easy to imagine myself in the mountains of Spain along with the characters , and that made it worth the wait .	1
Who am I or anyone else to critique this masterpiece ? I like to read a wide variety and the classics have a beloved place in the cycle . This book is a masterpiece , pure and simply a masterpiece .	1
This was my second time to read it . I watched the movie with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman and had to read the book again . Of course , the book is better than the movie . Great read - love Hemingway books .	1
It 's difficult to point at one work of a writer like Ernest Hemingway and claim it to be the best , but that is the claim that I would make for `` For Whom the Bell Tolls . `` This is a story that captures both the true spirit and the doubtful minds of war . It portrays both courage and cowardice , in the beautifully descriptive words that Hemingway was known for . His main character Robert Jordan is an American college instructor who leaves his job to take part in the Spanish Revolution , with a strong conviction in his heart and truly believing that he can make a difference . The story encompasses a time frame of slightly less than three days , during which he plots to blow a strategic bridge at precisely the right time . In those three days he falls in love with a young Spanish girl in the encampment where he is awaiting that moment and is involved in a character conflict with one of the guerrilla fighters by the name of Pablo.This is a well paced story and never boring , with action suspense and romance , all coming together in a setting where you can feel the cold and smell the forest in the way that only Hemingway can describe it . A splendid and beautifully told story that I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender . For that reason I would place `` For Whom the Bell Tolls '' at the top of the heap among all of his works.In my opinion this great story is the pinnacle of Hemingway 's talent . A must read for anyone interested in great literature .	1
My first Hemingway was Men Without Women , a collection of short stories , and I was so bored with it . After that , I pretty much put Hemingway on my black list , because if I could n't stand his short stories , there 's no way I 'll get through a whole novel . Man was I wrong . I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend . All I can say is wow ! This book is truly beautiful ; the characters , the scenes , and all the emotions that goes with it.The whole story takes place in 4 days . It 's about a man who 's on a mission to blow up a bridge and to do so he needs to work with the local guerrillas . Each character is unique , and the all the things one man can learn about life in just 4 days.Definitely one of my favorite books of all time . I look forward to checking out his other novels as well .	1
Robert Jordan , an American , joins a guerrilla force fighting against the Facist government in Spain . It is 1937 at the peak of the Spanish Civil War and Jordan has been sent to blow up a bridge.Jordan is a dynamiter who knows weapons and military strategies . Among the gurerillas is a young woman , Maria , who becomes attracted to him.A man named Pablo appears to be in charge . However , it is his wife , Pilar , who is the real force behind the group . Pilar , is Spanish for pillar and is a symbol of the steadfastness of the group . During the early action of the story , it seems that Pilar 's resolve for fighting has changed and he often resorts to drinking.Amidst the talk of killing we follow the activities of Robert and Marie . This mixture of love and war is a significant juxtaposition used by the author . With the tender moments of these two characters , it is as if this might be what the guerrilas are fighting for . The government 's totalarianism attitude can not tell them what to do and that gypsies like Rafael , foreigners like Robert , women like Pilar and Marie can all work and live together as equals.Hemingway has a master 's givt for dialogue . We do n't just read the words but are transported to the Spanish mountainside and are listening to the scenes such as Pilar and Pablo discussing a matador that Pable had seen and admired . It is so real that we can almost hear the crowd chant ole'.Hemindway was a reporter in Spain during the Civil War and his characters are honest in their actions loyal to one another and Spain and are described in great detail.The story mixes historical fact and speculative fiction in a most entertaining manner . Readers will enjoy the novel and feel as though they have read a work of extroadinary literary significance .	1
It 's hard to write a a concise review for this wonderful novel that would begin to capture the emotion and vitality within its pages . Read the Amazon description for a plot summary ; but do n't be fooled into thinking it 's a black and white story about the Spanish Revolution . Hemingway has an amazing way of capturing the sheer humanity of the whole undertaking . The Reds , the fascists , the anarchists and the uncommitted are all examined and ultimately shown as being human beings first , and political creatures second.At the same time it is the ultimate war novel and love story . Hemingway delves into Jordan 's perspective of the characters and is vivid in his description of the Spanish countryside while also maintaining a near stream of consciousness of intelligent thoughts . The simultaneous vitality and fatalism of the characters is amazing . Truly a wonderful book .	1
I was born and brought up in Delhi , and lived there for 21 years of my life , after which I emigrated to the United States . This book made me feel that how oblivious many of us 'locals ' are , of the many riches and insights that my home city has to offer.William Dalrymple peels the multilayered culture of the historical city of Delhi - seven times the capital of empires - ruined and rebuilt again . He spans from the Punjabi immigrants that 've filled the newer parts of economically booming Delhi sice the partition of India in 1947 ; to the more historic but now decrepit old Delhi - where the legendary age old 'Persian ' customs such as the 'Kabootar ' ( Pegion ) fights , the 'Chor ' ( Thief ) Bazaars and the mysterious 'Hakims ' ( Doctors practicing an old school of medicine ) are unquestioned parts of the daily lives of many . Dalrymple also describes the curious and unique collision of history leading to the current day fate of the Indian Hijras ( Eunuchs ) , who ring the door bells of apartments of Delhi 's denizens , in the old city and the new , on any kind of festivity . He describes the fascinating history and architecture of the tomb of Himayun and Hazrat Nizam-ud-din , the charming old 'Quawaalis ' ( musical forums ) still alive there , and many other monuments that I visited umpteen times as a kid , the 'Sadhus ' , an ancient culture intact with flavors ... the list is endless . Somehow , I missed making the connections , and could see the beauty of the entire kaliedoscope when I read this book . I find my visits to Delhi so much more fascinating . One thing that the readers must be made aware though is the overt focus on history of Mughal ( Persian ) Delhi - which is for a reason - that all the pre-Mughal monuments were destroyed . The Delhi that exists is newer than the spirit of the city really is.Since I read this book I always try to find such books on the cities I 've visited . A strong recommend for anyone visiting Delhi -- you can choose to be put off by the seeming boorishness of the existing 'New ' Delhi , or scratch beneath the surface and discover magic !	1
Book was in good shape . Received it very quickly . Gave it as a Christmas present , recipient very pleased with it .	1
I read this many years ago , and have re-read it many times since then . The story is gripping , the characters vivid and engaging , and it is just a satisfying read in every way . Look for it in used bookstores and library sales -- the prices online are unreal . Whay has n't some clever publisher reissued this gem ?	1
I go from historical romance novels to historical fiction to non-fiction but easy-to-read history . Each of them has its own slant on perspective about that era , ranging from history-as- wallpaper to up-close rendering , as if you were there . This is one of the very few novels that manages to combine the elements of all 3 kinds of those books into a very gripping reading saga of WWII . So you are given well researched history in a very palatable form . It follows an interrelated cast of characters all over the map with WWII , taking us deeply into the critical locales . There is even a fascinating account given by a German general , interspersed throughout , of the war as seen through the opposite side 's eyes . Wouk does an incredible job and his sequel , & quot ; War and Remembrance & quot ; is almost as goood .	1
Herman Wouk has a way with words and characterizations . The historical events and issues that lead to the U.S. entry into World War II are woven into the Henry family , a military clan that the father ( Pug ) characterizes as tumbleweeds blown around by the wind . I found this very enjoyable .	1
& # 34 ; The Winds of War & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; War and Remembrance & # 34 ; had been sitting on my shelf , unread , for some time . At over 1000 pages each , their length is imposing. & # 34 ; The Winds of War & # 34 ; is completely worth the time it takes to read . The story is engrossing , the history is fascinating , and the way Herman Wouk weaves relationships , politics , and military action is magnificent.This book is a must read for any military history buff but even for those who are not a fan of the genre , I believe there is much that would keep you interested . The story is built around the Henry family - a Navy family with three grown children who all have unique personalities and interests . While it takes place in the years leading up to the US military involvement in WWII , the story really focuses on the lives of these five people and those they encounter along the way . Some of their encounters are with other fictional characters such as a famous radio personality , a scientist and engineer involved in the development of nuclear weapons , a British journalist , and an accomplished author who happens to be Jewish . Other encounters are with historical people including big names from WWII : Hitler , Stalin , Churchill , and FDR . No matter who the encounter is with Mr Wouk keeps the novel a novel with interesting and well-developed dialogue.Through the course of the book , the reader is presented with multiple perspectives on the war . The American viewpoint is prominent , of course , but through the characters interactions across the globe other views are featured . One unique way the German perspective is presented is by interspersing chapters of a fictional history of WWII written by a German officer , von Roon , which was translated by the main character , Pug Henry , along with commentary by Henry on what he agrees and disagrees with from von Roon 's account.Do n't be kept away by the length of this novel . It is well worth the time to read - both for the history and for the story itself.Now , on to & # 34 ; War and Remembrance & # 34 ; . From the reviews of this sequel , I 'm sure I wo n't be disappointed !	1
This is a 5-star book that should read by anybody with an interest in WW II . The comments and complaints regarding sexism and poor female characters ... well the book was published in 1971 . Compare it to some of the other fiction being published at the time ... Ian Fleming , John MacDonald , Robert Heinlein . Wouk comes of pretty well in comparison to those authors , I think , especially as his subject is war . Despite this , Wouk still constructs some fascinating female characters ... and not all of them are brilliant , easy to sympathize with , or even very smart . But then again , neither are the men.It 's a long story , a bit melodramatic at times , will infuriate you , and bring tears to your eyes . Which was what Wouk set out to accomplish .	1
For this installment of the Aubrey/Maturin series , author Patrick O'Brian went to a little-known historical skirmish that took place between Great Britain and France ( as usual ! ) over the ownership of a couple islands in the Indian Ocean , including Mauritius . As O'Brian points out in the introduction to the book , there was little need to embellish ( i.e . fictionalize ) the events , since this was such a little-known event and because there was plenty of drama to be had in what really happened ( basically , the real-life commodore is changed to Jack Aubrey ) .The book contains all the details we come to expect from an Aubrey/Maturin novel - as appreciaton of the tactical and strategic situations , the politics of the Royal Navy , the way seniority and authority are handled , descriptions of ships , etc . But like with any well-crafted prose , such expository details never feel like exposition , but serve to immerse the reader in the world of the Napoleonic-era Royal Navy . And its never at the expense of the action or the advance of plot points . As for the novel itself , it 's just as interesting and engrossing as the previous three novels in the series thus far . The resolution may not be as satisfying in the traditional sense , but historically is a happy ending indeed - carrying the dispatches after a victory may not sound like a big deal , but the captains of such ships were often feted as much or more than the actual captain that won the battle ( in this case they are the same person at least ) . At any rate , the adherence to the overall historical timeline gives the novel a greater authenticity , even if it is n't quite the most satisfying way to script an adventure novel.There 's really little else to say - if you 've read any of the novels in this series you 'll know what to expect . That 's not to say that they are getting boring or repetative ! They are each fresh and exciting in their own right , and I 'll continue through the series looking forward to each new adventure . If you have n't read one of these novels yet ... . what are you waiting for ?	1
these classics seldom disappoint , and while the language ( and naval jargon ) sometimes to slow things down , the characters are incredibly well developed , and if you spend some time with them , you feel like you know them well . great work by a great author	1
The arguably offensive title aside , this is one of my favorite Flashman books , out the twelve that George MacDonald Fraser was able to write . One reason may be the fact that it 's set in America , but I suspect that more pertinent to my liking the novel is the resonance between its two halves . In the first , Flashman joins a party journeying westward in 1849 . In the second , he is present at the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn , where he meets his past once more . As always this this series , the story-telling is gripping , the prose transparent and flowing , and the historical research impeccable -- the pieces once more fit together with inevitable , easy coincidence . Fraser certainly knew how to relate a tale , and this is one of the best he ever constructed .	1
before you pick this book up , there are some things you should know about it ... and about yourselffirst off , if you are not the kind of sci-fi fan who likes in depth scientific stuff ... put this downyou will be bored out of your mind , or find yourself skimming over things.if you like , or at least mildly interested in biology , earth science , chemistry , physics , and just science in general ... then read onfor me , this was one of the things that made the book enjoyable . i find a lot of sci-fi authors just gloss over the science aspects of their books . robinson takes the time to explain things ( sometimes in quite a lot of detail ) .about the book itself.the book details the colonization of mars , from the start . the book begins in medius rex ... ( in the middle of things ) with the murder of one of the central charecters.after the murder , you flash back to the beginning of the colinization , from the trip out , to the establishment of the settlementsthe main charecters are the 'first hundred ' , the first 100 settlers to mars . there are a few other charecters who pop up , all quite interesting , that are not from the 100. each of the 8 segments of the book follows around one different charecter ( one of the 100 ) , and their interactions with everything.the human aspects of this book are incredibly poignant , and very touching . combining this with the time setting ( relatively near future ... 2020-2060 ) this makes the charecters very believable.the major conflict comes in when additional emigrants begin making the sojourn to mars . initially they are simply more explorers and scientists , who plan on staying on the planet for life . the trouble comes when transnational corporations ( think microsoft + aoltimewarner + general motors + general electric and you get the idea of the money and power behind them ) who have grown more powerful and wealthy than all but about ten countries , start to send people up , to mine for metals . the transnationals have approached mars as an untapped resource , and will stop at nothing to get their way.over all , this is one of the most well written books i have had the pleasure of reading in quite a while .	1
This was the first Clancy book that I have read . The action is excellent from the first page to the last . The characters are unique in that they tend to fit well . A former Navy seal is the focal point of the book who falls for a girl that is being used by a drug lord . The girl is killed and the Navy seal plans to take his own style of justice to the drug dealers and eventually the ones who killed the girl . Along the way he is challenged by the Navy to go on a deadly mission inside of Viet Nam . Fortunately the mission is scrubbed in time as the bad guys get reinforcements because of a leak back home about the mission . Our Navy seal returns to the states to finish his work with the drug dealers , but also to do one more favor for the government before they give him a new identity and put him to work for them . He has to eliminate the guy who leaked the information about the mission . There are other side adventures that the Navy seal undertakes which makes the book keep the reader 's attention as you read through the 800 or so pages of action and thrills . This one is worth the read .	1
John Kelly 's wife is killed in an automobile accident . The book begins by describing his dealing with the loss of his wife . John befriends a former prostitute who is on the run from the cities leader in organized crime . Kelly then falls in love with Pam , a prostitute , who has escaped from her pimp , who works for an up and coming drug lord . John Kelly is an ex-navy SEAL . The pimp/drug lord has a hit done on Kelly and kidnaps Pam . Though Kelly is left for dead , he is taken to the hospital and recovers . In the meantime , Pam is brutally tortured and murdered.This triggers John Kelly 's vengeful attitude . He takes it upon himself to seek justice be tracking down and trying to kill every member of the offending organization.What a brilliant fast pace book . I highly recommend it . I also loved HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER by Tom Clancy .	1
Lots of action an suspense . Great characters . I could n't put it down . Clancy is a great writer . I ca n't wait to read the rest of his books .	1
John Clark is the prototypical kind of hero our country needs in every community , and while I 'm sure some exist , we could use more . This is one of those books I knew Clancy needed to write , and hopefully he writes more , because Clark is fantastic character.Clearly the war on drugs has been lost at virtually every juncture . Traditional law enforcement is akin to giving everybody a can of Lysol and expecting the common cold to be cured . Yeah , you may get the obvious stuff , but there 's so much out there , you 're sure to miss enough to keep the supply of bacteria flowing.While I 'm not a proponent of vigilantism , few people in this country have not been touched in some way by the pushers , cookers and dealers . They are n't just on the street corners in the bad neighborhoods , either . They inhabit every socioeconomic strata , including the gated communities inhabited by the most affluent.There are times where the viruses on humanity need to be cut out like the cancer they are , and a character like Clark can do it . Can you imagine a drug trade in a community where the dealers are shot without warning , upon getting caught dealing by a phantom hero ? Or worse , are found naked and dying on the street after some torture in a hyperbaric chamber ? I can . The drug trade simply would n't exist.Violence should be a last resort at an conflict resolution , but when all other methods fail , then the application of violence should be undertaken -- Without Remorse .	1
This is the story of the origin of Mr. Clark first introduced in Clear & Present Danger . It 's one of Clancy 's best novels & gives you a little history lesson in the origins and previous work from many other characters from the Jack Ryan series of novels . Great book I still ca n't believe this one has never been made into a movie .	1
Clancy cleared the bar ( that he set himself ) easily with this one . He has written/co-written/consulted on some dogs , but I 've always been a fan . The attention and commitment to detail are superb , as are his sources ( obviously ) . I 've read and re-read most of his books more than twice , and all of them to date at least once . This is where John Kelly ( Clark ) hits the scene , and his story is world class REAL and emotional , even for `` Mission : Impossible '' fiction . There 's nothing in Clancy 's books that `` could n't happen '' even when not at his best . You can read the back cover for the storyline , but I promise that once you open the front cover you wo n't stop until you 've read everything in between . Cussler , Ted Bell , W.E.B Griffin , Dan Brown ... I read them too , but Tom Clancy at worst is a great read . And his best is THE best , and this is one of them .	1
... a bit slowly for my hunger of this story xDIt 's amazing how you end up rooting for all the characters ( some more than others , obviously ) Are n't all perspective right no matter how opposed they may stand ?	1
Ooohhh ... .Arya ! Daenaris ! What is happening to you ? Where is the rest of the story ? Hurry ! Write the next installment . Write the next installment . Write it ! Hurry ! ; - )	1
I waited months for this to come out in soft cover & it was so worth the wait ! It just keeps getting better ! !	1
I 've never much of a fantasy fan beyond Tolkein and the The Once and Future King . But one episode of the series had me hooked and I could n't wait to immerse myself in the books . I raced through the first four , then had to wait a good while for this one . But oh , my , it was certainly worth it.I 've never seen an author who could juggle such a mega-cast of characters and narrative threads and keep the whole thing comprehensible in drop dead exciting . Not only are the existing characters sent off in some very different directions ; there a host of new characters and places -- including one young man ( who shall remain nameless in this review ) who has attracted the loyalty of some surprising people and whose plans could be devastating to this entire world from Westeros to the Slave cities to the Wall -- that is if he can just stay alive that long.I hope I wo n't be a spoiler by saying that this book , according to the author , is not the last to come in this magnificent series . Part of me was looking forward to closure ( and the chance to get some long-delayed work done ) , but I must confess to being glad that there will be at least one more chance to immerse myself in this wonderful , horribly bloody and richly realized world .	1
By far the darkest in the series ... but like everyone else I am living for book 6 . Martin makes images that live in your mind for a long time ... . this book is no exception .	1
Book 5 continues the twists & turns & surprises of this series -- keeping me enthralled & looking forward to the next ( final ? ) one !	1
I just finished reading the fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . I 'm actually reading the Kindle version of the book -George R. R. Martin 's A Game of Thrones 5-Book Boxed Set ( Song of Ice and Fire Series ) : A Game of Thrones , A Clash of Kings , A Storm of Swords , A Feast for Crows , and A Dance with Dragons- much easier to hold my Kindle Fire HDX than these 1,000+ page books.This offering was better than book four - A FEAST FOR CROWS - but still left a lot to be desired . My favorite characters ( at least most of them ) were back in this book but the story stalled . This book is OVER a thousand pages long and I felt that at least half of that was filler.Lots of attention to detail but very little character development in this book . I read the whole thing . All five door stopper books . After all , I loved the first three books in the series . But books four and five have soured me on the Song of Ice and Fire experience . I 'm more than a bit leery about reading books six and seven when they come out . I know that I will - I have to find out what happens to my favorite characters ( at least the ones that do n't get killed off right away ) . GRRM is quite the hatchet man author . I just hope we do n't have to wait too long for the final books in the series . And I hope the spark that was there in books one through three will be back .	1
Although I read some bad reviews for this 5th book , I had looked forward to reading it and was n't put off by said reviews . I am so happy that I ignored them . A Dance with Dragons did n't disappoint . Now I ca n't wait for the 6th book . Another book you wo n't want to put down . So many twists and turns , Mr. Martin keeps you on the edge constantly .	1
I really love reading these books but they always end when they get good . Wish he would tie up some loose ends sometimes . You can tell he use to write for Tv as he always ends with you wanting more . Ca n't wait for the next one to come out	1
Liked this book so much more than the 4th in the series , which mostly seemed like people wandering around the countryside . Perhaps because my favorite characters were featured more ? One could almost skip the 4th and move right on to this , without missing much . Great story and ca n't wait for the next book to come out .	1
while this book keeps you up to date with the characters we all love or hate . But al it really does is set up the next book . We do n't know when the dragons return , although it was Great to see Cursi great some pay back . But we have to wait until next winter , if we 're lucky to learn anything more . At this point I 'm hoping I live long enough to finish this wonderful story . But to hear that the actor playing king Jophery is quitting acting because he ca n't deal with the hate his character drew . He is a first rate actor and should be proud that he did such a great job . He could be a major star if he kept at it . It saddens me that he took things personally , he is truly gifted and I 'm sorry it has driven him to quit acting.Since season four will only be part of book four , it really is a drag that after ten shows , you have to wait a year to see what happens next . So great writing , and I understand filming takes a long time , but remember when there were nine months to a season with the summer off . Even six months would be great . But it take a lot of effort to write and to produce for TV . I hope I live to see the end .	1
I found this to be the weakest of the series so far . Martin 's writing is as spellbinding as ever , but when you look back not much happened in the story . I will say the last third of the book picked up quite a bit , but for a book this size , you want a little more progression . I found the epilogue to be especially teasing . Volumes 4 and 5 seem to be great illustrations of Martin 's facility with words , but both lacked the energy of the first three books . Still , when the writing is this good , I will be among the audience .	1
love this book too . arya 's new found skills . dany 's new power . the greenseer found . ca n't wait for knowing what bran can do . ah.. mr martin i hope your health is good and finish this series before anything happens to you !	1
I 'm not going to post a synopsis or anything nearing a spoiler as a lot of people have just been turned on to these books thanks to the HBO series . If you 're wondering how this book compares to the previous four in the series , it 's good ; just maybe not quite as good ( at least early on ) . This book started off slower for me than the prior installments did . It 's chocked full of details just like it 's predecessors , but lacking a little in the action department as compared to the prior books . I feel like this was done to set the scene for what 's to come because the farther you get into the book , the better the story , the faster the pace , and a lot more action . We do get some new character perspectives in A Dance With Dragons , as well as the ones that were so noticeably missing in A Feast For Crows . Martin was smart enough to try to get at least one chapter in for all of the major characters in this one ( I only noticed one that was missing entirely ) ; probably because so many complained about the lack of certain characters in A Feast For Crows . Are all of the questions we were left with from the previous book answered ? No , but he does at least give us a little more to go on and of course he leaves us with more cliffhangers ! ! ! One in particular left me a little stunned and a bit upset . I 'll be very surprised if that story line ends the way we were led to believe . I do n't think it will , but Martin has earned my respect by doing just this kind of thing , so you never know .	1
Having read the entire series , I have quite the love/hate relationship with George R.R.Martin . I enjoy these books and many of the characters . He is a very good storyteller.However it is his cliche to kill most of those who are good ... and any cliche is a bad idea . This book is no different and also suffers somewhat from the author 's lack of focus and editing.Although not as dragging as the last book , I still found myself skipping large portions of pointless text - usually descriptions of meals , landscape , clothing , etc . - to get back to what was interesting and important.NEWS FLASH : If you have n't `` sold '' your universe by the end of book 2 , you are n't doing it right.Overall it was a solid , enjoyable read . Some parts had me literally not wanting to put my Kindle down . If you 've slogged through the entire series , you will probably enjoy this one .	1
Martin 's latest installment in his epic pulls in the reigns a little bit , taking us out of the hot mess that is Westeros ( for the most part ) , and finally starting to stitch the eastern and western sagas together through use of traveling characters , bonds of alliegance , and revenge ... It becomes clearer and clearer that , though magic is flowing back into the world because of Danarys ' children , such power is no simple thing to control , and exacts prices that individual players in this ongoing game of thrones may not be willing to pay . At least , not by themselves.Though I would call their stories the most compelling of the lot , we hear comparatively little of either Bran or to a lesser extent Arya . I am not sure if that means there will be more focus on them as intensely magical and pivotal characters in the future , or if they will slowly decay back into dust if and when the Targaryan queen loses one or all of her dragons . All the focus in 'A Dance With Dragons ' seems to be on characters who are striving now , traveling now , working now , on the fringes now , but for all that arguably more important due to their rangings . Fortunately , that means Cerci Lannister is finally set to cooling her heels . For those who have said here that one feels more softly towards her at the end , I must whole-heartedly disagree . She deserved much worse , and more , suffering than the measly pittance meted out . I have no problems with who she may choose to sleep with in the books , despite personal feelings at odds with incest ... But she is nasty , callous , powerhungry , and more than a little stupid about the way she politics . Frankly , I 'd like to see her thrown in a blender with old weasly lord Frey and made into dragon slurry inch by bloody inch , but Robb Stark died two books ago as meet proof that I do n't get what I want here , though I 'm quite happy to continue reading , anyway.I think we finally have the beginnings of the rise to peak , though , in a narrative that 's already some four thousand pages long and counting , even denoument will likely take a book 's worth of pandering ... But in the immediate future , there 's this whole sloppy Slaver 's Bay war to deal with , and with the flux galloping , much and more could easily change the whole tangent of the saga . I just ca n't wait to see the dragons once more on the move , and if HBO gets its ' way , we 'll see the next novel soon ! ! !	1
I have read all the previous Game of Thrones books and they are a fantastic read . Brilliant author George R R Martin look forward to more of his books	1
Martin is simply an incredible author . This story just keeps getting better and better and i cant wait to read more .	1
It took me five books to figure this out , but now I get it . In GRRM 's bio he has some screenwriting credits . Duh ! He 's a screenwriter ! These are not novels , they are scripts , complete with everything everybody involved in the production needs to know - all the costumes , sets , props , extras , set dressing , lighting , atmospherics , score , dialogue , ... He 's just making sure the producers get it all right . ( It 'd be like Michelangelo writing in all the little numbers on the Sistine Chapel ceiling so his assistants could put the paint in all the right places ! ) You can see how that has evolved over the years/books . By the last two books he 's figured out that if you make the production lavish enough , you do n't need so much story . Curiosity may compel me to read # 6 , if it is published before I change channels .	1
Book five still leaves you hanging in suspense with pretty much all characters in the story . You still want more and more . Ca n't wait for number six .	1
I WAS SO THRILLED TO FIND ANOTHER VOLUME AFTER READING THE 4 VOLUME SET THAT I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT . I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED . IT IS A TERRIFIC STORY THAT IS EPIC IN ITS QUALITY AS WELL AS ITS QUANTITY . I CA N'T WAIT FOR VOLUME VI .	1
I just started reading this book . It is great so far , I do n't want to put it down.I would recommend this book and the other four to anyone who likes swords , knights , kings and dragons .	1
While I do understand the disappointment of many readers of ADWD , I ca n't help but disagree . Perhaps this is because I did n't start reading the novels in the 1990s and read them all straight through in a row . I also know that there will be 7 books in the series , which made me not expect a complete resolution by the end of this book . What I think Feast and Dance do accomplish , is to broaden the spectrum of the fantasy world in which all of these events are occurring , introduce new characters , some of which I liked , some of which I found dull , but could tell that in the greater context they would eventually become important . I am not going to put in any spoilers , because I read one idiots review of this book that ruined a major event for me , but , I can say that it has plenty of action as well as prophecy . I can also say it has plenty of slow moving chapters as well . Not every chapter in the books can be exciting and action packed when you are portraying such a vast viewpoint of a completely different world from the eyes of many . I think the biggest problem people have with Feast and Dance is that they are not nearly as Stark-centralized narratives . While the Starks were the first family of honor and the protagonists that we were introduced to , a complex story of this size would be boring if it only revolved around them . That is what makes A Song of Ice and Fire unique . The good guys do n't always win . It makes fantasy more realistic . I probably agree with some that certain charatcers did not need POV chapters , their stories could have been told through other 's POVs . But it is what it is . and the 4th and 5th books of the series are setting up what will hopefully be a fantastic finish in the 6th and 7th as we continue to explore this wonderful world that Martin has created . That being said , if you are very emotionally attached to the Starks and do n't find other characters as interesting , it is pretty much OK to stop at Book 3 . You wo n't be disappointed , and HBO will show you their version of the rest of the story anyway . So if Feast and a Dan are daunting , skip them . But bashing them is irrational as they are a logical progression of the story addressing the world outside of Westeros , Winterfell and Kings Landing .	1
After I got hooked with the first book in this series I heard there is also an HBO series . I have n't watched it but definitely wanted to continue reading . A Dance With Dragons brings the characters together in a way that makes me anxious to continue with next book in the series ... .ca n't wait !	1
I have to lay the blame on my 21 year old granddaughter who has been hooked on the books and the TV series since inception . She finally persuaded me to take interest by giving me the first book to read . It was all downhill from there - next I had to read book 2 and so on.As I write this review I am midway through book five , and horror , there are no more books finished.Seriously , the books are huge and take time to read , but very entertaining and no doubt will be something that I will return to over and over . All of the best books need repeated reading in order to capture the small things that are missed on the first time reading , and these books certainly fall into that category.You can not read this book without reading all of the earlier books first , otherwise the intricate plot and characters will mean nothing .	1
I have run quickly through all five books - and like other readers had hoped that there would be some progression to an end . But no . So many points of view now ( IMHO ) . I sense that the author is working harder and harder to get through each successive book and may not yet have sight of what the ending should be , unlike JK Rowling who evidently wrote out all the outlines for all the Harry Potter books before she started . Despite this , the author turns a great tale and wraps you up in it . Have to admire how he tracsk all the POVs , locales and players .	1
This series is an amazing swim in the deep end of the ocean where the big boys play . This plot has so many levels that I have no idea what will really happen next ! Every time I think I know whats happening and going to happen ... . I find I am WRONG ! I LOVE IT ! I need more ! This writing is crack for readers !	1
Riveting ! I 'm waiting for his next book to find out what happens to characters in this one . He does know how to write them !	1
I can not get enough of this series . Come on book six and seven ... This book is the other half of A Feast For Crows ( book 4 ) with the other characters ' views . Some scenes are even duplicated from the other perspective . A total joy to read .	1
Love Game of Thrones , and Book Five does n't let you down ! Such a breath of fresh air after wading through Book Four .	1
I enjoyed this book much more than the previous . All my favorite characters were back and there was so much going on it made it hard to put the book down . Ca n't wait for book 6 to be available .	1
I read the rest of the series in paperback , then I got my Kindle - loved reading it on my Kindle as the book gives the wrist too much of a work out . I love this series and am looking forward to where it goes next . The Kindle just made the experience even more enjoyable .	1
I 've been waiting for this book to arrive and started reading it immediately ... . So absorbed in this series ! ! Absolutely love it..ca n't wait for the next one ! !	1
I bought this at the same time as the Romertopt book and was glad I did . It added to the variety of recipes and I tried several with great success !	1
An excellent mystery , Agatha Christie in great form , keeps us guessing almost all the way to the end - however , the ending is rather too improbably dramatic for my taste .	1
Whatever happened to the French novel ? There was the immediate postwar era , when once could read Camus , Sartre 's post- '' Nausea '' novels , the rise of Jean Genet . But in the fifties and sixties , the `` nouveau roman '' developed , which in the hands of Robbe-Gillet , Sarraute and Butor , sought to deconstruct the possibilities of fictions , and which in the hands of such writers as Robbe-Gillet , Sarraute , and Butor . The result was very complex and subtle and elaborate , with much on the ontological significance of the novel . But it was not the sort of fiction that people liked to read , and it left most English speaking critics very cold . The late Georges Perec was connected to this sort of school , and at least one intelligent English critic has thought that Perec wrote some of the most boring novels of the twentieth century . This book , however , is manifestly not one of them . Indeed it 's a remarkable hoot , at times quite funny , and throughout consistently ingenious and clever . What Perec has written is a lipogram , a book which follows a special grammatical rule . In this case there are no `` e '' s in the entire work . Writing such a book is incredibly difficult , and translating it into another language would appear to be impossible . Fortunately this is not the case , as Gilbert Adair has demonstrably shown . There has been at least one lipogram in English that includes no e , and the unimaginative writer , when he wished to have his characters talk , only used `` said . '' Adair , rather helpfully , prefers to use the present tense . Certain words in French , such as `` juif '' , `` mort '' and `` Amour '' have to be replaced with unusual English equivalents.The result is an incredibly strange novel . At times the sentences are full of proper nouns that exist for no purpose than their e-less nature . At other times the necessary twists and turns are odd and unusual , and the result feels like you are reading a book of palindromes . ( Another Perec specialty , and he wrote the longest ever , 5,000 words long ) . But more often there are brilliant flights of baroque fancy , such as the dinner Augustus Clifford prepares for his unfortunate guests on p. 115 . The plot starts with France in chaos , and an insomniac critic Anton Vowl , who goes missing . His friends find strange notes and letters . They find his lipogramatic versions of Edgar Allen Poe 's `` The Raven , '' Shelley 's `` Ozymandias , '' and Vowl 's version of the most famous soliliquoy in English ( `` Living or not Living : that is what I ask ) . But gradually a plot begins to develop , in a way worthy of `` A Manuscript found in Saragossa . `` Can Vowl 's friends find out who or what is behind the strange deaths and disappearances ? Who stabbed an Arab solicitor who smoked a cigar in a zoo , and then absconded with his corpse ? What is the secret of the strange ruby-like zahir that brings death to those who mention it ? What secret does a carp named Jonah carry within himself ? Why does Clifford 's son , Douglas Haig , die a horrible death while dressed as the murdered father in Mozart 's `` Don Giovanni ? '' Why is one of the chapters missing ? There is an especially vicious Albanian brigand who who we learn , long after his death , has been particularly humiliated , along with the lust of his life . But there are important moral lessons as well . The novel agrees with Jefferson and Danton that primogeniture is a really , really bad idea . Also , there are certain perversions that one should never undertake , especially when your brother is trying to dynamite you . And why is the French title of the work the same as the certificates the Vichy regime gave to those inquiring about those deported to Auchwitz , one of those being Perec 's mother ? There are strange secret baths , the most incredible revelations , the oddest connections between the characters are revealed , and wealthy Ottomans who are turned into peanut butter sundaes . There is deliberate anachronism and the solution is not entirely coherent . But be aware that the villian is not among the characters who in the course of the novel attempt or succeed at murder and manslaughter . As a novel , `` A Void '' is not at the height of Calvino and Garcia Marquez , who provide love , compassion and hope to their magical games . But this is a better novel than `` Pale Fire '' and comparable to Borges and Pavic , a Faberge Egg novel in which something nasty ticks .	1
It is difficult to write a review of a man 's heart felt narrative of his experiences during combat . I can simply say that it is truly worth reading .	1
George MacDonald Fraser , best known for the Flashman Papers , shows he can write conventional history just as well . He is familiar with the culture , geography , history and legends of the border region , and tells a complex story relatively clearly . The best sections are at the beginning and end of the book where he explains how the & # 8216 ; reiving century & # 8217 ; came about at the end of the middle ages as the people of the English and Scottish marches became pawns in wider political conflict between the English and Scottish crowns , and later how the age of the reivers was swiftly brought to a close by James I . In between the main conflicts are detailed in a scholarly and entertaining way , but the overall context suffers a little as the repetitive back and forth raidings of Maxwells , Johnstones , Kerrs , Armstrongs are picked over . The chronology of the period is a difficult one to master , and only those who are already familiar with the key border events of the 16th Century will find it easy to navigate this book . Overall though , a very good history of the Border Reivers .	1
Lord Saville one night listens to a chiromantist who tells him he has to commit a crime , whose victim is supposed to be a relative of some kind , before being able to marry his love . The tale is full of humor and shows how he fails , systematically , in his enterprise , because he believes the soothsayer . But the more humoristic the tale becomes , the more desperate Lord Saville grows . Till one night he kills the chiromantist . He has finally been able to rebel against the prediction and this rebellion proves the prediction is a fake . But a second dimension appears in the tale . The chiromantist had been introduced to Lord Saville by some woman who invites such oddities to her parties to amuse the audience . She behaves as if she believed in those ominous birds that she calls lions . And Lord Saville was naive enough to accept this prediction as true and unescapable because it had been introduced to him by this particular woman , in this particular situation . Men must not fall in the traps of social tricks that some women hire to give some life to their social evenings that would be very dull otherwise . Who is wiser ? The woman who `` animates '' her social gatherings with such attractions ? Or the man who falls in the trap of believing such predictions ? The other tales of the collection are all just as funny by showing how some people are able to go beyond such appearances and reach another level of being that is some kind of game and it becomes a trap to the gullible ones.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University of Perpignan	1
This surprisingly small dictionary has , so far , included definitions of every word I 've needed to look up through the completion of a first-year Latin course . Irregular forms are typically listed separately , which is especially critical for those of us still struggling with Latin 's abundant irregular verbs . Many proper names are also included , which is useful in recognizing their sometimes unpredictable declensions . The grammer and versification sections are too rudimentary to be of much help , but conversely they take up very little space . Although the book is physically small ( think `` gem '' ) , the typeface is a usuer-friendly size and font .	1
I 've become a fan of this writer and it 's great to have so much in such a small , digital , package . Kindle books take very little space in my Tablet . Some times , like vacations and business trips , it 's a good thing to have an entire library tag along .	1
Vikings on the rampage , hilarious prose , swashbuckling action on land and sea - what more could you ask for in a novel ?	1
What a glorious end to a great ship and wonderful crew . Alistair Maclean masterfully mixes the glories of warfare with the utter waste and senselessness of such conflicts .	1
InOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , Solzhenitsyn contrived a day for Ivan Denisovich that served to inform readers of the principal aspects of life in a Stalinist Special Prison Camp in Siberia . Along the way , he included much about the GULAG system , how prisoners came to be there and their prospects of release . That was ambitious for a novel of rather less than 50,000 words , but Solzhenitsyn 's objectives were fully achieved , aided rather than hindered by the limits that he set for both subject matter and time scale . In The First Circle , Solzhenitsyn looks again at the life of Section 58 ( i.e . political ) prisoners , giving himself this time three days just before New Year 1950 to describe a small scientific development and engineering facility on the outskirts of Moscow where political prisoners with appropriate skills were obliged to work long hours on projects such as a scrambler for Stalin 's telephone . Taking just three days and only one such prison again help by containing the scope of the novel . Nevertheless , The First Circle is more than five times as long as One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and has a cast list so large the two-and-a-half page listing provided with this translation of most of the character 's names , their roles and relationships , is a definite asset.Only near the end of the novel is the mystery of the title revealed . A prisoner remarks , `` Mavrino ( the name of the scientific Special Camp ) is the best , the highest , the first circle of hell . It 's almost Paradise ... . '' Unfortunately , the prisoner who speaks is at that moment being transported back to a labor camp.Besides telling us about Mavrino , its inmates and staff and their work , Solzhenitsyn paints in much of the background . Thus we spend time with the wife of one of the prisoners as she struggles to subsist in Moscow so as to be near her husband . We also meet the family of one of the free workers at Mavrino , who comes and goes on a daily basis ; with a minor diplomat , arrested on the eve of a posting to Paris ; and with Stalin himself as he works into the night , alone in his Kremlin office . As a sort of flashback , there is a visit by Eleanor Roosevelt ( widow of the late President ) to a Soviet prison shortly after the end of WW2 . Of course , what she is shown is contrived to appear humane , clean , and a relatively happy place for the inmates , but is quickly changed back to reality the moment she is gone.As with One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , Solzhenitsyn is telling us of his own experience as a political prisoner , incorporating also the stories of some of those he encountered whilst imprisoned . The plot of the novel , such as it is , serves primarily as a device on which to hang that information . It is the power of the individual stories that gives the novel its strength .	1
The best part of this book was the portrait of Stalin . It 's hard to write about historic figures -- whether it 's Lincoln , Hitler , or whomever , they usally end up sounding wooden or cliched . Yet here , the author & quot ; gets into the head & quot ; of Stalin . Reading it I felt , yes , that must be exactly what Stalin thought and felt like.The rest of the book is fine too , but Stalin remains the & quot ; character & quot ; I remember most .	1
The story and characters of a story set in ancient Atlantis is spell binding . I bought a copyfrom a second hand store in the 1970s and felt inspired , one dark night , to find it in my over stuffedbook cases to reread it . It was damaged and so I ordered another copy from Amazon Books . I am amazed at how fresh the story is and how it seems prophetic about ourcurrent global struggles compounded by environmental issues of pollution and global warming , fraught , of late , with many tidal waves , earth quakes and volcanic eruptions etc that disrupt international travel . The book seemsprophetic too about the corrupt practices people are becoming aware of in religious , scientific , political and media institutions . The book shows the materialism and weakness of modern society where welfare hand outs or a lush , sensual , materialistic way of life keep the populace subserviant but also weak with no sense of ethics or morals in their conduct towards others . Taylor Caldwell dreamed of this story with herself as principal character , an Atlantean princess/empress , in a life time lived in Atlantis . During this lifetimeAtlantis supposedly sank into the sea , due to misuse of nuclear power that had fallen into the wrong hands of young , vigorous but dangerous powers.It is an enthralling read and seems as if channelled and prophetic .	1
James Saxon gives a royal send-off to Ngaio Marsh 's very first Roderick Alleyn mystery , originally published in 1934 . Russian spy rings could be dealt with then as somehow detached from anything Soviet , no sound Englishman need be suspected of association with the rather laughable group , and , wel , l to say more would be revealing too much . Nothing else about the book is dated since it is in the classic mold as it was being modified by Agatha Christie , Dorothy Sayers , and Margery Allingham , among the fine `` British '' practitioners . I enjoyed reading this fledgling Marsh effort , written ten years previous to my first acquaintanceship with Alley , n which occurred during WW2 through Colour Scheme . I should think this archetypal country house mystery would be required listening for any Marsh fan since , in addition to meeting Alleyn for the first time , we also get to meet the quite young and naive reporter , Bathgate , portrayed as few reporters have been in mystery stories . New Marsh readers will not be quite as enthralled , as the villain of the piece is not entirely unpredictable and the Russian element is more a diversion than an intrinsic element of the plot . Still and all , it is an admirable first effort which is , as I have pointed out , given a first rate performance by the expert James Saxon . It should be an enjoyable few hours for any classic mystery fan , although not up to the standard Marsh later set for her works .	1
Surprisingly hard to come by nowadays , this novel was written in parallel with the fantastic film ( in a similar way to '2001 : A Space Odyssey ' , but with much more action ) . It makes an interesting companion-piece - there are some subtle differences in detail and tone , and whilst the book has plenty of action the destruction is n't quite so over-the-top . Best of all , you can pour over the famously-tortuous plot at your leisure , without having to pause and write down a little flowchart showing who is pretending to be who . On the downside , you do n't get the fantastic soundtrack , or Clint Eastwood 's mildly-peeved grimaces as bullets zing around his head . Although he will forever be associated with 'Eagles ' , MacLean was more of a cold war thriller writer than a war-thriller writer , and the book is an odd cross between straightforward WW2 action and a John Le Carre-esque spy thriller , meaning that the book is doubly dated , but still great fun .	1
The Bureau sends Quiller to Bangkok to protect an important British official who will be visiting Thailand . Quiller approaches the job in his usual efficient ( albeit grouchy ) style , but finds himself outsmarted ... at least for awhile.Quiller is a well-defined character : independent , even anti-social , perhaps suffering from a ( perhaps justified ) superiority complex . The other characters are more like caricatures , but the enjoyment of this novel comes from the intricate , twisty plot and from Quiller himself as he tries to out-think his adversary . Quiller is an intellectual spy , but there 's plenty of action to offset the thinking and scheming . Fans of espionage/thriller novels should enjoy this .	1
This thriller novel kicks off with Dr. Carpenter , a British medical doctor , who gets orders to board the USS Dolphin in the UK . The US nuclear submarine Dolphin has a near-impossible mission : it has to cruise underneath the ice pack of the Arctic to find and save the inhabitants of Ice Station Zebra , a scientific meteorological station drifting with the ice pack somewhere north of the Arctic Circle . Ice Station Zebra was destroyed by a fire , but little does anyone know that fire at Ice Station Zebra was due to sabotage , and that one of the survivors is a ruthless killer . Furthermore , Dr. Carpenter is not what he seems to be and it later becomes evident that he has more staked in this cruise than originally suggested.What I liked about the story is how Alistair MacLean demonstrated his writing ability and mastery of the genre to create an atmosphere that gets the reader to feel that he/she is also inside the submarine and can sense , feel , smell and experience the conflict , fear and tension on board the submarine . Definitely not as turbo-paced as Matthew Reilly 's more modern thriller novel with a nearly similar name , Ice Station , MacLean 's book does not lack in pace , but the pace is controlled to such a degree that the right amount of suspense is created and that the tension builds up as the story progresses . Reilly 's Ice Station is more about countless pages of jet-propelled action and relentless mindless violence , whereas MacLean 's Ice Station Zebra consists of the finesse of expert handling of suspense , intrigue and tension.Although the dialogue may be more reminiscent of the era that the book was written in , this is truly still a masterpiece of the thriller genre and can almost serve as a template for thriller writers , where you have a plot stripped of all the unnecessary fluff that so many modern thrillers suffer from , which only serves to increase the page count and nothing much else .	1
Detective novelist ( and Christie alter ego ) Ariadne Oliver has been coaxed into attending a literary party , something she , like Christie , did not enjoy and avoided whenever possible . Mrs. Oliver 's experience at this one would ensure that it would be a long time before she attended another . An overbearing woman , Mrs. Burton-Cox manages to corner the author cross examine her about her goddaughter , one of many Mrs. Oliver has managed to acquire through the years . And now that the young woman , Celia , is quite grown up , one with which Mrs. Oliver has quite lost touch . It seems that Celia and Mrs. Burton-Cox 's son are engaged , or will soon be , and Mrs. Burton-Cox wants to know if Celia 's mother killed her father or did her father kill her mother . Mrs. Oliver was quite shocked by the rudeness of the encounter and troubled about what to do about it so she contacted her friend , Hercule Poirot , for guidance in the matter . Soon the pair , each in their own unique way , begin to tackle the problems , re-establishing contact with Celia , investigating the old tragedy and finding out just why Mrs. Burton-Cox is so insistance on knowing the answer.For fans of Ariadne Oliver this is a particular treat , giving the reader more information into her ( and perhaps Christie 's ) personal life , than any previous stories . It is interesting to see Oliver 's and Poirot 's different approaches to investigation , even to the point of different interpretations of what the actual problem is.This is not the cleverest mystery that Christie ever wrote , nor even the best written but it is a very enjoyable one none the less and is a definite must read for any Poirot or Oliver fan .	1
This book arrived in a timely fashion and it is an exciting read with lots of twists and turns . I bought it to read the original story upon which both the British and merican TV series was based . I ams og lad to know how the original was set up and how well it was written . Thank you for a great read !	1
First of all , I hate being required to write remarks when I rate something . Secondly , as I said ... you ca n't go wrong reading Jean Plaidy . I have nearly all her books in hardcover and am now collecting them on Kindle .	1
Being a Christian in today 's society is often a scary thing . People love to bad-mouth our faith in something invisible . This book gives us the tools to strengthen our own selves before we get brave enough to talk to others , to offer them hospitality and then to help them know God themselves . It 's a 'read more than once ' book .	1
I have read some of Nouwen 's work before , and this is one of his best . My daughter spoke of this book as she was reading it for a study she was doing at the Christian school where she works , and I bought a copy as she was using hers . In the middle section , while speaking to everyone , he addresses parents , teachers , and professionals . I 'd say more , but you really need to read it yourself . This is a book that , read carefully , has the potential to change how you function as a result of your faith .	1
Every country in the world has crime cases that rock the very fabric of their society , their values , their very humanness . `` The Holocaust '' covers a period of many years before , during and after WW2 when a `` civilized '' nation undertook deeds of humiliation , degradation , terror , torture and murder of European Jewry with such impunity that totally defies human comprehension . This is not an easy book to read , the horrors that spring from virtually every paragraph will challenge every notion of the human race been filled with kindness and goodwill . Of the many thousands that shed blood in the villages of Poland and Russia , there were millions that looked away as their neighbors and former friends were taken into killing fields or bundled into trucks and trains to death camps . One and a half million children ... what mind can wrap itself around swinging a baby and smashing its head against a wall , or putting a bullet through a child , or in fun compete in contests of how many people one bullet could kill ? In the killing fields or burning snynagues of Russia , the ghettos of Poland , the days of cattle-cart transports to the camps of Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau , survival required miracles . Be warned you are going to require frequent respites from reading the horror of a culture and religion under commissioned terrorization , torture , enforced abject starvation and blatant murder . Most likely this was humanities darkest years ; it makes the Spanish Inquisition read like a teddy-bears ' picnic .	1
One of the best accounts of the jews of the Europe during the second world war that I have ever read . A intensely distrubing story of the one worst crimes of the 20th century . A must read for anyone interested in the history of last century .	1
This is a very good book that I would highly recomend . The storytelling , plot and the way the story is interwoven are all truly masterful.There are issues that I have with the book . For most of the first book he repeatedly refers to characters by both first and last name . Everytime , every dialogue , every mention . That really began to annoy me and I had to train my mind to skip over the surnames and just read the given names . I also felt that the book was slightly slow in begining . However the book ( and the series ) does nothing but build.It is a very good opening and the next book draws you even more in . I had heard great things about Kay as an author and this series is my first `` taste '' of his writting . Currently about 2/3 through the second book of this series I am very much hooked at this time.Is this book perfect ? No , not by any stretch . But it is extremely good . As I said , I would n't say that dialogue is Kay 's strong point , and at times his word selection could be better . But few storytellers weave a more masterful tale than Kay .	1
This should be required reading in school . I mean it really gives a look into the future . We 're constantly trying to make our lives easier and get a computer and probably soon robots to do our jobs for us but what happens when there are no more jobs left for humans to do ? so many books have it like we 'd be living in luxury but would n't it make our lives more drab , less meaning to them ? This book is fast paced with no dawdling . It makes you definitely think twice before wishing you did n't have to work .	1
I found the pace a little strange for a while . A very pleasant unhurried book . Do n't read it if you 're in a rush or expecting a thriller.As far as I 'm concerned , this book is important for the last appearance of Sir Harry Flashman and if only for that read it.I actually did n't get the ending at all ... but with such a book it really does n't matter .	1
In 1218 Eleyne is born amidst a burning castle in Wales . From infancy , her nurse brings her up to support the Celtic cause against the English and she is taught how to use the flames to see into the future . Throughout her fascinating life , Eleyne is married four times and produces numerous children . Several of the characters link up to character in other Erskine novels.I have read several of Barbara Erskine 's books , and so far this is my favorite . The characters she created were vibrant and extremely engaging . I love the historical aspects she throws into her novels and I ca n't wait to read more . I only wish I had discovered this author earlier .	1
Read these books years ago , and ordered them for my daughter to enjoy now . For me these books are even better than The Lord of the Rings series because these heroes are more human , subject to frailties and capable of wonder .	1
I 've read all of the reviews here and have something to say to those with negative opinions of this series : for those of you who have relayed your reviews succinctly , I respect your collective opinions . This series is not for everyone . But to those who 's reviews seemed to reflect confusion , please give this series another try . You obviously did not 'get it . 'This series is not about a fantasy land within which Covenant travels , such as other fantasy books dictate - yes , it is a story of a man who travels through the Land , however it is mostly about what happens to a person ( physically , emotionally , mentally ) who contracts and suffers with leprosy . The Land was Covenant , literally . When you look back at the characters , at the nuances of the Land , at the abilities of the Lords and such , and then put these details to the variety of physical aspects of the body , you can see a whole other series and story taking place.Covenant was the Land . Though it is dreary and somewhat tiresome to read , the first book - Lord Foul 's Bane - is the most important . It is where you , the reader , learn all you need to know about leprosy . Apply all that you learn there to the rest of this series , and the next three books , and you have a deeper understanding of Donaldson 's genius.BTW : on a side note , Donaldson - a master of language - spent some time in India with his father , who worked very closely with lepers . His experiences there shine through in this series.The follow-up series ' first book - The Runes of the Earth - follows the same pattern as this sets of series , except instead of leprosy the story follows a more psychological approach , mainly psychosis . I am anxious to read the next three books in the final series of this epic.When I read this series and the series that followed , I was so stunned by everything - the story , the characters , the method of Donaldson 's writing - I could read nothing else for a year . It was roughly 12 months later that I finally broke down and bought the Myth series by Robert Aspirin to 'clean my pallet ' so that I could once again read a serious fantasy series.And know that this series was written well before most of the fantasy series you have probably read .	1
My first Alex Cross novel , and certainly not my last . Very good book .	1
I really enjoyed this book by James Patterson . This is the fourth book I 've read by Patterson but the first in the Alec Cross series . Very imaginative story telling.Must read for those who enjoy mystery stories .	1
I have been reading his books for several years and this is a good read . He knows how to keep your interest right to the end .	1
Along Came a Spider is the first installment in the detective Alex Cross series by Patterson . I did not read these books in order , but that has not detracted from the flow of any of the books . Since I have read the other books first , and the first book last , Detective Alex Cross has changed somewhat into a mellower , more likeable character . I did not see the movie , but had envisioned Denzel Washington to play the smooth and sophiscated Alex Cross and was disappointed in the choice of Morgan Freeman . But after reading this book , Morgan Freeman fits Alex Cross in this book perfectly - for this book only ! ! ! I love Patterson 's books and have read just about all of them . I find them to be engrossing , suspenseful and I just ca n't put them down . He foils me with the ending each and every time ! ! In this book , Patterson has a serial killer at large , Gary Soneji , who has kidnapped two children , and who wants to be known as somebody . Jezzie Flannagan from the FBI , is also on the case , giving Cross support to capture the killer . Three great strong main characters , exposed to the reader so as to get into their psyche , yet intertwined with each other to make for one incredible story.The ending is a blow out , which is what I love about Patterson - hanging on to the edge of your seat with each and every page , and giving you the shocker at the end . I love it ! His books are definite thrillers and shockers !	1
This is the first James Patterson book I have read but it wo n't be the last . I thought it was very , very good . A little slow in the middle but the beginning and the ending made up for it . Starts with the murders of a family , then two kids are kidnapped . Can they be connected ? ? ? ? ? ? Alex Cross is great as a detective . The mind games with him and Gary are breath taking . Jezzie Flanagan , with the Secret Service , gives you a big surprise . I do n't know if Sandford 's & quot ; Prey & quot ; series came first or Patterson 's & quot ; Cross & quot ; series came first , but they remind me of each other . John Sampson is very good as Cross 's partner . If you like a good mystery with lots of twist and turns and a good ending you will like this book .	1
Great murder mystery . James Patterson is a superb writer and he knows how to keep readers engaged . Thanks for sharing your gift .	1
Along Came a Spider ( Alex Cross ) This book was fantastic , kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what was coming next . I would recomend it to anyone who loves mysteries and suspence .	1
Great suspense with good charecters . Extremelly fast paced which is classic patterson . This is one of the better alex cross novels .	1
Though this is a story written years ago by James Patterson , I had not read it . As usual the mystery drama is captivating , twists are always offered , and begs you to read without ceasing to the very end .	1
Dan-X could not have said it any better . I too was looking for a great thriller , as the last two ( not the great JP 's ! ) I have read have been quite lacklastre and boring . Then I got & quot ; Along Came A Spider & quot ; ..it is a very quick , excellent read that has more twists and turns than you can imagine plus they ALL MAKE SENSE ! ! ! Because the chapters are very short you want to keep reading more and the storyline is unbelievably good ... I have already put my request in for more James Patterson.Read this book ! !	1
Book is divided into two parts.In the first part , Tracy Whitney , protagonist , is a bank employee . Her mother is tricked by few gangsters and ripped of property . Tracy tries to avenge her mother , but she is also framed and send to jail by gangster . She faces several hardships in the jail and forms accomplices . On releasing from the jail , Tracy and her accomplices avenge the gangsters.In the second part , Tracy could not find a job because of her past , and with time , she turns into a art thief . She steals expensive paintings and diamonds under strong security . Thefts are challenging and detailed in the book . Tracy outsmarts her rivals and police around the globe.I like the second part of the book , because it is interesting and I was kept curious of what was coming ahead.Overall , this book is a good read and I recommend this book .	1
Great book , couple of scams I did n't know about . Must reed .	1
I know I must have read this book years past , but had forgotten the story . I downloaded a sample when I was reviewing Sidney Sheldon 's books . It is absoultely one of the best mysteries in the history of time . Sidney Sheldon completely keeps you guessing as to where he is going with his plots and who the characters of the stories really are . I recommend that you read this book , but also let me recommend that you read every book he has written as they just continuously get better and better . This man was a genuius in his own rights when it came to writing . I read mysteries all the time , but his are by far at the top and exceed any and all expectations for a wonderful , and entertaining book ! Just read it ! ! ! !	1
Probably one of Clancy 's best.He builds - the numerous - plot strands nicely , all leading to an explosive ending.My only complaints - and they are is the same complaints I have with every single one of his books ... ..1 - he stereotypes his character 's conversations ... ie , if the character is an unlisted man , he abbreviates everything , and uses slang , if he is a senior officer , he does n't - that type of thing.2 - there are too many unnecessary passages about what the characters are thinking - yes , we need to know what their thoghts are , but not ad nauseum.But , all in all , an excellent book .	1
Through a twist of events , Jack Ryan is thrust into the presidency . Not at all sure he wants this tremendous responsibility , or the politics that goes with it , he does n't even get the luxury of a & quot ; honeymoon period & quot ; before he must face a horrible breakout of Ebola . As always , life is one catastrophe after another , and Jack performs admirably . This is a great book , rivaling his earlier Red Storm Rising for excitement . Of course it screams for a sequel , which has been a l-o-n-g time coming . The Bear and the Dragon will be released in August 2000 ... I 've already pre-ordered it !	1
This is truly an epic , an account of the struggle between the democracy of the United States and terrorism . After the initial , almost complete destruction of our government , we are left wondering how we will ever be able to put it back together again . At this point , the suspense is unbearable , and you must read on , you simply must . Of course , with the survival of the one person among hundreds of key politicians , who is the hero , Jack Ryan , we know that everything will be allright . But we do n't know how , and we 're anxious to find out . On the road to `` happily ever after '' we encounter one serious incident after another , any one of which could put us down for the count . Clancy weaves these plots with great precision , using the strokes of a master painter . Jack Ryan starts out slowly , cautiously , and seemingly unsure of himself , but builds confidence in himself to make the right decisions , and begins to issue his EXECUTIVE ORDERS to counterbalance and overcome the potential disasters facing him ( and us ) .The sub-plots are intricately woven and very well connected , and in a book this long , many times the suspense is unbearable.Of course the good guys win , but this does not make the story trite , nor is this unusual in any way . It is the classic expression of the triumph of good over evil . And what 's wrong with that ? My two favorite passages are Ryan 's confrontation with the Prime Minister of India , a woman , when she orders the Indian Navy to interfere with the passage of the US Navy in the Indian Ocean as they are on their way to the Persian Gulf , and he ( Ryan ) , in a telephone conversation with her , gets her to back down , after her initial coy belligerence ; and Ryan 's confrontation in the oval office with the one who betrayed him.The story is very long and sometimes tedious because of all the details , but overall it is terrific reading-one of the best books I 've read in a long time . I always thought Ludlum 's spy thrillers were good , but I think Clancy has pushed it up a notch to the next level .	1
You will perhaps never find a more brilliantly executed political/military/international relations thriller that matches the power , drama and vision as `` Executive Orders . '' This book is an unparalled feat of emotional , psychological , and moral exposition . This amazing novel should be required reading in all our army , airforce and naval colleges . Any student of international relations could not help but be rewarded by reading this outstanding piece of literature . In a world where fiction becomes reality , where the tail wags the dog , and instant media dictates the thin line between what is real and unreal , one has only to read this book to gain a more inclusive picture of what are the true issues facing our world today .	1
Continuing G.R.R . Martins story in Westeros and Essos . A fantastic fantasy epic that is very interesting and captivating . Be sure to read A Game of thrones and A Clash of Kings first !	1
Arthur Slade uses his young hero 's imagination to good effect in Dust . Robert , 12-years-old , is a voracious reader , and his imagination and his suspension of disbelief are the keys to the story 's success . If John Carter can go to Mars just by reaching out his hand and thinking about it , then Robert can unravel the mystery of the disappearing children.Dust is a nice mix of SF , fantasy , horror , mystery . I like the way Slade uses Robert 's fanciful thoughts to build atmosphere , like the smoky pool hall , which might be just above hell . : ) Well-written , reminescent ( sp ? ) of Bradbury 's Something Wicked This Way Comes .	1
One of the best books I 've read . Well written and emotional . I think you have to be somewhat know somethingabout Jewish law to get the full vision of the story . I loved it .	1
Hardened journalist , Jo Clifford is working on an investigative piece to debunk reincarnation and regression hypnosis.There 's only one problem , the fact that once she agrees to be hypnotised in order to try and be fair , she has very realistic images of a woman from the Middle Ages , Matilda , Lady of Hay.Is Jo really the reincarnation of someone who lived hundreds of years ago ? Or is she just remembering some facts that she had forgotten from long ago history lessons ? Flitting between Jo 's modern life and Matilda 's past life , the book is a real page turner , keeping you guessing until the very end . The regression is handled quite well and as you finish the book , you do begin to wonder if reincarnation is such a far fetched idea after all.Barbara Erskine has the talent to weave a spell with words , you just have to finish the books once started.Reviewed by Annette Gisby , author of Silent Screams .	1
This book held my interest for the most part but the author ruined the story for me by having the past become a physical part of the subject 's past life . Except for that . I did enjoy the book .	1
Book was enjoyable ; people who are into paranormal , incarnation , new age would most likely enjoy this book . I have not read other books by this author but would consider doing so .	1
I read this book years ago and I loved it . I thought that the lives and story lines that were interwoven were really interesting . I have often felt the pull to the past myself and when I read this book I started to think the author may have not just created an imagined story . I really got involved in the twists and turns of the plot . Again , I loved it . Ca n't wait to read it again .	1
Strong fantasy coupled with a unique , fun concept that broadly starts the epic . Get started and enjoy the whole series .	1
Many of you know the writing of Megan Lindholm . But apparently not enough of you . The story I heard was that because of a lagging career , and on the advise of her publishers or perhaps her agent , this writer of innovative and critically successful fantasy and science fiction re-invented herself as Robin Hobb , writer of ponderously long , epic fantasy trilogies . Under the Lindholm name , her books had been mostly of a more normal length , and the ones I 've seen , stand-alone stories , not series . Apparently , this change is what her career needed , since the Farseer Trilogy was successful . And now we have the start of a new series , The Liveship Traders.At whatever length she chooses to tell her stories , Lindholm/Hobb is afine writer . Ship of Magic introduces us simultaneously to many stories : the charming and dangerous pirate Kennit ; a tangle of sea serpents ; Althea Vestrit , disowned daughter of a once-wealthy Trader family , who has a close relationship to the families ' prize possession , a living , sentient merchant ship , along with many other vividly interesting characters , all told against a landscape which is other-worldly , decadent , magical and yet historically resonant.I confess I feel this book was just a tad commercially contrived . Ittouches many romantic stereotypes , and uses them effectively ; a young lady masquerades as a boy to run away as a sailor ; forbidden love , family intrigues and so forth . But Lindholm/Hobb is still an inventive , imaginative , effective writer , and I further confess I loved this book , and wait eagerly for the next.Perhaps I also wish , however , that shorter books , which have a climax when you reach the end , were more popular .	1
I just wanted to say that I had not intended to enjoy this series . I had been turned onto the series from an acquaintance , and as I had enjoyed the Hornblower novels , I thought I 'd give the first novel , Master and Commander a try . That one was slow going at first , but it kept getting better the further into it I read . Finally , I could n't put it down for the last one-third of it.And I enjoyed Post Captain even more . O'Brien 's humor seems to hit me just the right way . I 'm waiting a bit before purchasing the next in the series , as they are more expensive than most of the kindle books I read .	1
A RESPECTABLE TRADE is one of Philippa Gregory 's earlier novels , first published in 1995 , and re-released in 2007 now that her popularity has increased.The novel concerns the relationships and lives of Josiah Cole , Frances Scott , and Mehuru , a trio of individuals whose lives become entangled through the desire for financial gain , dubious morality , and sheer bad luck . Mehuru was a priest in Africa , captured by slave traders on a diplomatic mission . Frances Scott is a noble-born , penniless woman living off the generosity of her uncle . Josiah Cole is a sugar- and slave-trader , eager to make a name and a fortune for himself no matter what it takes . Josiah marries Frances , hoping that her noble connections will help improve his position in life , and requests that she train a group of slaves , including Mehuru , to be house slaves.The novel begins with a painstakingly detailed , and heartbreaking , description of the slave trade . The reader is transported , along with Mehuru , and witnesses the horrible conditions of the slave ships . Worse even than the physical horrors to which the slaves are subjected is the slow breaking down of the slaves ' spirits . The reader watches as Mehuru , a well-educated , extremely intelligent leader in his own country , is stripped of all his power . However , Mehuru is a fighter at heart , and refuses to accept the degradation to which he has been subjected.Mehuru 's journey is compared with that of Frances . As a woman of that time period , Frances is also powerless . However , her experience could never be as affecting as Mehuru 's because , unlike him , she accepts , and even profits , from the status quo . Slavery is a normal , unquestioned , part of life for her . She eventually does begin to question the morality of slavery , but , unlike Mehuru , she does n't have the strength , or perhaps the desire , to fight her station in life , which ultimately makes her harder to sympathize with.Despite the weakness in the Frances ' character , the slow development of her friendship with Mehuru is interesting to behold . Their personalities are incredibly different , but because they 've both been rendered powerless , they somehow understand each other intuitively.The plot is a bit unrealistic for the time period ( I wo n't ruin the developments here ) but the portrayal of the slave trade , the position of women , and the amorality of businessmen of the time make this book a worthwhile read .	1
Accepting that she does n't have any better prospects at the age of 34 , Frances Scott enters into a marriage of convenience with a Bristol trader . She is soon after presented with a shipload of African slaves and instructed to school them in English and domestic duties so that they may be sold as servants to wealthy English households . With time , Frances begins to doubt the common assertion of the time that the slaves are animals and can not be educated . One in particular , Mehuru , challenges everything she has been taught about the slave trade.Gregory 's prose is once again breathtaking and meticulous . Unfortunately , the story itself was lacking in some areas . Frances is not much of a heroine ; she is n't particularly likable and never seems to have an opinion of her own . I was n't convinced of Frances ' and Mehuru 's love , having observed them seemingly going from distaste to affection with nothing in between.Mehuru was by far the most interesting character , and I regret that we are not allowed to get to know him better . The most entertaining parts of the story involved his acclimatization to English society . Amusing are the scenes in which he is demonstrated comparing inferior aspects of English culture to those of his homeland ( and the reader is forced to agree ) , and his descriptions of how ghastly the pale English people look . My favorite quote : `` She is a white woman , '' he said , trying to reassure himself , discounting his insight . `` They all look sick to me . ''	1
Remember the best Law book you 've ever read ? Burn it . When you put your hands on ROUGH JUSTICE and start reading it , you 'll never be able to put it away . Why ? Cause you just do n't think you 're reading a book , but watching the best Law movie you 've ever watched . The book is full of twists , action , wonderful characters that seem to be someone from your own family , and Lisa Scottoline goes beyond : she makes you laugh by the way she describe things and put sentences into people 's mouth . SHE 'S AN AMAZING AUTHOR ! Remember the guy who you think is the best author of the genre ? Forget him . Buy this book and see why I 'm so in love with Lisa 's books . Just do n't start reading it if you have to work the next day .	1
If you have never read a book with an & quot ; anti-hero & quot ; you may find this book a real page turner . I was hooked immediately . The later books decline in quality pretty quickly as the novelty wears off , but this one is a classic .	1
Harry Flashman , a decorated officer in the British military during the 19th century , sits down to write his memoirs for posterity . He informs the reader that while he may be many unadmirable things -- coward , liar , so forth -- he is also going to be honest . Most of his life he 'd lucked into situations that allowed him to be looked upon as brave and heroic , and had been sure to keep up appearances , as doing so had its benefits , but now , at the end of it , he does n't much care if the truth be known . Which is in keeping with how he 's lived . In Flashman 's world he acts only out of self-interest and self-preservation . With no self left to preserve or to be interested in , why not be candid ? Whatever future generations think of him , it wo n't affect him and his fortunes , because he 'll be dead.This first volume of the Flashman Papers starts at the beginning ( oddly enough ) of Flashman 's army career and takes us through approximately the first three years of said career , two of which are spent in India and Afghanistan at a politically dangerous time . The events and many of the characters in the book have their basis in reality . For example Queen Victoria , Lady Sale , General Elphinstone , the Duke of Wellington . The running theme is incompetence , which for me is a topic that never ceases to amaze and amuse.People who find sexism and racism intolerable , even if we are n't meant to agree with it , would do best to avoid this one . For everyone else , I reckon you 'll likely as not enjoy reading about Flashman 's adventures .	1
I agree with some other reviewers that there is a big difference between the first half of the novel with the Neighborhoods and the second half with Jeamland . Perhaps this could have been two novels.Anyway , the author has a unique way of thinking and an original style and I greatly enjoyed reading the whole thing.John Christmas , author of `` Democracy Society ''	1
First the one negative - the story they claimed had n't been published in decades has in fact been published , but with a few changes ( different detective mostly ) so it 's not a story you will never have read before.Otherwise this is a great collection . It 's wonderful to have all of the stories in one place .	1
Of course , we all know the Boleyn sisters ' fate and yet , Philippa Gregory keeps us on tenterhooks all along this wonderfully written story . Mary , the `` other Boleyn girl '' , voices her worries , fears , wishes and dreams in such a way that we can feel and see everything she feels and sees in a very vivid way . It is like being transported to Henry VIII 's court.Of the many books I read and buy , only a few I keep for my personal library . The rest I give away or trade amongst friends and relatives . This one is for keeps !	1
The Other Boleyn Girl is a very interesting book , that is also very fun to read . Being only 14 , I thoroughly enjoyed it , and would compare it toGossip Girl # 1 : A Novel ( Gossip Girl Series ) but in medieval times . A great book , must read .	1
The first thing you need to know about this book is that it is a work of fiction ! If you want to read a biography of members of English monarchy , then strolling through the fiction shelf is a bad idea . A lot of people are casting doubts on the accuracy of events in this book . It 's not meant to be accurate , it is fiction . A lot of people had the same reaction to The Da Vinci Code , another brilliant book . That was not meant to be an accurate account of the Catholic Church and this particular book is not meant to be one of the Boleyns . To accuse `` historical fiction '' of inaccuracy is such an obvious oxymoron that well , strange that people do it ! The plot : It is absolutely brilliant ; starts and ends on the gravest notes possible . We begin our journey through 16th century England right at the execution block and end it there . The story is woven to delight any reader and it is the kind of plot which makes you reach out for the book every time you put it down.The characters : I must say , I have been utterly blown away by the character development . Who cares if the original people involved were any different , if Anne was any less of a plotter than she is portrayed to be in this book ? The characters stick with you and your first instinct upon ending the book is to go online and look for The Boleyn Inheritance to see what became of the survivors.Writing style : The writing style is , if anything , immaculately compatible with historical fiction . I have to say this book defines the genre and as you can probably see , it has over 800 reviews with a stunning average . The writing has stayed in my head while I was reading the book and I literally had to force myself to put it down before going to bed.All in all , this book was an absolute pleasure to read and for those of you wondering whether you should take the plunge into historical fiction , it 's the ideal platform to start .	1
Well , I could n't put it down , once I started in earnest . The characters are rich and well drawn . The historical perspectives leaves a bit to be desired . Ms Gregory does miss out on some of the dialogue of the time , playing up on some of the & quot ; rumors & quot ; instead of facts . A few of the characters are not historically accurate . If you can ignore the inaccuracies , this is a definite page turner and is excellently told . I can forgive a little license for a good story .	1
I remeber hearing briefly about Mary Boleyn when PBS did a documentary series on the six wives of Henry VIII , but I never knew much about her or King Henry 's court . Gregory recreates court life in the 16th century , full of intrigue , lust , decadence , spying , and betrayal . Anne Boleyn is a household name , but who knows that her younger sister had two children by Henry VIII before he moved on to Anne ? Let me not spoil the juicy experience for you . This was the first of Gregory 's novels that I read . I have now finished five ! I recommend them all highly , and in this order : The Other Boleyn Girl , The Boleyn Inheritance , The Queen 's Fool , The Virgin 's Lover , Earthly Joys . Enjoy ! Kate	1
Very good story telling . The characters were very well drawn , and I found I was staying up until the wee hours to finish this one . It is the mark of a great story that makes me curse out loud at one of the characters . But Anne was so deliciously evil in this book , that I just could n't help it . Excellent !	1
It 's so Magical , the way P.Gregory tells this story . I lived with each character as the story progressed ... I could relate to their fears , their heart-breaks , their passion , their thrills ! This book is definitely my first brilliant read of the year , so far ! : )	1
I LOVED this book ! I do n't really like reading historical novels , but this book was amazing . I could not put it down and would read well into the night because I could not get enough . The author does such a wonderful job with the characters , you feel sorry for Mary and how horrible her family was to her , but at the same time , you quickly begin to despise Anne and how awful a woman she was , especially to her sister . I found myself surfing the internet reading up on Henry VIII because I didnt know much about that time in history . Before reading this book , I would never have been that interested in the English monarchy . If I could rate this book a 10 I would . I would rank this up there with & quot ; Memoirs of a Geisha & quot ; . Buy this book , you will love it !	1
`` The Other Boleyn Girl '' represents the BEST in today 's historical fiction , because much of it is based on little known , and fascinating facts . Thoroughly researched by Philippa Gregory , who is an expert on Tudor England , this novel is also written in a captivating style . You will be enthralled from beginning to end . Recommended for anyone who enjoys history or biography .	1
I 'm a full blown anglophile and fairly picky reader of historical fiction . I found this to be an entertaining book and one of Gregory 's better efforts . I ca n't wait for the movie version with Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman ... should be hot !	1
Loved this book ! I could n't wait to read it again each day , I dreamed about it . Started to get a little slow around pg 500 , but I stuck it out . Makes me glad I was born in the 20th century.a lot of criticism I 've read pertains to historical inaccuracies , but that did n't bother me . It 's fiction !	1
This is probably one of the best if not the best historical book I have ever read . I study Art , and have been through many history books and novels , but never have I read one that was so captivating . It takes you right to the Tudor era , where you see everything vivdly in your head , the places , the castles , the people , even the outskirts of London City.The story revolves around Mary and Anne Boleyn ( Daughters of Elizabeth Howard ) . Mary beacme King Henry 's mistress under the influence of her family , and was in the courts favor for some time , while Anne , her sister , overshadowed Mary by marrying King Henry and becoming Queen.The book is a mixture of a lot of things , drama , romance , politics , history , that when you 've finished reading it , you 'll know a lot more about the Tudor age , courts in the 16th century , the King and some of his wives ... The close connection and rivarly between Anne and Mary , is astonishing , you 'll cry with them , laugh with them , feel happy for them , and sometimes sorry . The story is narrated by Mary Boleyn , which gives a nice change , since most books on this particualr period are from Anne 's point of view . Gregory goes into so much depth and detail that the books you read after this one will seem to lack them . It 's one of those books , that you ca n't stop thinking about it till you 've finished it , and will probably think about it after it too . I also recommend reading The Queen 's Fool , and the Virgin 's Lover , after this one , as they are basically sequential.A great read , a great subject , and only a great author could have wrote it . This book is a winner .	1
The Other Boleyn Girl is a book that has haunted me since the movie was released . Although I did n't see the film until after I had read the book ( and thank goodness , too ! ) , the book kept calling to me , mostly because I had heard the title and the concept sounded interesting -- the story of Anne Boleyn , told from the perspective of her sister.Who does n't know the story of Anne Boleyn , the woman who dethroned Catherine of Aragon and married King Henry VIII ? It was Anne Boleyn who helped Henry to found the Church of England , and it was Anne who was the first executed wife of King Henry the VIII , put to death on charges of incest , adultery and treason.The stories of the other Boleyns are less-told : George and Thomas , Mary and Elizabeth ( Anne 's Mother , not her daughter ) are less well known . The Other Boleyn Girl begins to tell the story of Anne 's siblings , Mary and George , and the relationships that they had with one another and with Anne.In spite of my intense desire to read The Other Boleyn Girl , I was disturbed the idea that I believed the book would be dry . I pondered the length of the novel ( nearly 700 pages ) and the content ( I am no a history buff by any means ) and several times overlooked the book . I could n't bring myself to spend the money on this novel.When I ran into The Other Boleyn Girl at a used book store , however , I snatched it up eagerly and perhaps a bit greedily and read it promptly.While Philippa Gregory takes some license with the story line regarding Mary , George and even Anne , I felt that this book was a wonderful , fast-paced and easy read . I was able to pick it up and put it down during waiting periods and still finished reading it within a week of having started the book.I highly recommend The Other Boleyn Girl and look forward to reviewing other books in the Tudors series !	1
I loved Minty Malone from the first page where she is found searching frantically for her grandmother 's tiara , getting ready for & quot ; her day , exactly as SHE wants it & quot ; all alone ! Of course , after nearly driving herself into hysterics she looks in the mirror and finds it on her head . & quot ; Her day & quot ; went downhill from there.This author , Isabel Wolff , is new to me , but I am ordering her prior book immediately after reading Minty Malone . Minty takes a good long while getting over her engagement gone bad , swinging from blaming herself totally to blaming him totally . She comes to the conclusion , as most of us do , that the relationship was a bust because both were at fault , although she has to painfully acknowledge her own shallowness in the process . Her class on how not to be 'nice ' is so hilarious I think I 'll either look for one myself or start one . The way she learns to trade insults with the gorgeous Joe gets wittier and wittier as they happily draw stares from the crowds of people who overhear them . How I love to laugh !	1
Minty Malone is an appealing character , and in MAKING MINTY MALONE , Isabel Wolff has written a novel far superior to most of the rubbish on the market . Wolff has created multiple supporting characters who are believable and well-detailed , and she also provides many different subplots to resolve . In fact , Wolff struck me me as a contemporary , post-feminist Charles Dickens . MAKING MINTY MALONE is easy reading , well-paced and fun -- this is light fiction at its best .	1
When my copy of this book , OF MARRIAGEABLE AGE , arrived from Bookouture , I feared I had asked for something I could not manage , with so many book reviews waiting for me in my TBR stacking up . The length was daunting in itself , and then because it is about India , all those weird names.What a wonderful transformation I felt as I read the first chapters . The writing style is exquisite , with descriptions of character and setting . The hold the British have on Guyana as well as `` back home '' in India makes any freedom lover despair over imperialistic colonization.But Maas could not have imbued her novel with this big theme without interesting the audience in the characters . The chapters are narrated first person from the point of view of Savitri in Madras , Nataraj in a rural Indian village , and Suroj in Guyana . All want a better life , free from the restrictions of their Indian culture . All want free love , not love by contracted marriage.Their children 's games turn into more serious assaults on their parents ' beliefs as they grow to adulthood . London is their mecca , the place they will be free to do what other people do : obtain a higher education , date anyone they please , for the women , wear short skirts and short hair.The freedoms we often take for granted are underscored as stepping stones to autonomous adulthood for the Indian characters . And yet , with the exception of Baba , the adults are not heavy-handed slave drivers . They are parents who understand the world and want their children to find joy in their ethnicity.Maas gives Savitri compassion , Nat a two-sided personality of both love and guilt , and Suroj a dispute with her mother . With these elements in place , the plot dashes forward in complications of love and duty.The book reminds me of my favorite multi-generational epics of love and war : DR. ZHIVAGO , THE LAST CONVERTIBLE , MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA . All of these are long books with characters I will never forget , heartaches I will never forget , beautiful writing I will never forget . Maas captures the big picture while also feeding her reader 's love of language and craving for detail . This is absolutely a stunning book , carefully crafted and expertly told .	1
This is a quick and easy book to read . The concepts presented in this book to improving Customer Service is very possible . The ideas presented is interesting and really makes me aware how I have been `` just satisfied '' with all the bad customer service all around us . Ken gets his points across by using short events and dialogs between the characters . However , the short events , products , etc ... seems to be too fantasy and very fictional . I would have been more convinced if he had used real life examples . The concepts presented , however , are very logical and very implementable .	1
First published in 1989 , this book provides you a strong foundation in understanding the Middle East current issues . The author explains how the French and the British in the 1920s created a set of countries after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire that represented no more than lines in the sand . Often these lines contradicted the ethnicity , and religious affiliations of the affected populations.The French created Syria , and Lebanon . Syria was predominantly Muslim . And , so was Lebanon . But , the French installed a Christian minority in power in Lebanon who had a stronger affiliation with the French than the other groups . The majority of the Lebanese population were Muslims split between Sunnis and Shiites . Both the Sunnis and the Shiites would have preferred joining the Muslims in neighboring Syria , but had no say in the matter . The much faster demographic growth of the Muslims caused rising tension and ongoing violence with the Christian minority lead government.Additionally , the Sunnis and the Shiites were often at war with each other . So , it is not like Islam is one unified monotheist religion at peace with itself . Instead , it is a very fragmented religion . It is undergoing the equivalent of the Reformation era that Christianity suffered 400 years ago when Catholics and Protestants were killing each other over minute difference in interpretation of the same religion.As we know , the story of Israel is even more explosive than Lebanon . In 1921 , the British carved out the former Palestine division of the Ottoman Empire into two . The Eastern half became Jordan , and the Western half became a contested territory between Palestinian Arabs and Zionist Jews . An ongoing migration of European Jews until and after the end of WWII caused a rising tension between the two groups . This turned into ongoing violent civilian unrest that the British could not control anymore . The Brits left , and the UN took over . In 1947 , the UN declared a formal partition of the territory into a Palestinian State ( West Bank , Gaza ) and a Jewish State . The Zionist Jews declared Israel statehood in 1948 . A day later all neighboring countries immediately attacked Israel . But , Israel held its own . While Egypt took over the Gaza District , and Jordan annexed the West Bank . In 1967 , a second war erupted and Israel expanded its territory and occupied West Bank and Gaza District . The tension between Arabs and Jews has not abated since.The tension between Israelis and Palestinians has lasted over 80 years . After reading this book , you realize how difficult a sustainable peace resolution is . Tribal politics are prevalent throughout the region , and lead to a winner take all mentality . Negotiations and diplomacy are skills that are not utilized much in this region . Thomas Friedman gives you a sense that the `` Land for Peace '' motto so promoted in the West is actually utopic . There has been many `` Land for Peace '' deals offered to the Palestinians during the past couple of decades , but they were always immediately turned down by Arafat and the PLO , and quickly accompanied by a rise in terrorism and suicide bombing . The Muslim Arab World just does not recognize Israel statehood . The Palestinians and their Arab brothers have little interest in sharing land peacefully with Israel in an official Palestinian state . What they really want , is for Israel to get out . Given that this outcome is even more utopic than the `` Land for Peace '' proposals , this conflict may last much longer .	1
The author informs us about past history of places in Middle East , where so much conflict is nowhappening . Any One who is interested in why , and how , and what happened many years ago willbe helped to understand what is happening now .	1
A number of other Amazon reviews have pointed out the major error of Friedman . He bends over backwards to be ' objective ' and in the process distorts reality . He has a visceral dislike for the Jews who live in Judaea and Samaria and can not write of them with sympathy . He is one of those who argues a ' false symmetry ' between the Palestinians who advocate terror , and the Israelis whose military action is in self- defense . He pretends to be fair , but lacks real judgment and the courage to see that one side in the Middle East conflict is far more right than the other . In this he is the perfect representative of the paper he represents , the NY Times which for years has worked to blame Israel when it should have been defending the Middle East 's only democracy .	1
Fritjof Capra ( born 1939 ) is an Austrian-born American physicist , who is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy and is on the faculty of Schumacher College . He is also the author ofThe Turning Point : Science , Society , and the Rising Culture , Uncommon Wisdom , The Web of Life : A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems , andThe Hidden Connections : Integrating The Biological , Cognitive , And Social Dimensions Of Life Into A Science Of Sustainability.Subtitled `` An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism , '' Capra wrote in the Preface to this 1975 book , `` Five years ago , I had a beautiful experience which set me on a road that has led to the writing of this book . I was sitting by the ocean one late summer afternoon , watching the waves rolling in and feeling the rhythm of my breathing , when I suddenly became aware of my whole environment as being engaged in a gigantic cosmic dance ... '' He later admits that `` In the beginning I was helped on my way by 'power plants ' which showed me how the mind can flow freely ... '' He writes in the first chapter , `` The purpose of this book is to explore this relationship between the concepts of modern physics and the basic ideas in the philosophical and religious traditions of the Far East . We shall see how the two foundations of twentieth-century physics -- -quantum theory and relativity theory -- -both force us to see the world very much in the way that a Hindu , Buddhist or Taoist sees it , and how this similarity strengthens when we look at the recent attempts to combine these two theories in order to describe the phenomena of the submicroscopic world ... '' Here are some additional quotations from the book : '' The particle world can not be decomposed into elementary components . '' ( Pg . 81 ) '' Quantum theory thus reveals an essential interconnectedness of the universe . It shows that we can not decompose the world into independently existing smallest units . '' ( Pg . 137 ) '' The relativity of time also forces us to abandon the Newtonian concept of an absolute space ... there is no absolute space independent of the observer . '' ( Pg . 166 ) '' The distinction between matter and empty space finally had to be abandoned when it became evident that virtual particles can come into being spontaneously out of the void , and vanish again into the void ... '' ( Pg . 222 ) '' The whole universe is thus engaged in endless motion and activity ; in a continual cosmic dance of energy . '' ( Pg . 225 ) '' ... the theories of atomic and subatomic physics made the existence of elementary particles increasingly unlikely . They revealed a basic interconnection of matter , showing that energy of motion can be transformed into mass , and suggesting that particles are processes rather than objects . '' ( Pg . 285 )	1
This book is a short but vivid sketch depicting a situation in the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council which so swiftly and profoundly altered liturgical , ritual and spiritual life of the faithful that many of them - both among a hierarchy and common priests , monks and laymen - were thrown into confusion . However , these changes were positively necessary in order not to clone the former mistakes of negation of the modern world reality that several centuries ago had led to appearance of 'that righteous prig nailing in Wittenberg his defiance to the church doors ' who reformed the Church and the history of humankind . The novella does not pretend to a wide scope of theological problems , the characters of cynical church 'generals ' are rather schematic and satirical , but the delineation of different kinds of catholics - new 'enlightened ' libertarian generation , old generation who preserved their faith and also the hesitating type of believer who is loosing his/her faith - and their intricate interrelations in Time of Spiritual Troubles is really excellent .	1
I first read of Thor Heyerdahl 's voyage across the Pacific when I was in high-school and it had left a lasting impression on me . I recently ran across the book and reread it . Kon-Tiki is an amazing story of Heyerdahl 's determination to prove a theory that it is possible to sail from Peru to the South Pacific islands by raft . He puts together a successful expedition , and with a lot of luck manages to prove his point . Along the way , you get a history lesson , geography lesson , marine biology lesson , and a wonderful sea-faring adventure story all in a fast-paced book . And with the photographs accompanying the prose , you feel like you too are on the raft with them .	1
`` Kon Tiki '' is one of the great adventure stories of all time . In 1947 , six young Norwegians floated in a balsa-wood raft from Peru to the Polynesian islands of the South Seas . The trip took them 101 days and they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Pacific without seeing a single other boat or ship . Only occasionally were they able to communicate with the outside world by radio , and the possibility of rescue should their primitive raft sink or break up in the heavy seas they often experienced was slim to none.The journey was inspired by the theories of Thor Heyerdahl who speculated that the ancient civilizations of Peru had floated across the Pacific to reach the Polynesian islands . Scoffed at by scientists , Heyerdahl organized the expedition to prove that a raft crossing of the Pacific was possible . It was a foolhardy stunt -- but makes for a great story . `` Kon Tiki '' tells the story of the expedition from beginning to the end when the crew of the raft is marooned on an idyllic paradise isle in the South Pacific . Rereading the book after many years , I was most impressed with how isolated and empty the Pacific Ocean was and how unexploited was its sea life in 1947 . I fear that such is no longer the case.Heyerdahl 's theories of oceanic migrations from the Americas to Polynesia are still pooh-baahed by archaeologists today , although it seems that the sweet potato by some means made it from Peru to Polynesia in pre-historic times . Whatever your opinion may be regarding Heyerdahl as a scientist the story of the `` Kon Tiki '' is unique and original . Read it and weep because the opportunity for an adventure of such scope and daring is no longer possible in our over-crowded world.Smallchief	1
if you have enjoyed Amy Tan in the past , you will like this book . Tan does a great job of creating characters that the reader becomes attached to and wants to know what they end up doing . The historical aspects of this book are also very interesting and enlightening .	1
Immediately got immersed in the story of Ruth Young 's mother , LuiLing and grandmother , Precious Auntie and their lives before coming to the US from China . Very fast paced .	1
A middle-aged woman must come to terms with her mother 's onsetting Alzheimer 's . The mother 's story is a major element , casting doubt on just how much is dementia and how much is her keeping skeletons in their closets.This was my first Tan novel , and I was surprised at how well it was written . The stories are rich in detail , and do a good job of evoking reader pathos as well as a sense of `` there . '' The last act of the book was a let-down , though I can understand why the author chose to handle matters the way she did.Talking to a friend of mine who knew `` The Joy Luck Club , '' it would seem that the Author has a penchant for exploring mother/daughter dynamics , so perhaps this is retreading familiar ground . Since it was my first book of hers , I did n't mind.I was impressed enough with this that might pick up another book of hers in the future . Obviously , one has to be interested in Asian culture to get the most out of this , but it 's probably mainstream enough for `` the masses '' as well .	1
This is the story of a Chinese woman and her American daughter . The daughter has a hard time understanding her mother and feels that she is losing her grip on reality . She believes her mother is constantly confused and can no longer take care of herself . Then one day she comes across the true story of her mother 's childhood and what she had to go through to make it to the United States . It is a tale of much suffering , but a great deal of inner strength . Through this story the mystery that is her mother is unraveled , and through this new understanding of her mother , she can begin to understand herself.This book was riveting from start to finish . It begins with a simple phrase , which drew me in and would n't let go : Things I Must Not Forget . I was touched by the story of hardship , but it was also a story of finding inner strength through adversity . This strong message held me throughout the story , and also after I finished . I felt I could relate to the characters on a personal level , something that I 've found in all of the Amy Tan novels I 've read . each character is very human and three dimensional ; a blending of good and bad traits . I loved this book and highly recommend it for anyone .	1
I picked this book on a whim and was moved to tears by Amy Tan 's loving adaptation of relationships within several generations of women . The Bonesetter 's Daughter was a beautifully written story that I really enjoyed reading .	1
_Trilobite_ by Richard Fortey is a wonderful , witty , charming , very well-written , and very richly illustrated homage to the trilobite , an arthropod that teemed in the millions in the seas of the ancient earth for 300 million years before becoming extinct . Fortey is an enthusiastic expert on all things trilobite - having studied them for over 30 years - and did an excellent job in conveying his passion for these long extinct creatures in a very readable format with many dozens of excellent photographs and sketches.Early on Fortey introduced basic concepts of trilobite anatomy ( he said eight technical names is all anyone needs to describe any species ) . With the help of a diagram of a representative species , we learn for instance that the head is properly termed the cephalon while the other end -the tail - is called the pygidium . Between the cephalon and the pygidium is the thorax , which is subdivided into segments ( thoracic segments ) . A central convex portion or lobe running down the thorax and pygidium is called the axis , while to either side are the lateral or pleural parts.Reading about trilobite eyes was particular fascinating ; they were made of calcite ( the same substance that makes up the white cliffs of Dover and was popular in classical architecture ) , something unique in the entire animal kingdom . Fortey discussed the physics and chemistry of the crystal eyes of trilobites , how they enabled the animal to see , how the lenses on trilobite eyes were arranged and how they functioned , the unique optical properties of calcite , even experiments replicating the vision of individual trilobite species ( in particular the experiments relating to the vision of _Phacops_ were extremely interesting ; I never knew that physics had such a place in paleontology ) .We learn also that while whole trilobites are certainly found in the fossil record ( or more accurately the carapace of the animal , as the soft and delicate parts such as the legs only rarely fossilize ) much of what is found are only bits and pieces , often shed when molting . Thoracic segments , pygidium , and other parts litter the fossil record like puzzle pieces and it is often the job of the trilobite expert to reassemble them , much like a jigsaw puzzle . Some fossils sites - such as Beecher 's Trilobite Bed , an Ordovician fossil site in New York - have preserved through unusual circumstances such delicate trilobite parts as their legs ( long a mystery to researchers ) and even antennae . The details about the life of the trilobite found there - genus _Triarthus_- was fascinating ; apparently they lived in a very low oxygen , high sulfur seafloor environment and may have perished during a fatal drop of dissolved oxygen ( and were thus preserved ) but otherwise lived symbiotically with bacteria that derived energy from sulfur.Fortey introduced the reader to a wonderful parade of trilobite species , relating the history of the group from the Cambrian to its final days in the Permian ( the true Age of Trilobites he wrote ranged from the middle of the Cambrian to the Ordovician ) . We find that trilobites lived in diverse habitats , from the shallowest `` sands to the deepest-water shales ; in sunlit reefs and in gloomy abysses . '' _Olenellus_ for instance is the commonest of the earliest Cambrian trilobites , a creature the size of a large lobster that was a voracious predator 535 million years ago . _Agnostus_ was a tiny , millimeters long trilobite that swarmed in the millions , odd creatures that only had two thoracic segments and was so abundant that some late Cambrian limestones are made of nothing but this tiny trilobite . _Elrathia kingi_ is the commonest of the `` rock shop '' Cambrian trilobites , a `` middle-of-the road '' typical trilobite , one of many dozens of very broadly similar trilobites that make specialists gnash their teeth . This species has been known to leave tracks that have been fossilized , one of the true `` mud-grubbers '' that plowed furrows in seafloor sediment in its quest for food . _Parabarrandia_ was a streamlined , torpedo shaped Ordovician trilobite , a species that Fortey had performed experiments on in a water tank with dye to prove that it was well suited to a free-swimming role ( I never thought one could do experiments on a trilobites ; that was fascinating to read ) . Another free-swimmer was the giant-eyed _Opipeuter_ ( Greek for `` one who gazes '' ) from the Ordovician , with eyes oriented to see forwards and backwards and a body plan designed to house powerful swimming muscles . Also from the Ordovician was _Isotelus_ , an unusual animal which completely lacked eyes and had a head surrounded by a border full of perforations , not unlike a colander . This pitted fringe lay about the front of the head sort of like a halo , a rather complicated bit of Paleozoic engineering , the function of which has remained an enigma . The Devonian abounded in trilobites covered in prickles and spines ( possibly related to the dominance of fish ) ; one , _Dicranurus_ , among its spines appeared to have had great curling ram horns originating at the neck.As fascinating as trilobites are , Fortey had encountered those that question why he has devoted his life to their study . The author made an excellent case that knowledge of trilobites has played vital roles in the debates over the origins of new species and the nature of evolution itself ( researches have been able to track changes in trilobite species over time thanks to their great abundance in the fossil record ) and in the study of the positioning of ancient continents ( as it has been discovered that trilobites make excellent index fossils , not only for marking intervals of geologic time but also to mark the shores of ancient continents , enabling or aiding in the mapping of the ancient world ; indeed Fortey himself named an Ordovician ocean , Tornquist 's Sea , which separated the continents of Avalonia and Baltica , thanks to trilobites ) . Fortey weighed in also in such divisive concepts in evolution as gradualism versus punctuated equilibria , the nature of the Cambrian explosion ( and what trilobites tell us about that ) , the origin of eyes in animals , and the importance ( and proper interpretation ) of the weird Burgess Shale fauna .	1
My interest in Albania began with a TV documentary about tribal feuds in that country . Amazed that such barbaric custom could exist in the heart of Europe in this day and age , I decided to find more about Albania . Robert Carver 's highly readable book only confirmed the documentary story . While many readers who commented here condemn Carver 's lack of political correctness , I appreciate the fact that he had the courage to write about what he had seen through his personal lense - political correctness be damned . I do n't see why an author should be held responsible for the reputation of a country . This is how Albania appeared to him and if those who lived there had different experiences , they are free to write and publish them . I , for one , find it difficult to defend a culture where family honor is blown out of proportion , where women are treated like cattle and insults are drowned in the blood of innocent family members .	1
I had knew that Jhumpa Lahiri was an author I should be mindful of from reading `` Mrs. Dutta Writes A Letter '' in a short story writing class , so I came to `` The Namesake '' with a good deal of anticipation . Would I be adding Lahiri , to my list of `` must buy '' Indian authors , Mistry , Mukherjee and Divakaruni ? The answer ... absolutely ! `` The Namesake '' is a peek into the world of immigrant Americans that I can only imagine . I have always wondered how one lives between cultures , not entirely part of one or another . `` The Namesake '' gives me a snapshot of that world . Helps me to understand . A wonderful gift of a novel .	1
This book tells an engaging story ; it will resonate with anyone who has been an immigrant or a child of an immigrant . It is very readable , but in my opinion , it isnot a literary masterpiece .	1
Lahiri 's tale of a Bengali family that emigrates from India to America `` feels like a string of accidents , unforeseen , unintended , one incident begetting another . '' For Gogol Ganguli , the son of Ashoke and Ashima , `` these events have formed [ him ] , shaped him , determined who he is . . . . Things that should never have happened , that seemed out of place and wrong , these were what prevailed , what endured , in the end . '' Even Gogol 's name is the result of an accident . Named after the Russian author , whose work his father was reading at the time of a nearly fatal railway crash , Gogol tries to , but ultimately can not , escape either his name or his heritage.After an arranged marriage and before his birth , Gogol 's parents settle in Massachusetts , where they spend weekends entertaining and visiting other Bengali families . Gogol 's father , Ashoke , slowly accommodates himself to his life as an American professor , but Ashima never stops considering Calcutta as her home . Gogol , quietly embarrassed by his parents ' provincialism , does everything he can to shun his Indian heritage and to fit into a mostly white , Birkenstock-footed crowd . ( He and his sister especially resent their long visits with their extended family in Calcutta . ) While Gogol is struggling to escape the accidents of his heritage , his father is ineffectively attempting to relate to his son ; one of the most heart-wrenching episodes is when Ashoke presents his indifferent son with a copy of Gogol 's stories . Lahiri is at her best in presenting these two themes : the duality experienced by second-generation Americans and the acid-sweet schizophrenia generated by the typical father-son relationship.Lahiri 's prose is also in top form . Her omniscient voice alternates among characters , sketching their outlines before zooming in on specific incidents or traits . Her story will cover the events of several years in a few pages , almost as if she were writing a biographical essay ; then we will read in minute detail about a particular tragedy , a family reunion , or even an idiosyncratic yet everyday routine , such as how Ashima has purchased and maintained her various address books or when the young Gogol and his father walked along a beach to a lighthouse . I can understand how some readers feel that the expository sections are too emotionally detached , but the contrast surely heightens the impact of the more intimate passages.The invisible presence throughout `` The Namesake '' is the ghost of Nikolai Gogol , and I ca n't speak to the parallels between the novel and his fiction . Like the protagonist of Lahiri 's book , I too have a copy of his collected stories -- a gift from a beloved friend -- that has been sitting for many years on a bookshelf , untouched and unopened . It 's time I crack it open .	1
Such a beautifully written book ! Assimilating into American culture while at the same time remaining true to their Bengali heritage is this book 's theme . You will love these people and enjoy their history , cooking , travels ... it 's a very lovely book .	1
Great insights into Indian traditions and immigrant experience . Well written book that 's a very enjoyable read ! Author does a great job making you feel like you 're in the scenes .	1
This book was n't written extravagantly , yet it had such depth . It was n't a cliff-hanger , but I still could n't put it down .	1
more or less nonstop . I have to say that I thought the ending kind of had a `` let 's wrap it up '' feel to it , but I think that 's kind of a problem with family sagas.This book tells the story of a Bengali man and woman who enter into an arranged marriage in India and immediately move to Boston . The wife is cut off from her family and because she 's not working ( her husband is working on a PhD ) , she is particularly lonely and struggles to adjust to the culture . The book covers a 30 plus year period , and tells the story of their oldest child , a boy who ends up named Gogol -- a name that was meant as a nickname but ends up on his birth certificate , in part because of cultural differences . Gogol faces 2nd generation issues of identity , at first trying to distance himself completely from Bengali culture and values and then coming to understand that to do this would isolate him from his family and be psychologically difficult . Although he marries for love , one ca n't escape thinking that his parents ' marriage worked out much better in the long run.Lahiri is a great story teller ( she won a Pulitzer for an earlier collection of short stories , Interpreter of Maladies , which is well worth reading ) . As the daughter of an immigrant from Britain , I sympathized with much of what Gogol experiences , living with a parent who regards `` home '' as being in another country . At one point in this book , the acronym ABCD is used -- American-born Confused/Conflicted Desh ( Indian ) . And that is what much of this book is about -- the conflicts of both first and second generation Indian immigrants .	1
When I first tried , I could not get into it . On a second attempt , I became totally hooked . It is a truly interesting window into a lifestyle I know nothing about .	1
I did n't think I would like this book , I really did n't expect much of it . I saw it on sale for Kindle and ordered it without reading the description . When I finally did , I shrugged thinking maybe I would make it through one or two chapters but that would be it . It 's been about a week and I 've already finished the book . I even had tears in my eyes at the end . This is one of the most impressive books I have read that concerns itself with a person 's identity . It has such depth to it and comes completely full circle at the end . If you have the chance to read this , just go for it . It 's well worthwhile .	1
Lahiri 's characters come alive in her simple yet moving language , almost like Italio Calvino's.If you read `` Interpreter of Maladies , '' you need no introduction to this brilliant writer . Get this book and savor it . The fluid style , an undercurrent of the vagaries of cultural dislocation , and the worldliness of her characters are almost in continuation of her touching yarns from `` Interpreter.. '' If you are considering this author for the first time , Lahiri has a way of getting under the skin of her characters and painting a wonderful web of life 's simple moments . The lead character , Gogol , is vintage Lahiri : a man baffled by split national identities . We follow a trail of his life as he grows up in an alien environs , with different people and mores . But Lahiri , with her seamless literary skills , cuts through life 's usual messiness to reveal some fundamental themes - about how people cope with love , adaptation , family , and the perpetual quest for a mooring.To allow myself a `` harsh critic '' moment , perhaps some of the non-protagonist characters get a short shrift in terms of ink-time -- the parents and the sister of Gogol , for instance , never really transcend their cardboard descriptions . The novel overall left me with a feeling of not having taken any risks other than what her stories in `` Interpreter.. '' had already embraced . But these are trivial , subjective quibbles.This is a highly recommended gem of a read .	1
As a South Asian-American I thought this book was authentic , one of the truest books I 've ever read . The passages that get a bit longish for some readers seemed eerily like my own life -- descriptions of things found in bedrooms , of Bengali-American parties , of people 's coping strategies of being first- or second-generation American . I found that I could relate to at least two of the characters , and knew a lot of the types of the other characters from people in my own life . I wish I 'd written this book.I give a lot of credit to Lahiri for producing a work that is so emotionally authentic , universal , and resonant , while solving the problem of the guilt sometimes passed around in a family . Lahiri does so without putting any of the blame for anybody 's existential or cultural unhappiness on any one character . Everybody is likeable and their situations and impulses are understandable . Ashoke and Ashima are not to blame for Gogol 's name , since he picks it himself in a way and he has a problem with being distanced from it . Ashoke is not to blame for Ashima 's estrangement from her family and country , because they were living poor in Calcutta and Ashima did n't find a better suitor . Just like in real life , there 's often no better option in a situation , just a choice someone made a long time ago with the given inputs . No one is a villain , she just tells it like it is.Also , Lahiri wrote a book about some pretty nice people that are accepting and turn out to be good for each other in the end . If I were writing the book I 'd have a lot less of this because sometimes things do n't always get patched up , but I 'm glad Lahiri does it differently , since with bad Bengali neighbors or children who marry outside the group and cut off ties with their family or what have you , the novel would collapse under its own weight , since there 's already death and estrangement to deal with.The Mira Nair movie was also right-on .	1
Jhumpa Lahiri 's `` The Namesake '' begins with the birth of Gogol Ganguli , the son of young Indian parents recently immigrated to Boston . The novel follows the life of Gogol and his identity as a second generation Indian living in the United States with a Russian name , from his childhood to middle age . The life of Gogol , and especially the viewpoint of his parents , are presented in a wonderfully poignant way that is all the more effective for its subtlety - although it is written in a somewhat detached third person form , the powerful way in which the feelings of the characters resonate off the page makes it hard to put down - I went through the life of Gogol in two days and could n't stop thinking about it for a week afterwards . I would highly recommend this book , especially to other second generation Indians , who may find that they can relate strongly to Gogol 's point of view and circumstances .	1
I bought these for my son , but he did n't enjoy them . I re-read them having read them around his age of 10-12 . An OK story . These arrived in a timely fashion and very nice condition .	1
I have not read all of these just yet . I read the Black Cauldron as a child ( love the Disney movie too ) and for some reason never knew it was a series .	1
In the surge of fantasy books being reprinted , the formerly unavailable works of Diana Wynne-Jones are becoming available . `` Eight Days of Luke '' is a delight for fantasy and mythology buffs alike.David dreads coming home for vacation . As his parents are dead , he lives with his horrible relatives : Uncle Bernard , Aunt Dot , Cousin Ronald and his wife Astrid , and the sinister housekeeper , all of whom insist that he be grateful to them . They tell him what to wear , how to speak , what to do , constantly talk about what a burden and a pain he is , and spend the rest of the time listening to Astrid and Bernard compare imaginary ailments.While out doing yardwork , David utters a gibberish curse -- only to have a nearby wall erupt in a shower of snakes . Another boy named Luke appears , and offers to help David . Why ? He says that David freed him , and David goes along with this . Luke charms David 's nasty family , and as a result Astrid slowly begins to befriend David.But Luke quickly displays that he can be dangerous as well as helpful . And he is strangely wary of the new people in the neighborhood : the Frys , one-eyed Mr . Wedding , and sinister gardener Mr. Chew . He claims that he was framed for something he did n't do -- but how is David going to help him ? Perhaps the only drawback of this book is that you need some basic knowledge of Norse mythology to know who people like the Frys , Mr . Wedding and Luke are ; those who are not familiar with the myths may be hopelessly lost . So brush up on the basics before reading . As for the finale -- well , you 'll definitely need to know about Norse myths . Jones does n't tell us too much , but she does n't tell us a lot either . The three old women will be recognizable easily , though : Similar characters have been featured in many other works of fantasy.David is a completely realistic young boy , and I was pleased to see the `` conversion '' of one of his annoying relatives . Luke manages to be sympathetic and interesting despite the fact that he 's a little amoral and has a perilous sense of fun . I was also glad that the `` nasty relatives '' did n't fall into the Roald Dahl/Harry Potter trap of being cartoonishly bad . They 're bad because they are rigid and disdainful -- nasty in ways that are almost hilariously realistic . ( The scene where David keeps score as Astrid and Bernard compare psychosomatic problems is a hoot ! ) Soon to be reprinted , this is a lesser-known gem that is often overshadowed by Jones 's other more popular works . Though shorter than many of her other books , this is a great read for adults and kids alike..	1
This is not , in my opinion , the best story Diana Wynne Jones has ever written , but it is still a good story , and a fun read . The one thing I think would help it out would be to put the postscript at the beginning , so readers could understand more about the characters and the meaning of the escapades . Even with a classical education , and eight years at university resulting in three degrees , I found myself not always up on what the Norse gods were up to.And it helped to know .	1
I , now 34 years old , like most of the other reviewers for this book grew up reading the series and believe them to be great stories for both the young reader and the adult reader . A few years ago I began wondering if the THREE INVESTIGATORS ( TI ) were available for purchase today . I have an 11 year old son and thought he might enjoy reading them . I also thought I might like re-reading them again . I found that indeed some of the books were available but to my surprise the Alfred Hitchcock introductions and conclusions had been removed from the books . This put me off so that I decided not to purchase them.Around this time I also became familiar with Amazon.com 's auction site ... . Suffice it to say I was able to find almost all the orginal mysteries with the Hitchock material and references included as well as the artwork by Harry Kane . I also was able to purchase them in the 1960 's hardback form . These books have been read before and show some light wear but that 's a fair trade off if it means I can have the original hardback versions with all the original content.I began my collection with THE SECRET OF TERROR CASTLE . I think that this is a great intro into the series and as other readers have indicated the mystery follows a logical pattern so that if you pay attention you may be able to piece the ending together . As for me I almost figured the mystery out . I had guessed the Whisperer had a role in the events going on at Terror Castle but had not guessed the full extent.For the adult reader I might suggest reading this book while at work . I have recently read adult authors such as Clancy , Cussler and Brooks at work and find that such concentration is required for this heavier reading and that the work enviornment slows my reading pace down . I found that while reading TI at work I was able to move at a quick pace and the lighter reading lent itself nicely to the busy work enviornment . I have just about completed collecting all the Robert Arthur TI books in hardback and will probably stop there as I like his writing the best . ...	1
This is the first book in the Three Investigators juvenile series . This book , being the first of the series , has more setup than most of the books . It is here that the boys relationship with Alfred Hitchcock is explained . It should be pointed out that the Hitchcock connection is largely a marketing ploy and Hitchcock plays almost no role in the stories themselves . Indeed , it was easy to replace Hitchcock with an entirely fictional character in later editions after his death.The main protagonists are introduced in this book . Jupiter Jones , the `` stocky '' and intelligent one , is the natural leader of the group . Pete Crenshaw is the athletic one of the group . Bob Andrews is the studious one with the leg brace . Although , stereotypical in the beginning as the series progresses the boys are progressively more realistically portrayed . We are also introduced to Worthington , the likable chauffeur.The plot is the classic haunted house story . There are mysterious goings on at Terror Castle and the boys have to get to the bottom of it . There are enough twists and turns to keep even an adult interested.If you have a 10-15 year old reader you could do a lot worse than this series . The only possible drawback is that most of the stories are dated ; they are set firmly in the 1960s . But the charm of the books are timeless . The illustrations by Harry Kane are worth the additional effort of tracking down earlier printings .	1
Being a middle school teacher I try to keep up to date on books aimed for younger readers . As I was browsing through the bookstore I came across The Three Investigaors series . WOW ! TALK ABOUT A BLAST FROM THE PAST ! I recalled ( back in the late 70 's ) reading a few of these stories involving the three teens and their mystery solving cases dealing with mummies , sharks , and scarecrows . Of their partnership with Alfred Hitchcock and their secret headquarters buried in a salavage yard . But , would their adventures be as fascinating to a grown up ? The answer ( as I briefly pinch my lip ) is - YES ! I 'm happy to say that Jupiter Jones , Pete Crenshaw , and Bob Andrews have held up remarkably well over the years . Granted Mr. Hitchcock is now referred to as Reginald Clarke , but everything else remains the same just a fun-filled mystery . The Secret of Terror Castle does a nice job of starting off the series and introducing readers to the characters and their exploits.Anyone who grew up with Scooby Doo will love these books . As an educator I also strongly recommend them for parents who are looking for books to get their young boys interested in reading.For anyone ( of any age ) that is looking for more to young-literature than Harry Potter , the Hardy Boys , or the Wolrds of Narnia ... then The Three Investigaors series will be a great discovery !	1
For the uninitiated , I would recommend reading the first in the series , Curse of the Mistwraith , and continue on through the set . The tragedy , however , is that most of the series is out of print . Further , the latest one , Traitor 's Knot , had to be ordered through Amazon , as my local bookstore never seems to have any books by Janny Wurts . I 'd recommend buying just the first one , or check your local library first , rather than buying the entire set at once . For many , Janny Wurts is incredibly wordy . True , her books are long ( my hardcover copy of this book runs to about 700 pages ) , yet in truth she challenges the reader to understand and visualize her well-crafted fantasy world , empathize with her complex characters , and follow the twists of her far-reaching plots.Peril 's Gate continues the tale of two half-brothers , Lysaer and Arithon , having drunk from a fountain which sustains life for 500 years , then held in thrall of a curse which binds them to enmity , as heirs to two royal lines they plunge the world of Athera into war . As a backdrop , the lands have been split for centuries - the ancient royal lines had been ousted from power , persecuted and hunted like wild animals by the narrow-minded townborn people , they become clans living in the wilds , forests and mountains . Through deceptive statesmanship , wholly in thrall by the curse , Lysaer rallies the townborn to destroy Arithon , who is supported by the clan lines . Worse , each brother has an inherent gift - Lysaer has the gift to summon light , Arithon that of darkness ... and as people naturally associate light with good , dark with evil , it takes little persuasion to convince others that Arithon is demonspawn , dubbed the Spinner of Darkness . Never mind that Arithon is Athera 's Masterbard , trained to mastery of magic , and sanctioned by the mysterious group of Sorcerers dedicated to the protection of Athera known as the Fellowship of Seven.In this latest installment , we see Arithon hounded on all sides by Lysaer and his allies , through harsh mountains in winter , until he finally seeks sanctuary in Kewar Tunnel , known as Davien 's Maze . This Maze is the gate to peril which the title refers to . It was created by a rogue member of the Fellowship of Seven , a Sorcerer of brilliant artistry , who had instigated the rebellion which overthrew the royal lines . For that act , he gained the title of Davien the Betrayer . The Maze is a complex series of tests , not the least of which is to examine the traveler 's guilty past and conscience . Each death caused by a person 's hand is experienced through the eyes of the victim , their widow , their children . No memory , no matter how far back in a person 's past , is exempt from blistering reexamination . Those who have trod the Maze before have been rendered mad with guilt , trapped in their minds by unending rings of compassion for their victims . This is the danger into which Arithon treads , fully aware that his ancestor died as a result of entering the Maze , and that upon his gifts as Masterbard , master of magic and shadow , and last heir of the High Kings , rests the possibility of healing the division between the townborn and clans , the return of the Paravians ( centaurs , unicorns and elves ) and the safety of all Athera against the wraiths which are crossing space to invade the world.I can not speak highly enough of Janny Wurts - her works put most authors to shame . Rather than clothing her characters in drab descriptions , she understands them , highlights their flaws and strengths . This Maze that she devised lets the reader truly understand the character of Arithon to dizzying depths . This then , is her strength , while she deftly weaves disparate plot threads with seeming ease , and brings the reader to understand the mythical fundamentals of spellcraft.I highly recommend this book .	1
I highly recommend this book . The story was fast-pasing , you 'll never get bored !	1
I 'd watched this movie so many times that I finally broke down and read the book ( even though I 'd had the book for a couple of years bought as a set from NBC - the videos , book and soundtrack ) . I 'd say the book is true to the movie . I suppose it would be since the authors ( Rusch & Wesley ) were probably commissioned to write it from the screenplay . I thought it humorous they changed Tony 's swamp song from `` A Whiter Shade of Pale '' to `` Dark Side of the Moon '' . A few other small changes . Nothing major.The movie is my `` work '' movie . I work from home ( selling books including lots of this one ) and like to have some background noise which usually turns out to be this movie . It 's the perfect workday length at about 7 hours and I do n't actually have to see the TV to know what 's going on . Like everyone else , I 've got it memorized . It 's also the perfect movie to watch if you have to stay home sick *cough , cough* . : - ) I 've noticed people wondering why they never wrote the other 5 books ( the editorial review above talks about 6 books ) . I 'm pretty sure those 6 books are referring to the other TV movies released by Hallmark about that time ( The Monkey King , Arabian Nights - both also written by the pseudonym Kathryn Wesley ) .BUT if you are looking for more stories about The 10th Kingdom , there are many fan writings available - some quite good even . Look up `` Culinary Disasters & Other Stories '' ( in the quotes ) for a list of about 40 stories .	1
A novelization of the vastly superior ( and just plain wonderful ) fantasy miniseries has all the benefits of a novelization : inner thoughts and added details ( for instance that Virigina 's mother was going to abort her ) . Though the book moves faster than the miniseries , it does leave some details out . At the end of the day , its just a fun read for fans that have seen the movie so many times they want to experience it in another way . Grade : B+	1
This book is a must read for those who want to improve there management skills . It gives good advice and examples . It is easy to follow and an encouragement to put into practice what they share . Whether you are starting out in management or have been doing it for awhile you will benefit from reading this book . It is n't too long so you can get the points they are making and easily use the information .	1
The one minute manager is a bit of an anachronism now ... when it was first published this book seemed simplistic - with recent research being published you 're going to find the notion of 'a minute here ' and 'a minute there ' is simply not enough for the needs and motivations of different staff . While the advice in this book is fine and you can only benefit by reading it do n't assume that this book has any real answers for real mangement issues . Any movement beyond docile staff who are satisfied with a one minute word of encouragement or 'feedback ' is beyond the depth of this book .	1
On one hand I really like the way this book gets right to the point without consuming lots of time . Too many books with a similar mission would spend 400 pages , but this one can be read in an hour.The brevity is a double-edged blade though , because the book falls short of fully explaining its concepts . It really touches on only three main approaches to management , but it does not provide anything in the way of examples or contingencies in case real life does not match the story.I am glad I read it but it is hard to say the book is worth the money . You really do not get much content for the price . Upon finishing the book , you 'll soon realize the need to buy more books from these authors to flesh out how to implement their suggestions .	1
I would just like to add my appreciation of the language that was used in this book . Andrew Taylow artfully combines the various styles of English speech used at the time , with the mix of historical and social conventions , and family and societal values . It 's quite an accomplishment , and this , as much as the engaging and progressively engrossing story , makes it shine - a reader 's joy and happiness . I experienced the audio book of this , read by Alex Jennings , and found it superbly satisfying . A real gem which took me away - luckily , for 16 CDs . As noted by others , not to worry one 's head over the title , which although not an afterthought , is not significant to the story in any crucially developmental way .	1
Laurie King is simply a great writer who makes settings and characters come alive . After consuming every one of Laurie King 's Mary Russell books ( beginning withThe Beekeeper 's Apprentice ) , as though I had an attack of the munchies at midnight and found a box of cookies stashed in the pantry -- I started on herKate Martinellibooks . I found this one , a solo book ( not in a series ) at the library , and grabbed it as thought it was the last Wii at the toy store.The beginning , I must admit , is hard slogging . Not because it 's poorly written ( King is among the authors who probably write interesting grocery shopping lists ) but because her main character is depressed , troubled , scared . She 's working to get out of the situation by rebuilding a house ( singlehandedly ) on an island she inherited , but if you 've had a bad week at work or an argument with your spouse , it 's difficult to read about Rae 's troubles too.It is , however , worth the effort . Rae rebuilds her life and sanity as she builds the house , and ( after that first bit ) the story is compelling , with interesting characters ... and man , this woman can bring words to life.One element that I did n't expect , yet which I appreciated grandly , is that Rae is a woodworker . Part of her solo activities includes creating beautiful things from wood . If you like woodworking *and* mysteries ( or at least good storytelling ) , you 'll really enjoy this book.I liked it . I did n't love Folly in the same way that I did her longer series , but I 'm glad I took the time to read it .	1
After reading about this time as & quot ; history & quot ; in Lynn 's Nightrunner Series , it was a pleasure to come back and see it happen in real-time.However , what was n't so fun was watching what the characters had to do to get the good we know is coming later . I found the end to be emotionally draining , in the same way that the movie Dead Ringers was . While I was n't actually shouting & quot ; no , please , do n't ... & quot ; at the characters , it was a near thing .	1
As with the title of this review , only one word describes this volume and it is outstanding . This book provides a huge collection of rarely seen photographs of not only the Allies , but also the German pilots who confronted them . The pictures are captioned with great detail and the fates of the planes , crews , and pilots are told as well.The narrative and the first person accounts are engaging and bring the events pictured to greater life for the reader . This is a book that I return to again and again despite years of owning it . I find something new that I missed nearly every time . The detail is rich and if you could only have one book regarding the Airwar over Germany , this would have to be it .	1
When I first read the title of the novel it somewhat surprised me . A devil and a miss this is what interested me reading the book and of course as it was paulo coelho 's novel so I was a bit sure when I was going to start reading this book that it would surely interest me.This book also relates some part of our life too . It shows that every person has a good and bad person in himself but we realise it only when we are into a situation and that bad person of us is seen . A very good novel as paulo coelho 's other novels are for self help.I would like to recommend this book to everyone .	1
AMAZING ! ! ! This is the second book in a trilogy . Start with the Bronze Horseman and then read Tatiana and Alexander . This is a MUST READ SERIES ! I am an avid reader and these are by far my favorite books . This book is heart wrenching and beautifully well written . FANTASTIC ! ! ! !	1
I enjoyed this book not so much as the first one and the 3rd one ... .still tied everything together ... I really enjoyed the history of all 3 books	1
I absolutely loved the beginning ! I enjoyed the flashbacks that give us more insight into Alexander 's story before he and Tatiana meet in the first book . Even though they are apart , I still enjoy the love story that is Tatiana and Alexander ! The middle left me frustrated . It tended to drag on and make me wonder what kind of love story would spend hundreds of pages on everything but ROMANCE . I seriously wanted to claw Tatiana 's eyes out every time she contemplated dropping her son off with the nearest stranger or putting a bullet through her head . If she even remotely believed that Alexander was dead , what reason did she have to live ? ? Apparently their son was not reason enough ? ? Once Tatiana snapped out of her `` woe is me '' mode towards the end , it was fantastic.Overall , I still enjoyed the story despite my issues with Tatiana 's character .	1
The three books ( & # 34 ; Tatianna & Alexander , Bronze Horseman and Summer Garden & # 34 ; ) cover the full life story of the heroine and hero.As this first book & # 34 ; Tatianna and Alexander & # 34 ; ends one is left feeling bereft , leading the readier to the 2nd book . I enjoyed them very much and appreciated the details of the characters thoughts and feelings . There is great joy , intense struggles for survival , deep sadness , sacrifice , loyalty , romance , sexy love scenes , and testing of the human spirit to overcome obstacles in life . The author did a good job of research into the history of the USSR , Germany , and USA military . The writing style was good , not as many typos as other Kindle books I 've read . I would recommend to a reader who enjoys historical and contemporary , romantic literature . I was left with the impression at the end of the 3rd book , that a grandchild had written these as the life-story of her grandparents .	1
The beautiful and flirtatious Arlena Stewart is holidaying in the South West Coast of England with her husband , Captain Marshall and her stepdaughter Linda , staying at the Jolly Roger Hotel on an exclusive island . There she carries out a not too discreet affair with the handsome Patrick Redfern , husband of poor quiet Christine Redfern . Amongst the hotel guests are an American couple , a retired priest , a longwinded army chap , a spinster , a female friend of Captain Marshall and Hercule Poirot.One bright sunny morning , Arlena is found dead , strangled at Pixy Cove . Hercule Poirot and the local police are called in to investigate the matter . Could the jealous husband have murdered her or perhaps it was the long suffering wife . Could it be that Arlena was blackmailed by some unscrupulous cad ? Could she have stumbled across a smuggling operation at the cove ? Hercule Poirot fits the pieces of the puzzle together . Amongst the clues are a pair of scissors found at the scene of the crime , pieces of a green calendar and wax in the fire grate in one of the guests rooms , an empty bottle thrown out of a window , the sound of bath water draining from a tub at midday.This is classic Agatha Christie at her best . The scene is set , the characters introduced , the clues planted . As always the reader wil be left wondering right up to the end of the book as to who comitted the crime . As with all Agatha Christie novels , there are as many twists and turn in the plot to keep you changing your mind as to the identity of the killer . Agatha Christie is always a joy to read and this is no exception.Lea Ling Tsang	1
Today I got Mark Mazower 's first book in Hebrew , a translation of this book I have in English.Two Quotations from the Paperback copy.p 12 `` By 1950 , when this book concludes , Salonica 's Muslims had been resettled in Turkey , and the Jews had been deported by the Germans and most of them killed . `` On the same page `` Similar transformations occurred in cities across a wide swathe of the globe - Lviv Wroslaw Vilna Tiflis , Jerusalem , Jaffa and Lahore ... '' ( I know live with Arabs in Jaffa . S.C. ) p 460 `` The Aftermath '' : `` For returning Jews the experience was a haunting one , Jacques Stroumsa was a young engineer who helped construct the Hirsch camp , and had survived Auschwitz , where his parents and his pregnant wife had been killed . After the war , unwilling to return home , he had left for good . When he eventually he came back for a brief visit , he spent hours sitting on his hotel balcony and looking out over the sea : 'I was smoking cigarette after cigarette for fear the tears would come . A Greek Orthodox friend found me alone around midnight and said : `` I understand you , Jacques , you do n't really know any more where to go in Salonica , the city where you once knew every stone . '' And that 's how it was. '' S.C . : Jacques was my fathers friend at school and Sorbonne in Paris . My father survived WW2 and saved most of the family by leaving Salonica for Athens and hiding there as Christians.But the book is the History of Salonica from 1430-1950 , not only WW2.WW1 and the Fire in Salonica in 1916.Very Good reading !	1
This is a great book . I love Agatha Christie . I 'm not complaining about the book or the writing . The text is way too small . I 'm hoping that in later editions of the book they actually use text that 's readable . I would love to read more of the Christie catalog of novels but I ca n't read text this small . I 'm a young guy in his late 20 's and I have trouble reading these . Please make the text big enough to read in later editions . I 've been seeing a taller paperback coming out in new books the last couple of years . There are about 4 or 5 Agatha Christies in this newer format . I 'm was hoping that they 'd print more in that format . I do n't buy books I ca n't read because the type is so small . I did n't buy this book because the type was too small . I went to the library and got it for free . I 'm sure you publishers are loosing a lot of sales from making the type so small . I know that me and my friends do n't buy books with the type so small . We 'll find other ways , like getting an older printing at the library or buying it used online for a couple bucks . THE TEXT IS TOO SMALL ON PAPERBACKS THESE DAYS . STOP BEING GREEDY AND PRINT A LEGIBLE TEXT . PEOPLE DO N'T BUY BOOKS WHEN YOU GET CHEAPO TO SAVE 20 pages ... they buy books they can actually read .	1
I gave this novel 5 stars because it was crafted so well . Believe it or not , I had never read any Agatha Christie novels . What a way to begin ! One of the reasons I loved it so much is that the information presented allowed me to put my mind to work . Throughout the novel I suspected everyone from Hercule Poirot himself to Judith Hastings to Dr. Franklin . I wo n't ruin the ending , but the situation that Hercule Poirot reveals was so shocking that my mouth dropped almost to the floor ! I ca n't wait to read more Agatha Christie novels .	1
take everything i say after this sentence with the following thought in mind : agathie christie is brilliant and talented , her work , for what it is , seamless.problems i had with this book : dragged along for a large portion of the book , many/most her clues were totally obscure , buried , often miniscule and even ambiguous , the characters were , as usual ( it 's my second christie book ) shallow , the message was little or no redemptive value , and ... and : i guess here 's my big thing i think reading agatha christie ... that she wants to confound and even abuse the reader , trick him or her into feeling stupid and frustrated and unintelligent , so that she can prove , in the end , just how brilliant and clever she is . and what i think she 's really unconsciously attempting to do is prove to her parents that she really is a good little girl , and clever , and smart , and i suspect she in some way was abused , neglected or overlooked in some way by her own parents ... and she takes it out on her audience ... in a just loving enough way to keep them hooked , in the same way , incidentally , that poirot abuses hastings ... but keeps him hooked with a few crumbs of love.for those of you who have read christie 's autobiography , you 'll know better than i do if i 'm right or wrong , but i 'll be reading it soon to find out for myself . in the meantime , i 'll bet money i 'm right .	1
This is Hercole Poirot 's saddest , finest hour . Comparisions to Othello abound . The plot is incredibley detailed ... It will break your heart .	1
This is Hercule Poirot 's last case and is a fitting climax to the wonderful series by Agatha Christie . Poirot has invited his dear friend Hastings to return to Styles where the detective solved his first case . He is concerned that a murderer is staying in Styles and that he will soon strike again , as he has five times previously . He knows the murderer 's identity but will not reveal it to Hastings , and says he is counting on his old friend to help him prevent any further deaths . That hope is dashed when not one , but two murders occur and an accident almost takes the life of a third victim . Christie 's plot is razor-sharp as befits the last book of this series and old and new fans will be captivated by this wonderful book .	1
This was better than any sci fi book or any other fantasy books I 've read.This was also better then those stupid 1930 's books that our 7th grade literature teacher says & quot ; You need to read tese books by Monday. & quot ; I did n't read those books.I got to the 2nd chapter before throwing them away.These books , however , made me want to read it until the end.What 's great about it was the words used in those years which make the books great fantasy.It starts with Bilbo Baggins , who was fooled into going into an adventure with Gandalf , the wizard.On that adventure , he finds the One Ring , which Sauron , The Dark Lord , used for evil purposes.The Lord Of the rings contiues that story 60 years later , when Frodo Baggins , Bilbo 's heir , recieves the ring.Then , when he finds out its dark secret , he has to destroy it in Sauron 's lair , Mordor.This book is for everyone.This would 've been better if it was The Simariliion , The Hobbit , and The Lord Of The Rings , but then I would 've had a heart attack.Great for any read !	1
What can one say that has n't already been said about the most epic battle of good vs. evil ? Immortalized for the generations to come , Lord Of The Rings is amusing , amazing , fun , scary and suspenseful and surely the work of a master writer . The characters are alive , the events real and the landcape ever so uniquely convincing.Perhaps , for once , the legend lives up to its reputation.Never before has the choice of the best work in a given genre been such an easy and universal win .	1
I read this book after seeing the first movie . It is extremely well written , thorough storytelling . The adventures in this book are at least as exciting-if not more than-the first movie . ( I say movie because I did not read the first book yet , I only saw the movie . ) The characters become more interesting , more three dimensional in this second book . And the settings are spectacular . I was moved to draw several of the places mentioned in this book . I found myself wishing to visit an Ent-hall , to explore beautiful hidden caverns , to look out upon an ancient city . Absolutely worth the read .	1
This is the first edition of Lord of the Rings to contain many features that Tolkien had hoped for from the beginning : specifically it not only has the fold-out maps that were always part of the three volume hardcover editions , but the `` fire letters '' on the ring are printed in red ink and the color facsimiles of the leaves from the Book of Marzabul are included in the book , both for the first time . Numerous `` deluxe '' editions of the book have been printed over the last 30 years or so , with a variety of bells and whistles ( I own five or six in that category ) , but none of them have fulfilled this simple and well-documented wish of the author.As for the quality control question : no the physical book is n't perfect ; the craft of book making is not what it was 50 years ago . But though the list price may be $ 100 , I have n't seen it for sale anywhere for much more than $ 50 , which is about what you would probably pay for the three volume hardcover . I am delighted with it .	1
This is a simply amazing book that holds on to you and the deeper you get into it , the harder it gets to put it down . Tolkien is awesome in depicting a plethora of characters in such a vivid way.I had to read this book because I missed on so many characters in the movie . Its so hard to show such a grand piece of work in a couple of movies . Now , after I have got such an insight into this amazing world of middle earth , I ca n't stop myself from watching the movie again ! Go dip yourself in this pleasure trip and ride along with these amazing characters .	1
This review is of the Kindle edition only . There are more than enough reviews of the book itself , and I think telling you all that I have read the trilogy at least half a dozen times will be enough to let you know what I think of it . The only thing I will add is that if you loved the book , consider getting & # 34 ; The Silmarillion & # 34 ; . It 's not an easy read , but it is incredibly rich with the 'history ' of Arda from the beginning to just before the War of the Rings.The kindle version is very good , as far as kindle versions go , and the latest price of $ 10.00 is pretty much a steal . The index is correct , and I believe the corrections are all up to date . For anyone who is interested , look up 'Lord of the Rings edits ' in your search engine of choice to see the many , many years of errors and corrections that JRR and later his son Christopher went through to get to the final edition . The next best version of the Trilogy I know of is the illustrated edition , and that will set you back about $ 90.00 or so .	1
Slip cased and leather bound , this version contains all three of the Lord of the Rings tales . As translated from the runes in the book , this is the Red Book , retelling the tale of Bilbo Baggins and Sam Gamgee . The leather is beautifully embossed and colored in jewel tones . This is a worthwhile addition to your library .	1
Just got yesterday and unwrapped to find the most beautiful coloration on this printing . Have the original first set with the drab and navy coloring . My husband was truly shocked at how gorgeous this box set was and very happy to receive ahead of time . This quality and price are unbeatable and it is unmistakenly beautiful and well made .	1
This is the best book in the WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD ! ! ! ( i say this with emphesis ! ) I wish i was there , this is soo adventurous ! Its so exciting with all of the detail . If there is ever a book that you would order online i would recomend that it would be this book ! Please take the time to read these phonemoial masterpieces !	1
It is a good book . I like all go them . They are fun and interesting . I have it on my kindle so I can read it anywhere	1
This is a great Kindle book . It gives you the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy in one volume on your Kindle . Now I know that since we are talking about an e-book that should n't matter but it does to me and I am very happy with it.We are talking about a classic Tolkien book here , probably his most well known , and the presentation in this one volume edition is excellent , very worth while and keeping it in the cloud allows me to access it from my Kindle , my computer or my smart phone and have it automatically remember where I was in the book when I last set it down.If you are a fan of fantasy literature you can not go wrong with Tolkien and especially this book .	1
Absolutely love this book whether it is in 1 volume or 3 . An absolutely great book that I try to reread every few years .	1
This work is far more than a fantasy novel , it is the creation of a virtual world , very much like ours , yet peopled with strange races and heroic quests.Tolkien 's universe is very real ; this is beacuase he has gone to tremendous lengths to write its history , complete with its creation myths , lost civilizations , and folklore.I read this work many times when I was young , and the lessons it taught me about honor , friendship , right and wrong , courage , and life itself have stayed with me throughout my life.The story itself forms a bridge between Tolkien 's children 's story , the Hobbit , and his works of mythology ( The Silmarillion ) . The story is about a heroic quest in which an unlikely hero , Frodo Baggins , a hobbit , is called upon to challenge the very Dark Lord himself , Sauron , in completing a quest to destroy a magical gold ring that would give Sauron domination of the world . Frodo is assisted by a cast of characters including the great wizard Gandalf , who undergoes a death an resurrection in the course of the quest ; an outcast king named Aragorn who regains his kingdom ; his faitful servant Sam ; and other hobbits , elves , dwarves , and men who stand against the Dark Lord in challenges that take place both on a personal level and on the field of battle.It is a world of remarkable beauty , told by a master storyteller who also happened to be an Oxford professor of languages . This is no amateur tale , but a profound work of myth and literature .	1
I read this in 1968 in grad school , not as charmed as most people are , but to have it in great shape for my husband who likes to read a paperback in bed is very much welcome . No more broken spines and loose pages floating around !	1
My dad swears he read these books to me as a child . Although I have no recollection of this , the stories have always been there in my consciousnes , without explanation . Obviously , they made their mark . Now with the Super-Sized Lord of the Rings Fever at full tilt , I decided to read them all by myself.I have to say that the Fellowship of the Ring starts very slowly . Almost painfully so . If you saw the movie , then the 10 minutes or so of scenes from the Shire in the film correspond to about 150 pages of the book . When things do pick up , it becomes very interesting . You wo n't come across this level of vividness in many current novels . You may get to feeling like you know middle earth more intimately than you know your own neighborhood . It 's a bit of a commitment , but it pays off.The Two Towers is more action packed and scary than the Fellowship , and is probably the best of the bunch . It is full of intrigue and wild characters who really pull you in deeply . You will feel more emotions reading this one than the other two combined . It 's basically the climax of the series.The Return of the King is surprisingly short and unceremonious considering all the buildup in the Two Towers . It 's actually sort of a letdown , as it climaxes to soon and peeters out at the end.I do n't want to ruin any plot points for anyone who does n't know the plot already , but I will say that the movies most likely wo n't be able to cover as much ground with as much depth as the books do . What else is new ? It 's just that you 're talking about some really involved books when three 3 1/2 hour movies feel incomplete by comparison.I definitely recommend the Lord of the Rings to anyone who loves a good story .	1
I remember reading these books when I was 7 or 8 years old , and finally , in my adult years decided to buy them and read them to my kids . This is a must have series .	1
J.R.R . Tolkien 's Middle-earth encompassed in The Silmarillion , The Children of Hurin , the Hobbit , and the Lord of the Rings can only be described as one of the greatest legends in history . Tolkien can not fairly be likened to a modern author , but indeed unto Homer , Virgil , and Shahrazad .	1
I 'm writing this specifically about the boxed set with ISBN 0547928181 , published by Mariner Books ( a division of Houghton Mifflin ) in September 2012 . And I 'm writing this because when I was trying to decide if I wanted to order this set , I could not find any reviews that specifically discussed the set . So if you are in the market for this particular set , here is some information about it.Mariner describes this as a deluxe set . One thing that makes it deluxe is that the cover images , which are , as it says on the back of each book in fine print , by J.R.R . Tolkien , are embossed , as are the titles and Tolkien 's name . This gives them a very classy look and feel.There is no indication on any copyright pages or anywhere else in this set that the paper on which these books are printed is acid free or designed for permanence , so my guess is that the paper will eventually start to yellow though I can not guess as to how many years that might take . I think a truly deluxe boxed set would contain books printed on the same kind of permanent paper on which academic books are often printed . At least the paper is sufficiently opaque that I can not see text on the opposite side of the page I 'm reading.The books are 8 1/4 '' x 5 1/2 '' . Different font sizes are used for the main body of the text in The Hobbit and in the three volumes of LOTR . The font size in The Hobbit is larger and has 37 lines per page ( on those pages that are filled with text ) . There are 42 lines per page in each LOTR volume . Given my eyesight I wish they all had the larger font size of The Hobbit , but the font size in the LOTR volumes is okay.The numbering for the 3 LOTR volumes is consecutive throughout the volumes , meaning that Fellowship begins on page 21 ( following a note on the text , foreword to the second edition , and prologue ) , Two Towers begins on page 403 , and Return of the King starts on page 731 ( and ends on page 1008 , after which there are another 100 or so pages of appendixes , an index and maps ) .I first read The Hobbit and LOTR in the sixties in the mass paperback versions published by Ballantine with cover illustrations by Barbara Remington . ( There is a neat site titled `` The Middle Earth Illustrators J.R.R . Tolkien Loved -- and the Ones He Abhorred . '' Tolkien told a publisher that he thought Remington 's cover illustration for The Hobbit was ugly . ) When I recently decided that it was time to reread them ( and so far I 've only seen the first of the LOTR movies and I 've yet to see The Hobbit ) , I considered getting a LOTR volume that had all the books in one , but after checking one out in a store I decided it would be more comfortable to hold them for reading if they were in separate volumes . Plus I wanted The Hobbit ( which I plan to start reading aloud to my grandchildren ) and I could n't resist that Tolkien 's designs were on the covers ( I 'm an artist and illustrator and cover art is important to me ) .Each of the volumes that come in the boxed set are available separately ( i.e. , the exact same books minus the box ) . The box itself is attractive and seems fairly sturdy.There are notes in The Hobbit in this set and in Fellowship regarding the corrected text . The notes in The Hobbit are dated 2001 and 1993 in Fellowship , and I assume that if corrections have been made to the text of these books since those dates , these corrections are not reflected in the books in this set.There are two maps and 8 other illustrations , all in black and white , in The Hobbit.That 's it for what I can tell you about this particular boxed set of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings . I will now add a comment about why I decided to reread these great books.I started to read The Game of Thrones ( before I saw the first episode of the TV series , and in fact , before I even knew there was a series ) . It 's author , George R. R. Martin , is often compared to Tolkien or at least his series of novels , A Song of Fire and Ice , of which Thrones is the first , is often compared to LOTR ( and I just now realized that he and Tolkien share the same middle initials ) . And based on what I 've read of Thrones so far I think the comparison is deserved . But reading Thrones made me want to go back to Tolkien ( though I plan to continue reading Thrones as well as to watch the series ) .Last night I listened to a streaming radio interview with `` The Tolkien Professor , '' Corey Olsen , author of Exploring J.R.R . Tolkien 's `` The Hobbit . '' He expressed his admiration for Martin and Martin 's Song novels , but said that although Martin 's Song novels set out to be darker and grittier than Tolkien 's novels , and take place in a morally ambiguous world as opposed to Tolkien 's world where there is absolute good and absolute evil , the kind of fantasy of which a A Song of Fire and Ice is an example , is derivative of Tolkien albeit in a `` reversed way . `` That 's what I began to sense as was reading Thrones and that is what made me want to go back to Tolkien . I did n't know then that Tolkien had once said that , `` The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work ; unconsciously so at first , but consciously in the revision . `` Tolkien , I just recently learned , was a lifelong devout Roman Catholic who believed that the story of Jesus Christ is a `` true myth '' ( and in fact C.S . Lewis attributed Tolkien 's sharing this concept with him to Lewis 's conversion to Christianity ) . There is something universal in the kinds of values reflected in The Hobbit and LOTR , and something higher and uplifting in the worldview that shines through these great works . One need n't be religious or have any particular kind of religious beliefs to appreciate this.Anyway , I think it was a partly unconscious desire to once again partake of that wholesome , ethical and ultimately uplifting worldview that made me want to dive back into Tolkien 's novels . And it 's because these books are so special that I wanted to buy a special set as opposed to mass market paperbacks and/or a version that has advertising for the movies all over the covers ( though the cover of The Hobbit in this box set does have the words `` Now a Major Motion Picture '' below the title ) .The bottom line is that if you want a nice quality boxed set of trade paperbacks of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , this particular boxed set should fill the bill .	1
For its 50th anniversary The Lord of the Rings has at last been produced in an edition worthy of the beauty of its contents . For the first time , J.R.R . Tolkien 's masterpiece has received the treatment due to its classic status : leather binding , gilded edges , fine paper , everything the finest literary works should be accorded but are rarely given.J.R.R . Tolkien was never very happy with the publishing treatment given to The Lord of the Rings . He was obliged to leave out the pages of the dwarf history found in the Chamber of Mazarbul in Moria when the publishing technology of the mid 1950s was n't able to accomodate his painstaking production . He was never pleased with the arbitrary division of the book into three volumes , and much of the artwork , particularly that of the first American paperback editions , pained him deeply . Now at last we can feel that he would pick up this edition and smile.For this edition Tolkien 's son Christopher has carefully prepared the text so as to eliminate many typographical and other errors which had crept in over the years . Noted Tolkien scholars Wayne Hammond , Christina Scull , and Douglas Anderson have contributed forewards to explain some of the history of these revisions . This edition will truly become the Standard Edition of The Lord of the Rings.This edition of The Lord of the Rings is worthy to be read in Middle earth itself . As I hold it in my hands , I can imagine reading it sitting by an open round window in Bag End , or in the Hall of Fire in Rivendell , or on a flet in Lothlorien or a tower in Minas Tirith . Any edition of The Lord of the Rings will introduce you to Tolkien 's world . Only this one will do so in a manner worthy of the genius of its creator .	1
WHAT ? HOW MANY WORDS DO YOU NEED TO FIND OUT I READ THE BOOK AND REALLY LIKED THE WHOLE SERIES ONE OF MY FAVORITS	1
The second part of Tolkiens trilogy is perhaps the most encompassing and captivating . It is a true symbol of Imagination , colors , fantastic characters and epic Battles.It is not easy to forget the slimy Gollum or the Touching devotion Sam showes his Master at the End of the Book.Unlike the other two Novels this one does not suffer from a lack of supense , nor is it in anyway overexaggerated . Through ceartain part one truly imagines he can hear the pages breathing . A true classic and an epic symbol of Moralistic Fantasy which in many ways surpasses the recent Movie .	1
Every one knows this story so nothing more need be said about the tale , but the style is impressive . Tolkiens careful choice of words adds an extra dimension to the tale ; consider where Boromir says & # 34 ; no one leaves Lothlorien unharmed & # 34 ; , but Gandalf says & # 34 ; say rather unscathed & # 34 ; - a subtle but very different meaning . The whole book is filled with these carefully chosen words and phrases which sometimes creates the necessity for the reader to reread a passage to be sure of its meaning . This is a book that immerses the reader in the world of Middle Earth . As an adjunct to the last statement , this used to be called the hippies bible back in the 60 's .	1
I first read these books when I was in high school and have read them at least once every year since . They are so rich , so moving that I 'm always finding something else to appreciate about them . If you have never read these books before , I highly recommend you give them a chance -- even if you do n't normally read fantasy . Although these books are not what I would consider an easy read , I promise that you wo n't regret it if you give them your time and attention . The first time I read them , I have to admit that I skipped the long passages of elfish poetry , and even skipped ahead at the beginning of The Return of the King to see what happens to Sam and Frodo . Do n't worry if you are tempted to do this -- just keep reading . You will be rewarded ! Do n't let yourself get bogged down in the first 100 pages of the Fellowship of the Ring . I promise you that the story gets absolutely gripping after that and contains some of the most remarkable passages of action you 'll ever read.If you want to do something different , try reading it out loud with a friend . I recently read the entire trilogy out loud to my husband while he did the dishes each evening . Tolkien is very gifted at crafting dialogue , and some of the passages are quite striking .	1
Let 's see , I could pay $ 21 to get each of the 3 volumes ( Fellowship , Two Towers , and Return of the King ) separately , or I could pay $ 10 to get it all as one volume . Since I like to read the whole thing , and not just randomly re-read one third of it , it makes sense that it is all togehter . The book itself is fantastic . Tolkien had created a whole world , and the way he set this epic story in that world gave the readers the sense of that . Even though they did n't know all the details of that world or history .	1
I bought this for my 28 year old daughter in Hawaii . She raved . Loves it . Loves having all the volumes in 1 .	1
I do not own a kindle , i just use the app on my phone and may start using it on my computer ( s ) . The Lord of the Rings is a great book to start out a kindle ebook collection . If you get sucked into the world that Tolkien has created , you will want to come back to your favorite passages again and again . And unlike a cumbersome book ( or three , depending on how you bought the story ) , this is very easy to search and book mark and add notation ( or tags for searching ) . It will get you using some of kindle 's more advanced features and it will increase your satisfaction as you can quickly bounce between appendices and the main story.Even if you have a physical copy , any fan would do well to pick up this fabulous digital edition .	1
Thank goodness the book ( still better than the movie ) is as good as I remeber , The only reason I gave it 4 was shipping by the seller was slow.I just wish they had followed the book when they made the movie . I had the first edition when it came to USA but after reading and rereading it fell apart . Need I say more	1
I 'm really enjoying reading the books.. I can almost see the Movie as I read the books ... . Thanks ... .I will be looking for more great deals..	1
This is by far the best edition of LOTR ever published . I bought it off of Amazon , and it is just amazing ! I have never seen a book that looks better than this one ! You must buy it .	1
The final part in the three part Lord of the Rings , the Return of the King finds our heroes in a tight fix . The forces of Darkness are on the march : Frodo is captive in Mordor , Gondor is under siege , and the remainder of the fellowship , lead by Aragorn , is missing . In other words , things are n't looking good.The plot , once again , is masterful . You ca n't get any better than a story conceived by a professor of English Literature at Oxford . Tolkien is a wordsmith equal to the best of them . However , he does n't take three pages to say something which can be said in a paragraph . There 's something to be said for brevity.The characters have been maturing throughout the novel , and the third part is no different . Frodo is coming into his own , as are the remaining Hobbits . The question is , will they be able to step forward and do something epic in nature ? ? ? I loved the way Tolkien wrapped it all up , and the appendicies are a treasure trove of information on what happens afterwards , what happened before , etc ... Honestly , when I finished this book way back in high school I had a tear in my eyes . Very good stuff . This type of novel comes along once in a lifetime , if that often .	1
As with the Fellowship , this is a really terrific book . Mr. Inglis has the perfect voice for these readings ( referring to the whole series ) . Highly recommend to other fans .	1
This is a dunting tome but it is filled with many revelations.I always wanted to know where the other peoples of Europe came from ; the ones who were n't Greek or Roman.When Caesar invaded Britain , who was he trying to beat up ? I now know who they weren't.Who built Stonehenge . Here the book is less definitive , but does endeavor to tell you what actually can be discerned.Good points : Very readable and experienced writerBad points : I wish it had maps , but I knew it did n't when I purchasesd it.Overall , if you like Archaeology and don.t mind digging in , you 'll enjoy this book .	1
I highly recommend this book to any fan of Ray Bradbury 's work , or to anyone who wishes to introduce his classic works into their library . He is a passionate visionary that writes not only about sci-fi , but his colorful writing style encapsulates the sometimes ineffable feelings that each and every one of us have had about every possible situation in life , and dare I say , in death . I always feel like a kid again when I read his books , I am taken away to warm , sunny Saturdays when I was still in awe of the newness of life . I can hardly force myself to read the works of others as I am convinced that no one can do with words the magic that Ray Bradbury has done .	1
I recently read this because I just got my first tattoo and I had seen the movie when it was released in 1976 . There are several other short stories here which are easy reads , Science Fiction , lots of space travel ... back to the title story , I will see the movie again .	1
This was my first Bradbury book and it made me a fan . I truly enjoyed the way this series of stories is presented through the tattoos of a stranger . All the stories are very creative and keep your interest throughout the book . A work of extreme greatness to say the least . It merits the title of a 'Classic ' .	1
It is possible that you have read something about this battle ( Kohima ) , but , for sure , you have never find such a complete book about this subject , indeed for every person , Japanese or English , that played a role in this battle , the author reconstructs all his/her life to explain why he/she took a certain decision during the battle.What has really shocked me about this campaign in Birmania on 1944 , it is how the Japanese Command could have decided to start an offensive into the jungle , crossing some mountains , sending no supplies with the expeditionary corp , but hoping to feed the soldiers with the supply captured from the english army ! Anyway this is what happened and the Japanese soldiers starved to death.The book is written with a very lively style as if the author would have been with the troops involved in the fightings.The siege is told with the help of a lot of first hand accounts and of very detailed maps.If you are passionate about the war in Birmania or in the Pacific , this is a book that you ca n't miss .	1
This book is excellent for Endometriosis sufferers who want to learn how to manage the disease through diet and a holistic approach . Very informative , a must have !	1
This is one of the most read mystery books of all time , Agatha Christie was really a master at setting up multiple chracters and threading them through an interesting plot , leaving you until the very end to find out what really happened . She is a pretty succinct writer , so even though some stuff may be predictable , its not boring , because you 're always being moved to the next scene . This book is a must read for any serious mystery reader .	1
I 'd read virtually zilch mystery novels prior to this one , but found it most enjoyable . It contains a twisted nod to justice , lots of interesting dialogue , and an ending that could easily leave you hanging , but does not . There are several plausible scenarios as to `` who-done-it '' that will flicker through your mind while reading , but in the end you may find you were more astutely aware of the most plausible than you thought . So definitely give figuring out the mystery a try ; and oh yeah , I 've given just an itty , bitty hint in this review ; )	1
I love Agatha Christie and I am never disappointed in her . I love her movies and books ! You can never go wrong with Agatha ! : )	1
felt i was a fly on the wall . this waz my first from the author and i truly enjoyed it and the characters	1
There was a time when I loved to read Agatha Chistie . In those times her books meant everything to me , and I almost did n't read another author . In one year , I read 67 of her books . And believe me , among these 67 , AN THEN THERE WERE NONE is the best one.The plot is one of those you do n't find anymore on detective books . Ten people that do n't know each other hide something terrible of their past . They are invited to spend sometime at a man 's house - a man that no one know . And suddenly , one by one , they are murdered in a very suspicious sometimes , sometimes terrible and bloody way . Most of all , the ending is one of the best I 've ever read . Agatha Christie was really a wonderful writer . Her books will certainly remain forever , since she is the Shakespeare of detective fiction . And this book is for sure her best work . If you have n't read that one yet and you enjoy Agatha 's books , hurry up and take that one ! Marco Aurelio .	1
This is the first book that I read of Agatha Christie and I thought that it was great . A story of ten people who have questionable backgrounds that are asked to join a Mr. U.N. Owen on a island for an unforgettable time . From start to finish this book is a good read . I really liked Agatha Christies writing style and am looking forward to reading another of her many books .	1
This is Christie with some existential substance . Ten people on an island , each with a morally ambiguous past , watch in mounting terror as they dwindle one by one . And then there were none . While it borders on silly at times -- and that 's to be expected of the genre -- it grips and does n't let go until the very end .	1
I have always heard that this was a great book so I went down to my school 's library and checked it out . The librarian confirmed the reports I had heard about the book being good . I sat down and read and read and read and it was great ! I have always loved mystery novels . I began reading mystery novels with The Cat Who ... series by Lillian Jackson Braun ( yes even big , tough , male , 17 year old , high-school seniors can love books about mystery solving felines ) and I used to only read mysteries . This book reminds me of why I love mysteries so much . I could n't figure out whodunnit !	1
There is no doubt about it , Richard Holmes was a splendid writer and has written a splendid book.Having read some works on the Napoleonic Wars I was unprepared to have the preconcieved nuances of my views on Wellington to be quite so challenged . I had carried the simplistic and certainly conventional thought that the Duke was really just an rather efficient logistician , who fought his war largely by calculating the odds and through exceptional organisation - all rather dull . At a personal level , it was n't so much his affairs but the offhand treatment of his wife which one found a little challenging . Finally , reading about his political life , I had also found his `` high '' Tory views somewhat constricted . In short , I thought him a very able general , although a somewhat unlikeable individual.However , in 300 or so pages , Mr. Holmes has caused me to go back to my book shelves once again and reconsider my somewhat naive views . There are a number of thoughts I took away from this book , but perhaps the most worthy of consideration may be the following:1 ) Wellington clearly was more than a great general in the context of the Penisular ; He has to be considered a great general for the ages . It is said that he was a defensive , unimaginative and somewhat uninspirational leader - none of this can be true in the context of his outstanding military achievements in both India and the Penisular . Mr. Holmes does well to bring out the strengths which made him the genius he was and hopefully this goes some way to correcting two centuries of negative propaganda around his generalship . I particularly like Mr. Holmes ' even-handed approach when dealing with controversies , particularly Badajoz ( where it seems apparent he lost control of his troops ) and Waterloo ( where he was conflicted with national imperatives and the need to support his allies ) .2 ) Touching on his personal life , I am glad Mr. Holmes did not feel the need to go into prurient details , but it was evident that Wellington had an unhappy marriage . How he coped with this seems to have at least involved discretion but what I think brought his humanity to the fore was his observations following his wife 's death . Sadly , it also seems clear that his relationships with his children seemed somewhat poor - perhaps , to paraphrase Douro , because they all hard a terrifically hard act to follow . Beyond his family though , there does seem to be strong evidence that he was in fact warm hearted and generous behind the public facade.3 ) As to his politics he comes across as man of the times working in a framework of principles , but at least did have the flexibility of mind to shift his position on various issues . His political career was not stellar in any real sense , but I think it hard to see his goverment service as anything but a good man trying , by his lights , to do what was right for the country and his monarch.In short , no review of mine can do justice to this excellent biography , but I just would have liked to thank Mr. Holmes for vividly showing the Duke to be a much more complex , gifited , humane , interesting and , ( dare I say it since Holmes himself may not have agreed ) , likeable man than I had previously understood to be the case .	1
this is a great biography , but does n't revealed the politics of the voictorian age , is a minus of it.the former of a caracter is well described , because the India experience , the caracter is showed in wide mirror , not the same with the inside life , but we can understand the powerfull personality of `` The Duke '' .	1
This book is a comprehensive resource of herbs and plants from which essential oils are made . It describes the plants , their properties , traditional uses , and cautions . Impressive , although I would have liked it if they 'd included color photos of each plant discussed .	1
Philippa Gregory writes wonderful historical fiction.Hannah Green is a wonderful , complex young woman who is caught between childhood and adulthood , Christianity and Judaism , her desires and what she feels is her duty , and between life as a commoner and life at the court of Mary I and Elizabeth , in the role of fool . This is an excellent ficitional account , from the perspective of Hannah Greene , an adolescent girl , blessed with `` the sight '' . Her relationship with Mary , Elizabeth , Robert Dudley and Daniel , her betrothed , were all fascinating to read about.I would also recommend reading `` The Other Boleyn Girl '' ... which was an excellent book .	1
I like historical fiction , and this book did not disappoint . An easy read ( again , if you are a fan of the period ) , with good context illustrating some of the prevalent attitudes towards gender and religion from the time . Also good references to the historical characters from her other novels .	1
Philippa Gregory 's books are always well researched . She takes you back in time and gives a glimpse of what it was like to be that particular person.One can almost smell the country and see it as it was back then . Sometimes one can hear the sounds if you listen carefully enough ! Definitely worth the read !	1
Another great historically correct novel from an excellent story-teller.It keeps you wanting more.Her development of both the story and the characters is fantastic .	1
This book was a real attention grabber . I could n't put it down once I started it . You learn a lot about Mary and more about Elizabeth . Hannah the fool was actually a real fixture in this time . I 'm not how major a role she played in the history of this family but other books mention her and she did affect other important people 's lives in this time . It 's got scandal and tragedy . I recommend it !	1
I enjoyed reading this book . The plot was good . An excellent historical fiction .	1
This is young adult fiction ay it 's finest . Harry Potter eat your heart out . A fantasy world to rival Wonderland . All the things that go bump in the night and beautiful exotic creatures of the light .	1
Clive Barker 's `` Abarat '' is a wonderful story about a young girl , Candy Quakenbush , who would rather be somewhere else but home . She enters a field and finds she is no longer in her home town , but is transported to the Abarat.Once she is there , she finds a strange world where evil forces are already after her . On her way , she meets a host of strange characters , some of whom are very interesting , and others which are simply too bizarre to be taken seriously.The only real flaw with Abarat is that the stakes are not very high . Yes , Candy is sought after by the evil Lord Carrion , but neither character is developed enough for us to care about them too much . Granted , this is the first book in a series and Barker apparently did not want to show us everything in Book 1 , but I did not feel the tension of the Harry Potter books here.Barker 's imagination is incredibly fertile and the paintings he includes in this work are worth the price of the book alone . The painting of the Abarat itself is marvelous ! Overall , Abarat is a good book and recommended .	1
This is a book to savor . It is to be read slowly and maybe with a notepad handy . I learned so much from reading about the pioneers of the Romantic Generation .	1
Brilliant job -- a great topic , excellent writing , everything you want in a book . Do n't be set off by the length . It is an easy read.I am fascinated by the history of science and technology . This book is a must for those interested in a broad overview of the time period covered . Davy , those wonderful and crazy fellows with air balloons , the voyages to the Pacific to explore ... .and so on . A real delight is how the author eemplifies what CP Snow alluded to as two cultures -- -science and the humanities . In this book they find one another . There 's even some hints of sex ... scientists and sex -- what a tease ! Just as important as its relevancy is the writing . This is a gifted author . His writing flows effortless , it is punctuated with pithy observations ( e.g. , the author must have had a great time visiting the homes and neighborhoods of many of the main characters -- how poignant that most are still there but not even celebrated for what happened there ) .The book made me wish that we might still have individual greatness in the sciences , that we had something akin to a singular scientific academy like the one that existed in those days . Perhaps a hundred years from now humans will be able to recognize , like this author , the important social , literary , and scientific currents that flow through today . I hope so .	1
I picked up this book almost at random , drawn by the unique cover art . I almost put it back down , until I saw that Michael Chabon had won the Pulitzer prize for fiction in a recent year . I figured anything by a Pulitzer winner was worth the time to read.I was not disappointed . I was sucked into the world of Sitka , Alaska so thoroughly I had to remind myself frequently this was a piece of `` alternate history . '' I have rarely seen such vivid characters brought to life , living their lives against such vibrant backgrounds of blended fantasy and reality.This book reminded me why I write fiction , and Michael Chabon has given me a new standard to aspire to . If you have the chance to read `` The Yiddish Policeman 's Union , '' do so without hesitation !	1
This is a very unusual book ! I opened this book with the author 's Pulitzer-Prize winning book ( The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay ) in mind , and immediately started to bog down . This book is n't much like that one ( points to the author for wanting to break new ground with his fiction ) , and I had the sinking feeling that I 'd be in for a lot of boring descriptions of chess . ( Thank God that did n't turn out to be the case . ) Plus , there 's more un-italicized Yiddish words peppering every page than you can shake a stick at , and there 's no glossary . So unless you 're a 80 year-old European rabbi , you 'll probably have to cruise along , absorbing the gist of each Yiddish word from its context . Fortunately , Chabon is such a fine writer that you can adjust to this easily enough.Our hero Landsman is a washed-up detective who lives in a crummy hotel . His marriage broke up a few years back , his sister died while piloting her small plane , and he may soon have no home . In this alternate-history world , Alaska rather than Israel became the temporary safe haven for the world 's Jews after the Holocaust . Now Alaska is set to revert back to American control , and for reasons I never quite understood , the Jews of Alaska may be homeless once more.Landsman has a more immediate problem to worry about : when he 's called to a crime scene in the very hotel where he lives , he realizes that someone murdered a fellow resident . He takes this personally though he did n't know the man . His ex-wife , now his supervisor , warns him off the case . The police precinct in general is supposed to dump unsolvable cases and tidy up before everyone bails out of Alaska . But Landsman launches a secret investigation with his long-suffering partner . This leads him to the mysterious closed society of the `` black hats '' ( Hasidic Jews who , in this alternate reality , personify organized crime ) . The murder victim turns out to be more important than they initially thought.Problems I had with this book : ( 1 ) the relative slowness of the beginning ( unavoidable given the complex world-building that Chabon has to convey ) . By the time you meet the black-hats , the story starts cranking along at a good pace . ( 2 ) the abrupt and somewhat unhinged way that the ending came together . You may get there as I did and get fed the explanation that Landsman receives , and think , `` All this was a plan to do WHAT ? '' It 's a little unbelievable.Things I liked about the book : ( 1 ) the world-building . This version of Alaska is very poignant when you consider the fact that Yiddish , known to be a tremendously flexible and expressive language that was preferred by countless scholars and literary luminaries including Isaac Bashevis Singer , is hovering on the brink of extinction these days . In Chabon 's Alaska , which is wet and cold and gloomy , the culture is European and the main language is Yiddish . There is no Israel and there is precious little Hebrew outside of the synagogue . If , like me , you know almost nothing about Jewish culture , you 're going get absolutely fascinated as you read . ( 2 ) the characters . Landsman is cranky , wry , self-deprecating , and dogged . The friendships between him and his partner , and him and his ex-wife , are complex and funny and a delight to read . As a reader , I would n't hesitate to follow these characters through a story way more far-fetched than this one.As mysteries go , this story is much slower moving than fans of the genre will be used to ( because it 's so top-heavy with all that world-building ) . But I definitely recommend The Yiddish Policeman 's Union , especially for those reader who want something that they 've never seen before ! Chabon fans should be pleased .	1
It took me awhile to get used to the setting of _The Yiddish Policeman 's Union_ and the premise behind it ( the 1948 war that created the state of Israel failed , the Jews given a temporary home in Sitka , Alaska ) . Once I got past that , I was blown away by the characters and story.Chabon 's characters are painfully human and beautifully written . The mystery itself takes a while to fully develop , as the characters play out their relationships , but there is a satisfying resolution for those who are patient . While some may be frustrated by the effort and detail put into the characterization , I found it endearing and it served to pull me further into the story.Simply put , I enjoyed the book immensely and I highly recommend it .	1
a friend recommended the book to me - what a great story to learn more about the Jewish culture , especially Russian in AK . CHABON paints a vivid picture of Sitka , AK with his words	1
I almost gave up on this book . I 'm not Jewish and I found the generous serving of Yiddish words to be very discouraging and a barrier to appreciating the book fully . At page 150 I was ready to put it down , but because the book received so much praise ( I think the Economist called it one of the best books of 2007 ) , I forced myself to continue and am so glad I did . I finally got into the groove of the novel and found myself awestruck by the way the author 's words could capture such true-to-life feelings and conversations . The author 's writing style and the way he can write a conversation between characters makes other authors ' representations of characters and words seem contrived . WARNING - Plot spoiler : He even got me to accept the eventual reuniting of Detective Landsman and his ex-wife as a perfectly natural thing ( even though at the beginning of the book , the only thing I hoped for was that the author would not pander to the audience 's natural desire for happy endings ) . All I can say to those who are turned off by the book is to keep at it , you 'll be rewarded . You may even speak Yiddish by the end of it .	1
will you receive such a gift as this novel . The story line is superb but secondary to the reason I loved this work ; Chabon writes with such crisp text , rich allegories , colorful metaphors , and originality that I was simply blown away . Simply stated , the second or third best read in a decade . And I intend to reread it this summer .	1
At this point nearly 400 reviews have been written , and this novel has won the Nebula and Hugo awards . What can a mild-mannered reader add to this dogpile of praise ? Perhaps nothing , but I will say this . Chabon writes books that remind you why you liked novels to begin with . He 's a master word craftsman and he tells a story with a beginning , middle , and end , which no matter how many Wallaces and Pynchons and other postmodern vanguards I read , remains the best way to tell a story . It 's as simple as that . The fact that while telling a hard-boiled mystery Chabon can reimagine the last 70 years of history in a brilliant and convincing way just shows why he is honored as he is . In this book he fashions a world and a story that could take place on any planet using any mythology , but Chabon chooses Earth and the mythology of Jewish mysticism . The novel is all the richer for it , not to mention the wonderful use of a beautiful onomatopeic language , Yiddish.This novel is not for everyone , just as pork is not for everyone , but for those of us who willing to partake , this novel is the bacon .	1
I was interested in all of the characters in this book , as quirky as they all were . The author did a great job of exploring each individual 's feelings and experiences , enabling the reader to really get to know and understand each of them . The storyline was put together cleverly as well , carefully unraveling answers to the reader 's questions as the book progressed . I enjoyed the ending , and thought the epilogue was really a bonus ( more discoveries ! ) .	1
Five stars again for Hoosier author , Haven Kimmel . Love , it 's loss , it 's search , it 's dangers , it 's control , it 's beauty are all present in this interesting `` love story '' that does n't read at all like a love story at first . Everyone in the book seems to be having difficulty dealing with life and relationships . Every one of them needs serious counseling.Kimmel takes you through their lives , their memories , and their struggles that made them who they are just in time for the final pages and chapters when ... well ... read the book . Love is not always just sweetness , so hang in there with the characters to the book 's end -- you will be glad.You will eventually love most of the characters you decided to hate in the beginning . The change in emotion is also a part of the story of love that Haven Kimmel presents in such a different light . This story is nothing like the two previous Zippy stories , even though this fiction takes place in Indiana .	1
I am a committed Haven Kimmel fan after reading this very well-written book by an obviously erudite , well-read author . Once I had read a few chapters , I was hooked on Langston , her family , and Amos ' relationship ( s ) . This is a novel to be savored because each paragraph holds unexpected nuggets . I found the literary references to be thought-provoking , the details of each person 's life to be exquisitely crafted and the humor to be sharp . I felt as if I knew this small town in Indiana quite intimately by the time Langston met daily with Alice 's daughters . I majored in English at Indiana University , so I also appreciated Langston 's observations of the academics who reign in their own narrow world . I can not wait to read & quot ; A Girl Named Zippy & quot ; and anything else written by this very talented author .	1
I 've said it before , I 'll say it again : two things primarily motivate me as a reader . 1 ) D & eacute ; but novels , and 2 ) Female writers.D & eacute ; but novels from female writers are then , a double grand prize.D & eacute ; but novels from female writers such as 'The Solace of Leaving Early ' are ... *sigh*F. Scott Fitzgerald said `` You do n't write because you want to say something , you write because you have something to say . '' When a writer has something to say , as in the case of Ms Kimmel , and can say it the way she has here ... it 's a glorious thing to experience.There is no question that Ms Kimmel had something to say when she set out to write this novel ; it was a need . To me , this need was as much a motivating factor ( and a fortifying element ) as the story she wanted to tell . I say this after having read the most recent of her novels , 'Iodine ' , which allowed me to see that what she has a need to say , and the arena through which she expresses this need -at least insofar as these two books- include hyper-intelligence and profound-intellectualism-writ-as-an-everyday-experience , as well as philosophy , religion , the paradigm of family ... and the loss of an older brother . Even at this stage of her career , her facility at investing her writing with these factors is impressive . ( Not that it 's not self-absorbed , or self-indulgent . It is , all of it , but the sign of a great writing talent is the ability to grab the reader at the shoulder , pull them along to match your gait , say with confidence , with audacity even , 'I 've got a tale I want to tell you , ' and have the reader not only be willing to accompany them on the journey , but be eager to . She manages this , in spades . ) Another sign of such talent is , essentially , 'what 's left out ' . Not just in the ability to infer and suggest , but also in effecting a collaborative state : the unspoken agreement to 'dance ' , for the reader to unconsciously identify in the work something personal , to allow a resonance , so that the experience is something they add to , not merely have . For me , Ms Kimmel 's novel accomplished this at critical junctures , adding to my enjoyment in subtle , but profound ways.I laughed . I cried . I was moved to ponder ... I was moved , period . Despite the fact that I had no working understanding of the subject matter she might be declaiming on , despite the fact that the references were mostly alien to me ( some I 'd heard of , but never actually investigated ) , despite all of this , I found 'The Solace of Leaving Early ' to be one of the most rewarding reads I 've had in a long , long time . ( Oh , and I have to say that the title and what this mindset embodies ? Been one of my personal credos for years and years . ) Personal rating : 9.0/10	1
First of all , I could just hug Haven Kimmel for not falling into the trap that so many of today 's authors fall into , which is in thinking that if 50,000 words are good , then 500,000,000 will be EVEN BETTER . It was a great pleasure to read such a tightly woven story and gave me the impression that Kimmel has really WORKED on her craft as a writer -- she has the discipline to keep her writing spare and lean.The characters were lovely . Okay , I got a bit weary of Amos ' constant pedantic mental plodding through books of theological thought that are obscure to anyone who has n't spent time in a seminary , and there were times when I wished I could yank Langston out of the pages by her wrist , give her a smack in the head and then shove her back into the story , but Kimmel 's resolution of the quirks of the two characters was worth these annoyances . At first , I thought Kimmel was just being show-offy of ( and boresome about ) her own time spent in seminary and graduate school , but as the characters opened up , I perceived there was a reason . Langston 's mother was a jewel and the two little girls were haunting.Considering the subject matter ( a brutal murder ) , this was a surprisingly witty book that made me laugh out loud several times at Kimmel 's deft turn of a phrase . The ending was superb.I loved it . I recommend it highly . Kimmel is a gifted writer. ( P.S . I had those little cream cheese mints at my own wedding and they are n't THAT bad . )	1
Myth , Icon , Star , Hollywood-America ... Cintra Wilson , in her stunning debut novel , Colors Insulting to Nature , takes the reader on a tour through the underground reality of striving to `` become a celebrity '' in America . In the style of a burlesque Janet Fitch or Wally Lamb , Wilson introduces the protagonist , Liza Normal , as a scantily clad thirteen year-old auditioning her heart out for a T.V . commercial . Liza does n't get the spot , but captures the reader 's heart with her spunky determination . Liza 's mother , Peppy Normal , stage-mother extraordinaire , decides to open a theater in a dilapidated firehouse to finance her daughter 's and son 's ( Ned ) education at the New York High School for Performing Arts , after being moved by a viewing of `` Fame . '' Liza 's dreams are not realized , and the roof falls in , literally and figuratively , on her dreams of pre-pubescent romance and stardom.She is forced to attend the local public high school and things only go downhill from there . Liza , after a traumatic loss of her virginity and her hair , eventually moves in with her best friend , Lorna , whose mother is a midwife/drug dealer.She sports a mohawk , a safety pin through her nose and an untouchable attitude . Inside though , the reader can still see little Liza Normal , underdressed wannabe child star , struggling to surface.Liza travels through each level of the Hollywood underground , coming back occasionally to speak with agoraphobic Ned and perpetually antagonistic Peppy . She develops romances and a drug addiction , and like any Hollywood wannabe or superstar , does her time in rehab . She comes out renewed in her search for stardom and eventually finds that a side venture that she loathes will be her way `` in . `` Cintra Wilson peppers the novel with editorials , making an entertaining novel into an adventure in Hollywood and a hilarious tongue-in-cheek take on the endless quest to be `` discovered . '' She points out in subtle and not-so-subtle ways the tendency of Americans to look for instant gratification and how we love and leave our shooting stars.Liza 's recollections and reflections are all based in movies , whether real movies or the `` movie of her life , '' clearly showing Wilson 's intent of portraying America 's great obsession .	1
My favorite chapters are the unsent letters that Reta , the narrator , composes to authors who acknowledge the influence of other male writers , ignoring female writers . The best is the one she writes to someone whose obituary she has just read . Feminism is certainly a dominant theme in this book , but so are family and grief . The grief , however , is not over a loved one 's death . Reta and Tom 's oldest daughter , Norah , has essentially dropped out , silently begging for money on a Toronto street corner , with a handwritten sign around her neck , bearing the single word `` Goodness . '' This unfortunate situation consumes the lives of Reta , Tom , and their two younger daughters . I guess you could say that at least death has closure , whereas Norah 's circumstances cause ongoing concern as winter approaches . The overriding mystery is what caused Norah to take the drastic step of dropping out of college to panhandle , but there 's actually a lot in this book to savor . I loved that Reta 's mother-in-law , Lois , has a file of 100 dessert recipes and brings dessert to dinner every night , as soon as Reta signals by closing the red kitchen curtains . Also , it 's almost a book within a book , as Reta contemplates various endings for the novel she is writing , a sequel about a fashion writer who is engaged to a trombonist . Her new overbearing editor is a hoot , interrupting all her sentences and suggesting that she use a pseudonym , such as R. R. Summers . ( Has J.K. Rowling started a trend ? ) You can imagine how our feminist protagonist feels about such a gender-neutral name . And , of course , everyone has a theory as to why Norah has checked out . The author drops a hint early on but not large enough for me to put two and two together .	1
The first moon landing was one of the first worldwide media events ( but not , as some claim , the very first -- what about , for example , the Kennedy assasination ? ) . As such , it was new in that in some way we all participated in it . It 's one of my earliest memories , and I recall being brought downstairs to the aging , high-pitched black and white TV to see some blurry shots of the first step , I recall that it was a big topic at school & I recall getting an astronaut mug from my usually thrifty father with Armstrong etc . on it . What was different about all this was that in some way we personally participated in this vicarious media event . So Andrew Smith 's approach -- part memoir , part journalism -- seems entirely appropriate to me . The moon landings were , after all , as much about their effect on us personally and individually as about what was going on out there in space.This is a great book that stays with the reader after the reading and into which Smith does not overly inject himself . Rather , he successfully conjures up the feeling of the late 1960s and early 1970s by showing it to us through his eyes.The book loses focus somewhat in the last third and lacks a really strong ending , but it 's so good elsewhere that it 's still a great read . At times , perhaps Smith does n't quite `` get '' all of the astronauts he interviews , maybe he 's a tad patronizing toward them in a couple of places and maybe inadvertently he shows his own smallness alongside them once or twice . But he 's hardly the first journalist to commit any of these sins and it 's still a fine read.The style is what my father used to call `` Sunday supplement , '' i.e . the type of writing you get in the glossy magazine that comes with the Sunday newspaper . That can be a very slick , competent style and Smith executes it very well.This is not an in-depth technical or even historical account -- it 's really an extended think-piece , and Smith is at his absolute best when he 's pondering why we went ( his thoughts on Kennedy in particular are striking ) , what the result was and how it affected both those who went and ourselves.He pays sufficient but not excessive attention to the conspiracy theories and that so many now believe we did n't go is , after all , an important reflection on us and on the moon venture.I liked that Smith felt free to digress beyond the moonwalkers into other people connected to the venture who interested him . He did this in a disciplined way so that it 's not annoying . It was a writing strength to allow himself to do this ( digress ) , not a weakness.Some of the vignettes of the individual moonwalkers are outstanding . The one of John Young is the weakest , and I really felt that it mostly showed Smith as a lesser intellect really not trying quite hard enough with his Young profile.But , again , this is overall an outstanding book , especially the first two thirds , and very well worth the read . An original , well-executed idea .	1
What a fabulous find : the shorthand notes of Oscar Wilde 's prosecution of the Marquess of Queensberry for libel.The author is Oscar Wilde 's grandson and his literary executor . According to him , the formal transcripts of the proceeding ( the transcription from shorthand into typewritten form ) has mysteriously disappeared from the Court 's files . Very irregular . One wonders how/why the stenographic record survived when so much else of the official record mysteriously disappeared . The author only says the transcripts were delivered to the British Library , but does not indicate the source.I am a lawyer and am familiar with trial procedure here in the US , but not the UK in 1895 . It could be that the proceedings were taken down by private stenographers ( i.e. , not employees of the Crown ) , who would transcribe the proceedings and deliver a typed version to the Court for entry into the record . If so , then the hand written stenographic record could have remained in private hands ( the stenographic company ) , untouched while the rest of the formal record of the trial mysteriously disappeared . How fortunate for us these records have survived.I am not sure it 's fair to blame Wilde 's counsel for the debacle . Wilde swore to this man that there was no basis at all for the libel . I believe that during the trial Wilde 's counsel saw the inevitable , felt let down by a client who lied to him ( then a gentleman 's word was his bond ) and frankly did n't really care . A lying client really ties a lawyer 's hands behind his or her back . ( I have had first hand experience of that as a real estate lawyer . You really ca n't represent people who lie to you . ) In his introduction , the author says that he would like to ask his grandfather why on earth he started the action . I would too . It was insanity , knowing `` what was out there '' in the way of blackmailers , evidence at the Savoy Hotel and other places which would come back to bite him . Oscar Wilde and his immediate family paid a terrible price for this mistake . All of Wilde 's other friends told Wilde to tear the card up . Why did n't he ? I can only speculate that Wilde was sucked into the Queensberry family 's `` strum und drang '' and was used as a pawn . All of the Queensberry family ( exclusive of the father ) financed Wilde 's prosecution of the father . Wilde did not have sufficient funds to pay for the prosecution himself as he was facing bankruptcy at the time ( another reason why it seems incredible for Wilde to start this prosecution ) .	1
I was skeptical at first - C.S . Lewis writing about Space instead of Narnia ? - but once I started this book I was absolutely hooked ! I encourage everyone to give it a chance .	1
Early in the book a man named Ransom is travelling from town to town in search of lodging . Ransom is a professor of philology , an academic discipline where words , phonetics , and other linguistic constructs are observed . Ransom comes across three men fighting , and through a twist of fate is kidnapped by two professors who are going to explore a planet called Malacandra.After their touch down in Malacandra , Ransom is blown away by the vast differences between Earth and Malacandra . The three men are confronted by giant ghost-like creatures . Ransom runs for his life , and becomes stranded alone on the strange planet . This is the story of his adventures and exploration of the planet Malacandra.The main reason I give this four stars is probably because I have n't read the rest of the trilogy yet , but the story is very exciting once the plot is set up about a third through the book . I ca n't tell you more than what is above for concern I might give away something.Unfortunately , some of my favorite parts of the book fall into that category of stuff I ca n't give away . However , what I can say is this . Science fiction often encourages our philosophical and theological imagination . The effectiveness with which Lewis does this is significant . I highly recommend this book .	1
I found this book to be an excellent start to the trilogy . It was fast paced and interesting and opened up a desire to read more in the series to see where the story line and its symbolisim would lead .	1
Who knew Lewis did science fiction . I sure did n't till I stumbled on this . We read the first installment on loan from a friend and then had to have the whole set . Great read .	1
This first book in Lewis 's space trilogy is also the only one that is really sci-fi . Much of the book consists of descriptions of Malacandra , as it is known to those who live there -- our name for it is Mars . Bigger things are afoot , it is clear , but what wo n't be shown until 'Perelandra ' and especially 'That Hideous Strength . ' The book has a chapter tacked on the end , supplying some more details , supposedly written by Ransom to Lewis -- a clever touch ; Lewis comes off as the colossal bungler , romanticising a straightforward intellectual narrative , to Ransom 's clear-headed scientific observational approach -- a spoof within a spoof , well and quietly done . The scenes with Weston and the Oyarsa , Ransom translating , are priceless ; Lewis works in some sharp satirical comments against war and greed and pride . Those scenes alone would make the book well worth reading . Add in the strange and fascinating -- other worlds and creatures and the memorable descriptions of space itself -- and you 've got a book with double appeal . True , the science is inaccurate -- Mars has no 'hnau 's and space is not filled with light . Lewis is not to blame , however , especially for the last -- space _ought_ to be filled with light ; no one knows why it is n't ; whole books ( e.g. , 'Why the Sky is Dark at Night ' ) have been written on the subject . Science aside , the book really has no flaws except that it does n't ever soar above its consistent level of quality .	1
Now that we 've been there and done that , space exploration-wise , one would expect this science fiction to be outdated . One would be wrong . This is just the first part of one man 's arduous trek through the mysteries of our Solar System and Man 's Fallen State . Follow the language expert Ransom as he meets new peoples , learns new languages , and confronts our familiar old Enemy .	1
This item arrived quickly . It arrived in excellent condition . It worked exactly like it was supposed to . The item met a special need very well . Thank you Amazon for having it .	1
[ Throughout the years , I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon . These writings comprise two types of reviews : unfinished reviews , abandoned during various stages of composition , and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted . Of the later type , back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work , a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released . I am publishing these reviews now for the first time , over a decade after they were initially written . Mike London 10-3-2012 ] '' That Hideous Strength '' , the third volume in Lewis 's `` Space Trilogy '' , stands as central novel of his that gives me the most pleasure in reading it . While `` Till We Have Faces '' is certainly his best work , `` That Hideous Strength '' is the central novel in my own imagination that I most sympathize with in terms of where I want to go with my own fiction.There is so much in `` That Hideous Strength '' that absolutely fascinates me , and much of the themes I also want to deal with in my own fiction . The abuse of language stands as one of the most terrifying elements in the novel . Wither stands as one of my personal favorites on the side of the N. I. C. E , as does Fairy Hardcastle . Wither is very developed and incredibly diabolical , and Fairy is a very masculine woman involved in sadistic police torture . The Nazis have a very strong place in this work . Much of the more hideous and hellish scenes in this book comes from the inclusion of the N. I. C. E as the dominant villainy that works evil throughout the text . Much of what they want to do tie into the Nazi movements , and each are equally terrible.The inclusion of Merlin makes it a much more interesting text , for there is the key theme of Nature against Anti-Nature , and Merlin very much is in harmony with Nature . What makes this such a strong work is that each group parallels the other , and wherever there is a vision of total evil there also stands an equally dramatic picture of that which is good.One thing that the critics seem to really harp on is the fact that this text has such a complex structure , but for myself that is one of the most exciting things about it . It is the fact that Lewis manages such a huge cast of characters , and does so rather well , that makes this one of my favorite of his novels , and certainly my pick for the Space Trilogy.While I respect `` Perelandra '' and find it a very fine artistic effort , it is this book that I keep picking up to reread when I make my jaunts through Lewis 's imaginative gauntlets . This is truly the most fascinating of the `` Space Trilogy '' . ( These reviews covered all seven books of `` The Chronciles of Narnia '' , the three novels of `` The Space Trilogy '' , `` The Abolition of Man '' , `` The Four Loves '' , `` A Preface to Paradise Lost '' , a revised version of my 2000 review of `` Till We Have Faces '' , `` Surprised By Joy '' , and `` The Screwtape Letters '' . I have published newly written reviews of `` The Space Trilogy '' composed long after I wrote the three original reviews of Lewis 's science fiction . ) .. -- -- - [ In Late 1999 or early 2000 I also wrote this abandoned , unfinished review to `` That Hideous Strength '' ] The first time I 've heard of the trilogy , it was from a pastor 's wife . I was only then reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS ( this was back in 1994 ) , and I decided I would try it . Being a fan of Narnia ( although I do not like Lion nearly as much as the others ) , I figured this would be good also.THAT HIDEOUS STRENGHT , which is longer than the other two books combined , is a book like no other I 've read . Its main weakness is it jumps from modern to mythical too soon . It is a novel of ideas , and then at the climax the story becomes mythical , with a violent ending . Also , Lewis assumes to much of the readers on the matter of Merlin . Merlin was an incubus , and had no father .	1
This is among one of these best books I 've ever read . Part novel , part horror , part science fiction , part theology , this book blew me away bis sheer creativity and originality . What a sanctified imagination ! This was the last of Lewis 's works on my checklist to read them all . The space trilogy is one of his best kept secrets.I will return to this book again and again .	1
I 'm a sucker for big fat kids ' fantasy books ( big fat adult fantasy books tend to throw me off ) and I picked up & quot ; Woven Path & quot ; with great anticipation . I was not disappointed . Robin Jarvis , who wrote the great fantasy book & quot ; Dark Portal , & quot ; weaves an intriguing fantasy story.Neil Chapman is & quot ; our hero , & quot ; a young man who comes to the Wyrd Museum ( a pun on Weird ? ) , a rather grimy and unimpressive building in the East End . Creepy hardly describes the odd museum , run by three old ladies who are ... uh , creepy . Who are they ? What are they ? Better brush up on Greek and Norse myths , as these bizarre old ladies are the Fates , who weave a cloth composed of the life-threads of all the people of the world into their future . When Neil steps into the Separate Collection , he is swept through time and space to London . In WW2 . A scramble will result before Neil can hope to return , with some odd new friends ... The idea of a magical place being run by the Fates is an intriguing and original idea indeed , and Jarvis does it justice . The three are suitably creepy and strange , and the inner mood of their museum matches their personalities.Neil is a better-than-usual book hero , a very realistic person with great reactions and some very good lines . And the character of Ted was sweet , nuff zed . Jarvis skillfully manages to make Ted believable and sympathetic , not juvenile or stupid.The writing style is snappy where it needs to be and drawn out where it needs to be , with pretty good descriptions and characterization . I got confused a few times in this book , where the plot took a twist and I inadvertantly missed it , but the story flows well overall.A wonderful read , and I can not wait for & quot ; Raven 's Knot & quot ; !	1
I just finished reading this book and I loved it . Not only did I learn about Mr. Holman 's amazing life , but I got a clear sense of the period in which he lived . All in all a great read . I recommend it to all , but especially those who love history .	1
Cathy Kelly'sJust Between Usis a richly textured tale of a `` perfect '' family that begins to slowly reveal itself as one with all the ordinary flaws and foibles that plague most people ; it is this probing beneath the surface that yields a peek into the intriguing aspects of each of the primary characters.As the story begins , Rose and Hugh Miller are approaching their fortieth anniversary , and as the celebratory moment nears , we learn more about the two of them ; Rose uncovers a secret , and while she 's planning the party , she is also considering how to deal with it.Meanwhile , the three adult daughters are each struggling with their own issues . Stella , the eldest , has a successful career as an attorney , and as the single mother to Amelia , believes that her life is just the way it will stay . She expects no romance or any surprises at all.Tara , the middle child , writes for a successful soap opera , and as a newly-wed with a dream husband , she believes that all is just the way it should be.While Holly , the youngest , is plagued by insecurities and longs for a love that seems to never arrive , the other two begin to find that their lives are not what they thought they were.This is the heart of the story , but what sets it apart are the rich details that give us more than a peek into their lives -- we almost feel as if we are walking alongside them . As if they are our friends and neighbors , with their struggles part of us . We root for them , and sometimes want to yell at them for making foolish choices or mistakes.A rather long book ( 530 pages ) , I kept reading , because I truly wanted to partake of every eventful moment in the lives of the characters.Definitely five stars !	1
One way I can sum up this review is to say , I 'll probably never be through reading this book I mean that as in - you can never be `` through '' reading the Bible . THAT 'S how good David Pawson 's book is . I 'm going to keep it with my Bible and refer to it every time I do my daily Bible study . I have at least eight bookmarks throughout and numerous highlighting and markings . I intend to use it over and over again because with one read through , it 's virtually impossible to gather all the interesting commentary this book contains.Pawson covers every single book of the Bible and does so with incredible insights , and detailed commentary . He also uses charts as he does in Isaiah where he outlines the different reigns in Isaiah 's time or in Daniel with `` Historical Events Predicted in Daniel 11:2-35 '' or one of my favorites an O.T . Hebrew history , just to name a few.The author opens each chapter with an overview of the book , does a general outline replete with explanation and commentary , and ends with a conclusion . He gives most every chapter a thorough going over in an organized manner.At over 1000 pages , it 's long , however when this is viewed as reference material , the length does n't actually matter.The book is n't perfect . I do have some cons.Pawson 's introduction seemed rather self-serving . He says , `` I enjoy listening to my tapes and can be deeply moved by myself . I am enthusiastic about reading one of my new publications , often telling my wife , ` This really is good stuff . ' But when I read a transcript of what I have said , I am ashamed and even appalled . '' That was just one example of what I felt to be a less than modest view about his work woven through the introduction . I had hoped for more of a humble servant given the material.I also was disappointed in Pawson 's handling of 2 Corinthians . He essentially ignored the nine gifts of the Spirit . He ventures to offer his opinion on any number of matters throughout the entire book , but for some unknown reason , did not address that these gifts are listed and how relevant they are , or are n't , for today 's Christian . The fact he mentions many details in other portions of the book repeatedly and adds supporting arguments makes this omission particularly perplexing . `` Unlocking The Bible '' is a comprehensive and obviously well researched work , the fact that the author 's insights are n't perfect should n't be a deterrent . What author of a scholarly work is perfect ? In conclusion , I highly recommend this as a must-have book right along with a good concordance for anyone serious about studying the Bible .	1
This author was a master of her art and all of her books are a joy to read . I also loved & # 34 ; Unless. & # 34 ;	1
Seabiscuit follows the gradual rise of an underdeveloped horse born of grand breading . With no expectations of greatness thrust upon him , Seabiscuit enters a life of racing mediocrity . Slowly , his anger gestates as he is forced to lose to lesser horses in training to build their confidence . Eventually his life comes into confluence with a quixotic entrepreneur recovering from a personal disaster , a down-on-his-luck trainer with natural talent , and one of the tallest but most dedicated jockeys in the league . Together this unlikely but somehow perfect team take Seabiscuit to the greatest heights of horse racing , at the time the most popular sport in the United States . Along the way , their journey takes on grander scope than just personal redemption . They become a much needed beacon of triumph and personal renewal for American emotionally wasted by the throes of the Great Depression.The story is excellently researched , well crafted , and favors reality to fairy tale endings . Each of the characters is presented in written detail akin to HD TV . Hillenbrand should patent HD Words.Many times a book is not worth reading after seeing the movie ( i.e . Twilight ) , which is a shame because a good book can greatly enlighten the backstory that does n't come across in moving pictures . Seabiscuit thankfully makes the reading as well as the watching equally worthwhile regardless of the order they are undertaken .	1
All the previous accolades given to this book are well deserved.Thoughts : I found it intriguing that horse racing was so much more popular back in the first half of the 20th Century than the second half . Probably has to do with the horse being a major mode of transportation up until the early 1900 's and that more people had firsthand contact with horses.It also seemed that you did n't have to win the Triple Crown ( let alone race in those three races ) to be a popular horse.Great story and excellent writing ! A non-fiction page turner !	1
This is a must read . It is well researched and a compelling story . Laura tells a good story it is hard to put the book down .	1
One of the best books I have read in a long time . Hillenbrand is a terrific writer ; she makes the world of 1930s thoroughbred racing come alive and reveals the people and horses who inhabited it as flesh and blood , complex characters . She brings a depth of feeling to the high and low points of Seabiscuit 's career that is wonderful to experience . Whether or not you have any interest in thoroughbred racing , this story will grab you .	1
Very well-written , accurate , comprehensive but evocative story about a horse who came up from nothing and the people who loved and believed in him . The country needed a hero and along came Seabiscuit . His owner , rider , and trainer gave him a second chance , and he did the same for them . This non-fiction book reads like a novel , but it 's all there , fully researched . Hillenbrand tells a great story in great book .	1
This book was chosen to be read by my book club and I dragged my feet until the last minute because I thought that I 'd be bored with the subject . Once I got into the story , I had a wonderful surprise . Laura Hillenbrand has written a detailed account of Seabiscuit , and managed to made it incredibly interesting and very exciting.The author starts by giving the biographies of the fascinating men that had the most to do with Seabiscuit 's rise to fame . They were Charles Howard , Tom Smith , Red Pollard and George Woolf . Each of these men contributed to the greatness of the famed horse.Seabiscuit himself was not the most beautiful of horses and , in fact was a pretty difficult animal to deal with . Trainer Tom Smith saw something in the horse that he knew was worth tapping and encouraged Charles Howard to purchase Seabiscuit . Red Pollard and George Woolf were the jockeys who rode him into fame . By the time I was reading about the races , I could n't put the book down until I found out which horse won that particular race.This is a great American story !	1
I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars . I kept putting off reading it , as I could not see how a book about a racehorse would hold my attention in fact I never saw the movie . But Hillenbrand made it amazingly exciting . I learned a lot about the life and livelihoods surrounding the world of horseracing , human as well as horse . I 'm very glad I read it .	1
When the movie Seabiscuit arrived at theaters I saw and enjoyed the film . People told me they had not liked the movie as much as the book . Not having read it , I did not fully appreciate their comments or passion . Now I have read Seabiscuit.This book is a triumph for Laura Hillenbrand . Her writing is compelling and beautiful . She draws fine portraits of Charles Howard , Red Pollard , Tom Smith and Seabiscuit himself . Through her artful storytelling the reader sees the horse 's personality as clearly as the other players in the tale.Hillenbrand 's reenactment of the match race with War Admiral must be the most exciting eleven pages I have ever read . The tension , the anticipation , the fear , the cheers and pandemonium of the crowd are brilliantly crafted . As a reader , I was there , in the mind of trainer Tom Smith . I was then seeing the race through the eyes of the jockey , George Woolf , who , interestingly , suffered from Type 1 diabetes . Finally , I was shrieking deliriously with the crowd as the horses pounded around the track.This amazing book will go on my favorite-books-of-all-time list . What a stunning achievement !	1
I read this book after reading Unbroken . Seabiscuit is a good book and good story that I would probably would have given 5 stars too if I had n't have read Unbroken first.I will read anything Ms. Hillenbrand writes from now on . Her books are unbelievably well researched and written .	1
An extremely well researched and written biography of Seabiscuit , his owner , trainer and jockeys . Ms Hillenbrand has spent a lifetime researching to write this inspiring and accurate biography of a true American hero . In the middle of the great depression a racehorse catches the admiration of a suffering America . The intelligence of a trainer , the brashness of an owner and the brotherhood of two jockeys all work together to develop one of history 's greatest athletes . Much better than the movie . More details . More drama . Well worth the read .	1
The true story of Seabiscuit reads better than ninety per cent of the novels published today . Thoroughly engrossing and often exhilarating , this book works from start to finish . I thought the recent movie , although a respectable effort , never rose to the levels of interest and excitement that Hillenbrand created in the book . If you are n't moved by Seabiscuit , I suggest you check for a pulse .	1
Seabiscuit is the truest American story to ever happen . It 's the American dream . The underdog becoming the biggest thing ever . The horse who enchanted America . I loved this story , you will too . Buy it and you 'll see why .	1
I purchased this book on a whim after reading all of the fantastic reviews on the book 's jacket cover . The book exceeded my already high expectations . If you are reading this , you probably already know that the story follows the unlikely career of a knobby-kneed horse named Seabiscuit . Laura Hillenbrand does an excellent job of conveying the passion and excitement this horse engendered in 1930 's America . She also vividly details Seabiscuit 's ongoing rivalry with War Admiral , a far more heralded horse.Even more interesting than the Seabiscuit 's exploits , however , is the transformation in the lives of the people surrounding Seabiscuit . The horse 's rider ( Red Pollard ) and trainer ( Tom Smith ) each get a second chance in their respective careers and Seabiscuit is their ticket to doing something truly & quot ; great. & quot ; Tom Howard , a San Francisco auto baron who purchased Seabiscuit for a pittance , finds that he truly loves his horse - win or lose . Each of their stories transcend the time and place in which the novel is set.This book is an A+	1
My son got this book from grandma when he was a little over a year old . It was an automatic favorite ! It starts with `` Oh the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do . He can sound like a cow . He can go moo moo . '' It has pictures that are engaging for their simplicity and a rhyme that is flowing but varied so it doe n't get boring . My son loved learning the noises and now he says them along with me when I read . I 've even caught him looking at this book and saying the noises to himself . He 's now 2 and we still read this one often ( and I have it memorized ) . I highly recommend this book . I just do n't know how you could n't like it !	1
Who does n't love to moo ? Children love this story and the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown introduces . My students enjoyed the sounds and rhyme that Mr. Brown introduces .	1
Tons of fun . There 's an art to confessing in public , and many of these essays are small masterpieces of the form . It begins with the editor explaining how she was mooned by Manchester United fans while giving a reading , and goes on from there . One author 's grandmother interrupts the local premier of `` Gone With the Wind '' with her own version of more local events . Another has too much to drink and does an `` ape dance '' on a fellow poet 's installation . One is given a book to sign and sees that he 's not the author but shares the same name , and signs it anyway . Then there 's the unfortunate speaker refered to in the title of my review . These essays share a playful informality that leads to some unusual turns of phrase : TV presenters who are `` ... so handsome they 're ugly '' . A breakfast of `` ... sad toasted things , sorry boiled items , heartbroken sausages swimming in gray juice '' . A poorly timed regurgitation is `` ... an acid indigo porridge of red wine , Jameson 's and aubergine curry '' . A forced watching of a lengthy adult film that `` must have been the director 's cut '' . A speech from `` an intellectual with ferociously witty eyebrows '' . Lots of laughs for the casual reader , and even more for aspiring writers and those who have been on book tours .	1
I knew nothing about this book except that it had been made into a movie ( that I have yet to see ) . It took me a good way through it to figure out that it was actually a version of a much older fairy tale -- which greatly impressed me . Ella is completely herself and both unable and unwilling to depend upon such things as magic , ulitmately , to rescue herself . This is a fantastic book for young girls ( and young boys if they are willing ) but it certainly illustrates the power of one determined young girl .	1
As a baby Ella was `` blessed '' with the gift of obedience . As she grows older Ella takes her gift in stride and finds all sorts of ways around having to do everything anyone ever orders her to do . After being left in the care of an overbearing stepmother and to very mean stepsisters , Ella sets out to find the fairy who blessed her and have it removed.This is a very cute and well written rendition of story of Cinderella . It perfectly balances the coming of age girls experience with plenty of wit and humor throughout . As an award winner I would recommend this to any girl who is looking something fun to read .	1
Because I do n't have kids , I found Ella Enchanted by conducting a search on Amazon for the subject `` Children 's Literature '' sorted by `` Average Customer Review '' and it came right to the top.And rightly so . This is an original and entertaining revision of the Cinderella story . Ella is cursed at birth with having to obey any direct order given to her . It 's hilarious how she finds loopholes and ways to get around the orders . Clever girl ! I also loved the details with the giants , elves , gnomes , and orges . This story was a real pleasure to read and is highly recommended . Thanks Amazon for helping me find this book ! Now on to Gail Carson Levine 's backlist ... .	1
I love this book ! Ella Enchanted is much better than the classic Cinderella , because Ella Enchanted has more challenges and adventures.Ella is cursed to be obedient , having to obey all commands . Even when Ella is cursed , she still tries to disobey , but when she does , she gets dizzy and sick . In Ella Enchanted , there is a stepmother with her ugly daughters . The step-family tortures her and her father is no hope because he cares more about money.Ella tries to break her spell with the help of her fairy Godmother , who is a superb cook . As she tries to break the spell , she meets ogres , elves , giants and exotic creatures . With each creature there is an adventure that follows . While all this is going on , she 's falling in love with Prince Charmont.I think this is really a wonderful book and that all fairy-tale lovers should read this book because this is really creative and good !	1
`` Ella Enchanted , '' is an interesting tale of a girl named Ella . Ella of Frell was cursed with the gift of obedience at her birth . She is complied to obey all given order 's to her without having any ability to deny theses demands . Ella embarks on a quest to attempt to break this curse put upon her and live happily ever after . The tale gives our audience a sense of courage and determination . The story being based off of Cinderella , makes for an interesting twist to this story . If you love fairy tale plot lines , I would highly recommend this book for you . For me , it brought back all the wonderful memories I 've had reading fairy tale books as a child . The author does a fantastic job in making the reader feel as if they are apart of the story .	1
I first read this book several years ago and fell in love with it . I heard the movie is coming out in August , so I figured I would read it again to refresh my memory . I really did n't expect to like it very much now because I 'm older and thought it would be too young for me . Boy , was I WRONG ! I think I liked it even better the second time ! As soon as I started reading , I was drawn in again for a wonderful ride . Even though I knew how it would end , my memories had faded so that the twists and turns surprised me once more . In short , this one of the best books I 've ever read . It 's great for all ages . Read it to your children ! Read it to your friends ! Read it to your dog ! And most of all , recommend it to others !	1
This is really quite an enchanting book . I really liked how seriously the author took the story of Cinderella and then delved deeper and added a twist to create a delightful turn on the classic tale.The & quot ; twist & quot ; is that Ella is & quot ; cursed & quot ; with the spell of always having to obey direct commands . It 's quite delightful to see the clever ways she gets around this curse , and sometimes when she can not get around it the results are hilarious.The book gets a little cumbersome about halfway through , voyaging through a forest of fantasy creatures and removing its attention just a little bit from the character development of Ella . While it helps advance the story , I found myself losing interest at that part , and my 10-year-old son ( who broke down and read this & quot ; girl 's & quot ; book at my insistance ) decided not to finish the book when he got to the same spot . But I trudged through and then found myself enjoying the book at the end . It 's not that long.I 'd recommend this book for girls in 4th grade and up , and it 's not below the interest level of an imaginative adult . If you liked the movie & quot ; Ever After & quot ; then you 'll probably like this book .	1
This clarification of the classic fairy tale is simply astonishing . I first went into the book expecting to expect ... if that makes any sense . Yet , the book caught me , and most importantly my children , by delightful surprise . There is more to it than Prince Char ( aka Prince Charming ) and Ella ( aka Cinderella ) . There are gnomes , ogres , centaurs and giants in addition to fairies . Then there are attention-grabbing languages , new and unusual customs , and quite different schooling as well as the fairy tale balls and many other fascinating things . This book is n't just a fairy tale . It 's an in depth account of the life of Ella . Granted , we all know the ending , but by reading this , you ` ll understand even more how she got there . Finally , there is a moral lesson to be learned on giving . A truly good book .	1
This book is much more than just a Cinderella retelling.Unlike the adapted movie , this is something that is classical yet with a quirky twist.Ella , the main character , has a blessing bestowed by the fairy Lucinda . The blessing is the wonderful gift of obedience . When her mother dies , her father sends her to finishing school with two horrid girls . Ella 's father ends up marring the two girl 's mother , making them Ella 's stepsister . Mum-Olga , Ella 's stepmother , makes her work . Ella sneaks to the three balls held by the royal family . Ella has been friends with the prince . ( That 's a big difference ) And , of course , you know the last phrase ... ... ... .And they all live happily ever after . And they do ! This book is wonderful . I have no other way of describing it . I have read it 9 times !	1
A fun , whimsical take on the Cinderella story , Levine breathes fresh life into the familiar characters , giving them depth and a new world to live in . This breezy read takes us to the fanciful kingdom of Frell , where it is not unusual to fall prey to silver-tongued ogres or to attend a giant 's wedding . Elves live among the trees , Gnomes can see into the future and Fairies in disguise show up for weddings and births.Ella our heroine is a character worth admiring . She is strong , competent and independent , all of the characteristics that attracts Prince Char to begin with ( and even her self-centered absentee father ca n't , help but admire her for it to ) . Prince Char , future ruler of Frell , is tired of fawning courtiers and stuffy manners . He finds Ella very refreshing and sees the value in her authenticity and intelligence.There is no love at first sight in this book - thank goodness . Instead , Ella and Char have a very balanced relationship and I appreciate how in creating a strong character in Ella Levine does n't fall into the trap -that a lot of writers or TV shows do- of making Char weak or an object of ridicule who needs Ella to take care of him and save him from his own incompetence . Their relationship is what it should be , filled with mutual respect and admiration , the forgiveness of each other faults and the willingness to put another 's need before your own.While I 'm usually not into the idea of happily-ever-after ( yeah , I will resist the urge to go on an unrealistic expectations rant ) Levine is a very gifted story teller and I look forward to when I can share Ella 's story with my girls.For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com	1
Well written , well told . Loved every page , every word . I have seen the painting , it is strikingly beautiful . Truly a pearl of a book .	1
Of all the fiction that has come out recently featuring Vermeer or Vermeer paintings , this was my favorite . I do n't know how she did it , but somehow the author 's prose seems to be a reflection of the paintings themselves . The charged relationship between the fictional Vermeer and the servant girl ( the narrator of the story ) was very convincing . It also made clear that the options of women during this era , even those with interest and talent , were claustrophobically limited . Although I usually do n't care for fictionalized versions of historical figures , this book rang very true .	1
All I can say is ... Wow ! Girl With a Pearl Earring is a positively stunning novel , and one that I will remember for a long time to come . The historical detail quickly pulls the reader into another world , and the sparkling prose breathes new life into artist Johannes Vermeer , his family and most especially Griet , the girl hired as maid to the Vermeer household.Set in 17th century Delft , Girl With a Pearl Earring begins with 16-year-old Griet chopping vegetables in her mother 's kitchen . Griet 's family has fallen on some hardships , and her mother has informed her she is to become a maid in order to help support them . Vermeer and his wife , Catharina , agree that Griet will make a fine maid , and with that quick decision comes a fate that Griet could have never imagined ... a world of color and symmetry , secrets and passions , and one in which could spell her ruin.Author Tracy Chevalier has created a magnificient fictional account about what could have been , the inspiration behind one of Vermeer 's most celebrated works . Truly a masterpiece and one history , romance and art lovers will enjoy . Girl With a Pearl Earring starts as a fever and rises and flourishes with each turning page . I highly recommend this beautiful , eloquent , evocative tale . Readers will find themselves lost in the world of Vermeer and Griet ; this atmospheric novel will have nothing less to offer .	1
I 'll be honest ... I 'm not really sure how to rate this book . I read it as part of a book club and it 's not something I would usually read . It was ... interesting . I liked the first party narrative but never really connected with the characters . I did n't understand Griet 's decisions , but I enjoyed reading a different perspective than I might have taken . Overall , I am glad I read it .	1
Tracy Chevalier was obviously drawn to the beauty of one of Vermeer 's more famous paintings , of a young maid with a pearl earring . But unlike the many viewers who were similarly fascinated , that attraction became an obsession . She wondered about the circumstances that surrounded the painting , could find very little of substance in the historical record , and therefore took the known `` crumbs '' of facts , and performed major research into the life and times of mid-17th Century Dutch life . With this basis , she utilized that often sought , but oh so elusive gift : a seemingly magical ability of a creative writer to weave a well-told story that is authentic to the human condition.For sure , power is one of those conditions . The power of a famous painter with a substantial household over a semi-illiterate country maid who has recently been employed . And there is the countervailing power ; that of beauty . And the need , yes , even the obsession to capture that beauty , in the perfect light , for all time . Chevalier does `` nuance '' ; her viewpoint is not the narrow view of one or the other , tainted with modern political correctness . Rather , she depicts a more symbiotic relationship whose reflection is there for us to enjoy , more than three centuries later.And it reads so true . I said that it was `` authentic , '' and how can anyone truly know , of private events over three centuries removed ? And particularly when there are so many fraudulent novels , memoirs , et al . that are published concerning people and events in our own lifetime . So , it really is a judgment call . Given the sum total of one 's experience with human interactions , does this appear to be a highly likely scenario ? In my judgment , certain yes.I recently learned that Rembrandt , another brilliant Dutch painter , created a similar painting , of HIS maid , eight years before Vermeer , but have never seen a discussion on a possible connection , and would welcome reader comments . The review on Rembrandt 's paintings isRembrandt Harmensz van Rijn : Paintings from Soviet museumsChevalier writes well , and it is such a pleasure to read since she eschews the hokum so many novelist believe is essential in order to produce a `` best-seller . '' It remains a tribute to a diminishing sector of the reading public that it became one anyway . The movieGirl With a Pearl Earringis also highly recommended . 5-stars for both .	1
Ms. Chevalier has done it again taking a historic work of art and creating a believable story to how this painting came about.Ms . Chevalier has a very lyrical way of writing that is not only vividly descriptive , but also draws you into 17th century Delft . I managed to read this book in one sitting since the story of Griet and her sensual awakening which is triggered by her going to work as a maid for an artist and his family was totally captivating.For a fast read that is truly a work of art in it 's own write you ca n't go wrong with anything written by Ms. Chevalier !	1

My son is learning how to read , and just ca n't get enough of this book ! It 's great for beginners . It 's fun , and colorful and just Dr. Seuss . We love it .	1
Dr. Seuss 's extraordinary body of work is a collective treasure , but from that group of books a few stand out as his best . & quot ; One Fish , Two Fish , Red Fish , Blue Fish & quot ; certainly belongs in the category of Seuss 's finest . Rich in clever rhymes and memorable images , this book scores a literary home run on nearly every page.Directed towards early readers , & quot ; One Fish & quot ; uses simple language in its funny rhymes . Seuss mixes his own created words together with standard vocabulary , resulting in such memorable lines as & quot ; just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump. & quot ; And these rhymes are accompanied by a rich variety of images that can only be described as & quot ; Seussian & quot ; : A mother fish pushing her offspring in a baby carriage , a bed being commandeered by a menagerie of animals , and more.Futhermore , in & quot ; One Fish & quot ; Dr. Seuss introduces us to a wonderful assortment of Seussian creatures : the singing Ying , the hopping Yop , a truly bizarre creature known simply as & quot ; Clark , & quot ; and many more . These images are sure to energize the imaginations of both children and adults.Seuss 's images range from the joyful to the eerie , from the baroque to the earthy . I give & quot ; One Fish & quot ; my most enthusiastic recommendation .	1
Dr Seuss comes through again . Fun to read , good morals , excellent story.Lots of fun ! !	1
love that this was high quality book found on registry for my grandson ... love moose and love Seuss books so much !	1
Thidwick is a moose who does n't know how to say no . Over the course of the story he develops one hanger-on after another , each one making a home in Thidwick 's big horns . Each is a taker , but when it comes time to give , the parasites become indignant . Eventually it gets to the point where it puts Thidwick 's life in danger , and still the takers have no concern for Thidwick . Fortunately the hunters do n't make a trophy of Thidwick , and Thidwick learns a valuable lesson.Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose belongs next to The Lorax , the Grinch , and Yertle the Turtle as one of Seuss 's finest and most entertaining morality tales . Although it has n't yet achieved the iconic status of those other Seuss tales , this is among the six or seven best from among the entire Seuss catalog .	1
This book may not appear scholarly to many , but it is written in a refreshingly straigtforward manner that is easy to understand and easy for young people to relate with.The author , a young American-Muslim woman , has done an excellent job at defending and explaining her faith ( Islam ) without using big words and boring references.This book is a breath of fresh air , and I give 5 stars .	1
Not much is more cruel than the way young people may treat the one they consider to be the & quot ; class nerd. & quot ; Such is the case with Robert Nobel , often called & quot ; Norbert & quot ; by his primary bully , Jonathan Niker.Like every other youngster Roberts wants to have friends , to be recognized as a person of value . It seems this will not happen until he takes part in what is called the Elders Project , an endeavor in which members of his class visit the elderly residents of a rest home . Jonathan considers these older folks & quot ; vegetables , & quot ; but Robert sees something more and this is a vision that changes his life.Edith , thought to be quite a bit off , becomes Robert 's friend and it is through her story that he eventually finds himself.Director/actor Philip Franks invests understanding and suspense into this unforgettably moving tale.- Gail Cooke	1
It is one of the best books have every read . I ca n't read this book at any other better time . I was going through a stage where only these book could have given me hope and can ease me to go through . I give it five star because according to me it is worth . I have read this book three times and whenever I read this book I fell so relax and easy . It makes me positive towards my life . Thanks Sir Robin Sharma for writing such a wonderful book . I am sure many people will be benefited by this .	1
An enchanting fable , that teaches life lessons which are priceless . Enormously entertaining as well . Arlene Millman , author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY .	1
Very nice story and the tips and truths portrayed in the story are real , if put into practice you can really benefit from it !	1
Jane 's is a recognition guide , and a fine one at that . It should be noted , however , that as a recognition guide , it is not a book about tanks and other fighting vehicles , so do n't expect much text covering armored vehicle tactics , operations , capabilities , weapon systems , etc.As a recognition guide , this book does provide sillouettes , line drawings , multiple color photographs , lists of key recognition figures and basic vehicle statistics in order to aid the reader in recognizing various modern armored fighting vehicles . Aslo included are lists of nations who currently use each model.Surprisingly , not included in the latest version of the book are a handful of vehicles currently seeing extensive combat action and receiving a good deal of media coverage . These vehicles include the U.S. Army 's Stryker wheeled APC ( based on the Mowag Piranha and LAV-25 ) , the Israeli Achzarit tracked `` heavy '' APC ( based on the hull of the T-54 & T-55 MBT 's ) , Puma tracked Engineer carrier , and low-instensity conflict tracked carriers Nakpadon and Nakpachon ( all based on the chasis of the Centurion MBT ) .All of the above are derivatives of pre-existing models which are covered by the book but , as in the case of the Israeli APC 's , the modifications are so extensive as to make the resulting vehicles almost completely new in terms of components , performance , AND appearance . You 've probably seen all of these vehicles quite recently on the national news but you will not be able to find them in Jane 's . The omission of these almost completely new vehicles is therefore quite surprising.Furthermore , the book does include other derivitive vehicles ( many Chinese and eastern European vehicle entries are little more than locally manufactured variants of Soviet/Russian designed vehicles ) so the above mentioned omission are rather difficult to justify . Therefore , I 've given this edition four stars instead of five . Otherwise , it is a fine reference.Aside from the omissions discussed above at length , the current edition of Janes Tank Recognition Guide is chock full of information and color photos and is a must-have reference for any `` tankspotter '' or military gearhead .	1
This book is full of wisdom and insight for anyone who is seeking to understand how to face the challenges of everyday living . Putting it simply : start with yourself and be kind ! Nothing is static ; change is part of life - accepting that is hard for us to do as we want things easy and simple and what suits us . This book changes my perspective , enabling me to view my life in a healthier way .	1
I just could not put this book down . It is so real and at the same time profund . Honest , pure and addresses all the questions you have in your mind about life . It makes you realise that where you are and what is happening in your life , no matter how dark and hopeless it might seem - that this is what life is and we could not appreciate and enjoy the great times in life if we did n't know what pain and suffering is . It is meant to be and the important thing is to enjoy and bask in ALL of it - cause this is it . As Pema says in the final chapter THE PATH IS THE GOAL . Profund !	1
I first read this book 5 years ago or so . It came to mind again recently . And so I have read it again . Full of wisdom , compassion , love of others and life and self . Our life IS our path .	1
You might think , because this is a slim book , that it will be a quick read , but my advice is to really take your time with htis book . Chodron 's advice is straightforward and simple , but it has a lot ot offer and some meditation will certainly make it sink in deeper.Take your time and really appreciate the words , the advice.I know this book has helped me through some difficult times , as well as helping me forgive myself . Things fall aprt , but eventually they come together again and fall apart again .	1
The story evolves around a Nigerian family - narrated through the voice of 16 year old Kambili Achike . The voice is lucid , and we get insight into corrupt governments and their politics . Kambili 's father is extremely religious , and is too conscious of his patriarchal role in the household ... he often abuses his wife and children in the name of God . Papa will not hesitate to flog his wife or his children when he feels that they have sinned . This family is a microcosm of Nigeria in many ways . According to Adichie , the are so many churches being formed at every corner in Lagos , and yet Nigeria remains one of the most corrupt countries . Kambili and her brother Jaja are prisoners in their own home , until they take a visit to Nsukka , where Aunty Ifeoma lives . Kambili falls in love with Father Amadi , a young Catholic priest who also helps to morph her into a free spirit.The story is all too real . I know people in life who are carbon copies of the characters in the book . `` Purple Hibiscus '' reminds one of how Africa - with its dozens of countries and hundreds of languages - faces similar ills , and shares many cultural aspects . Yes , this novel is also a celebration of Igbo culture - - its cuisine and language . Adichie uses a sizable Igbo vocabulary , but does it very effectively without saturating the novel.The story is very life-like and there are many lessons to draw from . It highlights family life and generational conflicts in Nigeria . It is an amazing debut , I am eagerly awaiting her next work !	1
Like all the other books by this author , this book is an amazing , remarkable work . A must have .	1
One of the best books I 've read in ages . Brilliant main character , riveting scenes and a fascinating structure as the story comes into focus backwards . As the story gels , the book becomes impossible to put down . By the end , I was sorry it was over.Hats off to a genius .	1
This is what I love best about Flashman . A detailed history that I knew nothing about before reading the first page , combined with great heaps of hilarity and action . God Bless Flashman ( because no one else will ) .	1
In this , the twelfth and final Flashman story , we find Sir Harry aboard the ship bringing the Emperor Maximilian 's body back to Austria . But , having seduced an Austria Admiral 's daughter , he finds the need to leave Trieste in a hurry . Accepting a mission to carry gold to the British military mission to Abyssinia , Flashman soon finds himself thrust into a dangerous mission , where he hobnobs with the elite of Abyssinian society and nearly gets killed for his troubles ... repeatedly ! This is another very good Flashman novel , and a fitting end to the series . It contains a lot of action and daring do , and that great tongue-in-cheek humor that make the Flashman books so much fun . I really enjoyed the time I spent with this book . Long live Sir Harry Flashman !	1
This author writes with a depth of knowledge of her locality . You find yourself unable to put the book down , and the biggest disappointment is reaching the end , and wishing there was more . Annie Proulx knows human nature , and is not afraid to delve between the shiny surfaces and pull out the grimy undercurrent which motivates her characters . A must read for real escapism !	1
This book is SOOOOOOOOOOOO good ! For any aspiring teachers out there , I really recommend this book . It teaches you all of the things that school doesnt prepare you for . Such a great book , the second I finished it , I ordered the sequel right away ! I 'm currently waiting for it right now to arrive any day ! !	1
One of my favorite books of all time . If you 've never read any of Torey Hayden 's books , I 'd recommend starting with either this one , or Ghost Girl . One Child really did impact my life ; I will never forget it .	1
This was the last book my mother read before she passed away last year , and she had urged me to read it also . It took me a full year to pick it up , and it is one of the most heartwarming , tearjerking and humorous books I have ever read . I am glad my mother 's last book was such a joy to read - Thank you Frank McCourt .	1
What really sets Mr. McCourt 's story apart from any other memoir , or the rather dramatic ( and appalling ) childhood he led - what really sets it all above the rest , is simply the style . The lack of punctuation , the run-on sentences , no quotation marks ; all give us a truly genuine sense of his thought processes and the swirling madness that was around him . I felt miserable at times , particularly at any point involving going to the restroom in a little hovel outside the McCourt home . Not that it will change anything , but Americans need this kind of literature more than anyone else . We have it so easy , and that is so rarely the case elsewhere .	1
This book takes you back in time . Frank McCourt makes you feel like you are there and right along side him as a boy . Filled with all the emotions a poverty stricken boy must face . If you enjoy a great autobiography ... .then this is a must read .	1
How Frank McCourt survived all the injustices of his childhood astounds me . This is a story of survival against extraordinary odds . You will cry , a lot , but you will laugh too and there are such sweet moments that will remind you that there is goodness of human nature even in such droll circumstances . I could not put this book down ! Everyone should read this book !	1
Obviously , and rather slyly , Frank McCourt informs us that reading about a happy childhood is n't worth our time . Geez , with all the hype about the misery portrayed in the book , I would have expected the majority of McCourt children to be have been wiped out . Instead , the grim reaper gets only 3 out of 7 , and the reader feels cheated . Okay , maybe not that cheated.So , McCourt 's memoir treats us to 360+ pages of misery . Starvation . Desperation . Drunkenness . Classism . It would all be pretty unbearable , except that there 's the sly humour poking out here and there . Can we really trust Frank ? He knows that the more miserable he can make his life the more credibility he has.He treats us to a variety of scenes , many of which we 've seen before , in , oh , Oliver Twist , Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All , Rachel and Her Children . It 's all very fresh though . I 'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt -- either his life was appallingly miserable , with enough Irish charm and humour to make up for the lack of nutritious sustenance ; or McCourt himself has enough charm and humour to repackage a few dozen literary cliches as a tragic but uplifting memoir.Either way , I 'm never touching a Guiness ever again . And I 'll probably finish 'T is pretty soon . And I 'll still dock McCourt for failing to use quotation marks -- an annoying device that fails to communicate anything worth the reading confusion it causes .	1
I saw the author on the Today Show several years ago . I have read this book twice and have seen the movie . Both are great . This guy went through so much as a kid but can tell his story with a dry sense of humor that I love . He 's come a long way since living in the slums of Ireland !	1
This book is really great . It is a story of a young boy , Frank going up in poverty in Ireland in the 1930 's . It 's a must read book for anyone who enjoys true stories .	1
I absolutly love McCourts memoir . Not only does he preserve the Irish culture by maintaining the Irish brogue but also refers to his feelings as they occured during the time of which he writes . McCourt has a peculiar yet refreshing way of making comparisons with the ordinary to the not so ordinary ( i.e : eating an egg - & quot ; if heaven had a taste it would be an egg. & quot ; ) McCourt 's candor about subjects often frowned upon by society ( i.e : some of his confessions to the priest ) and his innocence ( thinking the worse sin is hearing a & quot ; dirty & quot ; story from a friend ) leads the reader to believe his narrative is an authentic account of his child hood . McCourt allows the reader to experience his story by keeping nick-names and other small things which ultimatly produce a hilariouse and touching story . McCourt 's book should not be viewed as didactic ( telling us to be thankful ) or & quot ; a pity-party & quot ; for himseld - he simply seems to be saying , & quot ; sometimes bad things happen and life is rough but years later you go back and laugh at it all ! & quot ; ( 15 yrs . female )	1
I figured I would pick this book up since I will be living in Ireland for one year . Of course , this book is a very different Ireland from today , but I figured it would answer question 's about this generation , and that time.It 's told from the perspective of Frank McCourt . The book stretches from the time he 's three , to the time he 's 16 . They move back to Ireland when he 's 4 years of age and into even worse poverty than they were in when they lived in New York.The book is not as bleak and awful as I thought it would be . Maybe it 's pretty bad and i 'm a moron , but I imagined a pretty dark book.Even through the darkness of the book , McCourts humor rings through it in how he perceived things as a child . The dialogue is wonderful . If not made up , it 's very captivating.The people that come into little Frank 's life are just one jerk or old witchy broad after another , or one Pious schoolmaster or Priest after another . The place he lives is very religious and traditional to the point where McCourt is led to beleive he 's doomed to hell for his petty little sins.HIs alcoholic father is portrayed in such a way that I felt awfully sorry for him and actually sort of liked him ! THis is despite the fact that he sells the remains of their dead son so he can have money for beer , and despite the fact that he works day in and day out only to spend everything on alchohol till they have absolutely no food , and even despite the fact that he goes to England to find a good paying job , but never sends them back any money ! Despite all of this , I REALLY wanted to see his father pull through because he 's such a warm and loving character even if he 's off his rocker and a total loser.There are so many bad echoes of Frank 's past in this book , but i was so intrueged by his style of telling it , as though you know something better is coming.The title , I imagine , probably refers to all the children their family loses throughout the corse of the book ; another devestating aspect of the family life.I 'm reading `` T'is '' right now , which is the sequel to this book , and I love it even better than this book ! I ca n't wait to finish it and I ca n't wait till `` The Teacher Man '' comes out in November .	1
The story of McCourt 's young life is certainly enough to make you thankful for your own early beginnings . It was sad , funny and ultimately victorious of a sort . I plan to read & # 34 ; Tis & # 34 ; .	1
Angela 's Ashes is a strange book . Frank McCourt 's ability to find humor in the least expected situations of life is quite extraordinary . Around the mid part of the book , it is perfect and really unstoppable as the characters grow on you . McCourt lived in Limerick , Ireland with his family after his parents moved from USA.His experiences in school , farms , castles , workplaces , hospitals , Laman Griffin , hills , bars , green sofas and at various grocery stores and sundry are all contained within this book.Despite his character flaws , Frank 's father was my favourite character of the book . His awkward style , his funny formal yet dinty , his och aye 's , his mannerisms of an aristocrat ( who wouldnt go out asking for help but would let his wife and children do the same ) , his patriotic drunkards ' swag , his silent confused love-hate relationship with Angela and his keen optimistic religious side is what really intrigued me . It was sad when the book ended without a word from him . Also Angela never finds out what happens to her red dress and that was a tad queer but then again , there already are a thousand problems in Frank 's interesting life . `` Angela 's Ashes '' is not just a memoir , it 's a confession . There is nothing conventional about the author 's overenthusiastic yet calm writing skill . He comes accross as the most patient , keen , willing to work , flexible family man . Frank was the eldest son and he suffered from typhoid and an eye disease . I loved the Uncles and couldnt stop myself from laughing when Frank wore his dead grandmother 's black suit . Frank took those jabs at his head with a light heart . To me , one of the funniest points in the book were the ones where the author , as a kid , would refrain from asking questions in fear of getting jabs at his head by the elders.Ireland 's description , as a nation , is unique and wins heart . It 's good to hear about the opinions of various types of people long gone and forgotten . Religion , catholics and protestants , their hate relationship with their hell and heaven concepts were quite interesting.I didnt know what to think once this book ended and I will definintely be reading the sequel titled `` 'T is '' soon . Some other things I loved about this book include Question Quigley , the teachers at school , Aunt Auggie , Paddy , Michael McCourt , Malachy McCourt , Angela 's dance partner in the `` good old days '' who 's also Paddy 's father , Eugene and Oliver 's twin love relationship.I cried a lot when I read about Eugene and Oliver 's demise . It was heartbreaking when one tries to console each other in few futile ways upon the death of a near loved one in the immediate family.I absolutely love this book	1
Och . It 's a word you see alot of in this book . Also the repetition of a familiar theme : Drunken father comes home in middle of the night after drinking his wages ( or his dole money ) at the pub and wakes his children up . Forces them to stand or march in place as he offers them a penny to die for Ireland . What precedes this madness is dysfunctional , codependent mom waiting hopefully , then less hopefully as time goes by , for said husband to come home with wages . Och , och indeed.In between this sad tale we have the McCourt children , in constant need of food , milk , coal , housing , and most of all , sane parenting . The miracle of this book is that McCourt finds the humor , the blessed humor in what otherwise would be one of the most depressing tales since Dickens . Their poverty is just plain awful to read about . Three of the McCourt children die in infancy or a little beyond , because their parents do not get medical care in time.It 's a tale of survival , a lyrical jaunt through the madness of dysfunction , ignorance , and threadbare familial love . You could see it as a tale of hope , if only you do n't wonder what damage was done to these McCourt child survivors that can never be repaired . If your childhood was tough , this book is for you . However bad it was , this might make you feel like you did a lot better . Cheers to McCourt for this bitter tale of woe with a pinch of hope thrown in .	1
It is amazing that a man could live through the things Mr. McCourt did and not only find the courage to write about it , but to be humorous and uplifting about it . The child in the book knew his lot in life and still enjoyed it . What a lesson for us all to appreciate the things we have and love those around us while we have them . This book was inspiring and oddly enough , although it was terribly depressing in many parts , it was genuinely uplifting as well . The courage and strength of Frank and his mother and brothers should be a lesson to us all that there is always a bright side to life if we only look for it hard enough . I would recommend this book to anyone .	1
I have read many books , but I have never cried reading a book . This book is very sad and goes right to the heart . I could not put this book down . I wish that it never ended . I laughed at some moments and I cried . This has to be one of my favorite books . I dont have a top ten list yet but when I have one I know that this book will be in it . I recommand everyone reading this book .	1
While this book details the Ireland we are all familiar with ... poverty , war , alcohol ... Frank McCourt defines every humorous memory which brightens the scene . I admit I was n't drawn to this book like some good stories . It began very slowly and every member of his family seemed to be dying left and right . However , once I got to the final 150 pages ( Frank 's teen years ) , I could n't put it down.It is disturbing how much control religion has over one 's mind ; however , seen through the eyes of a child it is entertaining.Do n't expect a close-knit family when you sit down to read this . This is not a family that sticks together . Aside from his father , McCourt 's aunt and grandmother are & quot ; tight & quot ; even when they have a little to spare . However , those in the lane who have less always seem to come through for others in the town which is enlightening.I am still debating whether I want to read the sequel , 'T is .	1
Do n't let the title fool you . This is no chick book . It 's the gritty biographical story of a boy growing up in the desparately poor conditions of WWII Ireland . The writing style is unsual , but the story is compelling . This is real history , not fiction . I will admit the title put me off from reading for years , but a recent NPR review at the time of the author 's death changed my mind . I 'm glad it did . I 'll never see Ireland ( or England ) in quite the same way again .	1
Angela 's Ashes is one of my favorite books of all times . The story of the family as they lived in the slums of Ireland is both heartbreaking and heartwarming . Death , desertion and the resolve to leave Ireland and go back to America makes this a classic story . Loved this book !	1
If you listen to our daily podcasts , you heard us talk about the passing of Frank McCourt -- an event that was , shall we say , overshadowed by the deaths of people like Michael Jackson , Walter Cronkite and Ed McMahon . While he was not as well known as any of those three , McCourt was , in the world of book lovers , one of a kind . He spent most of his life as a school teacher before deciding one day to go ahead and write a memoir of his early life in the extreme poverty of Ireland . His was certainly not the first book on the subject , but it is , arguably , the most lyrical . You simply can not read `` Angela 's Ashes '' without hearing his voice . Literally . The Irish lilt comes through beautifully in the writing , making the book itself seem like a rambling reminiscence from a favorite uncle . ( Unless your uncle happens to be from Estonia , in which case it probably does n't . ) Still , I defy anyone who claims to be literate and to enjoy reading good books to come away with anything but positive feelings for `` Angela 's Ashes . '' It 's the kind of book that reminds me why I love reading . And if you can read it without developing a bit of a lump in your throat and without laughing at the description of a kid `` throwing up Jesus Christ , '' there 's probably something wrong with you .	1
It takes a masterful storyteller to make readers laugh while detailing a story of oppressive poverty , chronic illness , despicable alcohol abuse and the death of three siblings . But that 's exactly what Frank McCourt does . With straightforward , non-judgmental prose , the author weaves a tale of survival at the most elemental level , detailing the life of the McCourt family , an Irish Catholic clan struggling to make it in poverty-stricken Limerick , Ireland , in the 1930s . To describe the McCourts ' life as 'miserable ' does n't do it justice . Yet somehow , through the misery , this amazing author is able to find laughter , joy , irony and hope . Do n't let the depressing setting fool you . This might be the most uplifting memoir I 've ever read -- and one of the best.Salmon Run	1
This is one of the few books which impressed me most and scared me at the same time . I do not understand why humans can be as stupid as appearently they are and do not act in time to avoid the drama which perhaps our generation will no face but a very next one .	1
Using a solid , conservative methodology , the author paints a frightening picture of the climatic changes that lie before us as Earth grows hotter from greenhouse-gas emissions.I was torn between assigning this book four stars or five . While there 's nothing about this book I do n't like , I did n't want to be influenced by my own conviction of the overriding importance of this topic for all of us , and have tried to grade the book purely on the basis of my reaction to it as a book.But the topic is urgent and important , and Mark Lynas has treated it effectively and with authority . His approach was to review all the published scientific literature he could find on climate modeling and paleoclimatology . His sources therefore consist exclusively of peer-reviewed scientific papers : no pop-science books , interviews , or mass-market magazine articles . He created a database of articles and organized them into categories according to the amount of warming they discussed : 1 degree Celsius , 2 degrees Celsius , and so on up to 6 degrees.The book builds up a picture of the heating Earth , each chapter notching the average temperature one degree higher . At 1 degree , for example , Lynas discusses the likely desertification of the American West . The great plains ranging east of the Rockies north to Saskatchewan are actually an ancient dune-field covered with a thin layer of soil held in place by plants . Climate models show its likely reversion to a more drought-stricken regime that has also existed in the ancient past . The result will be the death of the plants , and blowing away of the topsoil -- just as happened with the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma in the 1930s . This new Dust Bowl will be much larger and more enduring -- and where will all the people go ? That 's only one heading in the 1-degree chapter ; there are nine more , including the slowing or stopping of the Gulf Stream , the melting of the Arctic icecap , and the die-off of coral reefs . Then it 's on to chapter 2 , with 11 headings of its own . The effects he looks at are diverse , sometimes smaller , such as the extinctions of individual species , but mostly much larger , such as the severe droughts and mass migrations we can expect when the world 's mountain glaciers -- source of much of our drinking-water -- finally disappear , as they are rapidly doing right now.By the time we get to 6 degrees , the point is abundantly clear : we must not let this happen . At that point our planet will be ice-free , largely desert , and whipped by `` hypercanes '' vastly more powerful than today 's strongest storms . In Lynas 's personal opinion , the human species will likely survive , but it will be a small remnant , and one of only a few survivors of this great extinction event.Still relatively buried in the scientific literature are discussions of positive-feedback loops that may -- indeed likely will -- lie ahead : mechanisms that will accelerate warming beyond our ability to stop or control it . One such is the melting of tundra permafrost , which will likely release methane in large quantities , a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than CO2 . Another is the awesome storehouse of methane as hydrates on the continental shelves , which may be released as the oceans warm.Based on his survey , Lynas finds that our window of opportunity to head off the worst of it is very small indeed . We have almost certainly already crossed the threshold of 2 degrees of global warming , so the first two chapters are a snapshot of how our world will look just a few years from now . Indeed , the current droughts in Atlanta , California , Portugal , Australia , and elsewhere are themselves the manifestation of the process unfolding.Lynas sums up with a discussion of what 's stopping us from acting more vigorously , as well a look at the magnitude of the task . It makes for mighty sobering reading.His prose is vigorous , vivid , and confident . Lynas has studied the climate for years , and visited remote spots of the globe . To be sure , I found the message depressing . It 's all the scarier because it 's not hysterical -- it 's lifted right out of peer-reviewed papers . But it has woken me from my own torpor of denial . Whatever decisions we each make , we should be informed . And this book provides an especially crucial kind of information .	1
The book & # 34 ; Six Degrees & # 34 ; by Mark Lynas has been very challenging for me to read , mostly because it has endless references to past climate conditions . I understand that is part of how he decided to calculate what lies ahead for our planet for the future , but I have had to read and re-read passages to understand what he was trying to say . Still , I think it 's an important book for our times and the climate predictions he has laid out need to be looked at closely by policymakers if we are to avert further climate crises .	1
This book is by far the best of the lot I read this year . It tells a captivating , compelling and moving story of a woman that fought all her life , fought for everything she held . She is proud , she is wise , she is patient , she is strong . Left all alone in a foreign country with no means of support , she fought her way to become Queen and to protect the country in her charge.The book made me laugh and made me cry ( albeit more often the latter ) . I thought it was a great choice by the author to intercept third-party narration of the book with first-person confession-like segments , for it allows the reader to see the real person behind the political figure of the Katherine , Queen of England , her feelings , her pain , her anguish and her proudest moments . She is a very strong character and as such , one can not remain impassive towards her . She truly shaped her own destiny because she believed in it so.The book really moved and inspired me . It was a very enjoyable read and I highly recommend it .	1
Starts off slows and ends with a whimper , but the meat of the story , Catherine of Aragon 's widowhood after the death of Arthur , Prince of Wales , and her eventual marriage to his brother , Henry VIII , is rich and thoughtful . Gregory does Tudor fiction like no one else .	1
As with all Phillipa Gregory 's books it is hard to put down her interpretation of the life and times of Katherine is quiet intelligent and makes you believe and hope that it was like that	1
Stormed Fortress is the eighth novel in the WARS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW series by Janny Wurts , and the fifth and final novel in the Alliance of Light sub-arc . I 've reviewed every novel in the series so far , and all of those reviews have been extremely positive , so by now it 's probably no secret that I 'm a huge fan of these books and their author . That being said , Stormed Fortress is an outstanding novel even by the incredibly high standards of this series.The conflict between the half-brothers Lysaer and Arithon continues unabated . The fortress mentioned in the book 's title is Alestron , home of the s'Brydion family which has played such a large and complex role in the conflict between Lysaer , the false avatar of the Light , and Arithon , the Master of Shadow . Lysaer leads the forces of his Alliance of Light to the s'Brydions ' doorstep , and through no fault of his own Arithon is drawn there too , which sets up the confrontation between the two half-brothers that 's been brewing throughout this arc.Plot threads that were introduced four books ago at the start of the Alliance of Light arc come to fruition in Stormed Fortress . All the setup that took place in the earlier books pays off here , from Arithon 's involuntary doppelganger Fionn Areth to Lysaer 's complex and fascinating henchman Sulfin Evend . The Koriathain continue to plot , with Arithon 's love interest Elaira caught in the middle , and the Fellowship of Seven balances its long-term duties and goals with the immediate danger posed to the key players in this story.As you 'd expect from the title , a siege plays an important part in the plot of Stormed Fortress . And as people who are familiar with Janny Wurts would probably expect , the author describes this siege in a way that 's second to none . Just like the previous book in the series contained a description of a necromantic ritual that simply blew every other instance of necromancy in fantasy out of the water in terms of depth and attention to detail , what we get in Stormed Fortress is almost the platonic ideal of the description of a siege . The tension is practically unbearable , not in the least because the author manages to maintain it for hundreds of pages and describes it from various points of view , from the common soldier on up : '' Let us do what we can for your people . '' Hard-set , dedicated to practical mercy , Talvish shouldered his captaincy . He was no sorcerer , no musician , no blood-born seer stung by the vista of far-sighted consequence . He accepted that he had naught else to give but the conviction of human resolve.The amazing thing about this series is that it 's incredibly complex , but in a completely different way than you 'd expect based on its size . Writing even a basic summary of the state of affairs at the end of this eighth novel would take up several pages . Janny Wurts achieves this level of complexity with a relatively small cast of characters , as opposed to series like Steven Erikson 's MALAZAN BOOK OF THE FALLEN , which features huge numbers of characters and races . With Janny Wurts , the complexity lies instead in the web of motivations that drives each of her characters , both as individuals and as part of whatever group or faction they belong to . Before I started reading this series , I was told that `` it does n't sprawl , it deepens '' -- and now , after having read everything but the newest novel Initiate 's Trial , I understand completely what was meant by this : the story that 's being told here is essentially the same as the one we started out with at the beginning of The Curse of the Mistwraith , but throughout the series the author continues to reveal additional layers , reposition the markers , and explore the characters ' relationships and Athera 's deepest mysteries in ever-increasing depth . It 's no wonder that this is one of those series people end up reading and re-reading over and over.I 'm starting to get to the point where I will buy extra copies of The Curse of the Mistwraith , the first book in the WARS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW , to hand out to fantasy fans who have n't discovered the series yet . It 's simply incomprehensible to me that more people are n't reading these books . The entire series is back in print in the U.S. , and the latest book in the series , Initiate 's Trial , is coming out today , so if you are looking for an intellectually challenging but incredibly rewarding fantasy series to read , this is a great time to get started .	1
I thought that it dragged in the middle and at times and was a bit choppy . It did , however , hold my interest .	1
Another wonderful memoir from McCourt , famed author of `` Angela 's Ashes , '' about his childhood in Ireland . McCourt wrote `` Angela 's '' when he was in his 60 's , and this book takes us back to the thirty years before he became an author , when he was a decidedly less-famous high school English teacher in New York City . As the book opens , McCourt is a brand new teacher struggling to get his footing in a difficult career . Unable to get his students interested in the actual curricula , McCourt instead spends most of his class periods telling his kids the stories of his youth -- stories that eventually became `` Angela 's Ashes '' and its sequel , `` 'T is . '' In the middle of his tales , he 'd often slip in some lesson about grammar or literature , sneaking every bit of education into his students ' brains that he could . Though he was sure he 'd get fired any day for his unorthodox teaching methods . Instead , he is mostly embraced by his peers and superiors , and , over time , grows to love his job intensely.This book made me both wish I were a teacher and feel glad that I was n't , which , I think , means it perfectly describes both the experience and profession ( I 'm the only non-teacher in a family full of teachers , so I know somewhat of what I speak ) . Another masterfully-written and thoroughly engaging book by one of today 's most talented memoirists . Not to be missed !	1
Teacher Man is a yet another masterful memoir of Pulitzer Prize winner , Frank McCourt . It is not hyperbole to call McCourt brilliant . Only a person of considerable talent and good humor could make a childhood of severe poverty , deprivation and misery enjoyable reading material , as he did so adroitly in Angela 's Ashes . McCourt 's talent is on full display once again in Teacher Man in which he recalls , in spellbinding fashion , the ups and downs , triumphs and failures , self doubt and accomplishment experienced over 30 years of teaching.One might expect that a memoir of a high school English teacher would be rather boring . But McCourt 's humor and lyricism - the Irish charm that carried him for so many years in his professional career - inject in each story a life that a writer of lesser ability would never be able to capture . Though he probably had thousands from which to choose , McCourt did a superb job of selecting the most funny , sometimes moving , stories to retell.McCourt 's most endearing quality might be his humility . If you did n't read the book 's prologue , you would never get the sense in Teacher Man that McCourt ever won a Pulitzer Prize ( or ever accomplished anything in life . ) This self-described `` half-assed '' teacher , who claims to have bluffed his way through virtually his entire teaching career ( which spanned the 1960 's through 1980 's ) , really appears to have been something of an innovator in the classroom . Supposedly because he did n't have the backbone to take control of his classes or the knowledge to teach his students `` real '' grammar and composition skills , McCourt resorted to unorthodox teaching methods like having his students read , sing and play music to recipes in cookbooks . Nowadays , `` good teachers '' are those that , like McCourt , find ways to engage and inspire their students.No doubt , McCourt has his own view of the world at large and makes that view known in various places in this book . But , unlike his brother Malachy , who comes off in his books as a bitter , arrogant , know-it-all , Frank backs off when he starts getting `` preachy '' . His tendency to do this keeps his writing entertaining , yet persuasive , and frees the reader of guilt and shame for the state of things ( poverty , way in which teachers are viewed in American society , the sins of the Catholic Church in Ireland , etc . ) .Many critics have said this is a must-read for teachers . In truth , it 's a must-read for the rest of us `` half-assed '' professionals in the world who have wondered when we will ever find our niche , hit our stride in our careers .	1
Super read , very fast and informative . He writes exactly like he talks on Hell 's Kitchen . You will not be bored .	1
The story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn is about as well-known as any in English history , the subject of countless mini-series , movies , novels and bodice-rippers ( notably the Other Boleyn Girl ) . Mantel succeeds in breathing new life into it by taking as the protagonist the rather grim figure of Thomas Cromwell , usually seen as the villain of the piece . Of course , the other thing that differentiates this work from most of the others is the wealth of historical research that has gone into it and a true effort to see the characters from the vantage point of the age in which they lived , rather than trying to graft 20th or 21 century characteristics into them.The cast is enormous and there 's sometimes confusion between so many characters sharing the same name -- the Marys , Annes , and others . This is but a small problem . The attentive reader soon learns to distinguish between them , not least due to the author 's ability to paint characters with small but telling brush strokes.There are so many larger-than-life characters -- Cardinal Wolsey , Henry himself , Anne , her sister Mary , the Princess Mary , Sir Thomas More and his family -- and on and on.Henry is a spoiled child who never had to grow up , imbued with the certainty , shared by all around him , that he is God 's chosen on earth . Even after death , he and they believed , there is a special part of heaven for kings.Anne Boleyn , clever and calculating , proud , insecure , vain , cruel.Sir Thomas More , sanctimonious saint , in love with his own rectitude , who does n't hesitate to whip his children and servants and torture and execute anyone he suspects of doctrinal impurity -- a kind of Kenneth Starr of his day . In its portrayal of More and his silly quest for martyrdom , the author asks us to consider what exactly is the nature of sainthood . Who should we canonize -- the extremist unable to compromise or the realist who accepts that he is working with imperfect humans and yet gets things done.Most of all , we grow to love and respect Cromwell , who is supremely intelligent and resourceful , who has the courage to tell the king that wars are bad because they bankrupt the country . Cromwell is loyal to a fault . He does n't abandon Wolsey , his patron , when all others do . He is also compassionate . He was beaten as a child and will not beat his own children . He is fluent in many languages and understands that a new age is coming based on commerce and technology . He is impatient with the Catholic Church and its machinations . He is also highly ambitious and vengeful to those who wrong him -- though he will hardly admit this even to himself.In that way , this book is a rejoinder to Robert Bolt 's `` Man for All Seasons '' which beatifies More while casting Cromwell as the evil genius determined to kill him . Bolt 's talky play , with its endless speechifying , seems dated today . In Mantel 's version , it 's unclear which principle More is standing on.This book is subtle . Not everything is stated directly . One ca n't always trust the narrator . But its chief virtue is that it creates an entire world peopled with convincing characters . The court of Henry VIII was not a very easy place in which to live and thrive . Thomas Cromwell manages to do both better than anyone else because he is a pragmatic man who plays on the strengths and weaknesses of others . Ultimately of course , he makes a fatal mistake which brings him down . But that is not within the scope of this book . It happens presumably in the sequel , which I for one hope the author is working on right now .	1
Hilary Mantel 's historical novel pulls you in at page one and does not loosen it 's grip . The plot puts you squarely in the shoes of Thomas Cromwell , and the era come alive through his eyes as he survives and thrives in the most uncertain of times . The court and courtiers of Henry VIII are as real as the people in your neighborhood or workplace . You will not soon forget them . I hated to see this novel end , and immediately bought the Kindle version of the sequel , Bring Up the Bodies . Having devoured that one , I now wait impatiently for the third novel in the series to be published .	1
`` The king spoke , saying to the wise men of Babylon , 'Whoever reads this writing , and tells me its interpretation , shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck ; and he shall be the third ruler in the kingdom . ' '' -- Daniel 5:7 ( NKJV ) Despite the elaborate praise that has accompanied Wolf Hall , I found it hard to get excited about the prospect of reading once again about Henry the Eighth . Within a few pages , I was totally disarmed by Hilary Mantel 's unique story-telling style . She moves away from what historians focus on ( the big events and the most powerful people ) to emphasize character as portrayed in the little events . As a result , Henry the Eighth is at the edge of this book , rather than in the center.Wolf Hall is primarily the story of Thomas Cromwell and his pursuit of helpful solutions for all those he comes into contact with , provided in the context of utter loyalty . . . first to Cardinal Wolsey and later to Henry the Eighth , Anne Boleyn , and those who depend on Cromwell.The book is so wonderfully subtle that I found myself rereading many sections , smiling at the various ways that story threads are developed ( usually in several ways , overtly and subtly , at the same time ) . As a result , the story is fresh , new , and very interesting both for content and style.After reading about half the book , I had an epiphany . . . This book was also designed to be improved by being read aloud , as are all of the best novels . I managed to find a copy of Simon Slater 's reading of the unabridged version and was wonderfully rewarded by listening to what I had just read . It was four times better as a recording than in my silent reading.I recommend you forget reading the book and just listen to it instead . You 'll be amazed.Was I convinced by her portrayal of Thomas Cromwell ? I do n't know the historical record well enough to have an opinion . I certainly ended up with a revised view of Sir Thomas More ( having been a fan of `` A Man for All Seasons '' as a lad ) after thinking about him in the context of the Reformation.Listen and be filled with joy .	1
Historical fiction is a tricky business , and it 's very easy to get it wrong . Too little detail makes such a book unconvincing , and too much makes it read like nonfiction . Dated language inevitably sounds corny , but modern characters in historical settings all end up sounding like Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman theorizing about racial and gender equality as she performs the first mammogram in the Old West . And then it 's all for nothing if you pick a historical period that just does n't grab anyone.Hilary Mantel has navigated this minefield well . At the moment the Tudors are about as sexy as a bunch of unwashed barely-post-medieval Londoners could ever hope for , so she already had a head start . And in following such an intriguing character as Thomas Cromwell - essentially following Barbara Tuchman 's dictum of focusing on a figure who was n't a king but was still influential enough to be at the center of things - Mantel had no lack of material to work with . The result is enjoyable and informative in no small part due to Mantel 's deft balancing of historical and personal detail . If Tudor England is at all of interest to you , read this book.My one quibble is with a narrative device Mantel uses throughout the book . She more or less allows Cromwell to claim the third person singular pronoun for his own - pretty much any sentence or clause starting with `` he '' refers to Cromwell . I suppose the idea here is that we are following Cromwell , so of course `` he '' is Cromwell , and we are meant to trust the narrator to clarify if she is referring to someone else . But the approach is jarring and unnecessarily distracting . One minute she is talking about King Henry , and suddenly `` he '' is several sentences along in a speech before the reader realizes that `` he '' is Cromwell and not the King . The idea is clever and inventive , but for me at least , it was unsuccessful.Nonetheless , Wolf Hall is a brilliant book , and I 'm looking forward to the next installment .	1
I got the book on a Wednesday and by the following week had finished it . It was so riveting I could n't put it down ( except to work ) . It has a very detailed picture of the time full of smells and tastes and culture at all levels , with an equally interesting point of view : I 'd always read Thomas Cromwell as a villain and he certainly is n't in this exciting present tense work . I 've recommended it to all my reading friends .	1
Good writers have the ability to transport readers to different worlds by the simple medium of words . Hilary Mantel is one of them.The story of Henry VIII and his many marriages has been told before . But this is a version seen from another angle . Henry , Anne Boleyn and the stars in other depictions here become pawns of another player 's game . Though it is Henry 's and Anne 's desire for a marriage blessed , if not sanctified , by the church around which much of the book centers , it is the character and vision of Thomas Cromwell provides the driving force and interest.Cromwell , deftly portrayed as the pragmatic genius he obviously was , is made admirable , if not totally likeable by Mantell . We are made privy to his inmost thoughts and motivations as he maneuvers Henry , Anne and the peers of the realm to achieve his goal of transforming the medieval kingdom to a modern nation.Cromwell rises from the abused child of a brutal blacksmith to a renaissance man who `` can draft a contract , train a falcon , draw a map , stop a street fight , furnish a house and fix a jury . '' He manipulates Henry , Anne and the rest of the scheming Boleyn family to achieve his end of wresting Britain from beneath the heel of Romish domination.In other versions Cromwell has been depicted as a Machiavellian upstart while Thomas More is the stalwart saint defending religious faith even at the cost of his life . Here Cromwell is plausibly shown as a devoted family man who wants a better life for the commoners , a loyal friend and mentor to many younger men . He even shows compassion for his enemies , providing them with means to escape the worst fate has in store for them . In contrast , More is a petty , stubborn religious zealot who mistreats his wife , abuses servants and tortures alleged heretics.And , with our foreknowledge of history , Wolf Hall , seat of the Seymour family , looms in the distance as a reminder of what 's to come.No easy beach-read this . There 's a confusing array of names and titles to remember , the panorama of historical events and the shifting points of view . But , then , if it 's only diversion you seek , why not just watch TV ? This is a book to savor . I 've read a sequel is in the works . I 'm eager to read it .	1
Although it was a bit slow at times , overall this rendition of the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn told from the perspective of Cromwell is very interesting .	1
Hillary Mantel 's duly well-praised novel tells the story of Thomas Cromwell 's rise to power during the tumultuous years between the fall of Cardinal Wolsey and the rise of Ann Bolyen . If these names are not familiar to you , then perhaps Wolf Hall might be a hard read , but if you have any knowledge of Tudor history and the reputation of these characters , especially Thomas Cromwell , generally portrayed as villain and Thomas More , generally portrayed as a saint , then this complex , beautifully written novel will offer pleasures and insights that will give the reader a beguiling read . In the realm of Joycean stream-of-consciousness , Wolf Hall moves through the early modern world like a roving camera , noticing telling details , snippets of conversation , random brutality , love and loss , and the forceful destruction of the English Catholicism at the behest and for the benefit of Henry VIII . To American readers , this all might not seem important or relevant , but if you know anything about how our democracy and rights evolved , then you know the roots of American culture lie in the English Protestant Revolution . It all starts here , and Hillary Mantel gives us a masterpiece to discover .	1
Mantel chose probably one of the most enigmatic players of Tudor England , the oft-vilified Thomas Cromwell , to explore the court of Henry VIII . Cromwell , who deftly weaves between memories of his childhood and present 16th-century day , is presented as a tolerant , wise lawyer with a business acumen unsurpassed in his time.Born a mere commoner into abject poverty , Cromwell rose through the ranks of the Tudor court in meteoric fashion . The right-hand man of Cardinal Wolsey , himself the son of a butcher , Cromwell deftly avoided the Cardinal 's sad fate by delivering to Henry VIII precisely what the Cardinal could not : a divorce from Katherine of Aragon.Wolsey appears in the pages as benevolent , if slightly bewildered by the unexpected rise of Anne Boleyn . `` ... Anne is not a carnal being , she is a calculating being , with a cold slick brain at work behind her hungry black eyes . '' After his demise at the hands of the Boleyn family , Cromwell becomes the go-to man of Henry himself and facilitates England 's break with the Pope and the Church of Rome.And while the reader certainly becomes a part of Cromwell 's life , it should not be mistaken that this novel is entirely about Thomas Cromwell . The novel is , in point of fact , a full-fledged portrait of the Henry VIII 's court : the characters , the intrigue and the political backroom deals where fortunes were made and heads were lost . `` There 's no man in the room who does n't want Henry to have what he wants . Their lives and fortunes depend on it . `` The Duke of Norfolk ( `` If you tell Norfolk anything , he will twist it into treason . '' ) skips nimbly across the pages , a coarse man full of bluster , while Thomas More is bent on ecclesiastical vengeance , determined to stamp out the Protestant tidal wave sweeping Europe : `` He would chain you up , for a mistranslation . He would , for a difference in your Greek , kill you . `` Harry Norris , Thomas Wyatt , Mary Boleyn , Stephen Gardiner , Charles Brandon all feature prominently and are , for the student of Tudor history , a veritable feast of characters.Overflowing with period detail and a droll wit , this is not an introductory novel to the Tudors . The sheer volume of characters and the depth of their motivations make this a complex story better suited , or at least most enjoyed , by those who have a good grasp of the historical players of the time.I thought the novel was , quite simply , brilliant.Word on the street is that Mantel will produce a sequel to Wolf Hall , one that continues to follow Cromwell 's rise to power vis-a-vis Henry 's marriage to his third wife , Jane Seymour , which will produce the long-awaited male heir to the Tudor throne .	1
I found Hilary Mantel 's portrait of Thomas Cromwell to be very compelling . He 's a very decent man in his personal life . However , he 's willing to do questionable things for the sake of his career . It 's hard to hold this against him , though , because he 's merely reacting to the conditions of his world and using the resources he has to make the best of his situation.The historical setting feels very real ; it is made more real by the fact that Cromwell is a character that modern career-oriented people can empathize with . I found it easy to place myself in his position .	1
As familiar as the era may be from many books and many movies and TV series , this view of Tudor England as reflected in the life of Thomas Cromwell is believable and extremely sensitive to how people may have thought and lived . Maybe a little far-fetched to think they spoke as wittily as Oscar Wilde or Jane Austen characters , but certainly entertaining . On finishing it I had to start the sequel immediately ... after that , I do n't know where I 'll go .	1
Mantel is a terrific writer and offers a new take on the times of Henry 8 . I like the use of humor : she 's very good at it . And Cromwell comes alive . One of the best historicals ever	1
History textbooks usually show the big picture , events and people from a disinterested 30,000 foot perspective . Wolf Hall tells the fascinating story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn from the point of view of one of its most interesting and important characters , Thomas Cromwell . I 'm looking forward to the next installment .	1
I 'm quite sure Christians will see this book as an attack . What they need to understand is that they 've been imposing their views and even attacking and killing people for thousands of years in the name of God and Christ , neither of which can be verified to exist or to be who they are proclaimed to be.I 've been saying for a long time that believing in something there 's no proof of and something perpetuated by threats , guilt and condemnation makes no sense whatsoever . So this is a great analogy which hopefully will help to reduce some of the brainwashing in this culture.Be a Christian if you want , but be an informed one ! Understand that you have A perspective and not THE perspective , and everyone else has a right to make up their mind as well.Ramen ! ! !	1
Completely irreverent book that examines logic and dearly held beliefs in a manner to make one see the ridiculous in both . Loved it .	1
Bird Cloud is not so much a personal memoir as it is a memoir about the author 's mind , her wide-ranging and fascinating interests . Her own family history . The history of the land where she chose to build a home ( but encountered constant difficulties and obstacles during its construction ) . Her poignant recounting of the European settlers ' violence against both wildlife and native Americans . And her constant vigilance over and delight in the many species of birds that also made their home on her acquired land.For those who have marveled at Proulx 's fiction , this book offers a look at the sort of mind from which that body of work emerged . She appears to have the inclinations of a scholar and the spirit of a pioneer	1
Considered pragmatic by her friends especially the Duchess of Suffolk Catherine Brandon , twice widowed Katherine Parr became the sixth wife of King Henry VIII , a position not known for its longevity . Perhaps it was the experience gained from being wedded to two much older husbands , bur Katherine proved her practical nature by surviving four years with the elderly monarch until he died , making her unique as the Dowager Queen , . Within a few months of becoming a widow again , Katherine marries Thomas Seymour , whom she was in love with before Henry `` exiled '' him to Brussels so he could marry her ; he since has returned to England and become a confidante of Princess Elizabeth . They have a daughter Mary , but was her last marriage a happy one ponders Catherine as Thomas seems more fascinated with the princess than his once royal wife ? This is an interesting biographical fiction novel that looks deep into the latter part of the life of Katherine Parr , mostly from just after she became a thrice widow . The story is told almost exclusively by Catherine looking back after Katherine has died in 1548 so lacks a historiographic counterpoint as the subject 's best friend distrusted her last ambitious husband , who she believed married the `` Widow '' for her political connections . One interesting side note is that the vernacular used is twenty-first century ( explained why by Suzannah Dunn in an afterward ) so that purists who prefer Shakespearean English should pass as the idioms are technologically modern ; thou who find Shakespeare as `` ye olde '' English will appreciate the anachronism . Well written , THE SIXTH WIFE provides a fascinating slant on the Tudor age especially life near the top during the five years after Henry 's demise.Harriet Klausner	1
I ca n't get enough of your books and read and re-read them . I have transitioned from paperback into kindle versions for travelling . Beautiful title and story .	1
Although this book was hard to read at times because of the disturbing content it was a book I 'm very glad I read ! The book was well written and gave the reader an insight into the world of foster care parents ! Bravo !	1
Written with true empathy compassion and caring . So disturbing that this happens . Hope the future gives her peace and comfort .	1
What I liked best about this story is that Cathy , Jodie 's caretaker , kept the focus on Jodie and less on herself unless her reflections and actions filled in the blanks . ( See my review about Max and his mother ) Even though this child suffered from unspeakable acts from truly evil people , there is hope in the world , as long as Cathy and others like her keep doing what they do .	1
I read this in a day , hardly being able to put it down . Cathy Glass is someone who has a special soul . There are not many people who could provide such care to such a troubled child . I give her so much credit . The story of Jodie was heartbreaking and I will always wonder how she is , years from now . I have an idea that she truly is 'Damaged ' beyond repair . And that 's what is pathetic ... . it could have been prevented if someone had been doing their job as a social worker . It boggles my mind that she COULD have had a normal life , if not for the monster 's who tortured this helpless human being from nearly the day she was born . I hope these animals get what they deserve . No child should ever have to endure the horrors that little Jodie was dealt with .	1
This was a book that shows how some kids get looked over by the state but it is not the states fault it is because there is so many unwanted , unneeded families that need help and no one is there to think of what is best for the kids .	1
This book is written by a Cathy Glass , who takes on the care of a 6 year old foster child named Jodie . Although this woman had had many foster children in her home over the years , Jodie turns out to be very damaged from unimaginable things done to her . As her story slowly unfolds , I found myself crying for this little child , getting angry at an over-burdened foster care system and hoping there would be a happy ending to this true story . The story does not take place in America , but could have happened anywhere . Cathy Glass and her family try every way possible to reach Jodie . There are breakthoughs , but eventually it becomes evident she needs institutional care . Cathy Glass and her family continue to visit with Jodie , but the child was so damaged that she can not form much of a bond with them . This story hit close to home because my brother and his wife , who have two sons of their own , began the adoption of a young boy about 10 . It turned out they were never given the full information about him by the system . He had been in and out of foster care many times , and returned more than once to abusive parents . He eventually created an emotional `` wall '' to protect himself from further hurt , and they were unable to break down that wall . Sadly , after trying for a long time , they were unable to help him . He ended up in several more foster homes and is now , as an adult , living in an institutional setting . They occasionally hear from him , and he continues to refer to him as mom and dad . The reality of how these innocent children were abused beyond help of a normal life is sad but true . And the greater reality is that if someone suspects a child is being mistreated , do n't look the other way , report it . Your claim will be investigated and your identify will not be revealed , but you may be able to help rescue a child from unspeakable abuse and the chance for a normal life . In the case of Jodie , and also the boy my brother 's family wanted to adopt , their lives could have turned out much differently if only someone had cared sooner . I pray for all children in these situations and hope the system in our country and other countries can get the funding and manpower to help more children in these and similar situations . An overburdened system , with too many regulations and not enough workers , needs to be changed .	1
My only gripe about this book was that the epilogue was the only source of Jodie 's time at her proper care center . I would have like the book to include a least a handful of chapters about her time there . An epilogue is not enough .	1
To say I loved this book does not mean I love this book . It is another sad story of how horrible children can be treated .	1

I 've read all MacBride 's Logan novels and this one was a welcome return to form . The last one , Flesh House , while good was very violent and dark - a real departure from earlier outings . While Blind Eye is n't short on the more vicious aspects of the crimes committed ( the title is a major clue ) , I 'm happy to say the overall tone is considerably lighter than the past few entries and much more in line with the first book , Cold Granite . Another reviewer felt the banter between Logan and his crass , lesbian boss Steel was far-fetched and weak . I respect the reviewer 's opionion but strongly disagree - I laughed out loud several times during their exchanges ... especially when Steel and her partner want children and she practically orders Logan to volunteer his `` services '' ! I delighted in this scruffy , oddball duo with their warped yet winning cameraderie ( if you can even call it that ) . Yes you have to suspend disbelief to a certain degree - after all , nearly everyone in the book - good and bad guys - are barmy , but that is what makes it all the more enjoyable a read !	1
Nice story however the pictures are a little & # 34 ; busy & # 34 ; for youngsters and story is a little simple for older children .	1
This book should be on the curriculum , in my opinion . Yes , it is graphic and disturbing - but sadly it 's a true story . I have read this book many times and am shocked each time at how the group could call themselves `` The Family of LOVE '' when the adults bullied , hurt , abused and molested their children . `` Not Without My Sister '' is a disturbingly true story , but I recommend it if you want to know what really happened in the Children of God/The Family of Love back in the day - events that they today still has n't apologized for , unfortunately .	1
This showed how evil leaders rise and how people follow them , sacrificing their own children to be following the leader . This children have never healed and continue to wander , not knowing who they are or who their true parents are . So sad .	1
This book read like a novel but unfortunately was a true story . It just amazes me that this happens and nobody gets punished .	1
In Fjallbacka , Sweden , police detective Patrik Hedstrom is on vacation spending time with his eight months pregnant mate Erica when the call comes from Superintendent Mellberg . A six-years old boy exploring the mouth of the King 's Cleft discovered the corpse of a naked lady . Patrik arrives in time to get his boss away from contaminating the crime scene . When Forensics lifts the body , they find the skeletal remains of two more victims . Mellberg asks Patrik to lead the investigation as his other detectives , Martin lacks experience and Ernst lacks imagination ; Martin resents not getting a chance to lead and Ernst rages over the Kid getting another case.Patrik believes the older skeletons are female teens , Siv Lantin and Mona Thernblad , who vanished in 1979 . The autopsies affirm that each victim was tortured in a deliberate simmering manner until death provided relief . The latest deceased is identified as German Tanja Schmidt . Time becomes precious when a young girl vanishes without a trace while evidence points to the Hult family.The keys to this strong Swedish police procedural ( see The Ice Princess ) are the profound look inside the souls of the key players to learn what motivates each them ; including negative incentives and the discerning glimpse into group dynamics when time is running out . Using flashbacks to 1979 to tell the tale of the Hult evangelical healers who are involved in the present day investigation enhances the overall tension . Although Erica 's sister Anna 's domestic problems with her ex add to the look at what moves people , this subplot takes away from an otherwise taut Swedish whodunit.Harriet Klausner	1
This is a good & # 34 ; whodunit & # 34 ; . With good police work a family built on fraud and deceit comes tumbling down . This is also about our need to believe .	1
I enjoyed reading about the lives of the same characters that were in Camilla Lackberg 's first book . This book had good twists and turns with a surprise ending .	1
I loved this book , heart breaking and inspiring . But not for the weak hearted . I could not put it down .	1
This is the first book I have read from Vanessa Steel . I had feelings of sadness and thought about Vanessa & # 8217 ; s story for several hours . I believe her story because I am 60 and can remember the lack of discussions about sex in general and I never remember hearing about child sex abuse in 1960s or early 1970s in the United States . I saw children beaten with extension cords and 2 by 4s , and I remember hearing stories about things that happened to certain young girls . I highly recommend this book and I will read other books by this author . I also learned the hard way that it only takes one time to make a child .	1
If you like Tolkien , you will want to add this to your collection . Some of us ca n't seem to get enough material about this wonderful land of imagination .	1
I enjoy Cathy Glass and hearing about her experiences with these kids and how she provides so much more than just food and clothing , her heart !	1
Cathy Glass has a way of bringing the reader into her home and into the lives of foster children . This book is no exception and I was hooked from the start . I fell in love with Tayo and had trouble putting the book down , anxiously following his story until I was assured there would be a happy ending .	1
I saw this book and figured it would be a good thing to read since steampunk seems to be a very neat genre and this one was not too short ( 550+ pages ) and had a pretty cool Victorian feel to its book jacket . So I picked it up and started it pretty soon after.The author creates a really unique world . His writing is pretty interesting in which he mentions things in passing or in the immediate conversation as if you , the reader , know these things already and as a result you learn things about the novel 's world really nicely without sad and boring exposition . It is really a great way of writing and that made me enjoy the novel even more so . And to do this successfully , as the author has , is amazing since the world he creates is truly a sci-fi/fantasy world that is completely unfamiliar to the reader.The story is about a woman professor named Amelia from a nation named Jackals in a steampunk world ( Victorian era atmosphere ( think of Jules Vernes ) with an alternate history-like technology ( steammen , airships , Capt . Nemo submarines , etc . ) ) who is hired by her deceased father 's rival , a brilliant scientist/business man named Quest , to find the lost city of Camlantis , what is believed to be a utopian society of peace and prosperity for all . The city is known to have been lost to a self-inflicted floatquake ( an earthquake but the land is sent to float in the clouds rather than necessarily destroyed ) . Various artifacts have been found ( books that are actually hard drives ) showing things of wonder about Camlantis just fuel the urge of the folks to find it . In the world that Amelia lives in having various wars between nations and the normal problems we have today ( wars , hunger , disease , terrorism , etc . ) , Amelia and Quest ( it seems ) wants to see if the technology and philosophy of Camlantis ( if found ) would be able to solve all the world 's problems . So Quest puts together a group including Amazon like women warriors as defense , ex-slavers as seamen , an old royalist submariner ( hidden from the Jackal 's government who overthrew the monarchy ) as captain , and various individuals to fit niches within the scouting party including one of the best characters named Ironflanks , a steamman ( think the Tinman from the Wizard of Oz ) who knows the uncharted territory where the original Camlantis was located . Quest himself does not go but only is the hiring man.Most of the characters are flawed individuals so we do get very real and very believable characters.There are numerous subplots involving a wealthy shapeshifting character and his lashlite butler ( a birdman ) . And various side stories revealing backstory of important characters like Billy Snow ( the navigator ) , Ironflanks ( the scout ) , and others . The novel moves along smoothly with various set pieces keeping the reader guessing who will survive the Indiana Jones adventure and who will not ( since many characters of great importance do die throughout ) . As you can gather , the story does not slow down at all and with all the action , the book moves quickly even though it is fairly long.If you are into Victorian sci-fi like Jules Verne and H.G . Wells , if you enjoy old school stories like Hammer films or the history of Jack the Ripper , and if you are into steampunk fiction like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow , then you 'll absolutely love this novel . If you just like good action books and are into fantasy or sci-fi or period piece mysteries , then you 'll love it as well . It is definately a good read . It is a shame the author 's stories are published in England and only recently have been following here to the states ( a year later unless you order from Amazon UK ) . But let us hope this changes soon and this book gets a look by more readers . Check it out and enjoy .	1
I am a mother of twins that are 2years old . I would be beside myself if something ever happened to them . So this book was an definitely an important part of my life personally for l myself am a recovering drug addict . I am blessed to have a very good supporting family how understand my life . I am also a strong believer in the foster care services .	1
I ca n't believe so many people gave this book a bad review ! Yes , it is a little OUT THERE ... literally ... but it is so neat , sweet , and hopeful . I know , you do n't associate those words with Koontz , but come on , ca n't he stretch his muse a bit ? I really enjoyed this novel , and YES there is enough blood and guts for those of us who enjoy that aspect of Koontz novels . And those little fuzzy things ? I want one of those ! Not the way the military wants them . I just want to SEE and CUDDLE one .	1
This was such a sad story . This book made me appreciate my life a little more . The author wrote in such a way that kept me interest ( enough to read the book in 2 days ) from start to finish . I could also really imagine what she went through . I think the book was written in such a descriptive way I had an easy time imagining what the people in her life looked like , smelled like & # 8230 ; what the houses looked like where she lived , what she may have felt & # 8230 ; looked & # 8230 ; Hard to believe some children have to grow up like this.It was a good read & # 8230 ; but very sad so be prepared .	1
I have n't finished the book , although I liked it so far.One thing I ca n't figure out . Around page 75 , the heroinesneaks into the murdered girl Alex 's house at night andsearches through her things . She hides in a closet while anotherindividual comes in and searches also . As far as I can tell , this isthe same house in which the murder of Alex took place- and the policealready know it was a murder . Why have n't they put up yellow tape and posted a guardat the crime scene ? The police chief wanted to go over the place `` by the millimeter '' , but anything he finds will be suspect if all these unsupervised people have beenrummaging around.Another thing : In the big love scene between Erica and Patrick ( who is middle aged and out of shape ) , the author claims they made love five times in one night with increasing pleasure each time . Enough already !	1
I loved this book from start to finishthe storyline was strong right to the endthe characters were goodwill definitely read more of here books	1
Terrifying and heart wrenching . Sad that such a page turner is a disgusting truth . Bought and read all in the same day . I hope the abusers in this story literally burn in hell for eternity .	1
This is sad , disturbing read . Yet in the end he overcame the odds . A must read for anyone dealing with disturbed children .	1
So so sad ! This story will break your heart . I had to put it down sometimes just to catch my breath . Amazing little boy who has grown into a remarkable person ! ! God Bless You !	1
This was a sad but good book . parents can sure dissapoint an innocent child , a real eye opener.It is very deep and how amazing that a good person can turn out of this . The subject matter is so deepand hurtful that not everyone can handle it . Kudos to the author for coming out of a tragedy and makingsomething of hemself !	1
This is well written , and a heart breaking story . I could not put this book down . It is truly a page turner .	1
This is a book that is all the harder to read because it 's a true story . One of personal triumph over tragedy . What this man had to overcome should n't happen to the mangiest creature on earth , much less an innocent child . You will find yourself biting your lip , getting angry , being moved to tears and your heart will go out to young Joe.But if you stick with it , you will also find yourself cheering for him . And you will never be able to turn away from your instincts the next time you sense a child in trouble . In my opinion , the most unforgivable sin ( almost ) was how so many teachers and others were able to ignore what today , we , nurses , doctors , police , and other parents should be able to recognize and what should be reported . What 's worse : reporting POSSIBLE abuse and finding there is none , or looking the other way and finding that a child has been crying and suffering , even being tortured because too many people were afraid or too unconcerned to speak out ? Do n't read this book if you ca n't handle sad truths about something that happens all too often in our society as well as others around the world . I could n't NOT read it once I began.And I can not forget it , nor will you .	1
This book is just a glimpse of how kind hearted people can be . A traumatized young girl that was loved deeply by her foster parents . This book changed my whole perspective on fostering .	1
I 've read the recent memoirs by Pete Sampras , Monica Seles , John McEnroe , Boris Becker and others . Agassi 's is by far the most refreshing in its candor . And let 's mention the unique present-tense style used to make the book read effortlessly . For anyone who wondered what made Andre tick , this will answer every question , and he now seems finally understandable , after his career is over . He was a thinker , which is always difficult for an athlete . He explains everything here , including his much publicized drug use , hate for tennis , divorce from Brooke Shields and early fashion faux-pas , as well as why he made the ill-advised move to advertise a slogan , `` Image is Everything , '' which dogged him in his earlier days . Lendle 's quip , `` a haircut and a forehand , '' is put into context . Andre 's farewell speech was one of sport 's most moving . His new autobiography is that , as well . Read this if you are a tennis fan . You need to know what 's inside this fabulous memoir .	1
This is an exceptionally well-written and moving sports autobiography . Agassi confesses that he always has had trouble articulating his thoughts -- so obviously a ghost writer was hard at work here . But he manages to tap into Agassi 's soul , to Agassi 's credit.The best part of the book is Agassi 's ability to convey his loneliness and agony in growing up with an out-of-control tennis father and at a bizarre tennis boarding school in Florida . Also gripping is Agassi 's description of the critical mental aspect of the game -- the mind battle that goes on between the players , the importance of conditioning , and the surprising importance of good mental health in going into a tough match . Agassi loses a number of matches because of his mental fragility , and his triumphs seem all the more heroic given his struggle with his inner demons . You ca n't help but like the man after reading his book -- because he puts it all out there for you . Not many celebrities could ever bring themselves to be so honest and introspective.Agassi 's description of his love life , in addition to suffering from TMI , seems a bit less sincere and a bit self-serving . I do n't think he treats Brooke Shields fairly -- she comes off as terrribly shallow . And Agassi also does a hatchet job on his great rival Pete Sampras , who is portrayed as one dimensional and cheap . This detracts from the book . And while Agassi 's description of his friends and mentors is at times quite compelling , his occasional tendency to view his friends as `` wing men '' is not becoming.But Agassi 's struggle with his hatred for tennis on the one hand , and his pride of craft and desire to win on the other hand , makes for a great story . Also , Agassi 's ability to explain and embrace his contradictions -- culminating in his life 's work of founding a charter school after neglecting his own education -- is very moving.I do not watch much tennis , but I did always like Agassi and like him a lot more after reading his book . A gripping and surprisingly moving book .	1
Agassi 's autobiography is a very rare and deeply touching look into the life of a sports prodigy . There is n't one truly normal guy out there playing tennis and ranked somewhere in the top 100 , and you will shortly see that Andre Agassi would n't have been the first.When Agassi burst onto the tennis scene in the mid 80s , his life could already have been said to have been wrecked ; traumatized by his often irrational and dislocating upbringing , forced to play tennis by his severe father , virtually imprisoned in the Bollitieri Academy and more or less pimped for personal gain by Nick Bollitieri himself , he found himself with an 8th grade education , a pro at 16 , hating the one thing he was capable of doing well , and thrust into a life of uncertainty , nagging self-doubt , exploited by sponsors and advertisers , with only a few friends and hangers-on for a support network , all with predictable consequences.Agassi tells his personal story with seemingly brutal honesty , and pretty much anyone interested in his story already knows about the controversial bits , most particularly about the alcohol and drug abuse ; but these were really merely symptoms of the deeper pain and emptiness Agassi describes . The interesting part about his career was n't even so much about his meteoric rise and phenomenal youthful talent , but about how he found the inner strength and heart to come back so powerfully , finding his own center in so doing , and finding a reason to play and work for his own goals , rather than being forced to do so to please others.Sports bios are naturally lead-heavy with point-by-point and game-by-game detailed descriptions of important points , and this is no exception ; for a 21-year career and over 1000 matches , that 's a lot of reading , although it is grippingly written and deeply involves the reader in the games , matches where presumably the interested reader already knows the ending anyway . So , yes , there are a lot of pages devoted to flying here to play him , and flying there to play the other guy , and flying on and on ; in a way , this repetition does kind of give one the idea of the sheer whirl , the never-ending treadmill that is the tennis tour , with heartache and injuries and losses and training.But unlike so many sports bios , Agassi and his ghostwriter give you a glimpse into how Agassi himself thought of himself and his life , and how he turned himself from a phenom to a quitter and tanker in a slow-motion rejection of his own life and descent into self-destruction , and how finally he really did turn into a champion , not only on the court but more importantly in life.Those interested in tennis in general and Andre Agassi in particular will find this to be a really outstanding and inspirational read .	1
Save the receipt . That 's what my wife said when I brought home Open : An Autobiography by Andre Agassi . She was convinced I would n't read 400 pages about someone I never really liked . For the first time in 24 years of marriage -- she was wrong ! ! ! Seldom has an autobiography gone to tremendous lengths describing a detailed accountability for all actions taken . The book starts in such unique fashion and continues throughout . Yes the foundation years are covered and so are the ups and downs of a treasured tennis career ( including his brief drug usage ) . He is n't perfect nor does he pretend to be . But what is most fascinating is how Agassi has put into words his emotions and these emotions are really the theme in his most brilliant book . Nothing is concealed as he has bared all and lets the reader draw his own conclusions . Agassi in a word is complicated . He takes the reader on a 35 year ride to help find himself . Take away the various forms of dress and haircuts and what you have is a man who only wanted two things : to be loved and to give love -- both of which he eventually finds . Fascinating and captivating -- Open : An Autobiography is a work of art . Throw away the receipt because this book has a permanent place in my library .	1
This was my first Kindle read in what I now call the WWOK ( Wonderful World of Kindle ) about someone I did n't know much about , but had read an excerpt of the book in People Magazine . I was tempted to buy the HB edition , but still held out hope that I 'd get my Kindle for Christmas , which I did , and this was the my first read . It 's an amazingly open ( no pun intended ) , honest , from the gut book I 've read , and while I 've never much enjoyed the game of tennis , or watching it being played , I admire what this man went though , especially because he HATED tennis , as he tells us so many times . What a gifted man ; a great storyteller , too . He will forever change how people view the game of tennis , but more importantly , he told us all how it really was for him , his friends , family and other competitors . Too often when we see athletes competing we think of how much they must love what they do , and oftentimes it appears as though what they 're doing is effortless . Mr. Agassi reminds us all that it 's really not , and that looks can and are deceiving . The amount of time practicing , the different surfaces played on , the different stakes , all of which I had no idea of , really make for an interesting story . The fact that it also had an ending that made me smile , made it all that much better.My hats off to a great tennis player , a great athlete , a great husband and devoted father . Mr. Agassi , your book is well written , easy to read , even though I did n't always `` get '' what the scores meant , yours is a book that really helped me to understand competitive sports more and makes me want to donate to your foundation for at risk children , because children are our future . This is a book that really makes us aware that athletes are people too , and that they have an even harder life than we 'd ever think possible . I 'm glad this was my first Kindle read ; I intend to read hundreds of books , and will remember this one for some time.I recommend this book to all that love to read , to anyone that loves sports , especially tennis . It has a great storyline , and I found often that it was hard for me to put down . Thank you for reading my post .	1
I 'm not really a tennis fan and this book was kind of forced onto me by my tennis obsessed brother , but this is far from being anything but a book about tennis . It 's a book about a man with ambition , raw emotions , pain , anguish , love and joy , someone who feels , hurts and lives just like the rest of us . I honestly could n't put this down once I started it , just amazing read about an amazing guy . And come to think about it I ca n't even remember reading that much about tennis in the book .	1
You have to be very brave to put your soul on a platter , to let yourself be discovered to strangers.It takes great courage.It is so rarely encountered in our world today ... that 's 1 reason why this gesture is so precious.Andre had a tough childhood in the shadow of his father , during his story he appears to be a very sensible guy , which is something new to a lot of fans I guess.World is just beginning now to discover Andre , even though he played tennis all this time.I liked what I 've found in his soul 's testimony of an amazing trip called life.The book it 's about discovering oneself , trying to be objective and true with yourself and others , something amazing indeed , and more valuable than a diamond ring or a gold rock on a woman 's middle finger.I almost ca n't believe that he opened himself all that much to reveal himself to all the world.Unbelievable but true and beautiful .	1
the story line took me through areas of India I knew nothing about . A story that is quite complex but very interesting	1
I really enjoyed this book , it is totally different to other stories that I have read and it was one of those books that you cant put down .	1
Beautifully woven , just like a Kashmir shawl	1
I love all the books in this series . Of all the books this is probably the worst one in the series and it is still really good .	1
Couldnt put whole series down . Love the fact that at the end he tells you the facts but in the book these are brought alive .	1
I thought Conn Iggulden was done with this series in the previous book , which ended with the death of Genghis Khan , but this book takes up where the last left off - with the brothers , sons and grandsons of Genghis Khan rivalling for supremacy in the nation Genghis created.This book , like all the others , is rich in historical detail , and the author has an incredible gift for transporting the reader into the period , capturing the mood and feel perfectly . Never is the action held up for unecessary detail , and yet the writing is so well done that I really felt like I was watching the events unfold.I know too little about this historical period to comment on the accuracy of the descriptions and detail given , but I know from the Emperor series that the author spends a good deal of time time on careful research for his novels , so I am guessing it is a faithful one . Then again , I was aware that he occasionally played with the history a little in the Emperor series to make a better story , so I would n't trust this book for a history dissertation ( although maybe that is unfair of me - a better student of the period may like to comment ) . Regardless of that though , this is a cracking good story . The adventure comes fast and furious , and the battle scenes flow so well , I have no idea how he manages it ! Any initial slowness of the story ( and there is not much ) is down to the fact that this is a historical narrative . Conn Iggulden could have perhaps created an even more delicious initial tension - but he is constrained by the need to tell the story as it actually happened ( more or less ) , so he ca n't go assasinating characters who never died and such like.Ultimately though this is a book that the author did not need to write . He could have stopped writing with the death of Genghis Khan and no-one would have felt the series incomplete . Nevertheless I , for one , am very glad he did carry on writing . Another first class historical adventure by a master of the art of storytelling .	1
Is there anything like discovering a new author to follow ? That is what this book did for me , it made me a fan of Christie Dickason.I read a lot of historical fiction and , when told from a princess 's point of view , it normally follows the same formula . A little time spent during her childhood , marriage to a foreign leader , and then having children and suffering valiantly through whatever trouble her husband can come up with . This book , told from the perspective of Princess Elizabeth , daughter of King James I , does not follow that pattern . It uses Elizabeth 's marriage as the resolution to the story and the build up to that marriage as the substance . This is the most accurate portrayal of how a princess , who has no say in her own future , might feel that I have ever read . James I uses his daughter as a political bargaining chip and she is constantly hearing rumors and gossip about who her current suitors are . She lives in a state of uncertainty as her father continually shifts his support from one suitor to another . I thought this to be an extremely realistic portrayal of a princess 's fear as her life is being bartered.This book also had a wealth of period detail . The war between Catholicism and Protestantism that Henry VIII assisted in bringing to England is still in full swing . James I is the son of Mary , Queen of Scots and he fears someone using his children against him as he was used against his mother . Robert Cecil , adviser to Queen Elizabeth and now James , is slowly falling out of favor while Francis Bacon is a rising star . And the Americas are becoming an English interest.The one thing I think should be clarified is that this book is marketed as equally being about a black slave girl named Tallie . While Tallie is a character , this book does not focus on her story , just on how she is a part of Elizabeth 's story.This novel portrayed the time it was set in with great detail and still managed to portray a young English princess 's fears and uncertainties in equal detail . I loved it .	1
All over the world , teens are playing multiplayer games . In India and China , many of these players are `` gold miners , '' paid by local businessmen to play the game , turning over any treasures found for sale to rich American players who want to level up without actually going through the work of beating bosses or completing quests . Work conditions are horrible , and many of these young workers are beaten if they do n't perform or if they threaten to go into business for themselves.According to author Cory Doctorow these games , and the electronic treasures they drop , constitute several of the world 's top economies , which means that exploiting Asian teens is big business . Because they play over the Internet , though , these exploited workers are able to communicate and one of them , Big Sister Nor , comes up with the idea a new version of the 'one big union ' ( the IWW or Wobblies ) . A union makes sense -- although any small group of these players can be replaced , all of them together are a force greater than any single boss . Fortunately for the workers , the game managers themselves are n't really invested in allowing exploitation.Doctorow has a knack for looking at the world and seeing interesting potentials . I remember reading a Wall Street Journal article about Asian gold miners and thinking 'is n't that interesting . ' Doctorow ran with the idea and came up with a novel . In my reading experience , Doctorow usually does n't quite live up to the potential of his story . His writing is unexceptional , his characters tend to be flat , and sometimes wonderful solutions sort of fall out of nowhere . There 's some of this in FOR THE WIN . I had a hard time believing in a teen who taught himself Mandarin so he could on-line chat with fellow game players ( who already spoke English ) . In this book , though , Doctorow stepped up his story-telling . He did a great job describing the exploitation of the game workers , the environments that they work in , the factory world of China where everyone is illegal and where the police seem to exist to back up exploiting bosses . In general , I think Doctorow is an important author for SF fans ( and writers ) to read but that his books are n't always enjoyable . FOR THE WIN was both important and enjoyable .	1
First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 4 June 2011 ... and certainly one of the best authors ( with Bernard Cornwell ) writting about the Vikings . Both share the ability of making their characters come alive . As another commentator mentioned , it is indeed ruthless , brutal and bloody , but then that is exactly the reputation that Scandinavian warriors had at the time . Contrary to what others seem to have indicated , this is not the last of the series ( I very much hope that more are coming ! ) .	1
Another gripping saga tale from the Viking lord Low . First Orm 's outpost is assaulted : no spoilers , but chill , sweat suspense . The second stage of the yarn is another journey . Low 's journeys are ever engaging - being great describing of the Dark Age landscape and custom , and also the journeys of the mind . Buy it ! And Jarl Low , when begets you another saga ? ! ?	1
Run Mommy Run was a very sad but uplifting story . It tells people that there is always a way out if you need one and there is a light at the end .	1
***I WOULD RATE THIS BETWEEN 4 & 5 STARS***This is a well written , very creative , extremely entertaining work of fiction . The story told is , of course , pushing the limits , but as long as the author can suspend disbelief , this works . Fahy suspends disbelief and offers a tale that is enjoyable and intense . Be prepared to settle in and finish this because once you start you wo n't want to stop.I would say that the one thing that made me rate this 4 instead of 5 is that the author could have made the book a little more suspenseful . He certainly created and utilized all of the necessary elements to present a fantastically suspenseful read . Although the book was intense , it was n't what I would call a nail-biter . That did n't make the book bad , but it seems to me that more suspense would have made the book complete ; more suspense would have made this a definite 5 star effort.The creatures of Henders Island are amazing , vividly explained and easy to imagine . The science , which some of the lower rating reviewers tend to complain about , was not , in my opinion ( and I studied English and Philosophy , so I 'm not a scientist , for what its worth ) , difficult to understand and did not detract from nor slow down the story . I found the science to be interesting and even went online to learn a little bit more about a few of the real world creatures and scientific gadgets mentioned in 'scientific terms ' ; had I not done this the book would still have been enjoyable and understandable.The characters were all developed well . There was not real depth to many of them but a character study this book is not . I believe that a story like this would be bogged down by too much character development . Instead , Fahy gives us just enough information about each of the characters for us to understand them and their reactions and interactions to and with the island , its inhabitants and the other characters . I do n't believe that ANY of the characters were cliche , as some reviewers have offered , mainly because the characters were not , again in my opinion , developed to be protagonists ; the island was the main character here.All in all I can say that this , in its genre , is an excellent book , well worth the read and I would recommend it without reservation . I ca n't compare this to what most have compared it as I have n't readJurassic Park ( of course , I have seen the movie ) , personally leaning toward Crichton 's 'historical ' or 'sci-fi ' works likeTimeline , Eaters of the DeadorThe Andromeda Strainall 3 of which I highly recommend , have read only 2 by James Rollins , Map of Boneswhich was great andSandstormwhich was a disaster of a novel that had me swear off of ever again reading Rollins ( though I have since given in and started his newest , The Doomsday Keyand am enjoying that so far ) , and I 've not yet readThe Ruinsby Scott Smith though I may in the future.Definitely worth reading and if the cover statement that this book `` set off a bidding war '' is true I can see why . The cover also offers that this book `` is guaranteed to be summer '09 's powerhouse suspense debut '' ; I would feel safe in agreeing with that statement.Enjoy !	1
I read this book when it first came out in hardback , and it was the first title I purchased and read when I bought my Kindle . I can say that I have read it about 4 times since it first came out , and each time I fully enjoy it.Personally , I found the characters interesting and very well rounded , and the science of the novel was well researched .	1
One of a very few books which had my stomach in knots in the first few minutes of reading . Then I got a scientific education second to none , as the terror , and learning became intertwined to where you wanted to scream at the characters to `` get the hell outta there ! '' At no time did I find myself feeling the characters were safe , or were going to survive , but he did pull it off , and with credibility..First book by Mr. Fahy I presume , but read where a second is due out in 2010 , and believe me I will be a the head of the line ...	1
This is a great first novel by Fahy . Rarely do I read a new author and feel like I won the jackpot . This book was full of adventure and excitement . The creature sketches are a great addition to the novel also . The comparison to Jurassic Park is definitely appropriate . If you love adventure thrillers by such writers as James Rollins , Michael Crichton , and Lincoln Child , then you will love this novel . It has the right blend of adventure , suspense , and science , and it is my hope that it will be a huge success with the publisher rushing to print the next novel by Fahy .	1
I really enjoyed this book . It was a well-written , action-packed page turner that kept me guessing . There was a good balance of story line and science . I would not be surprised if this became a movie and if so , I 'd be first in line to see it .	1
All great fiction starts by tempting the reader with a thrilling & # 34 ; what-if & # 34 ; situation . Fragment takes that situation in an inspired and amazing direction that kept me on the edge of my seat from cover to cover . Perhaps even more impressive than the thrilling action was the convincing science that was used to backup the wild experiences throughout the story . I found myself highlighting parts of the book for later reference . I found so many of the background and substantiating facts thoroughly fascinating.This book was an amazing thriller and the perfect novel for fans of Michael Crichton style scientific adventures .	1
The story 's about a group of people and scientists that come across an isolated island in the Pacific ... inhabited by a world of lethal creatures that have evolved separately from us . Of course , the rest of the plot evolves around the confrontation of both worlds.The book 's a fast turner . Well written , interesting in the theme ( s ) it tackles and the imaginative world it depicts , it definitely has the stuff of future movies.The book 's not without flaws , though , which I 'd like to mention not for the sake of criticizing but rather as food for thought for the author . The narrative is not harmonious : entire sections of debates bring interesting ideas and hypothesis ... but they do n't add a lot to the plot . Also , the end of the book goes through unnecessary lengths as if Warren wanted to keep the action for as long as possible . After a while , though , the reader starts skimming through the text as 1- he knows what 's going to happen and 2- he knows that what is going to happen wo n't be that important anyway . Get my point ? Also , the use of established brands , makes , product names ... for God 's sake ! Fiction is about fiction , not about promoting commercial stuff ! ! These names might convey a sense of known environment to readers -but hey , there are other means to do that ! Who cares to know , in a science-fiction novel , that this watch is an Omega ? That that shirt is Ralph Lauren 's ? Other than that , go ahead , readers , it 's well worth your time and money . And Warren , keep on the good work ! Soon enough , Hollywood producers will start knocking at your door .	1
This has been our 2 yr old grandson 's favorite book since he was 9 months old . My daughter and I can recite it in our sleep . Yet , it never grows dull.The illustrations are bright , colorful and engaging . There are several items to point out and look for , which is what our little guy enjoys.The text has rhythm and the story begs for participation via sounds effects and physical support.Our boy shouts every time he sees Duck 's vegetables go flying ( and we exclaim `` Where 's the carrot ? Look at the watermelon ! '' etc . ) He compares everyone 's feet during , `` These are the feet , which jump the duck down ... '' And he gets red in the face helping sheep , frog and duck push against the back of the truck.I like the introduction to poetic language ( again , `` the feet that jump the duck down '' ) and the rhyme.Reviewers have commented on Duck 's selfishness in leaving his friends stuck in the muck . However , for our family , being in the muck is a pleasurable , sought-after experience and Duck 's quirky character provides opportunity for silly comments.This is the easiest of the duck books . The others are slightly more complex and Duck 's irascibility is even more pronounced . As our boy grows and understands , we know that Duck 's less desirable characteristics will serve as object lessons and also provide opportunities to highlight the patience and friendship of Goat , Frog and Sheep . Good lessons , those .	1
A most moving account of the relationship between a service dog ( a natural ) and his owner . I was particularly interested in the details of the dog 's attentiveness to his master .	1
if you like Karen Slaughter books ... please read Jilliane Hoffman 's books.. I started with Retribution , then had to go to The Last Witness and then onto this book.. I ca n't wait for her next book.. I read all of her books in a matter of 2 weeks.. that 's how good they are	1
A well written story with a compelling premise and an interesting lead character . You do n't want to put it down for fear of missing something .	1
( The following also appears on my blog , An Eclectic Mind . ) A month or more ago , someone on Twitter tweeted a link to the Kindle version of The Atheist 's Guide to Christmas for just $ 1 . Like a lot of people , I consider a buck `` why not ? '' money for anything that interests me . I followed the link and downloaded the book . It sat on my iPad for a while , half forgotten.Sometime later , while I was eating alone in a restaurant in Phoenix , I cracked the cover ( so to speak ) and began reading it . It was n't at all as I expected . It was so much better.You see , I expected some sort of anti-religious rant against Christmas and everything concerned with it . Not sure why I expected this -- perhaps it 's got something to do with the conservative media 's perceived `` war against Christmas '' that crops up every year here in the U.S . If you believe the conservatives on FoxNews , etc. , anyone who is not Christian hates Christmas and wants to destroy it . Following that line of reason , the folks who should hate it most are atheists , since they do n't believe in any religious doctrines at all.But that 's not what this book was all about.The Atheist 's Guide to Christmas is a collection of 42 stories and essays from a variety of atheist scientists , comedians , philosophers , and writers . They include reminiscences ( eg. , Phil Plait 's `` Starry , Starry Night '' ) , celebration suggestions ( eg. , Josie Long 's `` Things to Make and Do at Christmas '' ) , scientific information ( eg. , Brian Cox 's The Large Hadron Collider : A scientific Creation Story '' ) , historical information ( eg. , Claire Rayner 's `` How to Have a Peaceful Pagan Christmas '' ) , and tall tales ( eg. , Nick Doody 's `` How to Understand Christmas : A Scientific Overview '' ) .Sure , there was the takeoff on Jeeves and Wooster by Richard Dawkins in which Woofter and Jarvis engage in a conversation about the existence of God , Jesus 's part in the Holy Trinity , and bible inconsistencies . But that was just one small chapter in a very large book . Most of the book is very positive and uplifting , encouraging non-believers to enjoy the Christmas season the way most believers do : with decorations , big meals , gift giving , and gatherings of friends and family members.The book makes it clear that you do n't need to believe in God or religious doctrines to enjoy a holiday that just happens to coincide with the winter solstice . ( Not exactly a coincidence , but try to explain that to a believer . ) It also offers plenty of helpful tips and advice for getting along with believers during a holiday that may have some serious religious significance to them.I 'm about halfway through the book -- although I do admit that I began reading by using the interactive table of contents to pick and choose among the essays I wanted to read first . While some chapters are better than others as far as their relevance to my personal thoughts about Christmas , I 'm certain that any atheist would find something of value in its pages . Likewise , I do n't think any believers would be offended by its contents . As the book 's introduction states , The Atheist 's Guide to Christmas is an `` atheist book it 's safe to leave around your granny . '' Indeed , I 'm certain that even believers would find a lot of content in this book to help make their Christmas celebrations more enjoyable -- without threatening their beliefs .	1
Such a sad story ..a journey through extreme mental and physical abuse .Well written , I felt as though I knew the author it truly moved me . God bless you Lisa !	1
Our same Odd plus some new friends thatI suspect we will see again in future novels.I liked it - not one of the best , but I think itis moving the series forward .	1
I Have been reading the series since the original Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz . The first thing I found about Deeply Odd was that the story picks up quickly , without a lot of back story or build up . Second , it was very similar in style and tone to the first , third , and fourth books in the series . As in it is fun and keeps your attention without going too overboard on descriptions or way out there in sci-fi elements . While the story isnt very believable ( it is fiction and about a guy that sees ghosts , so not a big stretch ) , it is the usual fun character that we know and wish we could be in some way.For those of you that are n't familiar with Odd Thomas , this is not the book to learn about him and I would suggest starting at the beginning . There are many references to his other `` memoires '' that help you understand or relate as you go , plus many nuances that a fan would appreciate vs. a new comer finding weird.Over all loved it anc hope Koontz continues the series sooner rather than later , I didnt want the book to end . I hope the movie finally comes out and is worthy of the character ! !	1
I , like many Dean Koontz/Odd Thomas fans , have found the Odd Thomas series to be somewhat spotty as to focus on the plot , lack of interesting characters and somewhat of a tendency toward formula . Enjoyed most of them but some more than others . Frankly , the first , third and now the sixth , `` Deeply Odd '' , are the books that seem to carry Odd 's journey forward the most successfully , in my opinion . `` Deeply Odd '' pretty much fulfills the hopes/dreams/requirements that I want and expect in a Koontz novel . Being scared to death and then seconds later laughing , for instance.As usual , most of the likeable characters were very much so and the villains as psychopathic as one could possibly wish . Good conquers a terrible evil -- but is n't remotely defeated -- and Odd lives another day in which to save the world . And I 'm not being trivial or trite in saying this because modern literature so seldom is willing to admit that evil exists at all and we 're left cheering on the behavior and morals of some very mediocre and not particularly nice `` heroes '' . I want to read about good , decent , average , ordinary people willing to fight the good fight and very often win but sometimes with a steep price to pay to do so.I most highly recommend this book to anyone who fell in love with `` Odd Thomas '' in his first book . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Deeply Odd is the seventh book in the Odd Thomas series . Now , Deeply Odd tosses Odd straight into his destiny , leading him back around to his opponents from the first book and backing him up with all-new resources and aid . It took a little longer to pull me in than the first book did , but once it did I was hooked . It & # 8217 ; s also highly quotable , unlike some of the middle books ; Odd Thomas & # 8217 ; s narrative voice has built back up some of its whimsical , offbeat steam . I even had a not-quite-teary moment , which is a great sign that I & # 8217 ; m connecting emotionally with a book.This tale seems like it & # 8217 ; s supposed to belong to Annamaria & # 8211 ; the bell she gave Thomas finally rang , and it & # 8217 ; s been a full three books since she joined the cast . However , yet again she has almost no part in things other than as a plot device . She & # 8217 ; s still annoyingly enigmatic . She is the embodiment of the series & # 8217 ; oddities taken too far , wrapping back around into cliche and fortune-cookie philosophy.Edie is such a fully-realized character and has so much clear previous history that I found myself wondering if she was a preexisting character . Koontz is nearly back to full power with respect to the uniqueness and depth of his secondary characters , although the first book still has an edge there.Deeply Odd is not quite as good as the first book , but that & # 8217 ; s a difficult bar to reach . It & # 8217 ; s certainly better than most of the books that have come between , rendering it a worthy entry into the series . I & # 8217 ; m looking forward to seeing more of what Odd Thomas can do with his new resources !	1
Good Book from the start it launches into action . Many twists and turns , good plots , with plenty of excitement . Naturally , the ending leaves many more questions , and hints as to who a certain person he travels with is , and of course the next book . Well done Dean , another bullseye , and a great addition to this series .	1
I 've read every installment of the Odd Thomas series and have thoroughly enjoyed them all . This latest adventure does not disappoint .	1
Very well written . Can not wait till till the next instalment of Odd Thomas and his next adventure into the weird and unknown world .	1
Odd Thomas is back in Dean Koontz 's next edition of his episodic series as Deeply Odd . Odd is now `` almost '' twenty-two and it 's been 19 months since his love and soul-mate Stormy Llewellyn has been mowed down in the shopping center mayhem . He now lives platonically with still pregnant Annamaria and is searching for the meaning of life.On a trip to town Odd has an encounter with a flamboyantly dressed trucker whom he refers to as the Rhinestone Cowboy . He has a vision of him burning three children on stage with a flamethrower and follows the trucker to a market where he disappears . Odd knows his next quest has begun.He meets Edie Fischer , an 86 year old pixyish FBI Agent Dana Scully look alike , who is in need of a chauffeur . Odd reluctantly accepts this roll as he needs a vehicle in which to follow the Rhinestone Cowboy to a truck stop . Here we meet the Koontz obligatory `` Celeb du Libra '' Alfred Hitchcock.The reader begins to suspect that the Rhinestone Cowboy might have as many paranormal talents as Odd making him a formidable adversary . Odd , who believes that intuition is the highest form of knowledge knows he must play out this drama to save the three children as he continues the pursuit and follows the monster along the highways and byways of California and into his hellish chimeras.This is a rather formulate novel but for those who are lovers of this character it 's one of the better ones . I personally like Koontz 's ability to play with words and phrases and often get a smile from the most innocuous of expressions . In describing this villain Dean says `` He had Nordic features and a melanoma-doesn't-scare-me tanning-booth glow '' . When Mrs. Fischer was driving at breakneck speed she told Odd not to worry as she had dimples and `` Dimples are a get-out-of-jail-free card '' . Another is `` One good thing about a condemned man 's last meal is that he does n't have to worry about acid reflux '' .This is just another light hearted dark comedy in the `` Odd Thomas '' series from the pen of Dean Koontz . It does n't take itself seriously and in that respect is a fun read . Enjoy .	1
Like most of Dean Koontz 's books the Odd Series books are easy reads , and the Odd Series , once started , are difficult to discontinue .	1
This book was good , but did n't grip me like the others did . Well worth the read tho . It is obviously , however , that the series is coming to an end . That makes me really sad . I love this character .	1
Anyone who enjoyed the previous Odd books will love this one . I felt it was the best so far in the series	1
I love the Odd Thomas books ! They just keep getting better .	1
Excellently written . Such a courageous account . It 's not easy to read and is terribly sad , but it should be read . My heart goes out to Cassie and I found joy in her picking up the pieces and putting herself together after such horrid abuse , and sadness in all that was done so wrong to her . Read it .	1
This was a very good read . I must for any Top Gear fan . Some parts ran on a bit but overall , it was very good .	1
In continuing my journey into types of books I haven & # 8217 ; t read I decided to continue with the non-fiction . I was watching Top Gear and they mentioned Stiggy & # 8217 ; s new book and how it got him fired and in trouble with Top Gear so I decided I had to read it . Being a car fan and a Top Gear fan why wouldn & # 8217 ; t you ? Well I am extremely happy with this choice and highly recommend this book . It talks about Ben Collins life and how he grew up wanting to be a race car driver . After a few false starts he makes some key appearances on some race teams but always runs into an issue . Then one day he is called to an interview on a airplane runway to drive a car around for a few laps and ends up taking what everyone who knows cars would think to be the dream job . It also talks about Ben going through the Army in his free time off the set and having to keep the secret of who he was on the show . It talks about specific episodes ( all of which I have seen a few 100 times ) so that was fun hearing how they really went down . It was interesting to hear how the piece together footage for the show which makes sense but I never really thought about how they did it.My only complaint was that the book seems to jump around a little bit and is a little hard to follow , but that might have been me just being slightly distracted when I read it or something . After reading this I want to read a lot more non-fiction stories in this area and there are a ton . Actually each one of the TG guy & # 8217 ; s has their own book or 3 so that might be making the short list on things to read next !	1
Spellwright by Blake CharltonIt is always refreshing to see a new take on fantasy . This book focuses on the magic ability to use proper sentence structure to alter reality . The protagonist is effectively dyslexic and suffers in a culture that demands perfection in the interests of safety.One of the more telling aspects of the story is that the author is dyslexic . He has used his familiarity with the condition to craft a unique tale . I Nicodemus Weal is portrayed as having enormous potential made unreachable due to his tendency to mis-spell spells . His spells often go awry sometimes with dramatic consequences.The characters are fleshed out with suitable color and foibles . The scene is beautifully crafted to the point where you can see the spires touch the sky.I really enjoyed the premise , it reminded me somewhat of computer code writing and the ill that can occur with a single misspelled line.I recommend the book .	1
Despite the formatting problems noted by others ( which really are not that bad , I 've seen a lot worse , mostly just strange line breaks ever so often , usually in dialogue ) it 's a book well worth investing time in , if you like fantasy . Most of the reviews were written by fans of urban-fantasy , I am not very familiar with the genre . However , the story was great and the characters better . And , since I immediately bought and read the sequel , I can tell you that it continues well . Each story can stand alone , but this is best read first ( reading Road to Bedlam 1st will spoil the plot ) .	1
Purchased as a gift & the person is happy with the content . As it was not for me & I do not have it I can not review item .	1
I 've always liked Sebastian Junger - he 's factual and precise . I wo n't reiterate on what 's already been said about `` War '' in the other excellent , outstanding and comprehensive reviews , other than to say this book is similar to the movie `` The Hurt Locker '' ( insofar as it puts you right in the middle of the REAL action ) , and ANY article by C.J . Chivers and Tyler Hicks ( a reporter and photographer , respectively ) , both from the New York Times , and both of whom consistently supply superlative reporting and photos from the front lines in Afghanistan . ( You can Google their names for links to their articles and accompanying photos . ) Both Junger and Chivers & Hicks manage the incredible feat of showing how it REALLY is for our troops on the front lines by living it WITH them , the intensity , what drives them , the terror of what they live through and what they endure on a daily basis , what their hopes and dreams are , and so much more , sometimes by what IS N'T being said as much as what is.The highest compliment and tribute I can give `` War , '' is that it is like one continuous article/narrative from Chivers and Hicks , only by Junger , of course , and his experience with each and every brave soldier serving in Afghanistan . It is as if you are there with them in the eye of the storm , sometimes calm , always intense , and all the more harrowing because of its reality . Highly recommended.P.S.If you liked Sebastian Junger 's `` War , '' here is some info on C.J . Chivers and Tyler Hicks that you might want to check into : Christopher John ( C.J . ) Chivers is an American journalist who reports for The New York Times . He was part of the New York Times team that was awarded The Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 2009 , for his coverage of Pakistan and Afghanistan.Tyler Hicks has returned to Afghanistan nearly every year for the past seven years . He was among the staff members at The Times who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for `` masterful , groundbreaking coverage of America 's deepening military and political challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan , reporting frequently done under perilous conditions . ''	1
Sebastian Junger followed a platoon of soldiers through their 15 month deployment in Afghanistan . _War_ is his retelling of their experiences . To his credit , Junger is forthright in stating that journalistic objectivity goes out the window when one lives and works alongside the soldiers he is writing about . He is also clear in stating that in spite of this , he is as honest as he can be in his relating the details of the deployment.The first chapter set my teeth on edge as Junger explains how this platoon is `` the tip of the spear '' - the best infantry unit in the theater , the best company in the regiment , the best platoon in the company , et cetra . Having served in the military , and having served in a combat zone , every line unit says this ; I felt Junger was laying these details on a bit thick . Once he began writing about the young men he lived among though , the book got better by yards and miles.There seems to be a perception that journalists have a hidden agenda , that they `` do n't support the troops '' ( whatever that means ) , and that they intentionally seek to report only the negative without highlighting the real and lasting good ( whatever that means ) that the military is doing in Afghanistan . I found no evidence of this in Junger 's book . Rather , his focus was on the young men serving , detailing what their lives were like . To give you a feel of this , Junger writes , '' Combat was a game that the United States had asked Second Platoon to become very good at , and once they had , the United States had put them on a hilltop without women , hot food , running water , communication with the outside world , or any kind of entertainment for over a year . Not that the men were complaining , but that sort of thing has consequences . Society can give its young men almost any job and they 'll figure out how to do it . They 'll suffer for it and die for it and watch their friends die for it , but in the end , it *will* get done . That only means that society should be careful about what it asks for , '' Junger is an astute and close observer of human interaction , and his insights about these young soldiers were dead-on with my own experiences in a line company . Among those that would suprise most who have not served is the apolitical attitudes , the open and `` salty '' language , and the depth of the bonds between men . It is a powerful and moving narration that neither condones nor condemns the war , but rather puts a human face on `` the troops '' of whom are so often referenced by politicians and pundits alike . Highly recommended .	1
`` And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life . '' -- 1 Kings 15:6 ( NKJV ) Sebastian Junger 's War is the most chilling nonfiction book I 've read about 21st Century war . Whether you favor or oppose American military involvement in Afghanistan , you need to read this book to understand the nature of what violence is being waged there.The combat units that Mr. Junger describes are in essence sitting ducks , located deep in `` enemy '' territory where a single sniper located higher up in the hills can wreak havoc on the military outposts . Once an engagement starts , the Americans can bring in overwhelming fire power , but there 's a delay before it arrives . In the meantime , the pinned down troops can blast away . . . probably not doing much damage but at least forcing others to keep their heads down . The effect is similar whether it 's a local boy hired to fire a couple of shots for $ 5 and then take off or whether it 's the beginning of a serious assault . Fear goes through the roof . Men die . Deep bonding occurs among the survivors . Combat teamwork improves . Gradually , it becomes a preferred way of life . That 's probably the most surprising message of this book . Terrifying combat becomes something to be sought out for its highs.Mr . Junger balances a riveting tale with many valuable perspectives on how frightening it is , crossing the accustomed barrier into being someone who kills , and the deep love that develops among comrades.It 's a lot to ask of anyone to serve in such perilous conditions . It 's more than doing your duty and risking your life . It 's taking on a life that you may not be able to put down , even if you survive.Thank God for the brave warriors who have taken up these seemingly overwhelming duties so we can be safer . The next time you see someone in an armed forces uniform , be sure to thank them for their service and ask about what they have been doing in a caring way .	1
Despite all the death , injury , pain and frustration a surprisingly high percentage of our soldiers in Afghanistan re-enlist . If , like me , you did not understand why before , you will after reading this book . The book is an account of the author 's five months embedded with American forces in one of the hottest spots in the Afghan War . It is also an attempt to understand what is universal about the experience of war.There have been many books that have done a good job of showing the horror of war . I have never read another that was as effective at showing the appeal of war to the fighting man . Junger does not sugarcoat the ugly side of war . He just focuses on why men love it so much even as they hate it . It 's not just the adrenaline rush , though that is a part of it . It has more to do with being a member of a group where each man would lay down his life for the other and everyone knows it . The fear of death is powerful but far weaker than the fear of having to live with being responsible for the death of one of your comrades . This is a world where everything matters . The smallest mistake might get you , or worse your best friend , killed . This kind of intensity is addictive and makes everything else pale in comparison . Junger says that the trauma of losing the experience of that is a big part of PTSD . It 's the part no one talks about.Those seeking a political analysis of the Afghan war will not find it here . Regardless of why they signed up , when the bullets start to fly men fight to protect their brothers in the squad not some abstract political idea . Those seeking a well organized story with a beginning , middle and end will not find that here either . Junger is interested what is timeless about the experience of war . You could scramble the chapters up and it would n't read that differently.The book does come off the rails a little when he discusses altruistic self sacrifice in war in terms of natural selection . He concludes that humans are the only species that display this trait and that is because it requires language . He clearly has not heard about ants . Ants often conduct war and are far more reliable than humans in being willing to sacrifice themselves for the group . But this is a quibble . This is not a science book . It is a book about what war feels like . Judged by that standard it is a triumph .	1
No new ground is broken , but a powerful reiteration of why men fight . Some interesting insights in the Afghan mind and situation . Tough guys in a tough place . Good reading . More proof Junger needs to live on the edge . Otherwise we would n't get to see this stuff .	1
Great book , see in tandem with Junger 's doc , RESTREPO , and find out what the hell our guys and gals are up against out there in AFG . I especially like audio books that I can take on my exercise walks . I really love Junger 's work -- all of it . He 's a great writer and a very sensitive soul .	1
Birthdays for the Dead is a gritty and fantastic novel . The characters are believable and likeable . There is humour in what is a very dark and disturbing storyline . I am an avid fan of Stuart MacBride and I would definitely recommend this book .	1
I find all of Cathy Glass 's books awesome reads . There is something about the way she writes which shows just how much she cares about the children she fosters . It can be difficult to read about the terrible abuse and the children 's response to it . But it 's impossible to put her books down even when the content is a little disturbing .	1
The House on Willow Street is a great book to curl up with on a cold winter 's night . The characters are great and they epitomise all that you would want in a group of friends and family . I loved the feel good story line and way dsccription of the beautiful countryside was woven into the book . A must read if you are after an escape from the harsh reality of life .	1
Follows same formula of three friends which become intertwined in one another 's lives . Good read in front of the fire	1
i had no idea what this story would turn out to be . I had chosen it on a whim from the Kindle Daily Deals and did n't read it for a while after the purchase . I was delighted to discover Cathy Glass and her stories and look forward to reading more of her work . I felt as if I knew the characters and cared about them , which for me makes the best reading scenario I can ask for . I loved it .	1
Good book.Wish it was longer.Too short.Would have liked to see if the brothers got back together with their mom .	1
It was quite a good book . It was easy reading and not too long . I enjoy reading Cathy Glass novels .	1
Wow ! One of the best books I 've read in a long time ! I was unsure due to the fact that I do n't typically read war books , but this is more about one man 's life during the war . It can be disturbing at times during the abuse sections , but something we should all know about . I ca n't say enough about this book ... definitely worth reading .	1
I found it a very interesting and based on an amazing hero . But at times it bogs now in the detail especially when in the camp and the end of the book . It is an important part of our history , but some details are not needed to get the horror across . It makes it seem exaggerated even if it is the truth .	1
If i had a special shelf for the best books i 've ever read , then this book will surely find it 's place here & # 34 ; Never give up & # 34 ; is the first thing I can think of when i see this book . The story of a man who was to stubborn to say & # 34 ; i 've had enough & # 34 ; and just give up life.A full package inside on man comprised of Resilience , determination , endurance and other qualities , I 'm not gon na give any spoilers . All I can say is , thank you Mrs Hillendrand for an extraordindary book and to those who did n't read or are still thinking about reading it ... DO N'T THINK . Just get it.You will not be disappointed	1
Good read of a life experience that had some meaning . That ought to be enough words . I write concisely . So thats it .	1
This book is just plain old TERRIFIC . An unbelievable story about a true hero and survivor . Do n't miss it . Inspiring !	1
Wonderful book . It is unbelievable what these prisoners went through during this war . It is a gripping story and the fact that this well researched book is true makes it even more unbelievable . Well worth the read .	1
I thought I knew the events of WWII , but in fact I really knew very little about the real behind the scenes facts . At some points , as I 'm a woman who gets uneasy about watching scary movies , I thought I 'd have to stop reading the book because of the unnerving parts , but I 'm so glad that I kept reading until the end . This was a true story that had to be told to the world , no matter how gruesome the truth was to read at times . Every American should read this book and it will make you so much more appreciative of where we live and what we have been blessed to have in this country .	1
I ca n't imagine what Mr. Zamperini went through in his life even after reading this book . We do NOT give our veterans enough respect , honor and gratitude .	1
If you want to truly taste , smell and fell how war effects men of war this is a must read . The story kept my intrest until the end . The recap of all involved in writing her book was not of great intrest to me .	1
I totally loved Hillenbrand 's book on Louis Zamperini 's life . He was a bigger than life person and Hillenbrand did an astute job of presenting his life , his time as a prisoner of war , his post traumatic stress disorder , and his recovery due to finding Christ with Billy Graham . This book opens with the terror of being in a raft with his bomber friends and being circled by sharks and bombed by Japanese planes . As we are left hanging about what will happen to Louis , the reader learns about Louis ' ( crazy ) life in Torrance , CA and his rise to competing in the Berlin Olympics . A must read for everyone , Louis Zamperini is an inspiring man ! ! !	1
This book was hard to put down . I am so amazed that it is a true story . I ca n't wait to see the movie ... ... ... ... ... .	1
Just an amazing story about an amazing man . Everyone should read it , I could not put it down . By it	1
Phenomenal read - engaging and suspenseful . Hillenbrand captures a beautiful story . Could n't put it down .	1
I ca n't comprehend what it must have been like to be him , but it taught that maybe these ADD OR ADHD kids have those incredible toughness and stubbornness to help the rest of us . Just think of how many people learned how to handle the worst . This makes the Life of Pi a Fairytale .	1
An incredible and inspiring story of survival . The human spirit is both fragile and resilient . The beginning of the story had me bored to pieces and I was prepared to settle in for a torturous 400 page history lesson . History used to be one of my favorite subjects in school . Now that I 'm not in school anymore though , I have realized it was only my favorite because there were n't any subjects like `` Paranormal Romance '' or `` Time Travel Fiction . '' I was ready to just about stab my eyes out when The Green Hornet crashed.I was sucked into Louie 's journey and felt myself gripping my book in intense anxiety as I walked through his life in his shoes . Laura Hillenbrand did a great deal of research for this book and the details are a lot to take in . She did a brilliant job of taking those details and arranging them into vivid scenes the reader could place themselves in . What these men had to endure is really incredible . I have a whole new level of respect for our veterans . This is a must read for everyone ! History lover or not ... . this book is amazing .	1
The best thing I can say about this book is that it should become required reading for all high school/college students . Besides telling the unbelievable , if it were n't true you would n't believe it , story of an Olympian turned P.O.W . in Japan , Laura Hillenbrand gives great details about the war and insight into our soldier 's day to day lives and what it was like in a Japanese POW camp . I could go into details about the story , but ultimately I 'd just be ruining it for everyone . I strongly suggest getting this book , and when your done with it ... .give it to someone else to read . This unbelievable story is one not to be missed .	1
It took me maybe 50 pages to get into it , but holy cow this is an incredible story . I never read war books or historical non-fiction , but this story was incredible . Have passed this on multiple times . great read .	1
I would recommend this book for everyone to read , it 's a great book , the hardships they went through and how they survived , this book is so worth it . In fact , this coming December 2014 , this book is coming out as a movie , which I 'm going to go see because of this book . Everyone should read this book .	1
What a story ! It is amazing what human beings can survive and inflict . Louie 's redemption through the power of God was the best part .	1
Well written . I keep recommending it to friends . Even though my dad was statoned in the Pacific at the same time , I knew very little about the war and the people . This book brought many aspects alive and personal .	1
Amazing historical fiction . A powerful , well-written biography of a resillient , courageous man . It had a bit of a slow start , but I was soon addicted to the story and could not put the book down . The story is inspirational and it reminds us of how strong the human spirit can be . Reading this book has been a great experience and has left me with some very important messages about life .	1
This was one of the most fascinating books I 've ever purchased from Amzon.com . I could n't put it down . I especially enjoyed it because I was a child during WWll and my father was stationed on the kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands . I was intensely interested in that part of the book .	1
As a European citizen the Pacific part of Word War 2 was not very familiar to me before I read this book . The main person 's , Louis Zamperini 's , accomplishment is almost unbelievable- as a runner , as an Olympian- but foremost : as human being . The main message of the book is his forgiveness in regard to his former Japanese guards- an act which sets life in general in perspective and has an ethernal message to mankind . One of the best books I have ever read !	1
I read alot of World War II Books . Laura has a wonderful way to tell a story . Even something as horrible as war is . I felt almost as if I was there with Louie.I also read Seabiscut.It was also so gripping .I was so absorbed in the feel of horse racing.I will read anything she writes .	1
At first I thought I was reading a novel , instead this actually happened.I was stunned by the resilience shown by this real hero of World War II . If you enjoyed & # 34 ; Band of Brothers & # 34 ; , this book will rock your socks.Thanks to Laura Hillenbrand for writing this . It is a stunning accomplishment .	1
This story was so engrossing . I had forgotten many of the aspects of World War II in the Pacific , particularly those related to prisoners of war . This was such a courageous story of survival and faith to overcome obstacles . Laura Hillenbrand weaves an engaging story that is well documented and obviously fact based but reads like the best fiction .	1
Like a lot of readers , I was drawn to this book by the exceptional professional reviews . However , I have to admit that when I started the book I was completely disappointed . The beginning of the story was sloooooooow and repetitive , and not particularly well-written . However , after getting through the early chapters , the book picked up steam in a hurry . Even still , it was n't quite the book I expected . This was a war story , which does not by any stretch take away from the book . Though it was n't what I had expected , it was fantastic after the early chapters.As others have summarized , the book follows the story of Louie Zamperini , an Olympic runner from Los Angeles . The first chapters of the book cover his somewhat troubled youth and his rise to brilliance as a track star . This background is essential to understanding how Mr. Zamperini survived his POW ordeal , but got a bit repetitive after awhile.The bulk of the book is the story of Mr. Zamperini 's time with the Army Air Corps and in Japanese POW camps , and this is where the book really took flight . Building on her extensive research , Hillenbrand paints a very vivid and disturbingly realistic picture of the Pacific Theater in WWII . The travails of the POWs in the Japanese camps are very painful to read about , and left me with an even greater admiration for anyone who managed to survive there for even a single day . Thanks to the Nazis , the atrocities committed by the Japanese tend to be a footnote in the history of WWII , but this book brings them to the forefront . As the story unfolds , it becomes clear how Mr. Zamperini 's early life experiences may have actually prepared him to survive these camps.Overall , I definitely recommend this book with the caution that it 's not a lighthearted story of overcoming the odds . It 's actually more of a detailed historical work of Pacific POW camps that may very well affect you for the rest of your life . Stick with it .	1
Remarkable story of courage in spite of nearly insurmountable odds . I would recommend it to anyone interested in WWII Pacific Theatre stories as well as any combat veteran . The author brought a human face to pain , suffering and hope.Editorially , some of the torture scenes became 'redundant ' ... it made me reconsider how many times you can beat a dead horse.This may sound callus since he did have to endure them all ; however , the reader quickly gets the sense of the inevitability and sense of helplessness .	1
& # 34 ; War is Hell & # 34 ; as they say and I can see why they say that . This story is so inspiring as to the faithfulness of Godand to the determination of men to live . After all Louis , had been through He knew when looking back that God had not abandoned him . Man is so very evil and it shows the extent that one will go to hurt and punish another human being just because he thinkshe has the POWER and RIGHT to do so.Is there a moving coming out about this man 's life ? What a lesson peoplecould learn by watching it . Hope it happens .	1
as a disabled vet l was overwhelmed by this book . What Louis went their I do not believe I could have endured that hell	1
Ms. Hillenbrand is quite successful in writing about the life and perils of anincredible person ( Louie Samperini ) and am looking forward to reading more books written by this author.Happy Sokol	1
The book tells the story of Louie Zamperini , an olympic runner , who goes to War as a bombardier in World War 2 . It 's the story of his airplane crash and imprisonment in a Japanese POW camp and how he endured the difficult experience . Not one page of it was less than extremely well written and the story flows beautifully .	1
An amazing story of survival . I loved this book though the content is hard to read for the soft hearted . Learned much more than I ever knew about the violent treatment of our captured Gis under Japan . It makes me understand why our fathers and grandfathers did not feel so great about Japanese cars and products post war .	1
If you are into non-fiction books Laura Hillenbrand 's UNBROKEN is superb . This book is what its all about to say great reading . An unbelievable story about an extraordinary man , Louis Zamperani . Simply look at the reviews and the ratings . Get the book . Read itHIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
Unbroken is a well written story of an amazing life . It is also a moving discription of the fearless flyers and crew who fought against Japan in WW2 . This is one of the many stories which should be told .	1
If you like survival stories you will love this book ! The part of the book about his 47 days on a life raft and over two years held captive by the Japanese was very spell binding ! Also great pics of the different people that crossed his life , even the cruel Japenese guards . The other great thing about the book , is it told the reader what happen to even the Japanese guards and prison commandants after the war , not just his fellow airmen/prisoners . Just a very interesting and entertaining book !	1
Reading this story of our POW 's in Japan made me feel angry at war ( & Japan ) , empathy for soldiers , sympathy for family members and overall pride for our military service personnel - I highly recommend this book .	1
This book is amazing . I love history , which is why I bought this book , but I got a LOT more than history from it . ( And I read it on my new Kindle . ) What the track star Louis Zamparini and those other men lived through in WWII was unbelievable - but it really happened . What they did after the war is equally unbelievable . How Louis was haunted by the memory of his abuser known at `` The Bird '' - and descended into alcoholism before finding Jesus through Billy Graham - was an intense page turner.If you want to learn what the human is really capable of doing , read this book .	1
This book was simply amazing . It was truly hard to put down from beginning to end . If you are interested in WWII stories or just plain human survival stories , do n't miss this book . An amazing story that would make a wonderful movie !	1
Well , you 'll probably want to kiss your Japanese friends good-bye forever after this read ! ! ! They made the Nazis seem almost humane !	1
I am about half way through this fascinating book . Some say this difficult to read , but I found it very interesting , and I do n't want to put the book down . This is rewarding description of what happened during the Second World War . It is very sad , but it is amazing how Louie survived through all this . The Lord was definately with him . At that time I was just a baby having been born in 1944 . I had an Uncle Harold , who was in the Philipines during the war , and he lost his life there . I wish I knew more about how it happened . I think of him as I read this book.Amazon approved purchase	1
I never thought I would enjoy reading a true history book ! I hated anything that included . History when I was in schoolbut this book really held my interest throughout the book . Never realized what the POW 's had to endure during thewar and have a greater appreciation for what they did for our country . A truly good read !	1
I am a WWII nut , but I 've got to admit that this part of the war is very upsetting . The atrocities and hardships this generation faced is unbelievable . Every American should have to read about D Day in this 70th anniversary of the landings . Louie was one tough guy .	1
Loved this book and loved the background , the characters , and the true story of what happened to one person in a huge war . The details are stunning and unforgettable . The day to day drama , action , friendships , as well as the determination of the `` Greatest Generation '' will stick with me a long time . I highly recommend the book . Be ready to dig in and come out with a lasting impression of `` What it was like '' to be there . I felt like I was in the olympics , the war , the boat , the plane , the prison , and made it back out .	1
What more can I say that has not been said ? This book is excellent - stayed up 3 nights in a row reading - could not put it down ! Highly recommended !	1
Over 2,000 reviewers have written about how great this book is . And , yet , I 'm compelled to write and chime in with the rest of them . This book is great . Laura Hillenbrand is a writer who stuns you . When I read Seabiscuit , I felt like I was the jockey . In this book , for better or for worse , I felt like I was with Louie in the raft , at the prison camp and in the audience during the tent revival that changed his life . I am going through some stressful times right now and this book was just what I needed to give me some much-needed perspective . Thank you Louis Zamperini . Your life continues to be an inspiration .	1
I enjoy reading true stories . What is amazing to me is how some people like to read with suspense and here is a true story better than anyone could imagine . Plus the history of World war 2 , and all the planes and what they had to endure , wow , poor soldiers . However the soldiers still were willing to give their lives for our country . I hope all will take the time to read this , well worth your time .	1
I was n't sure how to rate this because of the subject and it 's hard to say you love it . The author did an amazing job telling this story , which needed to be told . It is always hard to read about war and all that happens during them . This story followed a man through his life and all the people who were part of that life . So many people , such a heart wrenching story . This is a story that everyone should know to have a better appreciation for the men and women who fight to defend our country .	1
I was sucked into this story from the very beginning . I fell in love with Louie from the start and my heart went up and down as I followed him through his life 's story . As I was on a Cruise and surrounded by water , I could totally relate to the opening of this book . Bravo , Louie , you are a stronger man then I could ever be . For people who like the World War II era , this is a must read .	1
Fantastic book , makes me appreciate all that I have and the freedom we take forgranted , earned by the suffering of those who came before us to make this country what it is . Bought this copy as a gift for an Army veteran friend and he enjoyed it as well . I 've been recommending this book to both men and women readers of all ages ( adult ) . A case of truth being & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; than fiction , and in this case a very well written account of it .	1
Call in sick to work . Put on a movie for the kids . Cancel your plans for dinner . You must read this book . Now.Had he not been lost at sea and then captured by the Japanese , Louis Zamperini 's life would still make for an interesting story . He was a wildly mischievous child . As a two-year-old he not only climbed out of his bedroom window and ran down the block naked , but as his family was leaving New York 's Grand Central Station he escaped from his parents and jumped off the train . Once the family managed to get him to Torrance , California , he soon began terrorizing his new neighbors by deflating tires , stealing food and ringing church bells in the middle of the night . Immune to all punishments and consequences , he entered his teen years and his foolish pranks gave way to a temper that began to flare dangerously out of control.Running saved him.First long distance running , then track and field provided a place where Louie could pour all of his energy and frustrations and instead of breaking and entering , Louie began breaking records . Coached by his brother , he soon dominated the local running competition and eventually went on to compete in the Olympics . Louie 's running career was interrupted by World War II , and in 1941 he joined the Army Air Corps.As the reader follows Louie into the war , you learn not only about his personal fears and challenges , but also about the war fought in the Pacific , the daily life of army airmen and the airplanes and technology of the time.On Thursday , May 27 , 1943 , Louie 's plane crashes into the Pacific . From there begins a story of survival that defies belief . Lost at sea , battling starvation and sharks , Louie survives . In the hands of the enemy , enduring beatings , humiliation and sickness , Louie survives . Back home , with the war still alive in his mind , he slides into alcoholism , and survives.Unbroken is a story of endurance , determination , and ultimately ( and most powerfully ) , the freedom that comes with forgiveness .	1
Unbroken : A World War II Story of Survival , Resilience and Redemption by Laura Hillenbrand is an amazing read . This is a true story of a WWII bombardier Louis Zamperini and his incredible journey from star athlete to suffering prisoner of war and finally to man at peace with his life . It is a truly inspiring tale of war and forgiveness . This book focuses on the Japanese and the War in the Pacific . I am more familiar with the German forces and the War in Europe . Louis 's journey really was an eye-opener for me . I never really comprehended how terrible the Pacific really was.Louis was a bombardier on a B-24 bomber . He was part of a crew that flew several bombing missions targeting strategic Japanese-held islands . After one such flight , his plane crashed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean . Louis and the pilot , Phil , were the only survivors . They were able to survive on a raft for 47 days . They fought dehydration , starvation and sharks . That journey of survival would be an entire book in of itself . However , the raft was only the beginning . They managed to reach land in the Marshall Islands which was occupied by the Japanese and from there their horrific journey really began.Louis 's treatment in the hands of the Japanese was appalling . Unlike the Germans , the Japanese did not adhere to the Geneva Convention 's treatment of prisoners of war . The prisoners were severely tortured by the Japanese guards . Ms. Hillenbrand was able to capture the horrific treatment of the Allied POWs . At times , I just wanted to close my eyes and deny that anyone could be treated that way . As I was reading , I kept comparing the POWs to the Jews in Europe . The POWs were routinely tortured , beaten , and executed at any given time . The Japanese even experimented on the POWs . As you read , you are shocked at their treatment.Ms . Hillenbrand description of the Louis 's torment was heart-wrenching . With every blow he received , you felt a little of his spirit fading away . I find it really incredible that she was able to get Louis and the other men to open up to her and share their horrific stories.The most compelling aspect of this book is the forgiveness that Louis is able to achieve . The author painted a picture of Louis as a tortured , broken and angry man when he returned from the War . It is truly amazing that Louis was able to feel any kind of forgiveness towards his tormentors . Ms. Hillenbrand vividly described Louis 's journey from total anger to total forgiveness . It is hard to fathom that kind of forgiveness.After I finished reading Unbroken , I watched a 60 Minutes piece on Louis Zamperini and Unbroken . Both Louis and Laura Hillenbrand were interviewed . First , Louis is still with us at 95 years old and he still has that unbroken spirit . Second , it took seven years to write Unbroken . In all that time , Louis and Laura never met . All of the interviews were conducted by phone . It is really remarkable that Ms. Hillenbrand was able to capture that confidence with Louis . If you enjoy historical nonfiction , I highly recommend this book .	1
highly recommended ! I rarely read nonfiction but this one i could n't put down and i loved it ! what a great man .	1
Was n't sure the kind of language that would be used as some of the war stories have language the military used , which I understand why , but do n't necessarily want to have a steady diet of it . I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoy Laura Hillenbrand 's writing . The story is very riviting and reveals a lot about the combat and how many perished by accidents as opposed to combat . Louie is incredibly tough , resilient and fascinating . Well written and enjoyable .	1
This book is good ... a little tedious but what do you expect concerning a book about being lost at sea ? But I think the book really covered everything well and kept me interested .	1
I can not believe that a person could survive in the circumstances detailed in this book . Gave a copy for a present	1
Wow we have all heard about the unjust done to POW 's in WWII at the hands of the Japanese but this really brings it home . I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it . The story of the Louie , his family and his Military family and friends is an amazing journey . My husband 's grandfather was a POW at the hands of the Japanese and even though he was n't in any of the camps mentioned in this book it sure hits home as to the abuse he was subjected to . Any one who wants a history filled journey should ready this book	1
This book helps you understand what the American POWs , captured by the Japanese , lived through , although many died . It is moving , at times difficult to keep reading , but an excellent book . It amazed me that people could live under the inhumane cirucumstances , but it 's written like a novel so you often forget that these things really happened .	1
I gave this rating because from the first page I was drawn into the story . Laura Hillenbrand surely knows how to grab your attention . Not once , was I bored with the book .	1
The writing often felt like generic , blockbuster movie-style writing with too many clich & eacute ; or hokey stories about stealing pies from windowsills but once I accepted this aspect of the book and then got into Louis Zamperini 's story I was hooked . Bottom line is that this is an amazing life story and while I may prefer a different manner of telling the tale , the story itself is very much worth reading .	1
I enjoyed reading this book but it was very scary . It was amazing what the men endured an lived to tell about it . Sometimes I dreaded reading the treatment they received but it was very enlightening.I recommend it highly to anyone .	1
Some of the most horrific episodes in human history have become the genesis of some of the most incredible tales , both factual and fictional ; such is the case with WWII . A time of great romance , patriotism , idealism and bravery , and also a time of unspeakable evil and brutality , it is still inspiring amazing and gripping stories 70 years after the war 's end.Unbroken stands tall among the amazing true stories of resilience and endurance during the horrors of this war . A juvenile delinquent who was headed for a life of certain catastrophy and failure , Louis Zamperini was rescued by his loving older brother who guided him into the world of racing . Louis soon discovered his talent and was headed for certain Olympic victory until his racing career was derailed by America 's entry into WWII.He entered flight school , washed out of pilot training , became a bombardier and was deployed to the Pacific . When their bomber was shot up and no longer able to fly he and his crew were forced to fly in a notorious problem plane . Sure enough , on their first mission out in it the plane experienced engine failure and crashed over the ocean , killing 8 of the 3 crewman . Zamperini and two others survived and thus began their harrowing ordeal of survival , lost at sea in the giant Pacific Ocean for several weeks on ill-equipped rafts . However , once they drifted to land they soon discovered that their real ordeal had just begun , as they fell into the hands of the Japanese and began 2-1/2 years of unspeakable existence in Japanese POW camps.This is a gripping story , well-written and well-read by the narrator . It follows Zamperini through war 's end and into the years afterward , as he struggled against his personal demons . In spite of marriage to a beautiful heiress and being feted as an American hero , Zamperini was once again spiraling into self-destruction , just as he had as an adolescent , until one night when everything changed and his life turned around.I particularly enjoyed the author 's detailed treatment of the B-24 `` Liberator '' bomber , as this was the same plane my father flew during WWII . Although my father was in the European theater rather than the Pacific , it gave me a better understanding of the challenges and risks he faced in flying this plane that was widely known as `` the coffin . '' I just realized that I am writing this review on the 13th anniversary of my father 's death . How serendipitous ... ... ... A wonderful story of resilience and redemption , all the better because it is all true . Much of what the POWs endured in the Japanese camps will turn your stomach ; nevertheless I highly recommend this book .	1
This is the story of Louie Zamperini , starting from his rebellious youth and his running in the 1936 Olympics . After enlisting in the Army , he becomes a bombardier in the Pacific during World War II . When his plane crashes , he survives for forty days in shark infested waters and is then captured by the Japanese.At this point , the story becomes very brutal , maybe a little too brutal for some readers . But the author has to make you fully understand the beatings , hunger , deprivation and humiliation that Louie endured . Then you can understand what it took for him to survive and what happened to him after the war . In the end , it 's really a story about redemption.I 'm a fan of true adventures that show how humans can become superhuman to overcome adversity that is beyond imagination . This is one book that I 'll never forget.Footnote : As with Laura Hillenbrand 's previous book , `` Seabiscuit : An American Legend '' , this book is certain to be made into a great movie .	1
This is a true story ... .and I always love a true story much better than fiction.It was recommended to me by a friend who is an avid reader . She never givesa bad tip . And she was so right about this one.Darn good book .	1
The story was so compelling . My father served on the SS Windsor in the Pacific . It was only when he was in his 80 's did he sometimes mention how terrible the Axis were towards captured service men . He died on 12/20/2010 and after reading this book I am sorry I can not ask him more questions . He was not a POW but he knew things and kept quiet about it for 65 years . This story is unforgettable .	1
I had really been looking forward to reading this one . The author 's first book , Seabiscuit , is one of my top ten favorite books and Unbroken has been getting great reviews since it came out . And I have to say , it actually lived up to my expectations . The story is incredible and Hillenbrand tells it really well.Unbroken is a biography of Louis Zamperini . I knew nothing about Louis before I read the book , but he has really lived an amazing life . Louis was an Olympic athlete whose track career was just about to reach it 's pinnacle , but was cut short by the start of World War II . After joining the Air Force , his B-24 went down in the Pacific while on a mission and he drifted at sea in an inflatable raft for over 40 days . He was then captured by the Japanese and shuttled around to several POW camps in Japan , where he was physically and mentally abused for years . During this entire time , his family did n't know if he was alive or dead or where he might be . Louis was finally released after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . However , once he got home , he had to grapple with leading a normal life again after all he had been through , which did not come easily.Really , each phase of Louis ' life could be its own book with its own great story . Just think about it - he competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany , the world 's first major televised event , where he met Hitler . He and the pilot of his B-24 broke the record for number of days stranded at sea . He was literally tortured and starved to the brink of death while a prisoner of war . And then he comes home and battles post-traumatic stress disorder . Each of these experiences is fascinating on its own , but when you put it all together and take in that this happened to one person in a very short period of time , it kind of blows your mind.Hillenbrand does Louis ' life justice . She does seem to have a knack for finding unique protagonists with compelling stories ( like Seabiscuit and his entourage ) , and having a great character to base a book obviously makes for a good story . But her style takes the story to the next level because she is really good at capturing characters . She shows the good and the bad and her insight into personalities is spot on . Hillenbrand has chronic fatigue syndrome and she is often bed-ridden and unable to write . It takes her years to write books because she is physically unable to work quickly . You would think her writing would be disjointed or labored because of the effort she has to put forth , but it is not . Her books flow so nicely and even though she is writing non-fiction , she pulls you into the story as if it were a novel . She really is just a great writer.My only minor quibble with this book it hits a slow point about 100 pages . After Louis joins the Air Force , the story bogs down a bit in military detail . This could just be me - excessive detail in military history tends to turn me off - but it was only a small part of the book and the story quickly picked up after that.In a nutshell : I definitely recommend it - an unbelievable story that is really well-written . Five stars . ( And if you have n't read Seabiscuit yet , go pick it up . Do n't make me tell you twice . )	1
good reason for anyone interested in World War 2 or Japanese prisoners of war or a life story of a man whose life with filled with accomplishments and also hard times but he made it through a good story a good read a good author other book Seabiscuit is also very good .	1
Great history book . What else can I ? U R forcing me to write my life story which I am not good at !	1
Being of Jewish descent I 've read many books regarding the suffering of the Jews , political prisioners , and `` the others '' caught in the grips of the Nazi's.I have not had as deep an education from the men fighting on the other side of the line.A friend recommended this book . I 'm not a heavy non fiction reader but got into this story right away.The early years gave enough information to grasp Louies determination to get him through the suffering he faced in the prison camps.Having just finished Hope is the Last to Die by Halina Birenbaum , I understand why Zamperini goes into such depth about the conditions , names , techniques , etc . of what he suffers in the camps.It can become a little tedious at times , but you have to get the whole idea of the day by day events to truly understand the degradation and emotional psychological pressure to break the human spirit.There are parts that are a little hard to believe , he chooses who he will concentrate on acknowledging with respect , ( what happened to Phil ? ) , but overall it was a good read , and I too would recommend it .	1
There are so many stories about the European Theatre during WWII , that it was interesting to learn about the Pacific Theatre in some detail . While this book tells us a lot about history , including what it was like to grow up in the pre war years and what life was like post war , it reads like a fast pace fictional action thriller . I like that the author tells you what happens to all the characters so one is not left wondering . There were two times in the book when i thought the author was going to use the story to preach the value of religion but it was relieving to know the religious portions were actually just factual portions of the main character 's life and was given no more and no less weight than other portions of the story .	1
This was my first Kindle book and I certainly made the right choice . I 'm not a huge history buff but this book blew me away . I can not believe what he and all other POWs went through all those years and how many survived . I really could n't put this book down . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
I had a hard time putting this book down once I started reading it . It is a tear jerker , but a very good book !	1
It all started with a great , true story . The story unfolded like a well-crafted novel , which made me have to remind myself that it was based on actual events and people . Well done Laura , I also loved `` Seabiscuit '' so this exhibits a wide , wide range . To sum up , I absolutely loved it .	1
i was so inpressed with her other book seabiscuit , i preordered this book and she did not disappoint me , what a story ! ! i hope she writes another biography soon because i will read anything written by her .	1
Well written and engrossing . Ms. Hillenbrand does an excellent job of telling Louie Zamperini 's story and setting it in place with all the events swirling around it . It is an amazing read .	1
A thrilling book	1
I was touched by this man 's story on so many levels . His ability to go through really tough parts of his life but retain the sense of humor were endearing . Even more endearing was his ability to take the ups and downs of life and never loose faith . I could re-hash the story line but I have a feeling everyone will know his story when it comes to the big screen . When I saw this man on Jay Leno interview I knew this was the real deal . This man is amazing and at 93 his story and his book should be on every schools reading list . A true living legend !	1
No matter how bad your day , no matter how bad your life circumstances , they will never seem as dire or as insumountable after you have read the story of Louie Zamperini . I dare say , you will even find yourself feeling grateful and able to face any hardship after comparing your life to his . This epic telling of an extrodinary life made me feel that way and more ! So will you .	1
A gripping novel on the brave , fearful & cheerful journey of Louie Zamperini . The plase crash and number of days adrift at sea , the animal like treatment by the Japanese to US POW 's and the dangers of flying a B-52 at war make a lasting impression . How could it all have happened to one man ?	1
I enjoyed the book . it was a wonderful read , the characters were so real and he was a outstanding indvidual	1
I read this book in two days and if I had n't had to take care of my family , may have read it in one . I could n't put it down.This is the true story of Louie Zamperini , a troubled child , who later became an Olympic miler and then a World War II Hero . I do n't like to give away too much , but as I was reading and followed his life I asked myself over and over , how much more can one man take ? It is an inspirational and uplifting story .	1
I 'll keep this short and simple , this is one of the best books I have ever read . Really enjoyed it , found it hard to put down . This is an amazing story of the human spirit and the will to live . Ca n't wait for the movie to come out . Louie is all heart , hats off to you old solider.Living FREE in America.Phil	1
This story would be incredable if it were fiction , but it 's not , it 's true . The conditions adrift and then as a POW are jaw dropping . The beginning where Louis describes his childhood is a little slow , but it 's necessary in order to know the character and understand his survival , determination and resilience . His story after the war and the obsticles he must overcome to get his life streightened out is equally compelling and challenging . Highly recommended !	1
Very well researched , written account of WWII . The author clearly put a lot of time into getting an accurate account of the story and made you not want to put it down .	1
What an amazing story ! Thank you Louie for your service to our country , and for your unbendable spirit ! Like the saying goes , truth is stranger than fiction . What Louie went through , Hollywood would never be able to dream up ! So wonder they are making a movie about this ! I appreciated Louie showing us his up close thoughts and actions as his mischief as a boy , helped him later as he pushed to become an Olympian , a bombardier , and a POW during World War II , suffering through some amazing atrocities and still remained UNBROKEN .	1
This was a difficult book for me personally get through . Not because it was bad or boring but because it 's a true story that dealt with countless war crimes committed by the Japanese against POW 's during WW2 . I do n't see how you ca n't have an emotional response to what they did and the greater crime was how our Government let Japan off the hook for most of them.Do n't get me wrong , this is a story of Louie Zamperini but there is so much more to it . Laura Hillenbrand covers a lot of events and things that went on during the time frame of Louie 's life and this helped make the book more interesting than most would think . Laura succeeds in the history aspect of it because she leaves her personal feelings out of it . Do you know if Laura is a liberal or conservative ? Neither do I because she stays objective and tells an honest story instead of being bogged down by ideology . I only mention this because so many authors who write about history these days seem like they want to ram their view down your throat . All of them could take a valuable lesson from Laura Hillenbrand.For everyone that makes assumptions about Laura 's facts , I challenge you to go through all her references that she lists at the end of the book and come up with something more accurate if you are so sure she is wrong . I think there are over 50 pages or so of references , this lady double checked her work before she put it in print .	1
Having read only a few on Ms. Oates ' other works , I ca n't say that I was particularly a fan . However , I was totally engrossed by her heart-felt , candid account of her widowhood . It is not an easy subject to explore . I was moved to tears , sensed the visceral abandonment she described , and smiled at times at the steely eye with which she described her new status in life . In other words , I 'm a convert ...	1
`` A Widow 's Story '' by Joyce Carol Oates is a heavy tome , a challenge to read to the very end . It takes stamina and determination to wade thru the exhausting account of one woman 's sudden immersion into the state of widowhood . It 's as though the reader slips into her every thought while she comes to grip with the sudden passing of her husband of almost five decades.The first 100 pages plus drip with moment by moment descriptions of her egregious loss and subsequent shock because the initial diagnosis suggested her husband was very ill ; no doubt take a long time to recover , but he would live . Life pulsed forward and Joyce tried valiantly to maintain a steady rhythm never anticipating some uncontrollable secondary infection would steal her beloved husband within hours of their last brief easy exchange . For the first time since Ray entered the Emergency Room barely a week earlier Joyce found herself relishing in a good night 's sleep when the doom-filled sound of her telephone screamed her awake in the small hours of the night . Her race to the hospital and her complete disbelief when she was told Ray had `` just died ! '' among strangers sliced her reality into denial and momentary insanity.Bit by bit the reader witnesses Joyce 's shock fade into the trauma of handling phone calls , locating a funeral home , returning home where she realizes the front door was left open in her devastation and panic . The opened front door has allowed all sorts of impossible concepts to leak into her consciousness and they do n't go away regardless of the time of day.Anyone who has ever lost a loved one suddenly can identify with the rampant escape of sensibility when the first words `` he or she has died ! '' are spoken . It 's as though a tsunami of emotion wrenches all sense of stability from underneath you ; then the floods of thoughts dealing with the impossible-to-believe overwhelm with abject denial . In the aftermath you feel compelled to find out WHY , HOW , WHEN - all the reasons to explain the unimaginable . Then comes the telling to others when you are trying to speak the words you could never imagine saying out loud - your child or your husband or your parent has died . If you do n't say it , it wo n't be true but it is there right in front of you . Denial dominates every thought & gesture but it too quickly becomes the truth , impossible to ignore.This is a very difficult book to read . The imagery is exquisite and the writing that of a well seasoned author who has a wealth of experience painting emotions with words . Yet it 's almost `` TMI , '' too much information . As I read I yearned for a slice of relief from the oppressive grief and anguish . With each page turn I hoped for an easing of her agony , loneliness and overwhelming sense of abandonment . It was as if I was wearing a pair of cement waders trying desperately to climb out of the abyss of sadness to discover even a minimal amount of acceptance or gratitude . When a person 's entire identity is focused on what has been lost even though it is very understandable , the diary-like quality of describing it in endless detail no matter how beautifully composed grows weighted down.My heart breaks for Joyce but I hope today , with some time having elapsed since Ray 's death , she has regained her equilibrium and fortitude to write again with her beautiful style and amazing subject matter .	1
In the second of a trilogy involving the Turkish city of Ruin , our hero and heroine look for Eden , all the while fighting the evil forces within the mysterious and now almost destroyed citadel plus rogue elements within the Catholic Church.Both Liv and Gabriel have a lot to do and go through plenty of grief to get there . Helped by Turkish cop Arkadian , they almost do n't make it.I found the story entertaining and pretty well written . Though it jumps around a lot which is a bit distracting , it does flow forward and keeps to the point . There are a lot of characters to keep track of but in the end , everything converges with the side stories colliding in a fiery ( metaphor ) conclusion that puts a new twist on biblical stories.I liked it . The writing is well done with solid third person and though there is some head-hopping , it 's not so bad to detract from the story . Since this is a trilogy , I 'm waiting to see what happens in the inevitable cliffhanger . I 'm looking forward to it . Highly recommended .	1
The Little House is a remarkable gem of a psychological thriller . It makes even the most normal , everyday events seem sinister and riveting.The plot focuses on Ruth who is talked into starting a family by her husband and living down the road from his upper class parents in the country . Then the nightmare unfolds . The book is a masterpiece of claustrophobia as Ruth 's in-laws intrude more and more into her life . All throughout the book I felt tense and unsettled - just as I love to be when I am reading a thriller . I could absolutely empathise with Ruth and as her situation got worse and worse I was routing for her all the way.Ruth is a delightful , yet in some ways tragic character . She is a successful journalist and yet her past has meant that she is needy and desperately seeking love . She thinks she has found a family which she can belong to at long last in her in-laws but what she fails to realise is that they want to control her . The mother in-law , father in-law , and Ruth 's husband Patrick are chillingly plausible and well developed . The beauty in this novel is that unlike in many other psychological thriller 's these three characters are not evil , they truly believe they are doing the best for Ruth and themselves - even as they push her further and further towards the limits of her own sanity.Overall The Little House is a fantastic study of relationships between a woman and her in-laws and how the ordinary things can lead someone to madness , and to do the most unspeakable things . The Little House 's packs a hard , chilling punch , especially as the ending is so unexpected and compelling . I would recommend this book unreservedly.JoAnne	1

A military rescue mission ( if they can find our suvivors ) WOW ... I do n't know how I would of reacted in this situation but I can tell you this our armed forces have been making soldiers right for a long time ( thank you ) .this true story will grab you and inspire you , give this book a read ( recommended ) .Namaste '	1
It was a very interesting book . I had never heard of this historical event until this book came out . It was nice to get a history lesson . I am amazed that they survived .	1
Loved reading about the indigenous people the plane 's occupants came in contact with . Love learning about other cultures . Love it .	1
I am a sucker for good survival stories . And the premise of this true story by Marshall Zuckoff is a great yarn about a little known story in the closing months of World War II.However , this book is not just a survival story about a plane crash , but it is also a book about a little known area of New Guinea that this crash occurred in 1945 . As with all great survival stories , the routine ` three hour tour ' becomes an epic tale of survival.From the opening paragraphs , I knew this was going to be a good book , and I was not disappointed . I had actually heard of this story of three survivors of a horrible sightseeing crash during 1945 in a theatre that has received little American attention ( New Guinea ) . I also knew vaguely of the fact that feared ` head-hunters ' had protected the survivors despite their fearsome reputation . This reputation was such that one participant stated he would rather die by hiking through Japanese occupied lands than die being eaten by a cannibal . And so , Zuckoff tells an interesting story that never lost my attention.I really liked that the author , who is also a journalism professor , never loses sight of the interesting stories that made up a complex tale . From the beautiful WAC , to the various officers and men who made up the rescue party , the story is very interesting and exciting and I really liked how Zuckoff weaves all kinds of anecdotes about not only the Americans , but also the tribesman who had never seen outsiders before and believed them to be spirits . Talk about a cargo cult , what must have been the thoughts as these soldiers flew in with metal machines and dropped things from the skies ? The fascination in knowing that the author went to the crash sight and interviewed some of the participants only made for a more compelling book .	1
Mitchell Zuckoff 's true story of survival is very interesting and exciting . It 's a richly researched account of the plane crash and subsequent rescue efforts . I loved his descriptions of the jungle people of New Guinea and how they lived isolated for so many years.It 's a great read . Thank you Mr. Zuckoff for such an enjoyable book .	1
This book is amazing in two ways : 1 ) The discovery of a truly `` Lost Civilization '' during World War Two is a shocker , 2 ) It seems there was virtually no media coverage after the war . It 's astounding that this never even became a footnote in history , yet the discovery , and study of primitive man is a major event.I 'd never heard of this until I read a New York Times Book Review.The book drags in parts , so I believe 4 stars is in order .	1
top story line , not fiction like most war stories.book was hard to put down , the author has put a lot of time into the history of this war	1
This is very powerful , sensitive readers might get triggered , or upset by this story . Unfortunately this kind of story is all too real . Im glad some people can & # 34 ; heal & # 34 ; by writting a book.I know all too well how abuse can damage a person and reading this story makes you understand even more the extend of the damage , .Again sensitive person be aware	1
I did enjoy the story , but there were so many characters popping in and out that it was somewhat confusing at first . There is a life lesson to be learned from the story , which is often not learned by many . You never really know your parents , until you learn who they were before they became Mommy and Daddy . The WW11 era plot was exciting , and when it jumped forward in time , it left you with a strong desire to get back to it . This was my first book by the author , and I would definitely read more from her .	1
I enjoyed this story a little too much on the Hedstrom family but overall a good read . The main plot was intriguing I did get there before the end but not far in advance so it was n't predictable . I will be buying the next one in the series .	1
Typical Camilla Lackberg . Very exicting.Gave a chilling summer-feeling and Camilla really tells good stories with a good language.I love swedish crime .	1
Ever since I read the first in the series , The Ice Princess , I have waited with anticipation for the translation of Lackberg 's next novel , and every time she blows me away . Her books are beautifully written , give nsight into the Scandinavian mindset and culture and always have gripping plots . I was late to work three days in a row last week because I could n't put The Stonecutter down . Her blending of the historical happenings that have led to the modern-day murder are always intriguing .	1
it was ok , i guess from the review of an aquaintance , i expected better , but it was alot of back and forth in the story , at times got confusing	1
If u like name of the wind and blood song u will love this series ! ! The prince is extremely dark And clever as hell .	1
I really like the evil side of this genre , and this book fits right in . The main character is easy to get into . The storyline was not bad either . I cant think of anything negative to say except that now that I have read the book I can not really remember it . I remember enjoying reading though so it gets 4 stars .	1
With an antihero ( ? ) self-made sociopath set in a really cool version of our world , it slowly sticks its knife in you and pulls you along with it to the end . I ca n't go without saying it belongs in the same & # 34 ; dark & # 34 ; school as the Nightangel series by Brent Weeks . Stupendously intense , I 'll be reading the other books as well .	1
This is one of the odder books I 've read in a while . I ca n't tell you why I neither hated nor loved it . It was better than good because I kept _wanting_ to read it , and not great because I do n't think I left the book with a defined emotional reaction.I 'll probably at least start the sequel . I suppose my biggest complaint is that the emotional range is sorta flat , and none of the wonder is riveting enough . The book could be twenty thousand words heavier and still feel like it was emaciated . We get hints and the like , but nothing solid about the world or the lead character .	1
While I 'm not a big fan of first person style stories this was n't a bad one . I enjoyed the book and look forward to the next one .	1
Book was great . Loved the different scheme with the main character and with its time line ! ! The author used some good ideas and makes u root for the dark soul prince . Stared reading the next book and it 's not letting me down .	1
I had no idea that this is more than just fantasy until I 'd read it ; it 's also post-apocalyptic ! Lawrence does a fantastic job of creating a far future Earth that has reverted to a dark age that also seems to incorporate magic . Stunning . Read it .	1
Very good book . Flew through it . The strengths are the fast pace of the action ( much of it involving events not predictable ) and the smartass and very intelligent protagonist . Looking forward to the next installment .	1
I have to disagree with those who compare this book to `` The Da Vinci Code '' . The only similarity is that both deal with religion and involve secret organizations . Instead of the rather `` gimmicky '' Brown approach , however , this book is much more theologically profound , relying on a new interpretation of the biblical Genesis story . Once the basic premise is accepted , the book does hang together theologically . Toyne deals with a variation of salvation history rather than Christian history , at least in this first book of a Trilogy . I gave it only four stars because of his failure , noted by other reviewers , to give us a better taste of modern Turkish and middle eastern time and place . Still , by any standard and especially for a first novel , it is a very gripping tale that moves quickly , gets us interested in the characters and leads to a very satisfying conclusion . I will be reading `` The Key '' very shortly.Sanctus : A Novel	1
Loved this . Excellent read , fantastic attention to historical details without ever overwhelming the reader.Now I 'm going to have to go buy all the others .	1
Like the author , I have read the Saxon Chronicles . The available historical information is limited , usually coming from surviving writings of monks , although some information can be found in Danish sagas and such . The author has filled in the gaps with historical fiction based on known battles , births and deaths of kings and other leaders , and known details of society during that period . The action is carried forward by the fictional character Uhtred . The series started with his support of Alfred the Great , who has now died and been followed in succession by his son , Edward . This novel extends into the beginning of the 10th century.The novel departs somewhat into various side issues involving Uhtred , who seems to survive in various battles and other actions ( including a confrontation with a supposed seeress who could tell fortunes ) . There are various confrontations with the Catholic church ( Uhtred is a pagan who believes in Norse gods ) . The status of women during that time period seems to be accurate - they married young and often died young . The lifespan of men was also much shorter than now . Uhtred describes himself as an old man of 45 in the shield wall during a battle.The Danes will obviously outlast Uhtred . Battles between Saxons and Danes continued into the 11th century before the Danish power was broken in both Ireland ( by Brian ) and in England . The Saxons and Danes would eventually battle each other into exhaustion , and the Normans would move in and take over ( the Normans being descended from Vikings who settled in Normandy ) .Depiction of Saxon life in England seems to be accurate . White slavery flourished in England and the rest of Europe , and white slaves were a major commodity in trade . That would continue for several more centuries . Many of us undoubtedly had ancestors who were slaves .	1
Great bloody battles . Utrid 's method of solving problems is to kill all his king 's enemies ; and he does . This one has even less character development and scene setting than the previous books in the Utrid series . But nobody writes battle scenes and fights better than Bernard Cornwell.MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY : 1969 - Sex , Drugs , Rock 'n Roll , and Football	1
outstanding writer and great book , i have read the whole series and really enjoy how he incorporates historical data into his books	1
I really enjoyed reading this book . Its emphasis is on describing the experiences of the people who lived through the Second World War . This is both from an individual level and community/societal level . You get the feel of what it was like to be living in that period in those places.Some examples that stick in my mind are : the strand of society in Britain who were entirely unaffected by the war . They just carried on as if nothing was happening . Another memorable example : the Asian people living in British colonies who were unhelpful to their colonial masters when the Japanese invaded their country - basically because their colonizers had treated them very disrespectfully in their rule . The colonial masters had sowed pent-up resentment.There are also some other perspectives written about that I found very interesting , and had n't read in other books , for example , Germany 's economic state affecting its chances of winning the war . Germany 's economy was weaker than it seemed on the surface.Overall , I think this book would be a good companion to a more traditional Second World War history ( which describes chronological events ) . Together , they would help the reader a gain a fuller picture about what happened during the war and the effects on the people involved .	1
Max Hastings does not disappoint in his latest work , Inferno . The book is a one-volume history of WW2 . In case you have read Hasting 's other WW2 books , he makes it clear in the introduction that in this book he makes an effort not to rehash at length subjects he has covered in his previous works . He also makes a point to cover less well known aspects of the war , at least less well known in the western world . Hastings does a terrifc job of capturing the human drama and tragedy of the war . He does this by quoting extensively from both military and civilian letters , journal entries and memoirs , most often those of ordinary citizens and the lower ranks . Hastings leaves the reader with no doubt as to the monstrous crimes perpetrated upon the world by the Germans and the Japanese . At the same time , while he acknowledges the essential contribution made to the Allied war effort by the Soviet Union , he does not exempt the Soviets for their own crimes against humanity . I listened to the audible unabridged audio version of this book , highly recommended .	1
The idea that World War II can be summarized in a single , readable volume seems impossible . The conflict was truly global and immense . Yet historians and non-historians continue to attempt the feat . Some succeed to a large extent . Many don't.Max Hastings is one of the few who does a good job - no , a masterful job - of summarizing much of the history of WWII in 651 pages , every page being a chronicle of death , destruction and tragedy . WWII has been characterized as the `` last good war '' . But like almost all wars , it was a war that did n't have to happen . Between the craven cowardice of the French and the hopeful cowardice of the English , war in Europe could most likely have been prevented . This cowardice played out in the ridiculously stupid League Of Nations in failing to check the Japanese aggression in Southeast Asia . And , of course , the United States with its strongly isolationist outlook of the 1930s contributed to the inevitability of the war as well.Hastings has distinguished himself in his earlier books . He is a masterful military historian with very pronounced opinions , most of which I agree with . Anyone approaching this history assuming that the Americans and British will be covered in glory for their wartime military exploits will be sorely disappointed . Hastings gives credit where credit is due for the military victory in Europe and that is to the Soviet Union . Needless to say , Hastings has little but scorn for the French , which is as it should be.The events of WWII are too widely known to bear mere repetition , so Hastings attempts to use personal diaries and anecdotes , military unit diaries and other secondary sources to give the conflict a human dimension . He succeeds in this . The love letters from German soldiers to their loved ones - often recovered from their corpses - reveal that what we consider normal human emotions , like love , can exist in men whose evil is beyond comprehension . The Germans and their allies invaded the Soviet Union with nothing but loot , pillage , rape , enslavement , murder and eventual extermination in mind . In the first year of the German/Soviet conflict , Germans intended for between 30 and 40 million Soviet citizens to die , mostly through starvation as Germany looted foodstuffs to feed its armies and domestic population.Hastings is a skilled writer . Though laden with detail , the history moves fairly quickly . Not a page-turner by any means , but every page is laden with interesting detail . In terms of notable historic events , the student of the period will find little new here . There are interesting details on General Patton 's anti-Semitism and his increasing derangement toward war 's end.Though British ( and often accused of favoring the British in his work ) Hastings is absolutely unsparing when it comes to the failings of British commanders in ever theater of the war . Montgomery , in particular , is pilloried and justifiably so . In fact , very few of the commanders of any of the combatants get words of praise . Hastings holds nearly all of them accountable for their mistakes and lapses , but most of this is already well known to the history buff.Overall , Hastings has produced one of the very best single-volume histories to date of WWII . It should be required reading for every high school student in each of the combatant nations of WWII . That wo n't happen , of course , which is why as many can see we are on our way to a new conflict , but that 's another story.In all , Hastings has written a very approachable history of the greatest and so far bloodiest conflict in history . It is necessary reading for anyone interested in WWII or even those who simply desire to know how the world we live in today came to be.Jerry	1
The history of the war is interlarded with many quotes , personal vignettes , and `` war stories '' . While I have n't tried to do an accurate count , I would estimate these to be 50 % of the text . This is not without value , if it 's what you are looking for . I was n't , and while many are interesting I found them a distraction that obstructed the history . In defense of the author , he is quite open , in his introduction , about what he intends to do and I will not let this lower the rating I give him ( although I would not buy the book if I had a do-over ) . War is indeed hell , but I could have done without the constant reminders . The history part is solid if sometimes lacking in detail . Hastings is at his best when demythologizing seldom-criticized leaders , military and civilian , and exposes any number of clay feet . One thing that could have been done better is the maps . If you want to pin down a place you have just read about , good luck - finding it on the map is a crapshoot . And the maps are oddly placed , often coming many pages after , or before , the places where they would have been most useful .	1
It reads like great fiction . So many important aspects are covered . So many personal stories told . So many fascinating factoids mentioned . This is the book to buy if you are looking for a gift or a first read.This is the best single book I have read on WWII out of many great ones.USA 's strategic and political , including post-war , aspect are largely missing so I would also read a good biography of Franklin Roosevelt , such asFDR by Jean Edward Smith , or the global strategic masterpiece ( although a bit harder to read ) A World at Arms : A Global History of World War II .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this book . It is well written and given the subject matter surprisingly readable , maintaining a decent pace throughout and finishing with some interesting thoughts . It is a depressing subject and the author does not try and hide his disappointment at the way things have gone and are going . But , as a book which follows a key player through some very interesting times in Afghanistan , it is a very good read . The author makes his points , backs them up with examples and a few anecdotes and then stops .	1
I could n't give this 5 stars , only because the real-life issues are so wrenching . The book is well written , and although some of the English slang did n't make sense , I could generally get the idea ( it took me a while to figure out that fairy lights are actually Christmas lights ! ) . I find it horrible that a child had such a terrible childhood , but am heartened to know that people like Casey are there to pick up the pieces and put them back together as much as possible .	1
I know the title is quite sad but believe it or not the book is actually very upbeat . This is a wonderfully written story and I could hardly put it down . The subject matter is sad but the approach that Casey and her husband take when dealing with children like the boy in the book is remarkable . I will be reading her other books as well . She 's a terrific writer .	1
This is an intense study and memoir dealing with problem children and foster care . here are heartbreaking moments as one reads through Casey Watson 's narration . One feels her overall concern and honest feelings for the child . I 've read the one review which savagely attacks this book and each person is entitled to his or her own feelings and viewpoint on a book like this , but I personally urge all who have a heart and a concern for `` difficult '' children to read this . I think you will learn much of value .	1
I 'm not quite sure why , in the last month , I 've ended up reviewing two stories by foster care parents from England ( `` Another Forgotten Child '' by Cathy Glass , and now the current one by Casey Watson ) . These obviously constitute a genre , and both authors write ongoing series about their experiences as foster carers . Both children , the little girl Aimee in Glass ' book and the boy Spencer in Watson 's , are presented as violent , perhaps abusive , and incorrigible . There are significant differences , however ; Aimee 's family is clearly totally dysfunctional , whereas Spencer 's appears at first glance to be completely `` normal '' except for the fact that it seems his mother may be an alcoholic . Yet his four siblings , two older and two younger , seem well-balanced , and Spencer is initially portrayed as having presented himself for temporary foster care . This leads to his placement with Casey and Mike Watson , who are trained and certified to use a specialized `` points '' program that has proved effective in dealing with extremely difficult youngsters.As mentioned , I 'm not really certain why I chose these two books from the options available . Certainly I am concerned with the problems of abused children , although I 've never had any personal experience with this issue , either as a parent or grandparent . Nor have I ever been a foster parent , or been trained to do the type of nurturing that this extremely challenging endeavor requires . The level of caring and patience which is evidenced in these stories is truly awesome.One other significant difference between these two stories I 've just read does stand out . In Cathy 's narrative , the child protective services are depicted as severely understaffed , and extremely questionable in terms of follow-through . Casey does n't seem to have such difficulties , although she , too , alludes to the fact that some of the service personnel with whom she works seem to be over-taxed and perhaps too inclined to `` stick to the book '' rather than deal with the realities of an extraordinary situation.In any event , I found this book , like Glass ' , beautifully told , completely human , and extremely valuable in making the story of a damaged child both enlightening and enthralling . Certainly anyone who is even slightly interested in this subject area should find it an extremely worthwhile read .	1
This book will haunt you , but is nevertheless worth the read . This is a raw account of a young woman 's harrowing ordeal of being trafficked and forced into prostitution . I can not say it is a book I would read again , but I do n't need to as it will stay with me forever . I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and becoming aware of this very real , global issue . Sophie is a courageous woman .	1
A courageous and at times terrifying book ... it says so much about manipulation and the working on the human mind , and how predators can gain control over a person through isolation , violence , threats , etc . It talks about many issues including stalking and the desire to protect others , whatever the cost to yourself.Sophie now raises awareness of human trafficking but still has not quite overcome the emotional/psychologic aspects of what happened to her . The violence also left her with permanent brain damage at a very young age .	1
This is a noteworthy novel with believable characters -- some of whom are going through the throes of religious exploration , marital challenges , psychiatric disease , family pathology , romantic obsession , and the vagaries of post-adolescent friendships.It follows a group of young adults as they emerge from an Ivy League college in the early '80s . Their emergent experiences are portrayed in a nicely paced and well-developed fashion -- often humorous , often tragic . It was so well-done that I started having flashbacks of my own college years , with the quirky professors and the stresses of graduate school , etc.My only complaint might be that an excessive amount of space was devoted to a didactic account of the origins and treatment of `` manic-depression '' along with the ins and outs of lithium management . Yet , the good far outweighs the boring , and the overall effect is stupefyingly good . I strongly recommend this book to lovers and seekers of high grade contemporary fiction .	1
mini SPOILERS . I liked the Virgin Suicides , loved Midddlesex , and also liked this book ... but , I think it seemed like Eugenides was trying to show off how much he knows about literature and religious studies . Yes , a book like this needs some references to these things , but , it 's like he was trying very hard to make the rest of us feel bad for not being familiar with these references . He is a terrific writer , deserved the Pulitzer , I wish he 'd come down to earth . I liked the story of the 3 main characters . Felt myself wanting to kick Madeline for her decisions related to Leonard and for not seeing how great Mitchell was . Disappointed in the ending , we all want a happy ending when it comes to love . Would have liked to have Mitchell figure out his path in life , too .	1
I really enjoyed this book it kept me wanting to keep reading hard to put down all of the books by this author are very well good I never been left wondering why did I waste my money on a book	1
This book just proves to us that life is so very short and we should treasure each day we are given as Patrick did . It was unfair that he was taken so young but in many ways so blessed to have so many good people that loved him and his son Michael dearly . Blessed to have had Cathy and her family , and to fall in love again before the angels came . Some ppl are not so lucky to find true love at all let alone twice in a lifetime . First with his beloved wife waiting in heaven for him and then again with Cathy . My heart went out to everyone in this story and I cried with them as I read thru the pages . God hasanother Angel in heaven to watch over us . Thank you Cathy for sharing yet another amazing part of your life with us .	1
Story Description : HarperCollins ( UK ) |April 16 , 2012|Trade Paperback|ISBN : 978-0-744263-8When Cathy is first asked to foster one-day old Harrison her only concern is if she will remember how to look after a baby . But upon collecting Harrison from the hospital , Cathy realizes she has more to worry about than she thought when she discovers that his background is shrouded in secrecy.She is n't told why Harrison is in foster care and his social worker says only a few are aware of his very existence , and if his whereabouts became known his life , and that of his parents , could be in danger . Cathy tries to put her worries aside as she looks after Harrison , a beautiful baby , who is alert and engaging . Cathy and her children quickly bond with Harrison although they know that , inevitably , he will eventually be adopted.But when a woman Cathy does n't know starts appearing in the street outside her house acting suspiciously , Cathy fears for her own family 's safety and demands some answers from Harrison 's social worker . The social worker tells Cathy a little but what she says is very disturbing . How is this woman connected to Harrison and can she answer the questions that will affect Harrison 's whole life ? My Review : A BABY 'S CRY is one of Cathy 's best books yet . She has managed to outdo herself yet again ! Harrison is shrouded in such secrecy that I could n't turn the pages fast enough wanting to know more and more information about him and wondering if Cathy was ever going to receive the answers to the questions about him and his reasons for being in care were ever going to be replied to.Cathy 's own children became so attached to Harrison and called him ` Harry ' for short and soon looked at him as their ` little brother ' . They so loved coming home from school to play with him and help Cathy take care of Harrison.Suddenly a strange woman begins appearing across the street from Cathy 's home which frightens her own children but each time Cathy looks out the window at her or opens the door , the woman dashes off before Cathy even has the chance to call to her and ask her what she wants or who she is . Then one night , this very same strange woman knocks on Cathy 's door late at night when her own children and Harrison are asleep in bed and Cathy is terrified ! Should she call the emergency number at the agency she works for ? Or should she call the police ? Harrison is eventually placed but after almost a year , leaving Cathy 's home is extremely hard on her own children who ask why they ca n't adopt Harrison because they still feel he is their ` brother ' but Cathy tries her hardest to explain to them that it would n't be in the best interest of little Harrison.This one was definitely a page-turner and I 'll be highly recommending it to my friends and anyone else who 'll listen ! Congratulations on a well-written page-turner , Cathy ! !	1
What a fabulous second book to the trilogy . I ca n't believe I have to wait for the final book ! Ca n't wait ! !	1
Pretty good read . Not as good as hunger games but could n't put it down so five stars it is lol	1
I 'm so happy I decided to start reading this series . Not only was the first book really , really good ... The second book not only lived up to the first but exceeded my expectations . I enjoyed Tris as the narrator and main character so much because for the better half of this book she was flawed . It 's refreshing to see a realistic , strong female character that is not perfect , that grows and becomes better through her experiences.I loved how every little piece came together at the end of this book . I 'm a little wary of book three but I ca n't help but be excited to read it too .	1
If you enjoyed the Hunger Games series , you will enjoy this , although it is a different story altogether . Well written , exciting and suspenseful .	1
This was a great read ! A little bit too much violence but still a great story . Dreading the third because I have seen that it has bad reviews .	1
Tis series was recommended to me by a high school English teacher and I am so glad I read it ! Well written for the most part , good character development , and I am anxious to see how the series continues ! Highly recommend .	1
I fell in love with Tris and Four and with Roth 's writing on Divergent . And when I really love a book , I make disciples out of my friends . She managed to stay clear out of Hunger Games waters and yet create as a disturbing future as Suzanne Collins did , with the exception that ... Oops , ca n't say . I 'm not really good with reviews , I 'm good with : HOLY DAMN , JUST READ IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN !	1
Insurgent follows Divergent as the second book in this series . The young heroine , Tish , who had to choose what faction to belong to when she turned 16 , chose the reckless , military-like Dauntless faction over her own quiet , Quakerish group . She must learn how to live among the Dauntless and survive , and then discovers that larger and more terrible things are happening that impact her whole world . This series is in the same vein as Hunger Games , but totally different . It is well written , fast-paced and the characters are strongly drawn . I am eagerly awaiting the third book due out in October .	1
I enjoyed the twists and turns of Tris and Four/Tobias emotions towards each other and those around them . How easy it is to mistrust someone or misunderstand where they are coming from . I would recommend this second book to anyone who enjoyed The Hunger Games trilogy .	1
I loved the series . I am 75 and loved it and I had my 18 year old grand daughter read them . She also loved them .	1
Loved it , action packed and could not put it down . Kept you guessing right until the end . Ca n't wait for the next book !	1
Wow . Just wow . Loved this book it took me two weeks tops for me to finish this . The endorsing had a huge twist .	1
So ... I had already forgotten stuff , and this one picks right up where Divergent left off , so it took me a few pages to get back into the story and slowly remember little details . LOL . At first I was like who IS Tobias , then I was like DUH . I was just used to him being called Four.Tris was a wild card in this one though . I know its guilt , fear , and the different factions warring in her head , but at times I liked her and others I wished I could smack some sense into her . She takes risks without thinking about the gain and sometimes that puts those she loves in more danger because of it . But she is still strong , and loyal . Everything she does , she does it out of love , loyalty and her view of the greater good . It is just hard though when she is taking those risks and being self sacrificing because you know that it wo n't go down a good road.It was hard reading about Four and Tris in this one though . They had moments where they seemed to really belong together and then the next second they are lying to each other and constantly hiding things . So I am torn because I overall really like Four and he is a bright spot for me , and I know I ca n't expect anyone to be perfect especially in a world that is so torn , but there are some moments where I did n't like that side of him that I saw . On the other hand , there were some very hot moments between them then more that were so sweet , so I hope we are just seeing both of the characters grow and change and that they will come out the other side.There is some really dark stuff in this book , and more characters do n't make it until the end . So it is very emotional and Tris hardly ever gets a moment reprieve.And , oh holy traitor . I ca n't say much obviously without spoiling but I COULD NOT believe it . I could 've strangled him . There were some that I expected , but this one . NO.I loved learning and seeing more of the factions in their day to day and also how they respond when faced with violence and when it is time to make a stand for what it right.The ending sent me for a loop and I ca n't wait for the next book.Bottom Line : 2nd in a series that connected me more with the characters and left me wanting more .	1
I started reading this series and was initially unimpressed . But even I could not see these twists coming . This book is very entertaining and unique , you should read it !	1
I recommend this book for all appropriate ages . I could n't put it down ! Ca n't wait for the third and final book !	1
Warring between the factions has become a reality , and the Dauntless are at the front of the line fighting the fight , being controlled by a mind controlling simulation serum and not even aware of their actions . Only the Divergent -- those whose Aptitude Tests indicated they were suited for more than one faction -- are immune to the simulation serum being used to mind control the others . And since Tris was suited for 3 factions during her own test , she is one of the Divergent.But in their world , being Divergent is a dangerous thing which can be used against you . It means you ca n't easily fit into one of the predefined molds . Many Divergent , upon discovery of their status , are often found dead by some form or other . So for that reason , all the Divergent are expected to keep their status to themselves . But as it turns out , Tris is not the only Divergent among the Dauntless , and with the help of the others , it 's up to them to defeat the the knowledge seeking Erudite , developers of the mind control serum , and find out what they 're trying to suppress.Insurgent is the follow-up to the highly successful dystopian science fiction novel Divergent and though I did like it a lot , there were a couple things that kept me rating it as high as the first book ( just one star less ) .There was a lot of action going on here , sometimes too much as Tris and crew were jumping from faction to faction , allying with this one , then that one , so much so that I sometimes had a hard time keeping track of where they were . A couple of times , I felt a little extra proofreading could 've helped too since some events seemed to contradict one other . An event between Four and Zeke for example , that seemed out of place when I read it yet none of the other characters batted an eyelash ; only to find out a few chapters later the reasoning behind said event . A similar thing happened with Peter , when all of a sudden it 's as if the author just forgot he was even there and the actions of Tris and Four did n't make a whole lot of sense in that context . Maybe it 's the kind of thing most readers would n't pick up on but I 'm kind of nit-picky like that since I tend to throw myself into the events of the story while I 'm reading and those events are ones I can recall that threw me right out of the story I had immersed myself in . That said , it is really easy to immerse yourself in this story ... it is that good ! Character-wise , I also liked Tris and Four just a little bit less in this book than I did in the previous . Many times I felt Tris was so out of touch with what was going on around her and found myself getting angry or annoyed at her . And with Four , now known primarily by his real name of Tobias , we discover he 's not really the impenetrable tough guy he first seemed . The revelation of his past , along with his relationship with Tris , has opened up a more vulnerable side of him , and though that might otherwise be a good thing , I felt he used that vulnerability to manipulate Tris one time too many . I even thought of him as a bit of an Emo at times ! LOL But still , the fact that I can have such strong feelings for the characters when I do n't feel they 're acting the way I want them to just goes to show how much the story impacted me . It kept me up way too late reading on several nights ! Overall , I felt it was a worthy successor to Divergent and a recommended read indeed ! : )	1
Very similar but not exactly to The Hunger Games series . A lot of fighting or war situations but the story is still good and ca n't wait for the next book .	1
The books are great . i enjoyed all of them . I like the characters too . Veronica Roth did a great job .	1
The book was a excellent sequel to Divergent . There was a lot of drama and action . It 's a fantastic book .	1
I really like this book , but not as much as Divergent . The relationship drama is a overdone and gets a little old in my opinion .	1
Well , once I finished & # 34 ; Divergent & # 34 ; had no choice but to go ahead and read the next one . And this is during the course of one week . The second book of the series did n't disappoint , and as with the first one , great story and extremely entertaining.As I mentioned on my review for the first book , I do think considering the audience , that the book has strong values that it highlights and the author uses them to build her story , which is what I appreciate the most . Now in this one , the relationship between the main characters evolves and shows them in a more mature light , which is natural , but still keeps it somewhat reserved . It continue to build on many of the things teens and young adult deal in the real world , and do appreciate how it shows than even heroes go through struggles , how they face them and deal with them . As with the first book , it was a fast pace reading , very entertaining and enjoyable .	1
I absolutely love this series ! Insurgent was even better than the first book and I ca n't wait to read the final book . If you enjoy post-apocolyptic , action-adventure mixed with a love story then you need to read this series . You will not be disappointed !	1
I really like this trilogy and wish that the next book was out already ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Amazing series , amazing author , just simply amazing ! ! ! ! !	1
This is the second book to the Divergent story and I go it for my daughter . She has loved reading this series and ca n't wait for the movie .	1
I rated this book five stars because of the action and suspense . There were a lot of red herons , or false leads , and they kept you guessing . Amazing .	1
This series started out strong and in this book it brings in a lot of new information . If you read Hunger Games and you are now on this series ... stick with it will leave you mad and frustrated ( like THG ) but ultimately I was less disappointed with Allegiant than what I was with Mockingjay .	1
My only complaint is , sometimes it is slow . But when there is action , it is really great . As I read , I can see this series on a Hollywood big screen .	1
The book was a good read . I enjoyed the book but got a little tired of all of it through the middle .	1
It is tough to follow Divergent because it was so amazing . Insurgent started out a bit slow for me , which is surprising considering the amount if action . At about half way through Roth had me back , completely invested into the series . The ending has you immediately one-clicking !	1
Very glad I kept reading . Each book seems to be a very very important part of the story . Enjoy the character development , finally truly understood what was driving Tris , and looking forward to the next book .	1
This book was very good . I did not know how it was going to end . I ca n't wait for the next book .	1
The & # 34 ; Insurgent & # 34 ; is excellent . It reminds me somewhat of & # 34 ; THE HUNGER GAMES. & # 34 ; The movie will be coming out soon and from what I understand from listening to Pat on the Glenn Beck Radio Show , the book AND the movie are both great . I suggest everyone read this - something like this could very well be down the road in our future . After all , we are living in & # 34 ; upside down and inside out & # 34 ; times .	1
This is a mind blowing sequel to Divergent - if you read the 1st book its impossible not to run to the nearest book store or get on the net and download Insurgent immediately because you will have to know what happens next ! For those of you who are still deciding if you want to read this trilogy - YOU HAVE TO ITS AMAZING ON AN EPIC SCALE ! ! ! The factions are in disagreement with each other after Erudites attempt to assassinate all those from Abnegation and take control of the Divergent population , we are introduced to new characters , find out more about the characters we already know and love like Tobias and Caleb , even Peter will shock you . We also get to visit the other factions and even meet some of the factionless ! We also get to sigh at Tris and Tobias ' love story which adds to the excitement , if you fell in love with Four in Divergent you will love him even more after this one : ) It ends on an amazing cliffhanger that will have you screaming for more but not to worry as Allegiant the final book is out in Oct 2013 which makes me squeal with excitement = ] This story continues to be fast paced and will have you reading into the early hours , it has a lot of surprising twists and turns to keep the pages turning and is highly recommended to all YA fans of any age ! ! !	1
Love this series ! Picks up right where divergent left off with the same attention grabbing story that makes you want to stay up all night reading . They do make the main girl a bit less bad ass as in the first one an a bit more reckless but still anticipating seeing how the story goes in the next one	1
I love love loved this book . I ca n't wait until the last one comes out ! I read Divergent and Insurgent once then immediately read them a second time . They were better the second time around !	1
Similar theme as & # 34 ; Hunger Games & # 34 ; . Could n't wait to read the sequel , & # 34 ; Insurgent & # 34 ; and now waiting for the new one coming out this summer . The freedom theme exemplifies America right now when we see new infringements on our rights daily . Most people I know are reading it ... ... ... ... ... ... .	1
I loved how the story continued from where the Divergent ended . Just as many twists , turns and revelations for Tris & Four . Hope Allegiant is n't disappointing like one of the reviewers said . I am still hoping . Great read ! Finished this in 2 days !	1
Love the premise of this series and it is easy to get sucked in to Veronica Roth 's world involving the five factions and the divergent who have to choose just one even though they fit into more than one . In the second book you see the main characters of Tris and Tobias still trying to figure out what their relationship means which at times can be exhausting but I still love them ! I has a good plot that fast paced , with a couple of twists and unexpected reveals along the way . I do admit that , for whatever reason this book was n't as good as the first , probably in part that it is extremely difficult to follow a first book , especially when the first one is near perfect . This series is a must read for fantasy fans !	1
So the first book I said was a God , and this boom is just like the first one ... it makes u feel the pain , the love , and all of the emotions from the make believe world if the factions . I ca n't wait to get the final book ! ! ! !	1
This story is so engaging that I could n't put it down ! I am eagerly awaiting the third installment ! ! ! I can not wait to read more from this author !	1
In a continuing effort to indulge my secret passion for YA dystopian fiction , I happily picked up Insurgent - the second ( and highly , highly anticipated ) volume in Veronica Roth 's trilogy.I 've had many patrons in the library looking for their next read after finishing the Hunger Games trilogy - and I have been heartily recommending the first book - Divergent.Just to play catch up here 's the premise of Divergent - Chicago in some dystopian future . Society has divided itself into five factions : the honest , the selfless , the brave , the peaceful and the intelligent . On their birthday , sixteen year olds must pick the faction they will live with for the rest of their lives . It can be the one they were born into ... or the one they feel they should belong to . One or the other , but not more than one . For most citizens , it 's an easy choice . But for Beatrice , the choice is a difficult one - her test scores indicate she could easily belong to more than one faction - she is divergent and it 's a dangerous thing to be.We were left hanging at the end of Divergent , wondering what Tris and her faction would do now . Insurgent literally picks up from that last page . In fact , you really would n't want to read Insurgent without having read the first book - you would be lost as to who 's who and what is going on.That being said , I really had no idea where Roth was going to take her characters . She truly kept me guessing , entertaining me until the very last page . In the first book Roth did a fantastic job of world building - the future society she has envisioned was brought to life with lots of detail . ( and was quite thought provoking actually ) Many characters were introduced , but are explored further in Insurgent , now that the stage has been set . Tris herself must take the time to deal with her grief and try to understand her role in this uncertain world that is poised on the brink of great change.And being a YA novel , of course there is the requisite love push/pull angst . Tris ' relationship with Four ( more commonly known as Tobias in this book ) did n't capture me quite as much as it did in the first book . There 's a few too many 'misreads ' of actions and words . ( But I have to remind myself - they are teens ) I mostly choose to listen to my YA fiction . Emma Galvin is the reader for this series and I do n't think they could have chosen anyone better . Her voice is slightly gravelly and rough - exactly like I thought Tris would sound . She captures the action and emotions of the characters really well - her voice is quite expressive . In fact , Galvin won awards for her Divergent performance.Chaos , danger , friendship , betrayal , choices , loss , romance - Insurgent has it all . For great escapist , entertainment reading , the Divergent books are perfect . Be warned - there is a fair amount of violence . The last page of Insurgent ends in the same dramatic fashion as Divergent - with a cliffhanger . Unfortunately , book three is not due until Fall 2013 ... far too far away ... ..	1
Do n't often like get into series , but , this is one of them . I like the story line , it makes one consider the potential mankind has to either progress or fail to learn from history and digress . Great fiction , but not a lot of deep thought required .	1
This was a good read . This is will be a book that I visit again . Ca n't wait for the third book to come out .	1
This was a great continuation of the Divergent book . I enjoyed the entire trilogy , and ca n't wait to see the movie .	1
I just loved this series ! All Three books are a completely absorbing story . Very different concept , wonderful and complex characters , and a sad surprising ending ... All things I love about a book series !	1
I recently re-read and reviewed Divergent , so of course I had to re-read Insurgent too . I remember now why I did n't really remember anything from my first read perhaps a year ago ... because everything happens . And because everything happens , nothing really stands out . Does that make sense ? Also adding to the sense of constant action with little depth is that Tris keeps doing the same things , over and over . And I do n't mean physical things , but making the same mistakes ( apologizing for lying while almost simultaneously planning to lie again ) , as does Four ( asking Tris to care more for her life , while continuing to offer himself in sacrifice ) . I still love it . I 'm not sure what I think of the final reveal , the big secret , so to speak , but I 'm excited to see how it develops . ( I 'm sort of worried that it will be like the Match trilogy for me , where the third book completely jumped the shark , but I 'm hopeful that wo n't be the case . ) There is more humanity in this book than in Divergent , because the factions are breaking apart and people are left to act on what they think is right and make difficult decisions not dictated by faction leaders . Despite an obvious effort by the author at character development , I think that falls flat , due to being repetitive ( as I previously mentioned ) and therefore not believable . Christina 's anger felt forced , rather than an irrational result from grief , and its resolution too simple . Four and Tris seemed more one-dimensional than in Divergent , in that they both seem to revert to extreme behavior and their explanations for why fall short . I do think Veronica Roth did a good job of describing Tris as lost and having the reader feel that . I think the big reveal addresses other 's complaints with lack of world building ( I was n't really bothered by it , Chicago with crumbling buildings and a marsh instead of a lake worked for me ) .As a standalone book , I would n't necessarily rate this well , but I love the series and this is a solid middle book that I hope links a fantastic finish with an amazing first book . Ca n't wait till Allegiant in October .	1
Similar to The Hunger Games ... kept me interested the whole time , and I need the next book to be out right now !	1
I love this series and am looking forward to the movie . I would purchase from this seller again without hesitation .	1
Great read , could n't put it down . Instantly hooked . Enjoyed the writing , the world , the storyline , loved it all . Highly recommend	1
I enjoyed Divergent , and was excited to finally see this book come out considering Divergent left off on a small cliff hanger . I ca n't wait until the third book comes out ! This series is thought provoking and I love the way each faction has its strength and its weakness . This is a pretty impressive series for a writer who is still so young .	1
part 2 is a book without swearing , without sexual encounters I found it to be a action story with many scenes of violence.the farthest it goes into romance is Tris ( Beatrice Prior ) and boyfriend 4 ( Tobis Eaton ) is kissing.The Factions are divided and since living in a society of factions there are some willing to do anything to keep things the same.And those who are oppressed that are ready for a change.Part 2 starts right off from part 1 `` Divergent '' as Tris,4 , Caleb , Peter and Marcus riding the train to Amity headquaters . They are now being hunted by Dauntless traitors and Erudite faction members.I do not like when series go back constantly to recap all the story , and this is just bits and pieces like little clip notes.And it jumps right into where it left off with no missing pieces . you will not know who the main characters are if you do not read `` Divergent `` first , so recommend reading in order . `` Insurgent '' gives the missing pieces to who the factionless are . Why in `` Divergent '' Dauntless has no old people in their faction , and where they go . You will find out how the Amity people are subdued into being the peaceful faction , and their importance . Why those that are divergent are hunted and put death if found out and what their importance is and why erudite want them gone and kept under simulation . Why the factions were started , where the people have come from.I believe that the story `` Insurgent '' ended the book in a good way to lead the factions into the great unknown as to what is beyond the fence if anything.I am looking forward to part 3 to see what becomes of this little society . `` in the hope that you will rediscover the moral sense most of us have lost . ''	1
I must say , typically the sequels of a trilogy ( or series ) tend to disappoint me . Usually filled with recounting book 1 , and a lot of filler to bridge to the final book . This book does not fall into that Book 2 curse ! This book is a dystopian book unlike any other . I am a huge fan of the Hunger Games , Maze Runner , and Matched books . While they all fall into the category of dystopian books , they are all unique and Insurgent is definitely a unique story . This was a terrific read . I loved Divergent , Book 1 , and could not wait until Insurgent was released . Yep , I am one of those who pre-order so that it is on my doorstep on the release date . ( By the way , Amazon has got the best price out there . ) I read all 500 or so pages in 24 hours . It is a fast paced , action packed , fascinating sequel . I do not want to spoil a thing , so I 'll keep this review brief . I loved the twists , the second-guessing who can be trusted , and I especially loved learning more about each faction as Tris and her entourage travel between the factions . Of course , a cliffhanger will keep me on the edge of my seat until Book 3 is released . Please read Divergent , and seriously folks , read it first as you will not get a recap in Insurgent and you will be scratching your head trying to figure out who 's who . Then , if you have fallen in love with it as I have , read , read , read Insurgent . It will not disappoint !	1
If you liked the vibe of the hunger games you will enjoy this series as well.. I know I did and have recommended it to a few people .	1
Roth 's second offering in the divergent series lives up to the promise of the first . The character and plot development are both satisfying and engaging.You might also enjoy '' for Mischief done ''	1
For those who have discovered the Divergent series , the second installment will not let you down . The characters continue to develop and grow as they fight for their survival .	1
The best book ever . Truly enjoyed every bit of it . She is a fantastic writer and a amazing story . Beautiful written literature .	1
This I a really intense book . Every time I picked I up I found t hard to put down again . I would recommend it to anyone what enjoys a good fast read .	1
I LOVE the Divergent series.It 's action-packed and suspenseful with an engaging storyline . A true page-turner . The ending of Insurgent is shocking , leaving my jaw dropped and ready for the next book . If you have n't read this series , it 's a must read . A cross between The Hunger Games and The Giver . Amazing writing !	1
this is the best book i read in a while . the ending is so shocking and cant wait to read the next one to find out more	1
I really enjoyed this book and it lived up to the quality of the first in this series . It has left with a mini cliff hanger , and I ca n't wait to read book 3 . A very thrilling and fast paced series which is highly enjoyable to read .	1
3.5 starsI & # 8217 ; m always up for reading a good dystopian novel , and Veronica Roth & # 8217 ; s Divergent series has essentially defined the YA dystopian genre for me . Insurgent doesn & # 8217 ; t waste any time , dropping us right into the events immediately following the cliffhanger of the first book . We see the aftermath of the dramatic and traumatizing events of the first book , exploring Tris & # 8217 ; emotions as she deals with the consequences of killing someone for the first time & # 8212 ; a friend , at that . Tris is broken , and we see that constantly throughout this book even as she struggles to stay strong for the benefit of her cause and the people she cares about . While I understood why Tris was so fearful and grief-stricken , at the same time a part of me wished that she would grow up and either seek help in the people she cared about or come to terms with what she had done . Instead Tris spends a majority of the book in a sort of petulant , self-induced closed-off space where she isolates herself from her friends . I know that Tris is grieving , but good god girl , get a grip ! It was really difficult to read some of this book because of how much Tris annoyed me at times.That being said , the dynamic between Tris and Four , seemingly so easy in the first book , meets its first real speedbump in Insurgent , which for some reason made me root for them even more . I feel like Tris and Four are two people who truly understand each other because they are so similar in personality , and that reflects in their relationship struggles , because both of them are stubborn . I feel like we got a lot more insight into the two characters through their interactions with each other , which I appreciated greatly . I just hope that Tris is less whiny and Four more open in the next book , else we will still see the same relationship struggles continue in the future.We get to delve a lot more deeply into the history of the factions in this book , learning a lot more about the politics going on and the tensions between ( and within ! ) the factions themselves . This is one of the strongest parts of the book . We also learn a bit more about the factionless . Throughout all of this , once again we learn that what we & # 8217 ; ve initially learned about the Divergent world is not at all what it seems . There & # 8217 ; s a lot more detail as to how this dystopia became a reality , as Roth divulges to the reader much about the history and origins of factions , and why they have such a tight hold on the contemporary society that Tris and her friends are a part of . All of this information alone is fascinating enough to carry the story through the various slower parts that otherwise I would have found dull.A wonderful expansion on the world portrayed in Divergent , Insurgent provides the reader with both interesting character development for both Tris and Four , a compelling relationship between the two of them , and the intriguing backstory of how the different factions came into being . All of this , despite some flaws in pacing and character portrayal , serves to make a strong second book in what is sure to be an incredible trilogy .	1
Enjoyed the heck out of the first book and this followed nicely from that to into the pending third book .	1
I 'm just going to start off by saying that I enjoyed this book . I loved how Roth made things deeper than I thought they were . They were complex , they were interesting and they were deeply interesting to me . From character development to plot conflict , there was always a little more there than you felt like you were understanding , which kept you reading.However , the main character ( Tris ) takes a giant step backward in character development . She almost becomes ... nothing . Yeah , she 's the center of the plot ( or pretty close ) , but she becomes this confused , angsty kid -- miles away from the character she was in the first book . I think this is what Roth meant , but it was frustrating to me , because I did n't like Tris as much as I used to and I started to turn my attention elsewhere . Her boyfriend ( Tobias ) also becomes a flat-out controlling jerk . Their relationship seems to be on the rocks , but they continue to carry on with the physical part of their relationship , which was weird . I could n't tell anymore that they really liked each other . It was almost like they did n't have any chemistry.Beyond those two nitpicks , the story seemed repetitive and , at times , confusing . I had to double back and really dissect dialogue to understand the character 's concerns and what was really going on . I feel like Roth got too into her characters and plot line and left the rest of us in the dust as she delved deeper into the story ( which , as a writer , I completely understand ) .Overall though , an excellent sequel to Divergent , which was an amazing story in and of itself . Definitely pick up both books and give them a thorough read if you 're into Dystopian novels .	1
This is the second book in the Divergent Trilogy . I had a hard time putting this book down . It is just a good a read as Divergent taking the characters further in their journey . This book series is considered teens and young adults but I 'm older and thoroughly enjoyed the story .	1
Who knew a sequel could be better than the first book ! ? I loved this book so much ! Full of suspense , hope , and longing ! Lots of longing lol	1
I read Divergent first , and immediately got Insurgent . I ca n't wait for the last of the trilogy to come out ! This is an exciting , fast-paced read with fully-developed characters and plot twists . It kept me thinking long after the final page was turned . I hope a movie is in the works .	1
I finished Insurgent with a & # 34 ; what the ... & # 34 ; Kind of reaction -- after having thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and counting it among some of my best reads of the year . All that buildup for some & # 34 ; secret revelation & # 34 ; that cost so many people their lives finally fizzled into what was -- for me -- a downer ending . Finally , the information revealed was not as mind blowing or as surprising as I had hoped it would be . And was it only me , or are there others who did not get the final messengers renaming of herself to Edith Prior ? I admit it was late when I finished the book , but I thought I had been attentive to the details . I guess I missed something along the way . Any less befuddled readers out there , please clue me in . I must be brain dead.The ending aside , I did enjoy this book , though not as much as Divergent . But hey , let 's give the author a little slack . Not too many writers can pull off two 500 + block buster books back to back , in less than a year . It would be unrealistic to expect this second book to be as flawless as the first . There 's a lot of pressure on that second book . For me , though , I think what suffered most in this second book was the relationship between Tris and Tobias ( the name change being the first indication of a weakening of the romance . I could never bring myself to drool over a guy named Tobias the same way I did when he was Four ) .Four was strong and powerful , a Dauntless instructor , feared by all . Tough . Compelling . Tobias was the guy who had to beat up his father to prove a point . Four would have cared less what anybody thought of him . That weakening of character carried over into his relationship with Tris . He never seemed to be on equal footing with her , and too easily bought her lies . His gullibility weakened him and allowed her to become dishonest , not an admirable quality . This was not a couple I rooted for.I will read the third book , though not with the same enthusiasm as I dove into Insurgent . If the ending of Insurgent is any indication of what lies ahead , I do n't think I 'll be up late at night again . I may fall asleep before turning the next page .	1
Very good series , you will read so fast because it is so very good ! = ) reminds me of the hunger games	1
Absolutely loved this book ! ! ! ! ! ! It was written beautifully ... very insightful . I could n't put it down . It is a must read for all ! ! !	1
I enjoyed this whole series . They are quick , suspenseful reads almost everyone can enjoy . I am a middle school teacher , and after my students told me how good the series is , I read them . I was not disappointed .	1
Insurgent is the quintessential second book in a series . It is brooding , emotional , dark , and successfully rewards the reader by both reconnecting with the main characters of Divergent and advancing the story to the next level and the next book.Tris and Four have narrowly escaped the Erudite declaration of war on Abnegation and are now seeking support from the other factions - Amity and Candor . Why did Erudite attack Abnegation ? Can they garner enough support to resist and attack back ? We learn so much more about Tris . The story goes deeper into Tris and Four 's relationship which is complicated by PTSD , survivor 's guilt , miscommunication that leads to fractured trust . ( However , thank you Veronica Roth for avoiding the ever present love triangle ! ) Tris must deal with the death of her parents , loved ones , and Will . She struggles over the consequences of having to kill Will in self-defense which leads her to a crisis of self-worth , impacting her connection with Four . `` I did n't trust him to love me despite the terrible things I had done . I do n't trust anyone to do that , but that is n't his problem ; it 's mine . `` In the end , Tris is Divergent - she is a survivor . `` I think we cry to release the animal parts of us without losing our humanity . Because inside me is a beast that snarls , and growls , and strains toward freedom , toward Tobias , and , above all , toward life . And as hard as I try , I can not kill it . `` As with any great Book Two in a trilogy , we are also left with a great cliff hanger ... We discover the reason why Erudite attacked Abnegation . Now , what 's next ?	1
A different approach to this genre . I could not put it down . The main characters are well developed and you care ca n't help but care about them .	1
This book had a great mix of adventure and sadness , Poor Tobias if that happened to me I would n't be able to get over it .	1
Third of a series . Bought for my daughter who has read the other two in the series . She says , & # 34 ; Took a lot to get into it , but good book. & # 34 ;	1
The whole series was so riveting I could n't put them down ! ! I highly recommend it ! Wish there was more to come .	1
Perfect ending to the series ! Any book that makes me cry is powerful ! - And this one did it to me !	1
So sad but the best book ever I might read it again after I get over the sadness I just breathe in and breathe out	1
I absolutely loved Divergent and Insurgent . Tris and Tobias were exceptionally developed characters and completely relatable . Their city , lives and the situations they lived are not easily understood by someone living in our day and age , but the detail that Veronica Roth have made everything understandable.Allegiant is no different . Tris and Tobias are still fighting for the right to live how they choose , but the enemy is different . They still grab my heart with the absolute purity of their love . This time around the enemy and allies are harder to define , but they find their way through together.Did this story end as I would have wished ? No.Was the writing , story and the characters still just as interesting and engaging ? Absolutely.The story comes from the author and their creative process . We can all disagree on whether we liked it or not , but that does not take away from the emotions the words create . I cried hard when I finished this book and I have n't cried at the end of a book since Harry Potter . I 'm sad it 's over even though I wish it ended differently . I 'll miss these characters and the world they lived in and are trying to build again . My kudos and thanks to Ms. Roth on an exceptional trilogy !	1
Personal preference , but I was n't fond of the ending of this series . Compared to the previous two books , this one has less action and therefore , gives more time for characters , relationships , philosophical/moral debates , which was fine . Without spoilers , I was disappointed in the overall injustice of the ending , considering the entire series was about justice . There 's a delicate balance in the amount of injustice I believe a reader should endure ( out of our control since we did n't write the book ) , but Mrs. Roth tipped the scales in my opinion . For instance , if you 're going to allow for the elimination of a character , then the natural outcome would be that justice would be served for the reason the character was eliminated . The ending was unbalanced in my opinion . I could have accepted & # 34 ; X & # 34 ; as long as & # 34 ; Y & # 34 ; happened to bring closure to the story .	1
Very sad ending but good . I like the fact that they saved themselves and the rest of the people in Chicago . True was a brave soul . One that I 'm sure there are n't too many people in this world could follow . Tobias wad a wonderful person with an inner strength . I enjoyed this book the most out of the trilogy .	1
Oh my goodness , this book . I 'd read mixed reviews before going into Allegiant ( although I somehow managed to avoid spoilers even though I was still active on websites where this book was discussed ... thanks for being awesome , internet people ! ) , so I was a little afraid this book might let me down . But it did n't . It definitely didn't.The beginning was a little slow for me , and other parts seemed really rushed , but I think part of that was from having to create an entirely new part of this world . Everything Tris and Tobias know is questioned , and everything has to be rebuilt from the ground up . I think there was a lot more telling in this book instead of things being inferred , but I 'm not really sure how else it would have been done all in one book . The world-building was a little lacking in this book compared to the other ones , but it did n't bother me as much as it typically would.I did really enjoy that this story was told from two perspectives though . It was a little jarring at first - since the first two are solely from Tris ' perspective , Tobias took a little bit to get used to . But then , I do n't think this story would have worked any other way . Divergent and Insurgent were definitely Tris ' story to tell , but this one belongs to both of them in so many ways . Tobias has issues that he has to deal with , and Tris has her own problems , and it would n't have made any sense for Tris to really be able to explain Tobias ' problems and thoughts and actions . It was a risky choice , but I think it 's one that definitely enhanced this last book.As I was reading this book , I felt like it had a Maze Runner feel to it . I do n't want to spoil anything for either series , but I think people who have read The Maze Runner will understand . One of those & # 34 ; society is n't always what you think it is , we 're doing this for your own good & # 34 ; kind of things.The pacing in this book was definitely very fast-paced , but I think the rest of the series is too so it was n't off-putting . The whole series is a gigantic roller coaster ride , and this book was true to that . Especially with all of the feels . Oh , the feels . So many emotions on opposite ends of the spectrum that I should have been prepared for but was n't really . So thanks for that , Veronica . You win.I do n't want to say too much about the ending , because it 's one I think everyone should experience on their own ( if you have n't had it spoiled yet , keep avoiding those spoilers ! ) , but I will say that I thought it was excellently done . It was risky , and I know quite a few people were outraged by it and hated the book because of it . I , however , think it remained true to the characters . After reading it , I do n't think this series could have ended any other way.If you 've read Divergent and Insurgent , you will definitely want to read Allegiant ! It has its flaws , but I think it wraps up the series well . I mean , even the epilogue is true to all of the characters . Usually I hate the epilogues , but I enjoyed this one . Any fans of The Hunger Games or The Maze Runner series would most likely enjoy this series , as well as any fans of YA dystopias . 4/5 for this final book in an amazing trilogy !	1
I was really excited about this book . I had read the first 2 and loved them ... . this book however felt a little rushed . I like the storyline she chose ; it was very different and made you think . I just wish that it did n't seem like she was just trying to cram as much information and storyline in as she could .	1
Many people were extremely disappointed with this book.I however , was not.Perhaps it was the strong connection I had made with the characters throughout the prior books that made me appreciate this novel . I believe the characters grew tremendously , and for that , this automatically is a 5-star review for me.I understood the end of this book , although I absolutely hated it . It was necessary , realistic , and eye-opening.This book , essentially , just depends on how you interpret the events , and character actions.Amazing .	1
I could not put this series down and Allegiant did not disappoint . This book touches more on the science fiction area than the other books did , however , I felt this necessary to bring answers to lingering questions . Great ending to a captivating series .	1
This book was terrific . It gets kinda confusing in the middle but it gets really good and sad . This book also does n't turn out how you expect it too . It is compoetely different from what I expected .	1
Young adult novels are quickly becoming one of my favorite genres . This series has an interesting story line and is a quick read . I was concerned that the author let the plot get away from her by the third book after seeing lots of less than stellar comments on Amazon ; however , while there were a few holes , she wrapped it up nicely and stayed true to her characters . The dual voice was n't an issue for me . Nor were the plot holes . This series is meant to be a fast and entertaining read . It accomplishes both .	1
Loved and hated it . Ca n't wait for the movie next month . Hope they do it justice . Sorry the series is over .	1
I would have given this series 5 stars if not for the ending , which I do not disclose for fear of spoiling someone 's experience.The books engaged my interest immediately and held it throughout . I finished them far sooner than I do most books . I recommend the series , but you may not like the way it ends .	1
Fast read . Plenty of action moves reader along . Very good characterization and plot . Yound adults will like . Looking forward to the movie .	1
A decent ending to the trilogy . I 'll admit I was a little disappointed in the ending selected by Roth , but it was creative and philosophically challenging . If you 've read the previous two books , you 'll still enjoy seeing how the story plays out to the end .	1
Never imagined the conclusion . Well done . Now I need to read four 's story . The whole premise of this series reminds me of the old science fiction books that I loved to read .	1
As I write this review , I 'm still in shock . Not because Allegiant was horrible , but quite the opposite -- it was good , it was realistic , it was unexpected , and oh my goodness , it was emotional . I 'm still reeling from the ending . Just my saying that might have some of you guessing at what the ending could be , but you 'll probably still be surprised ( well , unless you already read a spoiler somewhere , of course ) . I was entirely shocked -- I 'm not sure I 've ever encountered a YA novel that ended quite like Allegiant did . Does it sound arrogant to say I 'm proud of Veronica Roth for writing it the way she did ? I hope not , because I truly mean it as a compliment . So many authors either avoid reality or plunge too far into it , turning it so tasteless that it 's like trying to swallow bitter ash . But Allegiant walks a fine line of bringing those moments that make us giddy and happy , and then reminding us of the seriousness of being a real person in real life.Dang , I loved this book.I was n't sure at first . Insurgent was good , but not as amazing as Divergent , and of course Allegiant started off in yet another different way , so I had no idea how it would go . Whereas Divergent was almost insta-love , Allegiant was more like falling in love with a best friend who just sort of crept up on you ... unexpectedly in some ways , but yet , not so unexpected.I suppose I should actually mention the plot , beyond all these vague hints . I do n't want to give too much away , and I think the summary covers the plot just fine , so what I 'll do is I 'll talk about the questions that are addressed in this book . If you want to know absolutely nothing about the plot and what is answered , stop reading here ! So ... for the rest of you . Yes , Tris and Tobias finally learn what 's outside of their city . They learn where they are , what 's been going on in the outside world , and how their faction system originally got set up . We also see what happens to the city they 're from , so it 's not like the city 's totally been left behind . Tris and Tobias have to again make decisions about their values and morals , and they are wonderfully true to character . And I do n't mean they keep making the same decisions no matter what , I mean that they change , grow , and make decisions based on both old values and new realizations . Just like any person does . We also get a little bit of an epilogue , which is nice . I 'm glad the book did n't just end -- I hate when stories do that . Especially considering this ending ... yes , it is extremely sad . It will probably have you in tears . You may hate Veronica Roth for a while . But ... the fact that the book makes you care so much about the end ? I think that 's the mark of a good writer.If someone 's looking for critiques , the best I can give you is that Tobias has changed from who he was in Divergent , and some fans may not like that , who knows . He 's a little less mysterious since the POV switches between him and Tris , and some people might not love seeing more of his tortured soul . Also , some of the science/ scientific ideals seem a little unbelievable to me , but I suppose you have to sort of take that in stride when you 're reading a dystopian.But all that aside , it was the writing style , message , and characters that mattered more to me , and I loved all those . So a definite five stars for Allegiant , and I ca n't wait to see what Veronica Roth comes up with next !	1
I preordered Allegiant so I would have it on my kindle the morning of October 22 . Before I started it that day , I read so many bad reviews for it . I was anxious to see how the book really is . Let me tell you : do n't believe the bad reviews . Allegiant was amazing ; by far the best book in the trilogy . I have been anxiously awaiting this book since June , and I was not disappointed . This is the only Divergent book I have given a five star rating . Much better than Insurgent ! Allegiant hooked from the very first page . I could not put it down . Be ready for some expected tears , though ! This book was nothing like I expected it to be . Well done , Veronica Roth . Allegiant was perfect .	1
I think this book series is amazing . And despite the ending , I really enjoyed this book . I do n't understand why people are giving this one star . I get it , the ending was extremely disappointing , but that 's just the end , not the entire book . I would 've given this five stars if not for the ending , but even though I cried like a baby at the worst part , I 'm glad I read it , because it was a great book anyway . : )	1
The nature of sacrifice is delivered in these books . I have never seen the struggle we all face with who we are so well-written .	1
Despite the fact that I am still mourning the death of a few characters , excellent read and satisfying ending . Thank you , Veronica Roth for such strong characters .	1
Though I did find Allegiant to be a little rushed I enjoyed it and found it to be a wonderful and unique end to an excellent series . I ca n't believe the 3 stars and all the crappy reviews simply because the book did n't end as they wanted it to.NO , the ending will not be what you expect or want but the reality of it is that in war , nobody is off limits , sacrifices will be made . In the end , hearts may be broken , but life ultimately goes on .	1
Just a group of attractive teenagers fixing to fix the world for all of us . They just have to kill us first	1
This was a good book but the first two are so much better that I was sad and disappointed.. When the chapters changed I could n't tell who was Tobias and who was Tris , until someone said their names , or it talked out about this or Tobias in 3rd person through the narrators eyes . : / and it in the compound outside of the city , it was boring and just drug on ... the book was still good , just disappointed me and was n't up to the high standards I set for it .	1
I have a more in depth version of this review on my blog which you can find here : [ ... ] I know there is a lot of dissension over this book . Without giving too much away , there is a big , EMOTIONAL event at the end of the book that upset MANY people . On top of that many felt the books was a lot slower paced , they were frustrated with the change in the POV , and -- from what I can tell -- many many people found Allegiant to be their least favorite of the series.For me , it 's a pretty close second favorite . If it had had a little bit more action and better pacing I might have enjoyed it more than Divergent . But other than that I really enjoyed most of Veronica Roth 's choices with this story , particularly everything she did with the ending.I sobbed . I have not cried this hard over a fantasy/science fiction novel since Half Blood Prince . But I had to put Allegiant down more than once . I just could n't control the feels , there were so many.Tris was the strongest her character has been in the entire series . She was my absolute favorite throughout it . So much growth and strength and bravery . At the beginning of the series Veronica told us Tris was supposed to be selfless AND brave AND intelligent . But it was n't until Allegiant that she really SHOWED us.Everything about this ending was elegant and beautiful and emotional . It is a truly memorable and stirring ending . It makes all the frustration I felt throughout the second book so very worth it.All around I give it 4 stars .	1
I laughed , I cried , I yelled , I made assumptions , I argued with the characters , then I laughed and cried some more ! This book took me on an emotional roller coaster , the ups , downs , sideways , inside outs , and backwards kept me obsessively flipping through page after page , unable to set this book down ! I felt every emotion the characters did , and put myself in the middle of their arguments ! This book brought me to the insanely cool , albeit destructive world of dystopian Chicago ! Now I just have one question . `` What happens next ? `` I was angry at Veronica Roth for the death of our beloved Tris at first , but from the moment Caleb volunteered to die , I knew she 'd never let him . Tris is so absolutely mesmerizing , she captured me from the moment I read the first word of Divergent . With Tobias by her side , I knew they were capable of anything ! This book and entire trilogy was absolutely amazing ! Excellent Veronica Roth ! Just absolutely outstanding ! I wish the best for you and all your future endeavors ! I 'll be waiting for more of your books to read ! Xoxo , a hopeful 16 year old future writer . Oh and remember : Be brave .	1
Allegiant is the third in the Divergent series . Unlike the other two books this one is told from the point of view of both Trish and 4 . This is series is as good if not better then the Hunger Games series .	1
When I purchased the book , there were only about 12 reviews , mostly bad , and I skimmed enough to get the idea that something really bad happens and a lot of people are angry about it . I 'm a 33 year-old woman and I 'm so glad my kids were in bed and my husband was not home when I read the end . I cried so much I 'm almost ashamed of it . But , I think there is something to be said about an author who can create such a story and such characters that the reader becomes that emotionally affected . I 've read plenty of books , and I 've never been so heart-wrenched by a story before , yet so satisfied with the outcome.I think it was beautiful and - sad as it was - the perfect way to end the story . Many of the other positive reviews are right - I do n't particularly want unhappy endings , but mushy perfect `` happy '' stories make me want to vomit . It 's not always meaningful.But , really , it DID have a happy ending . Tris sacrificed herself so that the man and the friends she loved do n't have to live in a world where they are seen as damaged . No one else could have given that kind of gift . Plus , she did n't do it just to die for her friends - she honestly thought she could survive , and I think that makes a big difference . There are so many other good things to say about this trilogy - hints that these characters believe in God , suicide is n't a solution out of a tricky situation ( which is my biggest complaint about another popular trilogy ) , and all of the characters come full circle in so many ways.I do n't understand why so many are complaining about the writing style or it being boring . It 's the same as the other books . This one may have had a little less action , but the characters were in a new situation and had to take time to adjust and figure out what was going on . Makes perfect sense . And , I do n't understand why everyone is also being critical of Evelyn 's choice . Yeah , it might have been her life 's work , but it cost her child . Have you never suddenly realized something you were working on was n't worth it anymore ? She was tired , she was beginning to doubt . So when she was given a way out , a way to get back what she finally realized was important , she took it . It all makes perfect sense .	1
Please do n't let the one star reviews fool you , this is honestly the best book I have read . Although it tore out my heart , chewed it up , spit It out and put it back in , it was worth it . I was in tears , I have my ideas I wish she put into the epilogue but my goodness this book ` s perfection is ridiculous . I just ca n't even . This was the best ending to any trilogy I have read . For once it 's SPOILER not a happy ending . But you know what I 'm okay with it and I think the one star reviews are not . Thank you Veronica Roth , but please know you will be getting my medical bill in the mail for my broken heart . I 'm just kidding . Do n't let the risk of a few tears shed keep u from reading this book . BE BRAVE	1
I read all three and enjoyed all three . good style and plot . I recommend the series to anyone . you will not be disappointed .	1
so tris dies for no reason ... and then she doesnt come back ... and she died for no reason ... bad . LET TRIS LIVE ! ! ! ! IT WAS A MISTAKE ! ! ! tris better be alive and there better be a next book because i will never forgive veronica roth for killing her . you dont kill the main charachter . NO	1
this entire series was totally entertaining . It was not the greatest literature but it was a great escape and action packed .	1
Ok , interesting story , a little violent some times , but I was hopping for a good ending after all that suffering , so I do n't agreed on cutting the main character ! ! ! ! ! ! What happened to happy endings ! ! ! ! ! Why not ?	1
Loved it . Book three was the best . Sad at the end but the right way to end this series . I might have chose a they live happy ever after but this author chose a more realistic ending . A great read ! ! !	1
i 'm having so much fun reading this series . i 'm savoring this last installment since i kind of tore through the first two . have pre-ordered the shorts coming up later this year and early next .	1
Ok this book does get 5 stars because it is still my 2 most favorite book series I the world ( aside from hunger games ) but why does ( not gon na spoil ) that happen ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? Veronica Roth you know what I mean ! ! ! ! ! ! Like when that happened i was literally crying like really ? ? ? Why ? ? ? ? just why ? ? ? Now I 'm gon na give spoilers : SPOILERS : First off , I was referring to Tris ` s death . Why did she die ? ? Like really you had me crying . I now know why you had to add in Tobias ` s point of view . But now I 'm sad and mostly just want something happy so now I 'm probably going to go watch either the hunger games or silver linings playbook . Probably read the hunger games series again -for like the 8th time-Also something that bugged me was when Tobias worked with Nita and they got in a . Huge fight . Not that specific part but the part leading upto it ... URIA ` S DEATH . I absolutely hated tha.I also did n't like that Caleb never died . Instead you kill off a main character . Like really ? ? ? I liked Caleb at first but then in Insurgent , he became the character I hate the most . So why did you let him live and kill the most important character ? I also could not stand it when Tobias accepted his mom again . Like that bugged the crap out of me.Also when Peter reset his memory ? Was that nessicary ? I think not . He was fine . He was less violent , he was getting better with anger , and he was not getting in the way . But no . He still had to reset his memory.Thank you for reading this ... ... . and I am NOT saying this was a bad book I still love it and still gave it 5 stars but i just got emotional . But it was still great . : ) thank you Veronica Roth : D	1
I ENJOYED ALL THE BOOKS TO THIS TRILOGY . THE BOOKS KEEP MY ATTENTION AND INTEREST . I ALSO ENJOYED THE CHARACTERS .	1
I 've gotten to love the characters in the Divergent series , this book , even more ! ! It was fun hearing & reading Tobias ' POV , is fun ! ! ! I think the immersion reading helped make that part much better ! ! I do have to say , I was NOT a fan of the ending ! I 'm going to try not to spoil , so it 's just not a typical ending.it seemed short , but that could very well be that I could n't put it down ! ! ! !	1
If you were n't madly in love with Divergent or Insurgent , Allegiant probably is n't going to change your mind . If you loved the first two books , one of two things is likely to happen : you 're going to feel like this is the perfect , inevitable ending to the trilogy , or you 're going to hate it . I 'll have a spoiler section in a bit to talk about the ending , but as for the major content of the book , this is what you 'll get:1 . More of an emphasis on ideas than action for the first 2/3 . This does n't mean nothing happens , but the tension comes from a different place than it does for most of first two books . This will bore some people quite a lot , but if you 're like me , and you find questions about what motivates human behavior interesting , and you love to critically analyze where assumptions come from and how they become problematic , you might find this section fascinating , as I did . I love peeking over Roth 's shoulder as she examines where humanity 's aggression comes from and how we fool ourselves into thinking these answers are obvious.The fact that a YA book bothered to dig deeper into these complex situations without offering easy , parental answers is impressive -- much of the recent YA I 've come across struggles to deal with anything more than love triangles and supernatural powers . This careful consideration of what constitutes moral behavior digs deeper than the first two books . I liked the first two , but they were a little immature in the complexity of thought compared to this one . I see this as a pro , but as I said , if you do n't enjoy this sort of reading , you might get bored.2 . Struggles between Tris and Four . I love love love Tris and Four 's relationship , and I have since the beginning . I loathe insta-love in books . It 's stupid and immature and completely unrealistic , and I 'm not a fan of love triangles either . Tris and Four have been better developed than that , and considering the state of things after Insurgent , it would n't be consistent or realistic if they did n't have some bumps here . I thought they were explored well for the most part , and Four 's issues in this book were occasionally frustrating , but I always felt like his behavior was real and consistent with his character , despite the fact that he sometimes did things I did n't agree with.3 . The resolution of the battle for the city and the exploration of the world beyond . This part is intriguing , although in a couple places it meanders a bit . New characters are introduced that , frankly , are n't nearly as interesting as the old ones , but they do n't spend a lot of time in the forefront of the plot , so it is n't a big detraction . This part delves into the original development of the city and the factions and you 'll learn about the vast conspiracy that set all of that up -- and how it influences things for the better and worse now.Finally , the ending . SPOILERS follow , but mostly about theme and tone . I wo n't discuss specific plot points , but you 'll probably be able to infer some content if you keep going.This series takes place in a dark world , and it 's only getting darker . Characters are killed ( think of how many died in Divergent alone ) , Tris and Four endure terrible grief and hardship , and the violence in these books is unflinching.That being said , I was kind of expecting this ending . It 's true , the ending is not what I would call a happy one , but I do think it 's the right one . Roth could have arranged things so that everything worked out perfectly and everyone lived happily ever after , but to be honest , that 's the ending that would have made me angry . It does n't fit the world or the characters , for one thing . There are so many dystopian YA books on the market that end just like that . They play it safe , and as a result , they 're predictable and boring . I 've read so many of them that they blend together at this point , and it takes a lot for a book , and a character , to have lasting resonance.Tragedy abounds in literature for a reason . Complicated endings keep a story in a reader 's mind for a long time as we try to figure out why we had such a strong reaction to the events in the book . It forces us to be engaged , to respond , and to think . The ending to Allegiant is beautiful , meaningful , and perhaps most important , consistent with the themes , characters and world that this series is set in . It is n't an easy ending or a fun one , but it 's real , and far more adult than most YA I 've read . I wo n't be forgetting Tris or the journey I 've been on or the way this has made me think anew about what it means to be strong . If the ending were different , some of that power would have been lost , and Tris and Four and this story deserve to be remembered .	1
Read after the first two . Some say it is a young adult series . I loved it as a Senior Citizen series . Never hurts to use one 's imagination and see the patterns of life from a different perspective .	1
What I enjoyed most about the first two books in the series was definitely missing from this book . This was a more & # 34 ; informational & # 34 ; type of a story . You will definitely have a full understanding of the world of the Divergent Trilogy at the end of this book . Relationships developed and we learned more about the people involved.Towards the end the excitement started to build again . This was a more mature story than the other two , there were some emotional and philosophical insights shared . I do n't feel like Roth & # 34 ; dumbed down & # 34 ; the ending because of the age group this story is geared towards . It was frank , and it was harsh . It was life.I felt like it was a satisfying end to the trilogy . You wo n't get that heart-pounding & # 34 ; I ca n't put it down & # 34 ; feeling . I 'm interested to see what Roth does next .	1
This book read slower than the first two but was necessary for all the information given . The story is written in two perspectives , Tris and Four , yet it 's sometimes hard to differentiate . It 's not the ending we want but it 's the ending that 's written.We read stories to get away from real life and to immerse ourselves in something else . This story immerses us in reality and some people ca n't handle that . This story is not for the faint of heart , that 's how you know it was written by a Chicago girl .	1
No one liked this one because of the ending , but the whole series was n't all that great , so I enjoyed the nontraditional ending . It was refreshing .	1
There are so many things I liked about this book . I loved the character Tris who is very brave . I also love Tobias . This is a great book up until the ending . I cried for over 40 minutes . Just putting that out there .	1
Allegiant ... . you have broken my heart and made it joyous . The tears that flowed for joy , the tears that flowed for sadness . The triumph , the mistakes , the love . The truth of our own society so vivid . A wonderful read , suspenseful , and surprising .	1
I enjoyed this book , but it ran on a bit long for me . I gave the first two 5 stars , so I certainly think they are all worth reading , this one included.Interesting and compelling books that consider humanity , what damage really means , group psychology , and more .	1
This is a new author for me and at first I thought it was a take off of Hunger Games but it is n't . It 's a verywell written story that just keeps giving down to the last word . Appropriate for readers around ten to advanced adult ( which I am ) .	1
I love the Divergent trilogy . This book , to me , was no disappointment ! Veronica Roth is a very talented author . The ending though , was VERY sad , so brace yourself !	1
No way that this was the ending to this book let alone the entire series ? ! ? Ok not disappointed with the entire series but more like broken hearted and a good hit of reality smacked me in the face ! I 'll need a few days to recuperate from reading this series . On a side note I ca n't wait for the movie : )	1
There may be mild , implied spoilers . I am not sure if I would have given this book five stars had it not been for all the horrible one star reviews that this book does NOT deserve.Ok , the negatives first.This book has a different pace , tone , voice ( I do n't know what exactly to call it ) than the other two books ; not so much that it seems out of place but it is enough that when reading them together without a time gap that it is noticeable . There is quite a lot of character death in this series which can be incredibly depressing . Tris continually comes across as way more `` right '' than a sixteen year old girl should be.Now on to the positives.Typical books aimed at this demographic are horribly unrealistic and usually follow the exact same plot line over and over again . They are written in such a way that the main character is supposed to be completely average in every single way yet somehow manages to steal the hearts of everyone with two of the most handsome men to ever grace this planet fight over her . The girl is generally incapable of making the `` wrong '' choice . Take Twilight for example : The girl falls in love with her stalker who would like to eat her , lets another boy that she does n't love take care of her while she is pretty much suicidal over the loss of the man who wants to eat her , then chooses an immortal life in which she does n't have to give up her family , friends , the ability to have a child , or even have to suffer the desire to eat everyone who still possesses a heart beat . Seriously , there are absolutely no consequences for her actions and that is how this genre tends to work . I really do not think it is a good idea to keep filling teenage girls heads with that . In this book Tris has to actually work at her relationship with Tobias . They have issues and they fight but they also have to approach things in a mature way and work things out . It is n't some fake soul mate crap that sets girls up for failure . It is completely believable . There are constant consequences for their actions . News flash people , in real life there are good and bad things that happen based off of your actions and nonactions . I love that both are addressed in this series . I love that this series does n't make it out like every person has to lead a poor sap on in order to determine if the girl actually loves the first guy or not . I love that Tris went through a phase where she was putting herself in unnecessary danger and then she actually matures enough to realize that sometimes trudging into a situation head first is the wrong call . We watch a girl actually grow up and not just get her way . I really love that .	1
Before I started reading Linda Fairley first book & # 34 ; The Midwife 's Here & # 34 ; I read the reviews of both books . I have now read both books and really enjoyed them I feel I know Linda as she share her life with us . I 'm from a Nursing back ground but never did Midwifery but love babies and did Private nursing after training and enjoyed going in to people house and getting to know your patients . That 's a long time ago and have moved back to Ireland in the 70th and started a family of my own.I would recommended these books for a nice easy read.Linda I wish you the best for the rest of your life to you and your family . N .	1
A great entertaining read . All the highs and lows of nursing and midwifery . So well written makes it hard to put down .	1
I read this book when it was recommended after the & # 34 ; Call the Midwife & # 34 ; trilogy . It is just as engrossing , and I enjoyed how she tells her own personal story along with the professional .	1
As a nurse I am very interested in the experience of nurses in the past and found this nurses experience very interesting .	1
Koontz begins the book in no hurry . It starts off very great , like Lost Souls offered . The book is a page turner , and you just could n't let go . This means , if you are a huge fan of the first two books , its back to its super fast rate , pulse rising action like the first two delievered.Lost Souls brought what I called `` A breath of fresh air to the series , '' which the series did need , such as New Race is n't called the New Race , and the new , liquid metal like creatures , the Builders , are really the main enemies . And The Dead Town really offers more clues what these Builders are . The Dead Town , I think , is not only a fast rate book like Dead and Alive and Lost Souls lack , but it also brought another feeling to the series.The really only problem I have with the book is the ending . The ending is way too rushed , as if Dean really wanted to actually stop all of the sudden . Or if he was lazy to put it all down on paper . I beleive he wanted a good ending with `` and they all lived happly ever after , '' than actaully making more dramtic . I do n't really think the climax is n't that great , nor it does n't have its own twists . Lost Souls did lack of a climax , and the climax was only in four of five pages.Overall , the book was one of my favorites . It 's as good as the first two , and if you really enjoyed the first four , then you wo n't be disappointed in this one .	1
The Dead Town serves as the final volume in Koontz ' Frankenstein series . As such there are many storylines to wrap up and Koontz does a good job of picking up right where he left us in book four , Lost Souls . It rapidly becomes clear to the residents that their entire town is under attack and throughout the book they are in the process of preparing for the onslaught while battling skirmishes with Victor 's terrible Communitarians and Builders as they are called . We see these abominations throughout the book , often from their perspective . They are clearly the work of a supremely deluded mind . Victor Immaculate , as he calls himself , retains the central flaw of the original Victor Frankenstein/Helios . Victor 's dream of being the last living organism on earth to witness the death of the entire world as a deeply troubling one . Koontz ' writing truly shines when contrasting the nihilism of Victor with the prayerful resistance of all rational people . The irony that Victor confirms his belief in God by working his entire life to deny him is potent and timely . It 's clear that Koontz understands the lesson of Mary Shelley 's masterwork ( which most people , especially the so-called intellectual elite , miss completely ) and believes it is a timeless message worth repeating . Deucalion , Michael , and Carson are as good as ever . Deucalion especially has some good scenes in this book . Erika and Jocko contribute in the story but are more side characters than they were previously . This is probably a good thing since a little Jocko goes a long way . Newer characters such as Mr. Lyss , the FBI agents , the Riders , and especially Nummy `` Peaches '' are very fun to read . The monstrous communitarians and builders present an ideology more familiar to reality than is comfortable and make for great suspense and fright.The Dead Town is a fun read with a satisfying conclusion . The series is well ended . Fans of the Odd Thomas series are given a little treat here . As usual with his writing , Koontz ' satirical skills are in full form here . Overall The Dead Town is a nice entertaining read bearing the scary realization that there are Victor Frankenstein 's in the world who believe themselves to be gods and invite others to join their oblivion .	1
I AM A BIG DEAN KOONTZ FAN AND I AM A REALLY BIG FAN OF THE FRANKENSTEIN SERIES OF BOOKS . GLAD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION .	1
By the time you get to part two , of book three , you must know that you 're an addict.On reading the series ( on my kindle ) I 'd missed this book . So there was a massive story hole by the time I got to book four . So much so I was disappointed that GRR had moved this to back story.Not exactly the order I wanted to read the books in , but you ca n't undo reading a book , and I had to complete my knowledge . Given that , I LOVED this book . All of your favourite characters appear , and are plunged into even more impossible situations than ever before.As with all his work , you ca n't put it down . You have to work hard to keep in mind all of the relationships . And the thrill ride is deliciously explicit.The problem comes when you start seeing characters in your work colleagues , and asking yourself & # 34 ; what would Tyrion do ? & # 34 ; : - ) If you 're a fan - get it . Read it before watching the TV series.If you 're not a fan , hardly likely you 'll be reading my review : - )	1
A Feast for Crows is not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be . It is definitely is n't the type of book expected to follow quite an explosive book as A Storm of Swords was . Granted , a lot of the chapters in this book were mostly forgetful and I might have to get my mind refreshed on certain details here and there but there are subtle moments where it gets interesting if not very revealing for a `` calmed down '' book like this.A lot of the events were mostly set up for the next book and I 'm sure it will definitely pay itself off .	1
But it should have been expected after all of the many big developments that happened in the previous book . Compared to the other books the tone is calmer . That 's not saying there is n't any action , believe me , there is plenty ! But this just reminds me of calm after a storm that leads into another . So definitely read this book if you are into the series but do n't expect too many developments of storylines . The book features only half of the main characters , but the author assures us that the others will be featured in the next book which I assume is almost finished . Martin said that for him to include all the character into one volume during this break period from the war would have been too much . He could have edited some of the events from minor characters but it would have not been complete , and I think Martin knows where he 's headed with the focus of the storyline ( he gave hints with Sam Tarly 's chapters and the `` Prophecy '' ) so I 'm not worried about Martin finishing the series with 20 filler books . The best parts of the book featured Brienne , Arya , and Jaime . Cersei was completely annoying but that made events toward the end seem more satisfying ( believe me ) . The ending was left with a cliffhanger that was n't wanted but I think Martin may start the next novel with an interesting twist . The events in the book are really rising action to hopefully a satisfying conclusion later on .	1
I really enjoyed this one . The stories of each of the characters are so engaging . Though I came to dislike the author when he started killing off my favorite characters . I should have expected that after the first two , but I was not ready to lose them . I am looking forward to the second half of this and to the next book after that .	1
I first started reading A Song of Ice and Fire years ago , when only the first three books were out . I loved them at the time , devouring them eagerly , and then I kind of forgot about them , due to the long lapse between books three and four . When book four came out , I kept putting off reading it because it had been so long I knew I 'd have forgotten a good part of what happened . When the series began airing , I started watching , got hooked again , and finally decided to reread the first three books before venturing into this one , all because I wanted to know what was going to happen before the HBO series could spoil it for me.This series is a funny thing . I love it , get so caught up in the many , many plot threads and that phenomenal characterization , yet there are some things about it that annoy me too . Sometimes I have to drag myself through passages , all the while wishing I could get back to reading about the characters I care about . Given how many wheels are in motion , I get why Martin feels he has to tell the story from so many perspectives , so the reader can see all the pieces as they move , but that does n't mean I always like it . This book is no exception . Some spoilers to follow.I 'm not one of those readers who was disgruntled about only reading about half of the characters . That was okay with me , as about half the characters I like were in the book and the other half will be in the next . Yes , it was a bit annoying at times , particularly when I 'd read something from Sam 's perspective and be left wondering what was going on in Jon 's head , but for the most part , I was fine with how the book was constructed.What did annoy me , though , is the sense that this book is more bloated than it needs to be . I think a textbook examples takes place during the Iron Islanders ' kingsmoot , during which the reader is treated to something like 1.5 pages of a character blowing a frickin ' horn . Yep , that much page time , devoted to florid descriptions of the sound of the horn , and the face of the guy blowing it . It probably goes without saying , but this was n't my idea of scintillating reading . Due to the millions of plot twists in this series , the books are going to be long , and that 's fine . But I really object to things like this , which just slow down the narrative and annoy me . I felt like the entire kingsmoot could have been done justice in a few paragraphs . Ditto with the extensive detailing of the heraldic devices of every last house in Westeros , no matter how small and insignificant to the story . I do n't care , I really do n't . All I need to know is that Lannisters use a lion , the Starks have a direwolf , the Baratheons fly a crowned stag , and the Targaryens have a three-headed dragon . Done . I do n't need to know about Green Apple Fossoways versus Red Apple Fossoways , and flayed men , etc. , etc. , etc . It becomes mind-numbing after a while . Martin is also given to repetition , with his repeated detailing of the chains of the maesters serving as one example . Editing is a good thing . Editing keeps the story moving and minimizes the draggy parts that annoy readers . Embrace the editing , George R. R. Martin ! I 'm also annoyed by the Iron Islanders . They just feel like a superfluous complication to me . There 's enough going on with the intrigue in Dorne , the machinations of the Lannisters , the plight of the Starks , the drama at the Wall , and Stannis to make things plenty complicated without bring the Iron Islanders into it . I do n't find them interesting , I 'm not invested in any of them , and I just plain do n't care about them . Whenever I have to read about one of them , it 's like a chore , like having to read a textbook for some boring pre-requisite college course . Maybe it 's because the Iron Islanders do n't feel to me like they have any shades of gray , and because I do n't find anything with which to sympathize . I can sympathize with the Hound . With Theon or Aeron or Asha or Euron , not so much . Go away , kraken , so I can get back to reading about Arya 's fascinating journey.Fortunately , Martin 's knack for characterization and for examining the many ways people undo themselves and others saves the book from being dull . I do n't always feel like I need to read about all the characters Martin chooses to write about , but I ca n't help but be in awe of the way he can create such a vast , vast cast of characters and make every one of them feel unique . It 's a talent that I think every author should envy.There are so many things that happen in this book that shocked me , disturbed me , and made me cheer . One of the best , though , was witnessing the way Cersei brings about her own downfall . I 've always despised her character , so I enjoyed reading about her destroying herself . She likes to think she 's a female version of Tywin , but it could n't be more obvious that she 's nothing like her father.My favorite in this book , though , was Brienne . It was so satisfying to see her character more fleshed out and to get insight into her . The other thing about her character that I find so enriching to the series as a whole is the way her relationship with Jaime contributes to his development . Sometimes I love Jaime and sometimes I ca n't stand him , but nothing has done more to bring out his humanity and make him a more interesting character than his relationship with Brienne and the ways it changes him . She provides such a valuable lens through which to view him . I 'm not sure what to make of her journey in this book , though I have some suspicions about what might have come to pass in her last chapter , and it 'll be interesting to see if there 's anything to my speculations.Another aspect of the book that I found so fascinating was seeing how the house of cards is beginning to collapse now that Tywin has been removed from the equation . It 's striking the extent to which he was the glue that held not only the Lannisters , but much of the realm together . I knew when he met his fate in book three that it would leave a power vacuum , and it was so interesting to see what happened as a consequence . It 's almost as if the Westerosi are working hard to bring about their own downfall , and Tywin was the only one who could save them from themselves -- as disturbing as that thought is , given how much I loathed Tywin.Equally fascinating , though , is Littlefinger . I ca n't quite see where he 's going with all his scheming , but I 'm beginning to think he may be the one to win in the end . For as much as Varys seemed like the dangerous one , it 's now so obvious that Littlefinger was the one of whom everyone else would have been wise to be wary . Since there are so many characters in this series who conquer by sword and blood , it 's interesting to read about how Littlefinger users subtler tools -- persuasion , flattery , deception -- to achieve the same ends . As of now , the only character who I think is a match for him as far as brains and wits go is Tyrion.All in all , I found this book a satisfying continuation of the ASOIF saga . The book clearly moved the narrative on to the next stage of the story , and it feels like things are starting to come together , for better or worse . I 'm moving on to A Dance with Dragons and only hope I wo n't have a long , long wait for book six , as having to reread the first five books before tackling the sixth would be a monumental task indeed .	1
Based on many reviews I 've seen for the book , it seems this is where readers have begun to grow unhappy with the series . Perhaps it 's because they were so upset about the long wait . Or maybe it 's due to the fact that the series ' most popular characters , Tyrion , Dany , and Jon Snow , are all MIA . There 's also the problem that Martin takes up a few unclear plot threads that , by the novel 's end , lead seemingly nowhere . These are legitimate gripes , but it 's important to evaluate the book as it is and not as it should have been . Here you should find that A Feast of Crows , though uneven at times , is just as addictive as its predecessors.I will admit this book is more subdued than its predecessors , and it lacks the major plot events as well , but nonetheless it is a remarkable read . The novel is almost worth reading for Cersei 's parts alone . She is the novel 's major character , and her schemes driven by her intense paranoia are lots of fun to watch unfold . We get a deeper look into the characters of Jaime and Brienne , who both get to set out on adventures that , if anything , help paint a picture of the landscape left behind by the war of the five kings . Samwell remains one of the few untarnished `` good '' characters , and this novel shows the beginnings of major things to come his way . Arya and Sansa both play minor roles . While I enjoyed Sansa 's parts because we get to see behind the scenes of some of Littlefinger 's scheming , Arya 's part was not done quite so well . It 's unclear where Martin is taking her character by the end . Three of the Greyjoys also have character perspectives , and they 're a little more interesting than I thought they would be . Mostly I liked the kingsmoot . The Dornish as well played a small part , mostly from behind the eyes of Arianne Martell , but these are the least interesting parts of the novel and Martin could have done without them.What makes these books so great is the human factor . These novels are about human failures and the frailty of human success . Many of the characters have some major flaw , defect , pain , or weakness . Brienne is a woman with the build and looks of a man . Tyrion is a dwarf . Bran is a cripple . Jaime is a warrior without his sword hand . Sam is fat . Prince Doran has terrible gout . These are men and women who are unable to mask their vulnerabilities , but must work that much harder to make up for them in the novel 's cruel world . Pain comes much more often than not . Almost all of the characters are strongly driven to achieve some goal , which makes it that much more disappointing when they come upon a powerful force working against them . The end goal of this series is that somebody will be crowned king/queen of the Seven Kingdoms , and maybe more . Only one person ( or two ) can achieve this goal , which means that most of the characters in the series are doomed to failure , and that 's just a part of human life . We will fall in love with characters and root for them , but only one can win , and it ca n't always be the one you 're rooting for.While there is certainly a little unevenness in A Feast for Crow 's story , Martin 's accomplishment in this series is astounding . He has done the incredible feat of juggling a massive assortment of complex characters and intertwining them in a fantastic story . Part of my own feelings of disappointment lie in the fact that the book had to end . There 's also the fact that I really wanted to know where Tyrion ran off to , and I want to see Daenerys continue to kick butt , and I 'm very curious to see how Jon Snow handles his new Lord Commander position . At least book five is already out . My main concern is that by the time Martin finally releases book six I will have forgotten so much I 'll need to keep turning to the map and the character list every five sentences . Nonetheless , the imagination of the author who wrote these books is phenomenal .	1
Here I am , a carrion crow who ordered the UK edition to have an earlier feast , only to find the bones picked all too clean by the wolves and lions who came before me . Seriously , after finishing this book , I 'm still hungry ! And you will be too . Even knowing that you wo n't get the POV 's of Tyrion , Jon , Davos ( although I never liked his ) , Dany , and Bran , it is still difficult to feel satisfied after reading this book . The UK edition has 700+ pages but with significantly larger print than the 900+ pages in A Storm of Swords . And this thinner story contains more POV 's from new characters that , well ... . let 's say could be edited . For example , Arya , my favorite character has 3 chapters ( that are great ) and Victarion Greyjoy , who we 've never heard from before , has 2 . His are n't bad but they 're like having appetizers instead of a main course.Has George gone nouvelle cuisine on us ? Well not entirely . There are 10 chapters on Cersei and a significant number on Jaime and Brienne as well . But WHY only 3 on Arya ? WHY only 3 on Sansa ? The same amount of time passes in both places so why do we need to hear every thought that goes through Cersei 's head and witness every dress that goes on and off her body while we 're left with only skeletal , teasing information about 2 characters who I thought were more important ? Although this book is only half of what the author envisioned , it should still stand more firmly on it 's own . The stories are stretched very thin compared with the previous books and the dramatic action suffers.Still , it 's not worth slamming completely . It 's a great world , a great author and great characters . Just give us more meat and less parsley next time George !	1
About reading this book is extrapolating the rest . I love it , i love it i love it . You do n't even know . The mystery of the good guys with the focus of the bad is amazing . Not to say there really are good or bad guys in these series , cause who can tell . When reading , my favorite things are always the over the top , mythological viewpoints by the people , and how the court think of them . Then there 's all these whispers about the Queen across the sea , and where Clegane is , or what may or may not be happening at the wall . But my favorite part , is where you see how the insolence and lack of empathy drag the evol down .	1
Like most people who have reviewed this book , I knew going into it that it was only `` half '' of a larger book ( which will hopefully come out at the end of next year ) . Martin tells his story with different POVs- each chapter tells the ongoing story of different characters . This book features some of my favorites- Brienne , Jaime , Arya and Sansa- but it also misses out on the more `` action '' POVs of Jon , Danaerys and Tyrion.In my opinion , this book had WAY too much Cersei Lannister in it . She is not an interesting character to me- she 's evil , yes , but she 's very predictably evil . She thinks everyone is against her , and so she vows to take revenge on them- not just once , but in every single one of her chapters ( and she has a lot- more than anyone else , I think ) . It got a little old after a while and I think Martin could have cut some of hers out.There are also POVs for some new people- we see the Ironmen of Dorne , get a look at Braavos , etc . Those are interesting to read , but I wish Martin found a way to put them in earlier because by now , I 'm so into the characters I 've known from the first that I did n't much care about the characters that are being introduced now , half-way through the series.Did the plot advance a great deal in this book ? It 's possible , though I do n't think we 'll really be able to tell until the other half- A Dance with Dragons- comes out next year . That way , we can actually read about things only alluded to in this book . Feast for Crows seems more a transition book- preparing us for what I 'm sure will be a shattering , breathtaking climax and resolution in the remaining books of the series . In that way , I think it is Martin 's weakest effort so far- but transition books usually are . They 're not the most exciting to read , but they 're important in setting things up for later.For that reason , I do recommend reading this book- and then reading it again , later , so that you can catch all the stuff you are sure to have missed the first time ; - ) I also recommend reading Storm of Swords before reading this one , just to refresh your memory . I did n't , and I 'm sure I missed a lot of stuff that I would have caught , if I read it .	1
So good could n't put it down ca n't wait to start the next book ! Learning more about each character and loving it .	1
I read each book faster and faster . I want these to continue forever . So many twists and turns . Just as in Westeros , my allegiances seem to be shifting a bit .	1
There are so many dead throughout this book that I 'm sure the crows all over Westeros and beyond had quite a feast . Now I guess death is just part of the bargain when you are trying to hold a kingdom or trying to get a hold of one . This book like the others is also full of suspense , fighting and adventure.Now that I reread the first 3 books of the series , this book makes more sense now . The first time I read it 5 years ago I did n't remember many details of the first 3 so I was kind of lost . On this one , I do love Jaime Lannister even more . He 's turning out to be a great man . His sister , Queen Cersei is totally the opposite . She was mean to begin with , but now she 's turning out to be the Queen of Evil . However the tables start turning for her . Let 's see what Lannisters are made of.Arya Stark is becoming of age the hard way , but she lives to the fullest . Sansa Stark gets a new identity , and Brienne is out on the look her . Slowly but surely we start to glimpse other sides of the plot , like what goes on in Dorne , where princess Myrcella was shipped by the Imp , and the politics that are at stake . Samwell Tarly gets to see the world on his trip to Oldtown , and learns quite a few interesting things from Maester Aemon . I 'm finally ready to start reading A Dance with Dragons , ca n't wait to start .	1
I chose a 5 star because it is still a gripping story . Have to keep reading to find out what happens ! ! I am sad because I am on the 5th and final book . I did get a map from Amazon , that is big enough for me to read . That is a down fall for this series , I could never get the maps to load , and it since sure nice to be able to see where all the Kingdoms , rivers , the wall , the seas and the iron islands along with the foreign dessert lands . Try to work on that ! ! Would be pleased if George Martin would sit a bit and start another line of story telling I would be first in line to read ! ! Would recommend this series to anyone that likes to read , just give it a try , promise you wo n't be disappointed , I have yet to watch the HBO series afraid I am going to be disappointed .	1
Okay , here 's the deal in my opinion on Book # 4 . Martin was forced to release earlier than his writng would allow , a work that was within page count , and within some sort of committed timeline . The book was late , and I ordered it on Amazon based on some BS date a year prior to it 's actual relaease . I would have preferred waiting until he got what he wanted out the door which would have involved Martin NOT splitting Book 4 into 4 & 5 . Martin kept his fans entirely and responsibly abreast ( do n't smirk Paris ) of the situation on his website.There is no way this is a Goodkind or Jordan sellout ... Martin has called the ball on the series since the beginning at 6 books . Due to this slight aberration the series will go to 7 . End of story . Goodkind , and now Jordan , are sellouts for the dough , or for putting out work just to release something . Martin will not . I believe only Stephen King has a library in his head that can be released at any time . Most people have to let the story happen , and few listen to the muse . Martin listens to his muse and rewards us , the fans , with a properly written book . One favor George , do n't go to your grave with Book 7 half written ... I got hooked on the series after buying Game of Thrones in ~1998 for $ 1 at Barnes and Nobel based purely on the dustjacket ... basic and Arthurian . Prior to this , the only `` fantasy '' I had read in my life was Tolkien and T.H.White 's Once and Future King.Not only did I later find I had a new coveted 1st edition that was worth , arguably , in the $ 100 's ... I was hooked immediately on Martin 's writing . I gobbled up all the books , including this one , ( disappointing to say the covers slipped briefly into some artwork that looked like Harlequin Romance vs masculine novels ) and unfortunately , but easily , caught up with Martin 's writing in real time.My wife gets annoyed with my whining about how long it is taking Martin to write , but Martin himself laments this fact.Martin slightly sells out to timelines vs quality in 'A Feast for Crows ' by deviating from his timeline vs character style of writing , but there is no one that writes like Martin alive on the planet today . He `` levels up '' Tolkien , exceeds Bradbury or Asimov 's storytelling , and thrashes the supposed peers he has ( I tried them , they ca n't hold Martin 's jockstrap ) Robert Jordan and Terry Worse ... er Goodkind.Martin is a consumate sports fan as well , making him more likeable . Okay , he hedges his bets on Jets and Giants , but NY wo n't have a contender for 3-4 years in anything but baseball so we forgive him.Martin rocks as a writer , storyteller , and dialogue guy . Finish the series George , it 's all I ask ! -Skip	1
I , like many of the other reviewers of this book , was put off buying it because of many of the negative reviews comparing it to Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time series . Now that I have read AFFC , I have to laugh at the reviewers who have made this comparison.First , Martin has n't fallen into the trap of repeating paragraphs of story again and again as Jordan has . Second , even when the story is not as fast paced ( as was the case with some of the Brienne chapters ) the story continued forward sufficiently that even in the Brienne chapters she actually made it somewhere and did something ( which ca n't be said for Jordan ) . Third , Martin has a way of getting to the psychology of the characters he writes about making them real ; making them human.I have read many reviews that have complained about the fact that GRRM keeps getting us to like characters ( namely the Starks ) and then goes and kills them off.WAKE UP FOLKS ! IT 'S REAL LIFE ! Frankly , that point alone was one of the reasons I loved `` A Game of Thrones '' as much as I did and have continued to read the series . There was none of this , `` The hero has to survive '' nonsense that is found in so many high fantasy books nowadays ( like the `` Wheel of Time '' ) . I 've read the ones where the main character always survives and frankly I 'm tired of the same old script . The hero always just manages to get away , or someone just happens to be in the area to save the hero from the bad guys.This series has been refreshing and AFFC , though not perfect , is a lot better than most of the fantasy getting published these days . If you do n't like the main characters dying off , go read Paolini 's `` Eragon . '' You wont have to think at all as Paolini just leads you by the nose through the whole story and you wont have to use your mind any .	1
I 'm enjoying this book . Great background information to previous books in series . It took me time to get use to point of view format but now I like it ! Martin does n't sugar coat the past albeit set in a fantasy world ( his research of the dark and middle ages is thorough enough for the story ) . He does a great job at presenting relevant and believable insights and motivations behind his characters without giving everything away . I 've come to appreciate this book and ca n't wait to start reading book 5 . I know it will be some time before book 6 and 7 come out but I 'm patient .	1
So this was another great continuance of the series but it 's only half the characters ! The next book will have the remaining characters that were missing in the timeline ...	1
Martin takes a huge turn in this book at a great risk . I loved it , but it felt a little strange , especially getting into the demented mind of queen Cersei . I took off one star simply because it did n't delight me like the other books . Just keep chugging along ... it 's worth finishing and getting on to the next book .	1
Featuring a cast of thousands , but that did n't bother me . Well enjoyed , an abrupt end , which took me right to the next book !	1
All of the negative reviews for this book boggle me - or rather the dominate reason behind the negativity - that the reviewers favorite character makes too brief an appearance or none at all . This would make sense to me if The Song of Fire and Ice was about a certain set of characters , but as was made abundantly clear in A Game of Thrones , the Song is the main character , not the people who compose it . I am surprised that anyone can finish book one , let along three books , without that becoming painfully clear.This is a wonderfully written book . Like many I wanted to see more of Arya , Tyrion and Hodor , but any disappointment I feel stems from my desire for instant gratification . This series is brandy , not tequilla . Savor it .	1
I loved A Feast for Crows ! Although I had to miss some of my favorite characters in this book , I still loved it to bits.What can I say , I love all this scheming and back-stabbing , the `` Game of Thrones '' as it is called in the book.In this book Cersei was my favorite charachter by far . She tries so hard to be the Queen , convinced that she is the great ruler that everyone is waiting for . Always paranoid and thinking everyone is out to get her , always scheming , one devious plan after another . I just love her ! Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not rooting for her to stay on the throne . I wan na see her fall from her pedestal ... I wan na see her fall , fail and be left all on her own with no one left at her side to help her.I 'm off to book 5 !	1
Obviously no one in their right minds is going to begin reading a multi-thousand page opus on book 4 - so any review will have to be made based on a fan 's eye view . Yes the book was split in two , yes many favorite characters were left out till next time and yes no real progress was made plot-wise . On the other hand it still was full of cracker-jack writing , tense moments and is deserving of a read . Consider it an `` appetizer '' to whet your appetite until book 5 ( early 2007 ) .	1
I disagree with some of the earlier negative reviews . Maybe I 'm not the fantasy purist that some readers are , but I thought book four was similar to the first three . The characters are interesting and the plot moves at about the same pace . I admit that when the author goes on and on about the clothing and food , I skim the information . I almost did n't read book four because of the negative reviews , but I 'm glad I did .	1
I enjoy the writing and the storylines . This book is a little slow though . It seems to focus on the same characters that do n't seem as central to the story . ( unless they are in the next book and finale ) . It seems like they just do a lot of traveling . The one thing I do like is you see another side of The Kingslayer . It kind of seems to hint that some of the people we thought were dead might still be alive . I have not been disappointed by any of the books so far . ( other than being upset about & # 34 ; red wedding & # 34 ; )	1
& # 34 ; Paperboy : An Enchanting True Story of a Belfast Paperboy Coming to Terms with the Troubles & # 34 ; by Tony Macaulay is one heck of a good read . How a youngster lives among the troubles going on in Ireland and how he deals with bullies will keep you happy you chose to read this book . It 's very engaging and the flow like the water in a creek after a heavy rainfall . I found learning about the view of a young boy living in Belfast as to what was happening in his life and what was going on around him.The author did an excellent job in the writing of this book . It kept me in smiles . Definitely a worthwhile read !	1
The inclusion of `` Communion Town '' on the 2012 Booker Prize longlist may be slightly confusing to the prospective reader . Normally the prize consists of novels and this is far more a collection of short stories , as the subtitle of the book indicates , albeit ones that are heavily themed and lightly linked . This is n't a reflection on the quality of the writing , which is very strong , but more one on managing reader expectations.The stories contained here evoke a strange city that is hard to place both geographically and in terms of time period . At times the feel of the fictitious city appears Asian , at others European or even American . In terms of time period , there is almost feudal agriculture and bubonic plague mixed with electricity and other modern items . Sam Thompson 's style changes from chapter to chapter , often evoking some major literary styles . For me the sole of the book is most strongly evoked in the Sherlock Holmes style `` The Significant City of Lazarus Glass '' which talks of `` the Art of Memory '' with the city comprising of a combination of reality and the memories and experience of all the residents . Equally strong is the presence of the `` flneur '' , the wanderer of nineteenth century French literature.Fiction generally evokes a response on the range between head and heart , and this collection is very much towards the head end of the range . It 's cleverly constructed and the images of one story will reappear in others , usually from another person 's perspective . These are quite subtle though and the reader has to be alert to these . It 's a book that will probably reveal more with repeated readings as the clues are not always strongly signposted . This is a good thing and prevents the book from coming over as `` too clever '' - it wears its themes relatively lightly although it is a book that could probably only have been written by an English teacher or lecturer - it 's driven by the style more than any narrative.The city is revealed as a collection of experiences , almost all of which are dark and dissociating . It 's a fascinating and well constructed collection that opens up like one of those Chinese puzzles . Just when you think you are getting somewhere , you find you are more lost than ever . For me though , it lacks a bit of heart that would have made it a five star book . It is though well worth checking out .	1
It was well worth the wait from when The Prince Of Hazel And Oak was released . I was nervous that it would not live up to my expectations but it did and then some . Surprises are on each page with plot twists that end every chapter . Any fantasy fan will love this series of world 's crashing together .	1
Wow I could n't stop reading this book . It made me laugh out loud scream and cry . I highly recommend this series to everyone so good . do n't pass it up ! !	1
This is an autobiography by William Wharton ( pen name ) of part of his service during World War II . In it he recounts the bits of his war that he could never bring to share with his children . The reason soon becomes obvious in that they are too painful and that is for a number of reasons . Firstly he recounts the incompetence and bullying of early training , some of which is both touching and funny . Especially his attempts to help one of his buddies at rifle cleaning skills.Then he moves on to the War proper with being transported to England on the Queen Mary and ending up somewhere in the North . His stories are always very human with none of the gung ho that so often comes across in such tales . By the time he gets caught up in the fog of war that was D Day he has already had more than his fare share of near misses . His fight across France and Germany is often visceral and with genuinely felt fear and simmering outrage at the stupidity of those in charge . A feeling that has been expressed by soldiers on all sides throughout history , sadly.He gets wounded on a number of occasions and it is always by shrapnel . The title alludes to this and also to the little pieces of hurt that happen to all of us through out our lives and that we can often carry around with us , being unable to let go or properly recover , just like the real shrapnel wounds endured by so many during those dark years . He never does get the million dollar injury that would see him being sent back home and has to endure the war until its bitter end.This is a very accessible read ; his style is colloquial and engaging . You can feel for him when he recounts some of the shameful things that he saw and some that he participated in himself . He explains the justifications that he used at the time , but realises with the passing of the years that they really could not be justified , whether it be theft , random cruelty or jaded cowardice , if one can even call it that . At the end of the day being a judge and an arm chair critic is without value if you had not been there at the time . This is both brave , honest and life affirming in the approach that Wharton has taken . Whilst this is not the best memoir of war ever it certainly adds to the rich library of such novels . I found it so engaging that I read it in a couple of days , and have been thinking about it on and off ever since . Now in his seventies Wharton hopefully will still have some more books in him , I for one sincerely hope he does .	1
I could barely put this book down . The fervor with which I read it reminded me of how I devoured The Genesis Secret . Fast paced , interesting , and the historical references add to the mystique.I do n't know how Knox finds these stories , but I 'm waiting with baited breath for his next novel.Truly worth every penny !	1
I literally could n't put this e-book down . There 's a steam train of a plot with two brilliant central characters , Kate and Paul , on the hunt for the truth but simultaneously being chased by an outstanding monster of a villian who is utterly terrifying . When he rings your doorbell you 'd better hide as it 's impossible to tell which twisted direction he 'll take . Intrigue and twists come thick and fast . I thought I could see what was coming next but I was wrong at every turn.The story is original and believable and ratchets up the tension as Kate 's son becomes a pawn in the game.There 's a history and depth to the story linking back to 1990 when student Kate was a guinea pig in UK common cold research . Returning to the UK from Boston , 15 years later she comes to discover not all was as it seemed and the fire which destroyed the research unit and landed her in hospital was far more sinister than she could ever imagine . Kate 's family dynamics are also wonderfully complicated with her growing attraction for the brother of her first love and her outraged new ex from the US chasing her across the UK for custody of her son as he realises Kate never intended to return.Very highly recommended .	1
Unfortunately , I read this one first but it was a great conclusion to the I heart books and wrapped up the loose ends perfectly -- even if I was n't sure there were any . But the characters ( after going back and reading the rest of the I heart books ) were true to form and just as humorous as the first novel . Great last book to the series and a perfect ending . Worth the investment of time and money in the series . Very good British chick lit .	1
Lindsey Kelk is like a fine wine . Every new novel she writes is more satisfying and delectable . She keeps getting better and better . I absolutely adored I Heart London . It 's fun , incredibly witty and I scoffed so hard during this rollercoaster read on the subway that I thought someone would have me committed.I 'm having a hard time putting my finger on exactly why I Heart London and I Heart Vegas were my most favourite in this five book series . I suspect its because Angela is growing up and the issues she faces are more real and relatable to me than all the expensive shoes and designer clothes . And although she still has a designer bag , has amusing antics and gets herself into silly situations , they 're diminished somewhat as all of her relationships move to the forefront in this novel.I loved watching Angela 's angst at introducing Alex , now her fiance , to her parents for the first time . I adored her parents and I think one of my favourite aspects of this novel is how her relationship with them is examined and how it grows over the course of the book . And not just her relationship with them , but with her two BFF 's who meet for the first time leaving Angela to navigate the differences in their personalities . And then there 's her relationship with Alex , which I have always absolutely adored . The love portrayed between them seems so real and I love how it has matured through the last few novels in this wonderful series.I Heart London was such a fun ride ! And as someone who recently became engaged and decided to arrange a wedding within six months of said engagement , I could complete relate to the craziness that ensues and the hilarious scenes in this novel . I ca n't even imagine tossing together a wedding in a week and it made me grateful for the extra weeks I have - although I probably wo n't say that in a couple of months.There was even a surprising thread throughout that not until the very last page did I come to find out what was really going on - and I wo n't say if I was right or wrong , or what it was - you 'll just have to snatch up this lovely novel and read it yourself ! I actually want to read this one again . If you love the I Heart series , you will not be disappointed , and if you do n't - you should really go pick up this fab chick lit series today ! Thank you to HarperCollins Canada for our review copy . All opinions are our own .	1
SPOILERSSkulduggery Pleasant might be the single most creative series I have ever read . In each book , Landy manages to take the concept of a walking , talking , wise-cracking , skeleton detective and his teenage partner and stretch it on for seven books so far without making it boring . Each adventure , I feel like I have read something genuine and something more incredible than last time . Landy has slowly gone from good-guy fights bad-guy to the two good-guys who might be bad-guys are fighting corrupted-normal people and a delusional , godlike , pacifist . It 's almost as if he 's been building up to these phenomenal final books . Everything about them , I absolutely love . The humor- another reviewer referred to it as Landy 's trademark humor- the plot , the tone , the writing , and the characters . Oh , god , the characters . The most impressive thing , about this series , is that he 's never had the plot overshadow his interesting , interesting characters . And he 's never had the characters overshadow the plot , though the characters are at the heart of the story . In short , Skulduggery Pleasant is just about my favorite series ( yes , even better than Harry Potter ) and everything about it enthralls me.Just a side note , you do realize what Derek Landy has been doing with all the two main characters ' romantic interests , right ? Fletcher , Celaen ( hope I spelled that correctly ) , China ( some people do like her and Skulduggery together ) , etc . In the end , it 's all about Valkyrie and Skulduggery . Kind of ironic , considering their *ahem* alter egos .	1
This makes the 4th of Cathy 's books I have read . She writes so well , it tugs at your heart . I wanted to jump ahead to see if Aimee really went to the Forever Family , or stayed with Cathy . I could not put the book down until I finished . Great read , and very well done , Cathy .	1
This book started a little slow for me but as I was reading it , I became more interested . I really like it and definitely recommended . It is very entertaining .	1
After reading on George R. R. Martin 's blog that this series of books was the inspiration behind the A Song of Ice and Fire series , I eagerly picked up this book from my local bookstore . As Martin said , the characters in this tale were as clever and as cunning as any in the Game of Thrones , however , the fact that all of them were real people made this book extremely appealing to me because you all know how much I love historical fiction . Alongside this , the fact that the novel was written by a French author about French history also had a great appeal to me because most of the historical fiction I 've read has always been written by Englishmen and therefore , I think always making the stories a little one sided ! The book takes place in the early 14th century and is based around the court of Philip the Fair , or as some call him the ` Iron King ' . King Philip and his advisors have just managed to finally murder the last of the innocent Templar Knights that had been living in France since the last Crusade . In an attempt to seize their money and power , Philip and his advisors had created false accusations of heresy , sodomy and many other vile acts to create a case against the once respected Templars . However , just before the Grand Master of the Knights , Jacques De Molay is finally burned , he puts a curse on Philip 's family ( the Capets ) which curses their line to the 13th generation.Meanwhile in England , the new Queen Isabella ( Philip 's daughter ) is plotting against her three sister-in-laws . There are rumours circulating around Paris and even in London that her three sister-in-laws ; Marguerite , Jeanne and Blanche have lovers other than their husbands . If proved to be true , this outrage could bring great shame to the House of Capet . Isabella uses her quick mind to try and find out if the rumours are true and punish her sister-in-laws for the shame they are bringing to France.The final story in the novel is that of Guccio Baglioni who is the nephew of a wealthy Italian banker called Spinello Tolomei . Guccio is tasked with sending a message to Queen Isabella to help her find evidence against her sister-in-laws . On his way back from England , Guccio is also given the chore of retrieving a debt from a noble family that has fallen on hard times . However , when he gets to the family 's house , he falls in love with their daughter and gives them a further year to pay off their debts . This act of kindness helps Guccio and his uncle later on in the novel after it is discovered that King Philip is moving to expel all of the Italian bankers from France . Tolomei tasks his nephew with finding a safe place to hide a document that could be used to blackmail one of the King 's advisors into preventing the expulsion . Guccio decides the best place to hide the item is at his new love 's run down home.As I said before I was excited to read this book because of the amount of social intrigue George R. R. Martin said there was in it . If I 'm been honest , this aspect of the novel was a little disappointing for me because there was no point in the book where I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next , like I always am when I 'm reading Martin 's novels . However , as a historical fiction novel I thought it was brilliant and as Martin said , the characters in the book are great because they are so evil , nave and cunning like many of the characters in the Game of Thrones , however , these characters are all real , making the events in the book seem even more cold and hard-heated then they already are ! Moreover , the events of this time were interesting to read because it was the prelude to the Hundred Years War , which I 'm fascinated with and it was interesting to see these events from a French perspective.All in all , this was a good historical fiction novel but I think it was a little misleading with some of the marketing on the book . I am definitely going to continue the series and I ca n't wait to see what happens in the next novel ! I would suggest this book to anyone who is a historical fiction fan and enjoys books such as Bernard Cornwell 's Thomas Hookton novels . I would also suggest it to fans of George R. R. Martin and I 'd be really interested to hear what you thought of the book , so please let me know if you have read it ! For more book reviews google adam-p-reviews	1
This is true historical writing . The author knows the history , the setting and can describe it well . It even translates from the French to the English well . I hope that Audibile continues to release the whole series . I read them in the early '70 's . Now you can only find the books in the storage basements of our libraries . They should be read by anyone who loves historic fiction and good writing .	1
This is a fascinating book . I will get the rest in the series . If you enjoy history you will love this .	1
This memorable historical novel , 1st in a series , is both well-researched and dramatic . George R.R . Martin has said it was a major influence in his writing GAME OF THRONES .	1
finely drawn character study about dealing with grief and mental illness . The author has created an evocative narrative that enables us to see inside the process of both healing and coping . very enjoyable read .	1
This novel drew you in without revealing the story fully until much later . It was a fascinating glimpse into the world of schizophrenia and its impact on family and friends . It was well written and character driven .	1
Wow ! ! Read it . Enjoy it . Be thrilled by it - then turn it into a movie . Being born and raised in Bolton , now living on the nearby Fylde Coast , I am familiar with the locations mentioned , which helped in my enjoyment . However , I can not recall a zoo in Horwich , so am mystified by that . Quite a bit of the tale reminded me of my own Kindle tale : `` Iniquity , '' although a different subject matter , so maybe I and the writer ( s ) are of similar minds . Bill Franks .	1
It seems that our beloved characters are never going to get any peace . That is my only complaint about this book .	1
Excellent . Excellent . Excellent . I definitely need more Sword of Truth series . Terry Goodkind is an extremely excellent author . The whole series is an excellent read .	1
This is a peculiar book in lots of ways . It creates a new mystery category which might be called `` Polish noir . '' It is set mainly in the Polish ghetto of current day London , which is full of recent immigrants driven there by hard economic times in Poland . Amazingly a structure seems to exist in this ghetto like that of the mafia in the United States in the early days . There are ties back to current day Poland and the political and criminal goings on there . There is definitely a bit of Godfather at play . The hero of the book is a rough cut character named Janusz who is called into the case of a missing girl by an influential priest . Of course , nothing is as it appears and Janusz is eventually drawn into international politics and crime . He is an appealing character who is much smarter than he initially appears . The mystery itself is tight , gripping and logical to the end . The writing is crisp and the dialogue tone perfect . This is a terrific introduction to a whole new environment as interesting as those introduced by Chandler or Henning Mankell .	1
Yes indeed , business meetings are a drag . And that 's the big idea of this book . David Pearl is an exuberant author and his zest is well conveyed here . This is indeed a guide bent on making those meetings truly mean something and accomplish something . This truly is a book worth your while that will benefit you in large ways..	1
I was once offered a supervisory position and I turned it down . When asked why I was turning it down even though it would pay more and have more flexibility , I said , & # 34 ; Meetings. & # 34 ; Just that one word and my manager totally understood where I was coming from.To me , 90 % of meetings are useless . Most participants blank out during the meeting and forget anything discussed by the time they get to the elevator to go back OR it ends up becoming a grievance session . The 10 % of meetings that work are when there is a clear focus and the person running the meeting is aware of time , participant attention and how to keep track of both.That 's the feeling that I got in reading David Pearl 's & # 34 ; Will There Be Donuts & # 34 ; . I feel like it should be required reading for anyone who has to run a meeting so that meetings will be run more effectively and not be the dreaded exercise that most feel that they are.With humor and a wide variety of examples , Pearl breaks down meetings and then gives examples on how to build an effective meeting with the understanding that there are different purposes for meetings . It is n't a one size fits all but there are definite patterns .	1

Serena Folkes , who has had an abusive upbringing , leaves her home town and first boyfriend behind for the bright lights and promise of London . On one of her first nights in town , she literarily bumps intomysterious entrepreneur Gustav Levi . Serena doesn & # 8217 ; t know it yet , but this handsome stranger will change her life forever . Gustav promises to launch Serena & # 8217 ; s photographic career at his gallery , but only if Serena agrees to become his exclusive companion . To mark their agreement , Gustav gives Serena a bracelet to wear at all times . At first the chain on her wrist represents his control , but later is representative of their growing bond.The Silver Chain was an interesting book that at first did n't feel like most stories in this genre . Serena 's departure from Devon was an obvious place to start the story , but it took a few chapters for me to understand the significance of that first scene . Once in London , the story begins quite slowly as the author lyrically describes what Serena sees through her camera lens on brisk Halloween night . I have to admit that at first , I found it to be boring , but the detail of what Serena captures on film becomes far more interesting later in the story.Once Serena meets the enigmatic and mysterious Gustav , the story starts to take shape . There is an almost mystical feel to Gustav that would definitely appeal to the young and rather sheltered Serena who is looking to have adventures . Gustav 's business arrangement with Serena certainly enables her to experience a more adventurous life.Among other things , Gustav is an artist and gallery owner . At their first meeting at the gallery , Gustav shows off replicas of erotic frescoes from Pompeii ( displayed as a menu of sorts in the city 's lupanare ( bordello ) . Given the nature of the proposed business deal , it very much feels like a comparison to the arrangement that Serena is considering with Gustav.The sensuousness and seductiveness of their relationship is described poetically by Primula Bond . The difficult pasts of both characters are explored as their barriers to a & # 34 ; normal & # 34 ; , fulfilling relationship.There are multiple graphic sex scenes -- some of which are rather dark.Good quality writing and character development , but the pace was too slow.You could read this book as a stand alone , however , the cliff hanger at the end does provide a tempting hook to the next book in this trilogy ( and good news , it is already published so you do n't have to wait ) .	1
Addicted is one of my Charlotte Stein all-time favorites . What a love story ! Dillon and Kit are simply amazing . Theirs is a journey towards true intimacy . Stein 's writing is astounding as always . You are lulled by the utter beauty of her prose then slain by the erotic nature of her books . There is so much honesty in her writing . I revel in her characters ' quirkiness . She reveals them to their utmost vulnerabilities , and just gives them to us raw and real so that we can enjoy them . Please give us more of these extraordinary couples . Run to You is another favorite . Stein , you rock !	1
There are many famous achievements noted in THE RISE , but the most salient point about failure and what it provides the person who has failed in a particular endeavor comes from a member of Scott & # 8217 ; s failed Arctic bid , Navy Explorer George Nares : & # 8220 ; It is true that we failed to bring home the North Pole as a national present to the world , but those who regret that circumstance may be consoled with the knowledge that failure implants more deeply in all breasts the desire to excel. & # 8221 ; THE RISE attempts to make the case that the lessons learned from spectacular failures can only enhance and support the masterpieces that come when anyone is forced to confront the bad and reconstruct an idea into its inevitable success.Sarah Lewis doesn & # 8217 ; t have a huge history with failure herself . She has a BA from Harvard , a Masters of Philosophy from Oxford , and is getting a Ph.D. from Yale this year . She has been a curator at the Tate Modern and MOMA in New York . She was on Obama & # 8217 ; s Arts Policy Committee , on Oprah & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; Power List & # 8221 ; and a Critic at the Yale University School of Art in the MFA program . Is it possible for someone this accomplished ( and under 40 ) to really understand what failure is for most people ? Well , Lewis doesn & # 8217 ; t bother with any stories about ordinary people . Instead , she fills the book with tales from those who , despite searching for success at some point in their lives , found huge fame and accolades later on after a period of reconstruction and reinvention.Mythmaker J.K. Rowling , choreographer Paul Taylor and activist Frederick Douglass are all examples of famous personages who suffered the slings and arrows of fate , who survived periods of lowdown depression and endless negative reinforcement only to take those anger-inducing , frustrating circumstances and turn them into lauded achievements later on . Lewis believes that this type of resilience is possible for anyone and that these examples serve to prove that it is truly possible to recreate oneself or one & # 8217 ; s work into something that will find purpose in the greater world.One of the things that brings Lewis & # 8217 ; s sources to this point after a situation that would cause most people to run for cover and never try again is what she refers to as & # 8220 ; grit. & # 8221 ; The resilience to take failure and continue moving towards a goal , by rethinking the original plan or just going forward with a new project in the face of past failure , requires a certain mindset . Lewis says , & # 8220 ; Grit is a portable skill that moves across seemingly varied interests . Grit can be expressed in your chosen pursuit and appears in multiple domains over time . It can be expressed through the pursuit of painting , and then through the invention of the telegraph. & # 8221 ; Switching course and finding new ways to attempt your particular adventure is a necessary but learnable skill that helps people meet their potential . She spends a good part of the book discussing how other theorists agree that training kids to excel in & # 8220 ; grit & # 8221 ; would be a progressive step in truly preparing the young for inheriting our flawed world.Lewis writes like an academic ; this is no cozy Dr. Dyer book with everything boiled down to simplistic platitudes that would find refuge on cat posters . It is a very thoughtful look at turning lemons into lemonade . Turning failure on its back and dissecting the particulars can take us into the next realm of our growth and expression . Lewis thinks it & # 8217 ; s possible , and after reading THE RISE , I have to say I believe her.Reviewed by Jana Siciliano	1

First off , I love British Chic-Lit . It is like my favorite thing . I think it should be its own special genre . I am always disappointed at how hard it is to get some of the best Girlie British books in the hands of American gals like me . Fortunately , some books do well enough in the UK , that we finally get to read them easily here . This is one of those books.Now , it did n't flow as easily as I usually like . Part of it had to do with all the sassy sideline comments , which were funny . However , they were also quite British and a lot of them went over my head . In fact , sometimes when I would actually get one of the Briticisms in this book ( because I do read a lot of British stuff ) I would be reminded about how many of them in this book I WAS N'T getting . Kind of like reading an old book with a lot of words you do n't understand so you just skim over and keep plowing ahead.Overall though this was adorable . Just my thing . And it goes back and forth in time and I did n't find it annoying like I usually do . The past/present actually worked in the book 's favor and moved the plot along nicely . This story consumed me , keeping me from real life , until the last page.A splattering of swearing , and talk of sex , but nothing overly descriptive .	1
Oh my word ... . Where to start , I absolutely loved this book ! ! ! The characters were very well developed and by the middle of the book I was in love with them all ! ! ! I especially loved Jack , Grace , and Liam ! ! ! But the only things in this book that I would change would be the occasional f-bomb and g-d words and the ending ... no spoilers but seriously ? ? ? Anyway make sure that you have plenty of tissues on hand with this read ! ! !	1
Oh , love , love , love this book ! I 've had a copy on my shelves for years , and when I ca n't figure out what I 'm in the mood to read next , can always pick this up . This is an extremely fast paced and very intense page turner . As a mother , I feel the mother 's pain so intensely . I also enjoyed the Atlanta references as a resident , but you certainly do n't have to be - that was just a little plus . If you 're into thrillers and fast paced action , pick this up NOW ! You wo n't be sorry .	1
Like the rhyme . Love the words . The pages are crowded , but that 's OK cause we 're reading it together . Sturdy book .	1
This book was a favorite of our four children , especially in helping them realize that they might like to hop on Pop ( which they did as much as Pop would let them ) . This book has really stayed with me , and I was interested to analyze why it is so appealing and effective.What I discovered upon rereading it today is that the book packs a whallop in terms of providing learning opportunities for children . Long before Sesame Street was a staple for youngsters , this book picked up on some of the same learning techniques.For example , you start with two rhyming words . The only difference may be one consonant ( hop and Pop ) . This helps a child learn to read by seeing the role that a letter plays . Then the book uses the two words together to form a sentence , and puts an illustration in the reinforce the syntax ( the difference between a house on a mouse , and a mouse on a house ) . After the simple syntax lessons are done , it goes on to give the child more rhymes and more complex sentences . & quot ; We like to hop on top of Pop. & quot ; Here are where Dad 's abs come in . The illustration shows how to hop on Pop without hurting him . Also , the book says not to , which will help Pop and the child learn that the subconscious in all people and all children pay no attention to negatives in sentences . So what is captured is an imperative to hop on Pop.The story builds to a crescendo by letting the child know that there is more to learn . Children can learn small words like & quot ; if and it & quot ; while Father knows long words like & quot ; Constantinople and Timbuktu. & quot ; The child is given a little quiz at the end about & quot ; seehemewe & quot ; and so forth and is given the hint that learning can continue tomorrow.Also , this book provided me more pleasure in being a Father than any other that I read to and with my children . So if you are a Father , get with it . If you want to encourage a Father to be with his children more , get this book to him.Overcome your stalled thinking about the limits of what can be learned by small children from an introductory reader by using this masterpiece ! . . . and practice tightening your abs !

My six year old daughter told me they read this book at her school and asked me to buy her a copy , so I did . I 'm very happy with it . Each page has the two or so focal words of that page at the top in capital letters , which I think is clever and practical . She is able to read every page in this book aloud , though I 'm pretty sure there 's about 30pct memorization of entire sentences going on on her part.I 'm very happy I bought this book for her and I recommend it for parents with children learning to read .	1
I always thought this was the best work that Dr. Seuss put on paper . It has always been a favorite of mine and it has come to mean a lot more to me than I ever thought it would.I see less and less of his books on the shelf.If there are any parents reading this attempt at a review , this pitch for our children , please do n't forget Dr. Seuss .	1
This is another Dr. Seuss book that I read to my kids over and over again . They loved looking at all the wonderful illustrations while I read it to them . Then as they got older they started reading it on their own . I just love the writing style in this book . It was simple but catchy . I & # 8217 ; d recommend this book for anyone with small children.T.S . CharlesAuthor of young adult book , & # 34 ; Consumed. & # 34 ; Available on Amazon .	1
Nice book , used it couple times and the recipes I have tried were very good . Purchased it used so price for me was good not sure I would pay full price for it though .	1
I love this book . Please read it . Nafisi writes beautifully . She gives us extraordinary insight into life in revolutionary Iran and into English and American literature . If you have interest in either topic , you must read this book .	1
A couple of months ago , I found this book at a charity book sale for $ 3 . The title jumped out at me while I was scanning the wall of book spines for anything remotely interesting . Although I had no idea of the book ( Lolita ) referenced in the title , I was not deterred from taking a closer look.My only knowledge of Iran came mainly from the news and from an Iranian friend I had found on Yahoo 360 back in 2009 during the student crackdown . Why I chose to bring the book home was mostly a desire for another glimpse into what life is like for a woman in a theocracy.After a good number of chapters in the book , I found the narrative to be rather intimate . Dr Nafisi , the author , felt like my host and I the guest in a metaphysical living room where she made conversation about the memories that were dear and painful to her.At that point , I was curious to know what others thought of the book and found that the common complaints from the one star reviews were about the terrible flow of her book , the constant dwelling on oppression and the lack of emotion from Nafisi . Others complained that she was pretentious and arrogant , because of the numerous references and parallels she drew from Jane Austen , The Great Gatsby , Daisy Miller and Lolita.I am no an expert in literature nor gifted with an insight into the human psyche , however I found it to be quite engaging and touching due to a few reasons.As a personal confidant for many of my friends , the way Dr Nafisi jumped around timelines to touch on different stories did not irritate me . I felt like I was listening to someone who was sitting with me , talking about whatever sprang to mind about the problems she encountered.Her description of life in a totalitarian and invasive regime was almost like science fiction where every display of humanity was defined as good or bad , with survival being dependent on the obedience to the conservative regime . The novel - The Giver - immediately came to mind and over the course of the book , it continued to strike me that this story ( albeit with changed names to protect identities ) was real and not fantasy.Through Dr Nafisi 's recount of lessons , secret meetings and confrontations with lesser authority , it was clear to me that I had nothing in my life that could help me relate to the fear of being persecuted for just being a human being . The only time I remember being heavily regulated was being in school and in the army . Even then , there were some allowances for individuality.The only people she could trust even the most mundane ( to our world ) information with were family and long time friends . She took a risk forming a secret book club for selected students who could have reported her to the authorities as a decadent dissident . In teaching something regarded as harmless and trivial in our society , literature lessons became a treacherous route that could have implicated her as a traitor to the country and an immoral western sympathizer.In the classroom with students acting as regime watchdogs such as Mr Bahri and Mr Nyazi , lesson plans and class discussions became potential minefields for her . While it may seem ridiculous and affected to most of us to have heated intellectual debates about Jane Austen or Gatsby , those events became veiled surrogates for confronting dogma without too much risk.Most of us in the free world do not make a big deal about literature other than people we perceive as being insufferably pompous . However , in oppressive environments , minutiae such as having illegal satellite tv , moonshine , chocolate , dancing , and yes , literature , provided outlets to cope with the relentless surveillance and the long war with Iraq.As for the charge of Dr Nafisi being emotionless , I am not sure that writing about what happened decades ago would possess quite the same energy as a real time report . It is after all a memoir about people she cared about . One acquires a certain stoicism over the passage of time when it comes to relating personal loss.There is a lot of honesty from Dr Nafisi in the book . She relays her misgivings about teaching her students to think outside of religious and cultural boxes - if it harmed them instead of helping them cope with life in Iran . As she revealed in the book , she had a lot of guidance from a mentor known as Mr R. whom she referred to constantly as her magician , and she owned up to her propensity to pontificate.One particular instance that struck me was the admission of something so idiotic as weeping when she heard that Ayatollah Khomeini was dead . Why would anyone oppressed even feel sad upon hearing news of the death of the leader of an evil government ? My guess is it was spurred by mass hysteria which unleashed bottled anguish for the loss of friends and self to the monstrous entity haunting every moment of their waking lives.As I approached the end of the book , Nafisi pondered how her students were doing - some of them have moved overseas , some have stayed behind in Iran . Sure , there is very little mentioned of her feelings but sometimes , words unspoken say a lot more than the ones we hear .	1
I avoided this book for fear of voyeurism . Abuse of children , or the artful justification of it in even an attenuated form , is not something I want to encourage , and I assumed the point of the title was , How paradoxical to be reading something so naughty with veils over our faces ! Fortunately that was wrong . Nafisi seems rather to be using a story about the exploitation of one girl , as a literary doorway into a society in which all girls are treated badly . That was what I was hoping for , in finally picking up the CD of this book ( which I listened to while driving through Amish country in Ohio ! ) -- to learn more about life in Iran from a sensitive critic of the regime.Overall , the book is good enough . Nafisi 's descriptions of her students , and the other characters , are acute . You do come to understand what life is like for women in the most radical Islamic countries -- at least for women educated to think like Westerners.But at the same time , I did n't always get the feeling of getting inside the thought processes of another culture , here . Nafisi does not always seem to mediate a general view of life for women in Iran , but more of what an American forced to live among Islamic Leninists ( see Naipaul ) would feel . Her description of Islam is so uniformly negative , one does not much get inside the head of its proponents -- unlike with Naipaul.My other complaint was that the book dragged at times . The author has descriptive talent , but sometimes lets it get away from her . Sometimes Nafisi gives the readers too much interior dialogue -- read with a rather gloomy seriousness , in the CD version.All in all , while good , I 'd probably prefer a shorter version of this book . Maybe a printed version , which one can skip forward at times , would in this case be preferable .	1
_Reading Lolita in Tehran_ is part memoir , part personal narrative and part literature course . Nafisi , a literature professor by profession , not only gives readers insight into some of the seminal works of literature , but also honestly details the struggles of herself and her students as a women in post-revolutionary Iran.Nafisi writes , `` the best fiction always forces ( you ) to question what you take for granted . '' Teaching a small group of women western literature , we are privlidge to the things Nafisi - and her students - took for granted before Iran was made an Islamic Republic . The personal connection that she and her students made with Nabokov , Fitzgearld , Henry James and Jane Austen remind us all of why we read literature . Living in such difficult times ( the revolution , the increasingly restrictive demands of the Islamic republic on women , the Iran - Iraq war ) gave me new insight into these works . Nafisi 's brilliant prose also gave me new insight into the Iran in the late 20th century.The challenges Nafisi ( and her students ) faced - from not dressing moderately enough ( not even a strand of hair could be shown at one point ) , to the search for love and acceptance by members of the opposite sex , to the dangers of even reading these `` radical western '' authors provde a real sense of just how difficult it was ( and I suppose is ) to be a woman in modern Iran . Things became so unbearable for Nafisi that she and her family eventually left for America.Nafisi writes with tenderness and passion about her books , her students , and especially about Iran . I highly recommend it .	1
Let 's start with all that bothers me about Reading Lolita in Tehran . Nafisi can be annoyingly self-absorbed . I also do n't believe for a moment that she can remember years after the fact exact details of the furnishing of a room or the way the sun and breeze felt on her face in 1981 . And though you would have to be an idiot not to appreciate her need to protect the identities of many of the people she discusses in the text , I did wonder to what extent she is creating characters who are nearly as fictional as the ones -- Gatsby , Lolita , Emma , et al -- her `` girls '' meet to discuss once a week in Tehran . In short , as the best fiction does , she is creating -- or recreating -- a world . Yet none of those concerns -- even if valid -- much diminish what she has achieved . For in this well-subtitled `` memoir in books , '' Nafisi does nothing less than prove once again , through her account of women and a few men keeping imagination and literary argument alive in Tehran , that the human spirit is indomitable and that totalitarian efforts to stifle the thrill of creativity and critical thought are always and everywhere doomed to fail . It is simply a matter of how long it takes . It is hard to come away from Reading without believing that sooner or later Iran will regain -- or perhaps gain for the first time -- its full freedom . For that encouraging accomplishment alone , Nafisi 's memoir deserves reading .	1
This book provided fascinating insights into life in revolutionary Iran . It is NOT necessary to read Lolita to enjoy it . Not wishing to spend a lot of time repeating what other reviewers said , two items in the book were most interesting for me . The first was the incident of the young man who is confronted with his inability to bury his grandmother because she was of the Baha'i Faith and all the Baha'i cemeteries have been bulldozed . The second was the insight into those who wore the veil BEFORE the revolution and how the enforced dress code for all makes them feel.The book has great value to thinking people today not only to teach us about the oppression which still continues in Iran but also to give us insights into the thoughts of ordinary thinking Moslems .	1
I bought this book in october , after having heard quiet murmurings about it , seen the cover around alittle bit . I just finished reading it not twenty minuites ago , and i positively loved it . I was stunned in some parts , angry , rejoiced withthe charavters , her students and Ms. Nafisi . I love the idea of it being a memoir in books . I ocldn'tt hink of a better way to describe it.and as for the comments that it tended to wander a bit ... . I did n't have that problem . It felt and read like partial journal entries , partial class lectures , retrospectives etc . I did n't have a problem with the wandering . I backed it up as it ws following the course of her books she taught , sharing her experiences with all of her students she could , he difficutlties in the environement , and with the war . It came back ot her students , her own personal Dear Jane group . But it also showed her other students , and the dangerous times.Do yourself a favor and read this book . It is beautiful . You will come out of it nourished , among many other things . read this book .	1
I have owned this book since March 2004 , when two very good friends brought me back an autographed copy from their attendance at the Author 's reading/ signing . I did not read it until my book club selected it last month.Though it is a little slow to start , I found myself unable to put it down as I reached the last 1/3 of the book . I have read most of the books she discussed and felt like the beginning was a little like reading published papers . But ... when she began to talk about her own life and the lives of the women she taught in Tehran is when she had me hooked . I began to understand her need to be true to herself despite ideologies that were forced upon her . I felt inspired by her drive , yet saddened by the repression she felt by being forced to cover ( rather than choosing it as modesty and honor for God ) and made to censor.Through my highschool years 1985-88 , I had a pen pal from Tehran through my Spanish class . At that time , I had NO IDEA that throughout our exchange of crossword puzzles , post cards , letters , stamps and the funny papers that he was experiencing the very things that Ms. Nafisi describes . We were kids , we only talked about pop culture . Reading this took me back to my connection with him . As an adult , now watching the news of current events in Iran I am so saddened . I hope he is safe and a good man . He was a good teenage friend to an oblivious teenage girl.With Iran is the news , it is a perfect time to read this book and understand why there is such unrest right now with thier election.Some have said that the author is narcissistic . To that I say ... it is a memoir . It is supposed to be all about her .	1
I read this book a few years ago and will never forget it ! I actually found it a Goodwill and what a find ! Every once in awhile my mind wanders back to `` Tully '' it is not a happy book , but real . A book of thiscaliber only comes once in a great while , do n't miss it .	1

This account of the imprisonment , internment , survival of Primo Levi in Auschwitz is written as a straightforward chronological narrative . Levi recounts his initial capture , the horrendous suffering of the journey of Italian Jews to Auschwitz , the selection there in which all the woman and children were immediately sent to their deaths in the gas- chambers , and in which the able- bodied sent to the work- camp at Buna . Levi tells the story , detail by detail of his getting into the work- order of the Camp . He describes in clear precise language the horrible humiliations the prisoners were subject to . He also describes in one central chapter , four different kinds of survivors , and the strategies they use to escape death . His accounts of his own getting through to the liberation include his appreciations of his friend Albert , and a few other individuals who with no reward to expect for it , helped him on the way.The bestiality of the Nazis and their helpers is not sermonized about , but rather portrayed in specific incidents of unusual terrible cruelty.Levi is deeply concerned with the whole question of what it means to be human , and how it is possible to retain human dignity in the most extreme circumstances.His carefully written record of his own horrifying experience is to this day considered one of the most moving and effective of Holocaust memoirs .	1
Brunner was known to be a very workman-like author , producing many works that were quite readable but not particularly special . But in the mid-sixties he seemed to mature and produced a whole series of excellent to great novels , from Stand on Zanzibar to The Jagged Orbit . This work is part of that period of excellence.If telepathy is a rare but very real talent , just how does society as a whole make productive use of it ? One obvious use is to find out exactly what is wrong with people who are mentally ill , to become the ultimate psychiatrist , and if the talent extends to 'projection ' of thoughts onto another brain , to effect corrective changes in the ill mind . With acceptance of this talent , the definition of 'ill ' could possibly be extended to those who are violent , the trouble-makers of society . Coupled with a far more effective UN than exists today , telepaths could be used to help defuse the attitudes and situations that lead to revolutions and wars . This is the background against which Brunner tells a tale of a child of just such an aborted revolution , a child born with physical deformities , an uncaring mother and a dead father . Gerald Howson grows up without hope , the object of ridicule , trapped in a cycle of minimal dead-end jobs that are limited by his deformities.But in his early twenties , he suddenly finds that he is one of the fabled telepaths , and a very powerful one . His first real use of the talent is to draw a deaf and dumb girl into a detailed fantasy , made more than real by his talent , a fantasy neither would really wish to wake from . Forcibly dragged out of this fantasy by other telepaths who have tracked down his radiated power , he is taken to the UN center for training and rehabilitation . But Gerald is far from a whole man at this point , and the story of his growth and maturation forms the balance of the work.The characterization of Gerald is excellent , a man we can see change and empathize with . Many of the secondary characters are just as sharply delineated , and the interplay between them and the envisioned world society so dominated by the actions of the UN peace-keeping forces forms a convincing picture of what could be . Issues of privacy , individuality , self-responsibility , and the proper use of power form the thematic backbone , highlighted against some vivid scenes of internal mental worlds that demonstrate just how alluring living inside such a fantasy can be.Portions of this book are somewhat dated , from the use of typewriters to a stated method of trying to combine music and visual form , which has been long superceded by modern computer integration of the two . But these technological items are almost irrelevant to the thrust of the story , of just what it is that man does beyond surviving to give him that inner feeling of correctness and satisfaction with doing something that is worth doing.Incomprehensibly out of print , this book was nominated for the 1965 Hugo Award , and to my mind is better than the book that won that year , Fritz Leiber 's The Wanderer. -- - Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd ( hyperpat )	1
You wo n't find a better book of short stories . The characters in this gorgeously written , profoundly observed collection are down-to-earth , real-life people with perplexing issues that they deal with in quirky , sometimes desperate ways . Annie Proulx 's early work sings , period . The way she describes the countryside and the people , down to the last detail , you know she has lived it , but more importantly , she has seen the poetry in it . Highly recommended .	1
One thing you must realize about Annie Proulx -- she pulls no punches . Heart Songs and Other Stories is absolutely no exception to the rule.In this collection of short stories , Proulx give us characters that are not terribly intelligent , sophisticated , attractive , or even likable . But , what they are is real . We 've all met at least one of the characters in this book , and that 's the magic of Proulx 's writing . She 's not interested in creating a romantic hero ; she 's interested in telling real stories about real people ... who happen to be fictional . And , like so many of us , they have moments that are n't exactly shining.I 've read quite a bit of Proulx , and this book is one of her earlier efforts . It 's not quite as stylistically refined as her later work , but it is still a magnificent read . The fact she is absolutely so willing to spit in beauty 's face makes her no-nonsense stories and rough and tumble characters all the more beautiful.If you have n't read any Proulx yet , you really should.~Scott William Foley , author of The Imagination 's Provocation : Volume II : A Collection of Short Stories	1
I 've read the whole series several times . Even knowing how it will ultimately end , it 's still a lot of fun . I first read it as a child and enjoyed it . Years later I reread the series and found I still loved it.The stories weave Arthurian elements and a variety of British Isles folklore sources into their own grand narrative , at the same time creating a folk lore of their own . This series is n't meant to be a definitive guide to folklore though and it takes some license with a few tales ( possibly different versions ) .At any rate , they are enjoyable and instilled , at least for me , curiousity about Arthur and some of the other myths , enough to make me read other , more traditional , sources.I ca n't recommend them highly enough - I 'd put them in the same category as Tolkien or Eddings even if they are n't quite as fantasy-oriented as their works .	1
Unique , enjoyable , wonderful , fast paced , exciting , PERFECT ! I first enjoyed this book back in grade school , when my sixth grade teacher read it aloud to the entire class . What a treat ! It helped cement my love of books at a young , tender age . Susan Cooper 's writing is MAGIC !	1
I was first introduced to The Tripods when I saw the first two books adapted for PBS television in the early 1980 's . It was a great series of half hour shows , but PBS could not get enough funding for the third book . Occassionally I am nostaglic for the old PBS series . I liked the trilogy which I read later in a couple of sittings . It 's an interesting series of adventures against tyranny . A discriminating sci fi fan will find this collection unique and well done .	1
I first read the Tripod series in seventh grade . Some of you in the Boy Scouts may remember the comic book adaptation of The Pool of Fire from the Boy 's Life Magazine . I 'm now a 24 year old adult ( Ahem ! ) and I still love these books . Ever since my book collection was destroyed by a flood three years ago I have been hunting for both this , and the Prince in Waiting series by Mr. Christopher . As usual , Amazon.Com comes through for me . I heartily recommend this series , and the Prince in Waiting to all readers of Sci-Fi and Fantasy .	1
Years and years after finishing his highly popular and adaptable `` Tripod '' trilogy , John Christopher caved into public yearning and added a single prequel to his three-part series . Fans of the `` Tripod '' books are divided as to whether or not this was a good idea . Some people claim that the three books are perfect in and of themselves and that this prequel was a bad idea poorly executed . Others state that this is a well-written book that definitively clarifies how the tripods got a hold on the world in the way that they did . And still others , like myself , think that the books are pretty silly to begin with , but they 're fun reading and a prequel like this one is n't going to change what was already out there . Nuff said.In this book we meet our hero Laurie ( who , I should tell you right now , is a boy ) and his best friend Andy . While participating in a wilderness trek , the two come across a startling scene . It happens in the middle of the night as they camp out in an abandoned shed . From over the horizon they spot a huge three legged machine , picking its way carefully along the landscape . To their horror , the machine casually plucks up an escaping farmer , and destroys the man 's house with a few well-aimed bashes . In no time the army is called , and when attempts at a peaceful reconciliation are dropped , they destroy the tripod forthwith . Laurie and Andy return home to their families and all seems to go back to normal . Of course , there is that weird tv show that came out after the Tripod disaster called the Trippy show . It 's your usual fast-paced tripod-based entertainment with catchy music . Laurie 's half-sister is obsessed with it , and she 's not alone . Suddenly people all over the world are watching the show and becoming mindless pawns . So when more tripods land on Earth once again , suddenly there are people everywhere waiting to greet them . The world is in serious danger , and there 's not much Laurie can do to stop the onslaught.The book 's kind of a zombie film put on paper . At one point , people who 've already been hypnotized by the program start wearing silver metal caps that prove their allegiance . They also start `` capping '' their unwilling fellows , thereby taking away their free will and making them slaves of the Tripods . In such a situation , your nearest and dearest could suddenly turn into your enemy without your ever knowing it . Apart from the obvious zombie-like quality of the story ( and Christopher is to be commended for his abilities at making a good child-friendly horror tale ) the book also reminded me a bit of the first three movies in the Star Wars series . You go into this book knowing full well that , in the end , the Tripods are going to win . So how do you end it on a happy note ? Keeping this in mind , again John Christopher has adeptly given us a book that ends in a hopeful mind set . It makes for a fascinating read.My personal problem with the series has always been that there are n't much in the way of women in the books . I was delighted for the first 25 pages of this tale to learn that the narrator of the book was named Laurie ... . and then I found out that Laurie was a boy . Doggone it . The women that remain here are pretty annoying as well . There 's Martha , Laurie 's grandmother who favors her granddaughter , henpecks her son , and is seen in a mostly negative light . Ilse , Laurie 's step-mother , is fine but vapid . And Angela is seen as a spoiled little brat who only comes into her own when the family vacates their home . It 's funny , but at the end of the book Laurie makes a statement that girls are more likely to join his family 's rebel resistance than boys and then promptly has his head almost bitten off by an angry Angela . This is the only moment that Christopher clearly shows his sexist hand . I looked at the motley crew of men and women who are left free at the end of the book and had to wonder where all the girls went in the future books . After all , the free people living in the White Mountains in subsequent novels were all men . Ugh.Personally , I think this book is a much better read if you pick it up after the first three tales in the series . Though it contains the same outdated views of women as its predecessors , `` When the Tripods Came '' is still a worthy addition to an already captivating series .	1
Man , I love anything with crazy visions in the sky - particularly the first chapter of the Biblical book Ezekiel - but the vision in this book is a neat thing to read about too . I just do n't get why the buffalo was referenced at the end . Must be a Native American custom to end all stories with some mentioning of a buffalo.I 'm sorry to say I still like non-sacred dogs more than sacred dogs , but I have a very good reason for doing so . Sacred dogs are much more expensive .	1
Follow poor Fox on his short-lived journey to get back his tail.After drinking the milk of an old woman , a young fox gets his tail cut off . He then has to go through many people , animals and even a few non-living `` things '' .Will the poor fox ever find an end to his colorful journey to get his tail back and go play with his friends ?	1
Enjoyed this book as an adult as well as a child . I ordered it so it could be read to my grandchildren .	1
This is my all-time favorite illustrated children 's book ! Mercer Mayer tells a beautiful , funny and profound story about the power of generosity and kindness . And he creates the most wonderful illustrations to enhance it perfectly ! The paintings are intricate and powerful . I wish I could frame them and hang them on the wall . I could not possibly recommend Everyone Knows What a Dragon Looks Like enough . A true classic .	1
The only thing missing in this wonderfully told tale is color in the illustrations . The interior illustrations are all back and white , and I feel that color would add SO MUCH more to the overall story line and creative thought process of the reader and those being read to !	1
I find this book a difficult one to review . While the story itself is n't the most exciting , engaging , or fun to read , this is undoubtedly an excellent example of the literary skill of one of America 's best known and well respected authors . Hemingway 's sublime style of bare-bones , almost flat seeming , prose is able to evoke surprisingly powerful images and emotion . Certainly not flowery , with hardly an adjective to be found , it is nonetheless effective.In A FAREWELL TO ARMS , Frederic Henry ( the narrator ) takes you through a difficult and life-changing time of his life . A rather cold seeming young man , the musings of Henry present a very interesting glimpse into Hemingway 's view of a young man 's psyche . As you experience Henry 's adventures in war and love , you come to see the brutality and unfairness experienced by so many during times like the ones described . While Henry himself seems quite distant and unemotional throughout most of the book , the reader really comes to empathize with the young man and while they may imagine themselves acting and thinking differently , sympathize with him.The tragic experience of Henry and Cat 's love is at once intensely emotional and strangely shallow . Watching as true love develops in Henry is a great experience , while seeing his unthinking readiness to be untruthful ( to himself and to Cat ) is rather disturbing . The whole story is a very thought provoking and fascinating look into our emotions , the meaning of love and of life.Highly recommended for anyone interested in Hemingway , not for those looking for a thrill ride .	1
Although book keeps interest as a human experience love story , I cut back one star because of personal preference . I expected more war related action but must be careful to avoid the wrath of a given multitude of Hemingway fans including a friend with an autographed certificate from the author . Read as a followup to movie about Hemingway and his second wife .	1
Read this as a kid , really liked it , and gave it as a present to someone who never read it	1
Loved the book - it arrived in perfect condition and without any marks of any kind . Delivery was very timely and packaging for the book was excellent . I would highly recommend this seller.thank you !	1
This book arrived on time and in good condition . It is a classic and worth the short read , not as good as some other classics though .	1
I am not enthusiastic about this book but I respect it and I understand why it is considered a classic . The Nobel Prize for literature is more of a lifetime achievement award even though this book was specifically cited as follows : `` For his powerful , style-forming mastery of the art of modern narration , as most recently evinced in 'The Old Man and the Sea . ' '' The book tells the story that is so familiar that I wo n't bother to repeat its details here . The original true story which Hemingway described in a journalism piece available in `` Byline : Ernest Hemingway '' was a brief account of a Cuban fisherman who hooked an enormous billfish in his little boat and got pulled out into the open ocean . The fish is attacked and partly devoured by sharks . A large fishing boat rescues the unnamed fisherman ; he is delirious , having gone for days without food or water . The fish is brought back to the dock in Cuba : there 's a picture of the huge and still formidable half eaten fish hanging by the tail.Hemingway fictionalized this story almost two decades later to make it a symbolic parable about man 's struggle against nature and against his own frailty . The old man , Santiago , holds on by sheer willpower , at one point he says to the fish , let me kill you or you can kill me , I do n't care which.In addition to speaking to the fish and to the sharks that attack at the end of his voyage , Santiago also spends time talking to his injured left hand , an obvious reference to the looming Communist revolution in Cuba . The fish and the old man Santiago represent the huddled masses of Cuba yearning to breathe free . The sharks that attack represent , variously , worldwide mercantile Capitalism , jingoistic American gunboat diplomacy and the oppressive authoritarian Bautista regime under which poor Santiago is starving to death . Santiago is able to beat down attacks by the first two but the last succeeds in picking clean the marlin 's carcass . Thus , Hemingway shows that Cuban revolution had not yet developed sufficient strength in 1952 to overcome the brutal Bautista dictatorship .	1
As was stated in another review , this book is the first third of mere Christianity . That said , Lewis is at his best here . Truly the ability to write with any sort of lucidity and laconicity about Christ and Christianity is a most admirable trait . I do n't like to recommend many books beyond the Bible for Christians , but this one that I will . Do read .	1
This is the textbook I used in college for second year Greek . It covers all the fundamentals one might need for that next step in their Greek studies . It is not far-reaching in scope , but that is in keeping with its stated goals : `` This book is not offered as an exhaustive treatment of the grammatical phenomena of the Greek New Testament '' ( from the preface ) . However , the book systematically covers all the features of New Testament Greek that one needs to secure a sound footing in the language.I would recommend the book for independent study and as a reference tool .	1
This book is very accessible for someone with a strong interest in Roman history , but little background in the subject ( like myself ) . Like the other reviewers , I agree that & quot ; History of Rome & quot ; is more of a primer to Ancient Rome than a detailed scholarly analysis.But , as primers go , it is very thorough . Grant discusses the political , economical , and military aspects of Roman life relatively equally . His timeline encompasses the entire span of Roman history ( a breathtaking era ) .Furthermore , unlike many historians , Grant includes the cultural side of Roman life . He gives almost equal weight to Vergil , Horace and Ovid as to many political/military figures . This gives a more human aspect to ancient Rome , which , though like modern society in many ways , still seems so remote to us.Grant 's writing style can get a bit dull , but the book flows welland is hard to put down . History may be more exciting than drama at times , but telling it is often more difficult . Grant can hardly be blamed for not keeping the reader at the edge of his seat all the time .	1
This book was actually more interesting than I first expected it to be , Im not quite done with it yet , but Im sure I will continue to enjoy it .	1
This book is just the thing to make you think . I read this book when I was a lot younger . I did no realize how much this had shaped my life . You will either love it or hate it but give it chance .	1
I 'm not sure how one goes about reviewing a book like this since it can not be captured in a paragraph or two . Suffice it to say , when I read it in my undergraduate days it was an eye-opener.In his earlier Tractatus Logico Philosophicus , Wittgenstein had sought to build a picture of the world by exploring how language mirrors reality in order to capture it . In Philosophical Investigations , a book which became the bible for a whole new way of philosophical thinking ( but which he never published in his lifetime ) , Wittgenstein scrapped all that for the view that language ultimately WAS the world because it contained it . A subtle but powerful difference in the way one sees things . He achieved this not through a traditional and long-drawn out philosophical argument but rather by a series of pithy , note-like questions and answers to himself . The argument does not so much build as unfold , as the reader sees more and more ( from a multiplicity of angles ) the nature of language as Wittgenstein came to conceive it in his later years . What it did for me back then was to wean me away from a narrow and rigorous positivism , which had previously colored everything I did and said , allowing me to see the value of many of the & quot ; non-concrete & quot ; forms of life in which we find ourselves . It does n't answer the ethical or metaphysical questions of traditional philosophy so much as it builds a & quot ; world & quot ; in which they seem intelligible if one approaches them in the non-traditional , Wittgensteinian way which is so crisply demonstrated here.In this book , no less than in his later teachings , Wittgenstein radically altered ( dare one say revolutionized ? ) the way we think about language and knowledge and even thinking itself . And how we view the philosophical project . If , in the end , we have not given up the struggle to solve philosophical problems in favor of & quot ; dissolving & quot ; them , which he generally recommends here , it is not because he did not offer us new insight into the matter but rather because his strategy leads to a more open and broader view of the world in which we find ourselves . Because of this book I found greater comfort in the company of the great metaphsyicians and existentialists , for all the fuzziness of their language ( which Wittgenstein implicitly criticizes ) , and learned to feel at ease with phenomenologists and even religionists ( is that a fair formulation for those who embrace the concept of deity in any of its many variants ? ) . And that , it seems to me , is what philosophy must be about in the end , about the big questions , Ludwig Wittgenstein 's technical queries and explorations notwithstanding . But he gets you there if you will give him the time and attention necessary to crack the world open , like the opaque and rather hard-boiled egg it often seems to be .	1
I 'm usually not so crazy about Star Biographies ... for a variety of reasons , they 're usually attention getting & quot ; feel bad for me & quot ; vs. & quot ; worship me & quot ; ploys taken from the pages of magazines atleast I would n't be caught dead reading outside of a doctor 's office , however - - THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT ( ! ) It is enormously well written - - Though its pretty clear Bruce Tucker wrote most of it , he managed to dig down into JBs soul and convey his RAGS TO RICHES story quite convincingly , capturing his voice while telling about his rise and fall ( & lt ; -- the IRS and disco got him ) and his come back at the time This book is so well written that I 've actually reread it SEVERAL times since it initially came out in the mid '80s . - - Though it is a bit ironical that JBs life would get a bit more & quot ; complicated & quot ; after it was written ( the drugs , run-ins with the law , death of his wife etc . ) it is clear that Brown & amp ; Tucker have presented to the world a book that 's engrossing and definitely a keeper ... It will bring a whole new meaning to the music !	1
RIP to the Godfather of Soul , Soul Brother # 1 , The Hardest Working Man in Show Business . This been a great blow and to all of us James Brown fans here . This book was the one I needed to keep me focused . Just read it all the way through earlier this year . Very strong , uplifting and powerful . James Brown was the Hero , the Legend , the American Pioneer . He was n't just an entertainer or a hit maker or an artist , he 's a man that have overcome alot on what 's happening in the world : going thru poverty , business , the Civil Rights Movement , the world , loss of jobs , politics , way of culture , way of living , and a way to express ourselves thru a meaning of religion , life , hunger , soul , pain , and suffering . The Man had it all . Boy I'mma miss him and his talent . His spirit always captures us thru this day . GOOD GOD ! ! ! Thanks for all the hardship and legacy you put us into , Brother James Brown .	1
Good book . Interesting read	1
bought this for a neighbor who was happy to receive it . That 's all I have to say about this purchase..	1
Could even Shakespeare have imagined the triumph and tragedy that marked the life of Napoleon Bonaparte ? Like Caesar , Napoleon rose from obscurity and through sheer determination , utter ruthlessness , and all-consuming ambition to become the ruler of the most powerful nation on earth . And like Caesar , Napoleon 's moment of triumph was short-lived , although the Waterloo campaign gave Napoleon the second chance his predecessor could only dream of.David G. Chandler is that rarest of historians who combines the dogged research skills of a born academic with the light writing touch of a master storyteller . While this work is enormous in both detail and scope , it is eminently readable , each page filled with the wonders of the Napoleonic Era.Far from pure biography , Chandler attempts to unravel the genius of Napoleon and explain the man and his times in terms even the military layman can understand . The longevity of this work ( published 1973 ) attests to the success of this endeavor.This book is an excellent choice for the budding military enthusiast , the Napoleonic fanatic , or the reader who wishes to begin his introduction to one of the great captains of history with the finest monograph ever published on the subject . Lavishly illustrated with maps , photographs , and drawings , you 'll find The Campaigns of Napoleon to be simply the most accessible work on on of history 's great men.Vive L'Empereur ! Vive Chandler !	1
What would happen if Little Red Riding Hood became angry with the woodsman ( oops ! woodsperson ) for trying to save her from the Big Bad Wolf ? Can you imagine a scenario where Cinderella actually ended up getting along with her sisters-of-step ? How would The Three Bears handle Goldilocks being a rogue environmental scientist ? In Politically Correct Bedtime Stories : Modern Tales for Our Life & Times , you can find the answer to these questions and more . This book takes these and other classic fairy tales from our childhood , strips them of offensive ( to some people ) language , replaces said language with more neutral word choices , for a brand new take on classic stories . Sounds boring ? Hardly . You will laugh hysterically and these stories just might make you think of life in a different way.I had been given this book as a Christmas gift when it first came out but somehow I had lost it , after a time . In rereading it , I laughed as much as I had before . Even though I still love the original fairy tales , it is amazing how sexist some of them actually are , when you think about it . Along with the humor , there are also strong themes of self-reliance , self-esteem , and empowerment in many of these stories .	1
This has become my favorite volume of fairy tales ever produced ! While the Brothers Grimm , Ellen Datlow and even Disney have all made gallant attempts at telling these classic morality stories , no one can hold a candle to James Finn Garner 's brilliant masterpiece.The fairytales presented in this volume include Little Red Riding Hood , The Emperor 's New Clothes , The Three Little Pigs , Rumplestiltskin , The Three Codependent Goats Gruff , Rapunzel , Cinderella , Goldilocks , Snow White , Chicken Little , The Frog Prince , Jack and the Beanstalk , and the Pied Piper of Hamlin.While all the stories are wonderful , Cinderella and the Frog Prince stand out and are my favorites . Read these two first ! While these stories are great if you just curl up and read them by yourself , they 're even better when read aloud with a big group of your friends ! But whatever you do , do n't read these right before bedtime as the title suggests . You 'll be laughing to hard to ever get to sleep.These stories are suitable for children , but even more fun for adults . This book gets my highest recommendations .	1
In November 1989 in St. Louis , the FBI inadvertently tape recorded the entire episode of a teenage girl 's being killed by her Palestinian father and Brazilian mother ( the Feds were looking for evidence of terrorism , which they also found ) . In a ghastly eight-minute sequence , Zein Isa stabbed his daughter Palestina thirteen times with a butcher 's knife as his wife held the girl down and responded to Palestina 's pleas for help with a brutal `` Shut up ! '' The killing ends with Zein screaming `` Die ! Die quickly ! Die quickly ! . . . Quiet , little one ! Die , my daughter , die ! '' By this time , she is dead.Harris , a St. Louis television reporter , has done admirable spade work going through the court transcripts and interviewing everyone connected to the case in an attempt to piece together the interlocking stories of family murder and active support of Abu Nidal 's terrorist organization . In addition , she successfully conjures up the small and exceedingly unpleasant world of Zein Isa and his family of rabid anti-Americans living right in the American heartland . The murder culminates their lives of frustration , greed , and vulgarity . Unfortunately , Harris spent more effort digging up information than she did writing the book ; so the more-than-casual reader must read and reread its pages to piece together the sequence of events and the scope of the Isa family 's involvement with Abu Nidal . Doing so repays the effort , however , for Harris has compiled a treasure trove of materials on two usually elusive subjects.Middle East Quarterly , September 1995	1
Bought this book for my culinary school classes .	1
This should be a & # 34 ; Must Read & # 34 ; for anyone interested in understanding how our federal government operates when it desires to close a subject to the public . If the reader does not conclude that some sort of cover up occurred , then he or she must have rushed through the book and skipped some pages . It is well documented and logically presented .	1
This is the classic tale of wanting what you ca n't have ... until you can . Romance aside , this book is chock full of history , drama , suspense , emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy . It 's peppered with a dry , cynical wittiness that will keep you , not only turning pages , but smiling , laughing , and even occasionally gasping incredulously . Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.The dialogue is simply smashing . The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level . This is something that the movie version was , understandably , unable to pull off . Scarlett came across as a one dimensional , selfish , cold hearted monster on the big screen . In the book , however , we have behind the scenes access to her mind , heart , will and emotions . When this story is appreciated in literary form , one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because , just as in reality , there are too many shades of gray.I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant . While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language , readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period . If the story had been written in any other way , it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale . That being said , if you are sensitive to such things , you should probably steer clear.As far as I am concerned , this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction . Yet , I must warn you ; Do n't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed . After reading Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books , I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down . Still , that did n't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind , anxiously looking for more . I was breathless with wonder , racked with unanswered questions , passionately angry at fate and , of course , torn between love and hate . When you really stop to think about it though , how could two personalities as dashingly quixotic as Scarlett and Rhett be expected to depart in any other fashion ?	1
One of my all time favorite book that I have gone back to time and time again . A thrilling story of the war that ripped this country apart . Wonderfully rich characters . I read this book at sixteen , and again almost forty two years later , and loved it once again . Margaret Mitchell writes as though these were her neighbors . A slice of southern life , it 's an intimate portrait of the mind set of the politics and culture of the times . It a true picture that debunks the `` glory '' of war and shows the devastation of it 's aftermath . The scene is set where the untouchable aristocracy of the South revels in the rich tapestry of entitlement , thinking themselves indestructible . We watch hope fade as the overconfidence turns into depression and finally defeat . We watch the emergence of a new type of person . As slave are finally freed , so is Scarlet . Her driving force , ambition and intelligence gives birth to a new American woman . A woman who can think . It is a great book on so many levels and on top of that the `` mother '' of all romances .	1
I love the storys , I laugh cry and am with Alya all the way through her life . watching in minds eye.The Clan of the Cave Bear	1
I have read this book at least 2-3x before ordering this copy . I must say I am enjoying it immensely & find it quite informative re the years after the Civil War in Atlanta . I have always considered the movie to be the best movie ever but the book is even better & even better than I remembered . A must read .	1
one of my all time favorites- ordered this for my friend so I would not have to lend mine . very good	1
This is one of those books that consumes your entire day thinking about it , even when you 're not reading it . A classic I 've been meaning to get to for quite awhile , I 'm glad I waited to read it as an adult . If you 'had to ' read it in high school , or you 've seen the movie , I still encourage you to give it a go .	1
This is a well-written classic . It 's a book about a woman and pre-Civil , Civil War era , and post Civil War . You 'll find one swear word in the entire book .	1
It 's a classic that I 've read more than twice . I rarely read a book more than once , but I love this story .	1
It 's almost impossible to match Gone With the Wind in terms of romance , passion and struggle . I think I 've read this book 6 or 7 times now . Maybe I 'll read the sequel some day because I 'd love to think Scarlett gets her happy ending , but I doubt anyone could match Margarat Mitchell 's writing .	1
I know , I know : another review of GWTW ? Yes.Why ? Because even after 72 years and billions of kudos , GWTW is still underrated . I was skeptical when I picked it up . But MM is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century , and she immediately hooks the reader . And she never lets up . And she spends the last third of the novel sucker-punching the reader over and over and over again , with each twist and turn more painful than the last . There 's no one left to root for at the end of the book , and that 's as it should be . Because it becomes clear that the characters in this novel ( the adults , anyway ) have all been playing a variety of dangerous games and , just like real life , they have to pay the price in the end.Scarlett is smart and courageous , but in the end she pays a price for her selfish behavior . Rhett is also smart and courageous , but at the end of the book he 's a broken mess groping for his dignity and sanity . Melanie remains sane and dignified , but she 's selfless to a fault ( a characteristic which leads to her demise ) , and Ashley ... well ... This book makes me weep every time I read it . And yet I 've read it at least 100 times . And keep coming back for more . Too bad all the sequels are so bad , but there 's some fabulous fan fiction out there .	1
I would give this book ten stars if I could . The story is great , the scope is magnificent , and the characters are so believable .	1
A book that I am saving , having read it years ago , but it seems as if now everyone is looking for it ! And I have mine ! ! Thanks Amazon	1
This novel is , I 'm certain you must know by now , a family saga covering the Civil War and Reconstruction in the South from the viewpoint of a wealthy Southern family who live on a plantation called 'Tara . 'Easy to read , 'Gone With the Wind ' is not only a family saga , but a fascinating character study of people who did what they had to do in order to survive the devastating war years and the reconstruction that followed . Lives and lifestyles were changed forever with the Civil War . Southerners had to adapt to an entirely foreign way of life and this novel explores how different people coped in the form of well-developed , complex characters.Difficult to put down , this novel is one you will read over and over again and eventually pass down to your children . Do n't hesitate to buy a copy !	1
I thought that I had read this book , but I guess that I had n't . The writing was SO good , I would think about it when I was n't reading it and happily read it whenever time allowed . No wonder it is a classic .	1
The movie is all anyone talks about , but Margaret Mitchell 's book still is the gold standard for brilliant plotting and characterizations . Despite its obvious racial backwardness ( we must remember when it was written ) , GWTW is still one of the most modern of novels . Scarlett is a woman for all generations .	1
Gone With The Wind is a classic of mid-twentieth century epic fiction . I read it years after being misguided by Ayn Rand and I was stunned when I realized how closely Rand mimicked Mitchell 's prose . Perhaps it was simply the writing style of the time . Mitchell and Rand differ , though , and if both writers create characters that are larger than life , Mitchell 's are real while Rand 's are pure fantasy.Scarlett O'Hara starts off as a prissy , selfish sixteen year old . She 's in love with a beautiful wimp and ca n't stand losing him to a saintly rival . She marries someone else out of spite at her loss just as the Civil War begins . She 's soon a widow and her estate is destroyed , her family in ruins . She marries again to a man with a sound business but no business sense . She takes over his lumber enterprise and gets thing done . She 's again widowed and marries Rhett Butler , a man who has all her gumption but whose self interest is tempered by empathy for the aspirations and hopes of others.Scarlett is a fascinating character . She has gumption , she gets things done but has no compassion for anyone but herself . Yet she never wastes any time on recriminations when wronged or when she falls victim to someone else 's mistakes ; she just moves on to the next task . She has a sense of responsibility , in a way she does n't clearly understand , and that there are things greater than herself . It is the tension between her inner contradictions that hooks the reader into admiration and that brings about our empathy for her.Vincent Poirier , Tokyo	1
This is the story of Howard Roark , the fiercely individual , independent , and unbreakable architecht . He is the ultimate testament to human spirit . The Fountainhead is wonderful for the intellectual intrigue in exploring Rand 's philosophy , and in its own right , as a gripping story of Roark 's perseverance in the face of countless obstacles.Howard Roark sets out to design buildings as he knows they should be : pragmatically . And he will not bow to pressures to build ostentatious works , regardless of the costs to his career . He suceeds on his own terms -- the only way to truly do so -- while ignorant tabloids and untalented , unprincipled coleagues do everytyhing in their power to bring him down.Also interesting is the novel 's exploration of Rand 's objectivism : the notion that the individual should never lie prostrate to the masses . Even in the extremes , the seeming selfishness of her philosohpy can be forgiven here , as the polar opposites in the novel -- the `` altruists '' are more manipulative and self-interested than any self-proclaimed `` selfish '' character of the novel . A must read , both to enjoy on an intellectual/philisophical level , and for the simple enjoyment of reading a gripping , well-written novel .	1
Most of the people who either tell you `` The Fountainhead '' is a must read or tell you not to bother seem to have an agenda . The best advice I can offer is to read it and decide for yourself . Individualism is , after all , one of the main messages of the book . Do n't let others tell you what to think . Think for yourself.First , `` The Fountainhead '' is a great read . It is a compelling , vastly readable and entertaining novel . For years I was intimidated by it and its size , but my rule that great authors and great books will keep you interested and reading to the end regardless of length holds true here . It is the story of individualistic architect Howard Roark who refuses to compromise his integrity , designing and building amazing modern architecture while fighting the status quo of public opinion , manufactured and otherwise . There is a tremendously powerful and unconventional love story between Roark and the brilliant Dominique Francon that inspires great debate on its own . There are amazing characters and images that will stay with you forever . Mostly , though , `` The Fountainhead '' makes you think and , love it or hate it , this is always a good thing.At the heart of the Ayn Rand 's novel is the theme of the individual versus the collective , `` not in politics but within a man 's soul . '' It barely mentions politics , economics , or world affairs , even though it was published during WWII . Howard Roark at least partially sums it up by saying , `` Do n't work for my happiness , my brothers . Show me yours . Show me that it is possible . Show me your achievement , and the knowledge will give me courage for mine . '' He does n't help others out of the goodness of his heart . He strives to achieve his best in his chosen work , and that in turn inspires others to do their best.Roark thinks for himself , which threatens others who either seek the power to control others or who are merely content with being controlled . Ellsworth Toohey 's speech to Peter Keating in part 4 of the novel sums up his view of this threat . `` Can you rule a thinking man ? We do n't want any thinking men . '' While rival architect Peter Keating 's only sense of self-worth comes from the validation of others , Howard Roark 's motivation and satisfaction comes from the inside , completely independent of what others think . Satisfaction comes from his work , not from what others think of his work . He keeps his integrity , through the good and bad . To do otherwise would destroy him.Many of the characters in `` The Fountainhead '' are said to be based in part on actual people . Howard Roark 's buildings are based on the works of Frank Lloyd Wright , and many contemporary architects have cited the book as an inspiration to their own careers . Gail Wynand , the newspaper mogul of The Banner , reminds me of William Randolph Hurst . The book came out within a year of Orson Welles ' classic film Citizen Kane , also said to be based on Hurst . It is interesting to see how the Wynand newspapers manipulate public opinion , and to think about how major media outlets do the same today , especially during political election cycles.There are a number of people who attack this book without understanding or bothering to understand the message as a whole . Some will think it too long . Some will disagree with the novel 's libertarian ideals . Some will object to the rape scene . Some will dismiss Rand 's entire philosophy by labeling it `` selfish '' and summarily moving on without thinking about it . The challenge in reading `` The Fountainhead '' is to think for yourself , making up your own mind , much as the characters in the novel are challenged to do . It 's easier to be told what to think , and many fall into this trap . With the decentralization of information in the Internet age , however , I wonder how this dynamic is changing .	1
It 's one of her best . My first book of hers that I read was & # 34 ; Anthem & # 34 ; and I loved it . & # 34 ; Atlas Shrugged & # 34 ; was talked about on Fox News and so I read it and it opened my eyes more to what 's going on now here . & # 34 ; Fountainhead & # 34 ; completed my collection . It never ceases to amaze me how old these books are . If your aware or worried about the route our country is on ? Ayn Rand will open your eyes to what is going on right now .	1
Whether you agree with the ideas Rand presents or think she is one with the devil , `` The Fountainhead '' is a powerful and moving book that I highly recommend . Although it is long , it is very tightly written . There are no unnecessary scenes , no irrelevant characters and no ad nauseum descriptions of sunsets and waterfalls.There are several reasons I love this book , none having to do with the controversial philosophies of the author . The first is the amazing characterization . There were several people in the book that could have been drawn directly from people in my life : the social worker who works more out of self-righteousness than pure altruism , the over-blown academic who can read meaning and symbolism in tripe , the professional who cares more about where his work takes him than the quality of the work itself . Rand does n't draw these as flat characters . Instead we actually see their flaws and motivations in all their beauty and terror.I also love the idealism of Roark . Several previous reviews have termed him `` egotistical '' with a `` superiority complex '' , but that is n't how I see him at all . Would a professional who meets those descriptions lower himself to working as a common laborer at a quarry ? Roark does n't care if his work is good or not , let alone that it is superior . All that matters is that it pleases him . He might work a menial job , but he would n't debase himself to produce anything but the kind of art that pleases him , whatever anyone else says about its quality.The insight of the book into the power of the press and the country 's growing socialization is another drawing point . I crack up whenever I read the Banner 's editorial on parenthood in modern times . It describes how parents need to be just as loving toward and concerned about other children as they are of their own . It reads remarkably like Hillary Clinton 's `` It Takes a Village '' . In an age where talentless performers are at the top of the chart because of the right buzz , I can understand the idea that he who controls the media , controls the tastes of the masses.A common criticism of `` The Fountainhead '' is the rape of Dominique by the hero . Like so much of the book , it is not something that can be understood if you only view it in a vacuum . Roark and Dominique have an almost transcendental bond . Throughout the book they start in the middle of conversations and understand each other as if they were one . Their violent first sexual encounter is not indicative of Roark 's character or of their relationship.There are some simplistic parts of the book : all capitalists are good , all socialists are bad , wanting to help people and do good is described as an excuse , not a noble motive . Still , there is so much good in this beautiful book that I consider it one that everyone should read .	1
OK , I have read everything Ayn Rand ever wrote . I am a Randian nut . Her notion of capitalism and government applies to me . I believe in the free market economies and that only through free markets will society be achieved . Fountainhead speaks to all those factors brilliantly in the Randian style of pictorial wording and pithy elegance of character creation.Howard Roark , is an individualistic architect who chooses to struggle in obscurity rather than compromise his artistic and personal vision . We follow his battle to practice what the public sees as modern architecture , which he believes to be superior , despite an establishment centered on tradition-worship . How others in the novel relate to Roark demonstrates Rand 's various archetypes of human character , all of which are variants between Roark , the author 's ideal man of independent-mindedness and integrity , and what she described as the `` second-handers . `` Powerful , visionary , and moving . Rand gives us ideas as poignant as The Republic by Plato .	1
Unbelievable , superb ! The author depicts characters which not only intrigue but depict the extremes in society . I do not believe that Ayn Rand was an extremist ; it is through her extremist characters in the novel that Rand describes objectivism , the goal towards ego and capitalism , as not 'evil'.It is man 's desire to achieve a goal using all instruments at his/her disposal which promotes improvements or degradation to society as a whole.Toohey as a character was resolute in his goal for power and it was this determinedness which allowed him to obtain his strength and manipulate people . Ayn relates the methods used to stifle the soul of man and kill the spirit.Howard Roark strives for a 'quality ' in architecture which many attempt to destroy ( even unknowingly ) . Roark 's glory is achieved in the doing and the finality of the work . The achievement when completing his works alters the architectural and imaginative ideas of others.I highly recommend this novel to all the philosophically minded readers . Whether or not you agree with the author , the ideas will have you thinking .	1
I read Atlas Shrugged first because that 's what all the discussions are about . I had been trying to find the time to read this one , but it 's hard , and I figured since all the fanfare is about Atlas this was mediocre in comparison . I found the book on CD for this at the library and listened to it on the way to work . Boy was I wrong . I loved this book , much more than Atlas Shrugged , and I still love Atlas . It 's incredible , so I had to order it right away . Wonderful . I flip through it all the time and read the best parts when I 'm feeling depressed about current events .	1
Ayn Rand really draws sharp contrasts between her individualists like Roark and collectivists like Keating . This is a timeless classic . The Fountainhead may have Rand 's best villain in Toohey .	1
When I read The Fountainhead I was in my mid thirties , and I though it was one of the best books I have ever read . It is not a straightforward novel or a story . Rand uses her characters to describe different positions one can take in life . Sure , all heroes are distilled to the point of the primitive : good guy who does not give up his principles when creating houses , bad guy who does , another bad guy who manipulates the weak and encourages the mediocre , and so on . As such people involved in the story are not typically human . However , through such symbolism the author expresses her philosophy of life , which I suppose is well known.One can argue about the methods Rand used in her work , but the essence of the novel comes through very strongly . Integrity and honesty are , in my opinion , the symbols of this text . Sure , nothing in real life is black and white , but like in visual art , where a fragment is may be given unnaturally bright light in order to make a point , characters of the Fountainhead are unnaturally illuminated in order to express their essence more clearly.If it was up to me I would include this book into the school curriculum .	1
THE FOUNTAINHEAD was my first exposure to Ayn Rand and her objectivist ideas . I 'm surprised how much I enjoyed it . This novel is brimming with Rand 's philosophy , but also presents a very compelling story about a man ( the brilliant architect Howard Roark ) who refuses to compromise his integrity against all odds . For the most part , this book is a real page turner.This type of novel is n't for everyone . The writing is dry in spots , and much of the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic . But I do really admire Rand 's ambition here . In THE FOUNTAINHEAD , she tries to convey a lot of big and demanding ideas that are normally not expressed by the mainstream media , or by most of the artistic community . This book , in many ways , is one of a kind.Although I do n't agree with all of Ayn Rand 's philosophy , I still found myself looking at society in new and different ways after finishing this book . So this is the type of novel that can change your world view . And even if it does n't , it 's an interesting experience that you wo n't forget . I heartily recommend THE FOUNTAINHEAD to those interested in being challenged as well as entertained .	1
Ayn Rand 's The Fountainhead is an engrossing and challenging literary/philosophical book.At one level , the novel is a simple story , following the life of Howard Roark , an architect with daring vision and uncompromising standards who battles psychologically ( and occasionally physically ) with the world around him . Roark dares to design buildings not for their aesthetic or functional purposes as defined by others , but rather for their prima facie , self-serving purposes -- a goal which Roark ( and Rand ) believes is pure and perfect , for the human ego is the fountainhead of all progress . In opposition to Roark is seemingly the rest of the world -- charlatan characters who merely imitate and debase the pure egotistical nature of man . Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey are the main antagonists , both of whom live parasitic , relativistic existences that run counter to Roark 's objective philosophical purity.At the second and more important level , The Fountainhead is an introduction to Rand 's philosophy of objectivism , which exalts man 's place in the universe and actively promotes egoism , capitalism and objective reality as its virtues . Rand 's characters are caricatures , as Rand exaggerates her perspective to drive home her philosophical points.Regardless of what one thinks about Rand 's philosophy , The Fountainhead is an engrossing story that , despite its length , keeps the reader 's attention throughout . Readers will really have to think throughout the novel and will be filled with many questions and doubts at the end of the book as Rand makes a forceful and often persuasive case against modern American society.While I found Rand 's philosophy to be a bit obnoxious and oversimplified , it did not get in the way of me enjoying this book . Unfortunately , much of the debate about this book has been clouded by people 's philosophical and political leanings . The people who enjoy this book the most are those who go in with an open mind . Whether you conclude the book in total agreement or utter disgust with Rand 's philosophy is moot -- readers will be better off for having read this intellectually challenging book .	1
I LOVED this book . One of my goodreads friends added it to her to-read list and it looked interesting . I read it and I am so glad I did . I read it in a few days and thoroughly enjoyed it . It 's the story of an alcoholic housewife/mother in the 70s and her struggles just to make it through each day ( without getting drunk by mid-morning ) . I highly recommend this book . I think I read somewhere that there was a TV movie based on this book back in the 70s . I am going to have to look for that .	1
I was given the 1964 edition of The Joy of Cooking by my mother when I was in my teens and there is no better than this one in our opinion . Mine had fallen apart from years worth of use and the one that I received was in practically mint condition for a 40 year old version . I would recommmed this to all who love to cook .	1
I bought this book for the details and suggestions on cooking wild game . Also the old ways of mixing and putting together recipes have intrigued me - it makes me challenge myself to use basic , old ways of baking and cooking .	1
This is a MUST read book , so much detail & information . One of my favorite books on a different slant about the Nuremburgh Nazi Trials/ Holocaust / what the `` saved `` Nazis endured during their stay in Spandauetc . Very easy reading . My personal feeling is ALL of them should 've HANGED , Speer included ! So many escaped JUSTICE because maybe they were n't the `` exact `` ones to lead the poor men/women/children into the Gas Chambers etc. , but they did n't have too , they had others to do their `` BLOODY Work '' for them & were able to keep their hands `` clean `` . While SPEER was no doubt `` Between a Rock & A Hard Place `` , he knew of the MONSTROUS regime he was working for & what it 's EVIL Plans were for the Jews & others that did n't `` FIT `` into Hitlers future ! He just figured as long as he was not `` physically `` attached , he was `` clean `` ! He was part of the EVIL CHAIN OF COMMAND & should 've hung ! There 's no doubt thousands that escaped justice should 've HUNG , camp guards etc. , as i 've read several books on the Holocaust & survivor storys . The whole WORLD owes the JEWS an apology ? { more than that ] because of HOW we ignored what was being done to them [ not just the Jews ] when we KNEW way beforehand of the catrastophe that was developing ! ! ! Shame on us , may WE [ The World ] NEVER allow nothing like this to EVER happen again ! ! ! !	1
I like to read biographies and this book was well written and revealing . I liked all the sources the author was able to interview rather than a lot of here say when the person is already deceased on whom the biography is written.Marilyn is a legend here in America , and to even glimpse into her short life is fascinating and diverting . Anyone who thinks they know Marilyn Monroe should read this biography because she was a layered individual who had a glamorous yet tragic life .	1
Words can not describe it . One of the best I 've read about Monroe . There are no sugar-coated stories , only gritty and sad glimpses of a woman who spun out of control..	1
I never before read the details on her death , who knows but the theory is interesting . the book haunted me for days afterwards , can hardly believe the whole situation regarding her tragic life although she was so beautiful it 's so sad-a good and captivating storyline if you believe it who knows .	1
i was to young to know any of this at the time . I know it now . I was born in 1968 and knew the face , but not the story . WOW . Corruption at the highest level .	1
drugs , who can say , or understand the demons she faced , Kennedy s , Sinatea Lofford , and all the rest were only human , she took as well as gave .	1
I 'm almost done with the book and I love it . Very well written . I never knew much about her . What a soul she was .	1
Margaret was nervous . She was developing more slowly than her friends . This was not just a problem ; it could be an embarassment . Margaret was different in another way , too . She did n't follow any religion , but that did n't keep her from talking to God -- even if she was upset with Him sometimes . Read about friendships , enemyships , and `` girl problems ; '' about Margaret Simon , but you 'll probably see yourself , too.The Creative Teacher : Activities for Language Arts ( Grades 4 through 8 and Up )	1
I really liked this book , and I recommend it to 11to 13 year - old girls . I loved this book so much that I read it in one day ! : )	1
I loved this book . I learned a little bit more aboutGod.I am a Christian girl and I 'm not afraid of it .	1
A fantastic read for young girls . Judy Blume remembers what it is like to be a young girl and get the voice of Margaret perfectly . Young girls reading this may finally feel like there is someone who 'gets ' them . Highly recommended .	1
A Newbery award winner of 1931 , this book ( based on an old folk tale ) is a beautiful lesson in patience , compassion and kindness to all , human and animal alike.A little humble cat ( a Japanese bobtail ! ) , rescued and brought home by the compassionate housekeeper to the home of a starving artist who does not at first welcome her -- does all she can to show how grateful she is to share the artist 's home and eat her meager fish and rice diet.When the artist sees this cat seemingly praying at the statue of the Buddha , he names the cat Good Fortune.Soon the artist is commissioned by the temple ( and given a cash advance ) to create a scroll depicting the death of Buddha and the procession of animals who walk by him to convey their final respects . But because , the cat never received Buddha 's blessing , the artist could not put a cat into the scroll . However , looking at Good Fortune and how kind and humble she is , his heart and his compassion get the better of him and , to Good Fortune 's exceptional delight , he paints a cat into the scroll , even while knowing that by doing so , he assuredly risks losing the possibility of ever having the scroll hang in the temple.Beauty , happiness and sadness all occured at the same time -- the beauty of the finished scroll , the utter joy shown by Good Fortune at seeing a cat in the scroll , and the double sadness , 1- Good Fortune died of Happiness ( and was buried with great love and respect ) -- and 2 - the monks of the temple , upon seeing the cat in the scroll , were very upset and angered . The artist knew very well that because of his compassion toward Good Fortune , he was doomed to utter poverty because no one in the village -- would ever ask for his services again , after what he painted in this scroll.Or would they ? ? ? ? Read on.Miracles happen every day . As it turns out , Good Fortune truly DID bring Good Fortune -- to herself , her artist , his housekeeper , the temple and the village.The Cat Who Went to Heaven brings us not only beautiful illustrations , but a timeless wisdom in its message .	1
This book was a favorite of my children and grandchildren . My granddaughter wanted to read it to her two daughters and asked me if I could get it for her . Amazon came to my rescue and now she will be able to read this dear book to her children . We are so happy and ready to start a tradition for the next generation	1
4.5 stars . Long time ago , back in 4th grade , a librarian recommended this book to me ; I read it , and liked it , but did n't feel it had made a huge impression . Yet it kept coming back to me over the years , so I decided to give it a re-read.Hitty the doll was about a hundred years old ; this story , published in 1929 , is getting close . Some things have held up fairly well ; the story of a small , hand-carved doll , going from beloved companion to heathen idol to fashion model and more , is fascinating , and the device - told in first person from the POV of the doll - is probably one of the most unique literary devices ever . The illustrations , too , are charming , and help reinforce the idea that while the doll belongs to various owners , generally children , she herself is an adult , with a deliberately pleasant expression.Other details , like Hitty 's ash-wood complexion , became a little rougher with the passing of time . The author did not know about political correctness in 1929 ; some of the stories , like that of being carried on a whaling vessel , are fascinating , yet at the same time horrifying to those of us who understand whales to be sentient beings . The depiction of people of color - in India , and America is n't - QUITE - racist , but borders on it ; the depiction of & # 34 ; heathens & # 34 ; as bowing down and worshiping the doll because she had jointed limbs is ridiculous.I would n't hand this book to a child today without reading it along with her/him and explaining some of these issues . But there is a tremendous amount of entertainment here ; it certainly stokes the imagination , wondering where the doll will wind up next . The revelations about human nature - some of the doll 's owners prized her , for various reasons , otherwise were more lackadaisical , even abusive , are still applicable today . The descriptions of Maine and its foliage are also beautiful . And the doll 's voice - a somewhat prim , stiff ( well , she IS wooden ) older lady - is wonderful .	1
I first read `` Misty of Chincoteague '' when I was a child in the 1950s . I loved the story so much that I ended up memorizing it so that I could tell it to myself after lights-out . My parents took me to Pony Penning Day in the late 1950s , when Chincoteague was still very much like the town Marguerite Henry described and the bridge to Assateague was way , way in the future.Pony Penning Day was very exciting , but even more exciting was the fact that Misty was still alive and living at the Beebe ranch ! I still have a picture of me petting her . Marguerite Henry was there , too -- a wonderful woman , with a genuine love for children . So was Grandpa Beebe , looking very much like Wesley Dennis drew him.I will always treasure the memory of that vacation , and judging by the other reviews of this book , there are many , many people out there for whom this book occupies a special place in their hearts.Even though times have changed since this book was written ( Maureen would probably not play so much of a second fiddle to Paul these days ) , the story itself is timeless : the love of the children for the Phantom ; their yearning to own her ; their willingness to do whatever it took to buy her ; Paul 's eventual triumph ; and , once again , the love of the children for the Phantom that compels them to do what it best for her : these things make up a story that will continue to captivate children for many generations to come.I would also like to add that the Wesley Dennis illustrations in all of Marguerite Henry 's books are simply wonderful . That was a very serendipituous partnership , because his drawings add so much to Mrs. Henry 's spledid stories .	1
Big Pumpkin is a wonderful story that teaches children about working together to accomplish a task , when one person can not do it alone . It is a really fun book to read to children and change your voice for each character . This is one of my favorite books to share with young children .	1
In Erica Silverman 's _Big Pumpkin_ , a witch tries to get her big pumpkin off the vine , so she can make pumpkin pie . A mummy , a vampire , a ghost and a bat each stop by and try to pull the pumpkin from the vine . They succeed when they all pull together . Later they share the pumpkin pie.Schindler 's illustrations are hilarious . The image of the mummy trying to pull the pumpkin from the vine is one i will never forget ... the image of the bat eating pumpkin pie is another one . Both I and my ( 3 year old ) son find this book very funny . The story is simple and repetitive ... there is nothing really scary or morbid here at all.In my opinion , this is an ideal Halloween picture book for 3- and 4-year olds .	1
Beautiful illustrations will entrance children of all ages as Amy Tan shows she can entertain both children and adults .	1
This publication brings together a lot of information , one would have to gleen from reading extensive other material in multiple books and magazines . Thanks .	1
I purchased this cookbook as a gift for my father who really enjoys cooking and Cuban food . What a hit , I would definately reccommend !	1
I am 50 and only got interested in cooking a year ago . This cookbook and Fine Cooking magazine are the reasons it finally took ... .This book will tell you with clear explanations and drawings how to cut something up ... or whatever you want to know about a particular food . All the stuff that I did n't know and did n't seem to be able to find out easily.For instance , I was eating bing cherries tonight , wondering if they could be used in a pie . I do n't bake - how should I know , right ? Duh ... : ) So I read all about cherries . Then I got into fruit compotes and mousse ... Then I read all about pastry ... this cookbook is fun , and you can end up surfing it just like that.Even if I use a recipe from some other source , I go to this book to bone up on the ingredients - how to buy , how to prepare , etc . So far I have always found what I was looking for . He really must have included EVERYTHING . : ) In addition to this , it also has very good recipes.Finally , I love the intelligent way it 's organized , because you can find the item alphabetically in the index and then go either to THE BASICS OF ... sections for techniques and basic info on the item , or directly to the recipes containing the item .	1
I love to cook- sometimes even without a book . At times I need a quick , 15 minute meal . Other times I need a from-scratch cake with homemade frosting . With How To Cook Everything , I can find multiple recipes for both occasions . I can look up `` brown rice '' ( if I have way too much of it in the pantry ) and find pages and pages of recipes that use brown rice . At the end of many of the recipes , there are suggestions/alterations on the original recipe so that I can make them my own and experiment in the kitchen with almost guaranteed success.I own both the yellow , softcover edition of this book and the new , 10th Edition . From the older edition , there is a reference of 50 classic cookbooks that I have started to add into my collection . From the 10th edition , I have list after more go-to lists for meal ideas and different dishes to make on special occasions.I have used these books as my go-to references whenever I am cooking . There are black & white illustrations showing you how do everything from carving a roast chicken to folding egg whites . I have not made anything `` bad '' from either of the books . There was only one recipe I have looked for and did not find : Baked Alaska . I would highly recommend either edition of this cookbook to a novice cook looking for some guidance or to a seasoned cook looking to add new techniques or flavors to his/her cooking .	1
As someone who was banished from the kitchen by my mother ( except for dish-washing chores ) , I have always had lots of questions about what to do and when for the kinds of dishes I like . My wife was similarly banished so we are like the blind leading the blind . Our mothers ' culinary skill caused us to appreciate great home-cooked food , but unable to provide it for ourselves . As a result , we are fond of cookbooks where you toss a few ingredients together and get something tasty in a few minutes . We also look forward to restaurant meals where great flavors are experienced beyond what our mothers gave us.That seemed to me like where we would stay until I found the Completely Revised Tenth Anniversary Edition of How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman . With this book , I can create almost anything I used to enjoy at my mom 's house or in a restaurant . I also feel confident about achieving those results because this book answers my unanswered questions.I was astonished to see how many flavors I like in sauces can be created very easily . Wow ! In addition , I can now look forward to healthier eating by knowing what ingredients are being used rather than relying on so many prepared ingredients.Thank you ! If you already know how to make great recipes from scratch , you wo n't be as impressed by this book as I am . In fact , you probably wo n't need it.To use a metaphor , this book is n't the ultimate cook book . It 's the step-up cookbook for those who have mastered the simplest kitchen preparations but want to learn how to do more and create the kind of results that you do n't experience in 90 percent of American kitchens.Enjoy !	1

I love the simplicity of the recipes and that the recipes I 've tried so far always come out well . I rely on this book to learn about new foods I 've never tried before .	1
For someone like me who is really just learning to cook because I am finally learning to enjoy it instead of doing the bare minimum to feed myself , this book is the perfect answer . I got this on Christmas and spent about 2 hours just curled reading about things like making pasta ( more approachable sounding than I suspected ) , making stocks ( or making the canned broths more passable ) , how to choose and cut certain vegetables and so much more . This book contains so much general useful information that I feel like I 've gotten an education to take beyond just the recipes in the book but to actually use anytime I cook . I have n't yet tried the recipes , but I loved reading how much instruction and detail is given instead of keeping things vague like so many others . Some of them sound so good that they ca n't be bad , and even if every recipe in the book were to bomb ( unlikely ) , this surprisingly big and chunky book is worth it 's weight in gold just for all of the advice and information . I 'll be so much more well-fed thanks to this fabulous cookbook .	1
Once again , I added this to my Weight watchers Collection . I have used this & other Books for Delicious Receipies & have had Success with the Program	1
I purchased this book when me and my boyfriend were going through a hard time . It was a good product overall and i went on to purchase the complete idiots guide to a healthy relationship . I think this book would be better suited for beggining couples trying to determine if their partner has similar goals in life .	1
This is a really good book , and is not totally about stocks as a previous review claims . It talks about the traits of wealthy people , taxes , investing , starting your own business and many other things . It is the kind of book you read over and over ! I got it from the library originally , but it was so good I had to buy it !	1
I bought this for my husband , who is our baker and cook . We recently purchcased a Zojurushi Bread Machine ... .every receipe in this book has been a winner ( so far ) ! Excellent instructions and the end product delicious . He has not tried the receipes by hand yet ... . ( but has baked bread by hand in the past ) ... but I give this book a big five stars ... .I 'm looking forward to the day I can be baking again to try ( and taste ) all of the receipes .	1
This book is not just for beginners ! Every researcher should read this book to keep them on track in their family history research . The material is very entertaining as well as informative . I recommend this book at every class or seminar I teach .	1
This is a very good book with a lot of beautiful photographs . Good ideas for various types of gardens and gardners , with a practical , useful emphasis that looks at long-term planning .	1
If you can only afford one book on gardening , this is the book you should buy.I have been gardening for 3 years now . I bought this book last year ( my 2nd year ) , and it was some of the best money I have ever spent . It 's the only gardening book of the seven I bought at the time that I would buy again . I refer to constantly . I found Burpee 's Complete Vegetable & Herb Gardener very accessible as a novice gardener and I find it complex enough to keep me coming back as I become more experienced . If it has a flaw , it is only that it does not provide enough information on identifying diseases and pests ( Identifying Diseases of Vegetables from Penn State is good resource for this , but it does n't seem to be available from Amazon -- I got mine form Southern Exposure Seeds ) .	1
I taught myself to knit - and knit only - off of a pamphlet in a store . I could start , I could do the basic knit stitch , then I could make the world 's longest scarf , because I could n't for the life of me figure out how to stop ! This book helped a great deal , with simple instructions and ways to fix all those mistakes you make in the beginning.There are n't a LOT of illustrations , but the ones they have were very helpful . I ca n't imagine true photographs would be better - hello ? yarn is fuzzy ! It blends together in a photo , but in a drawing can be more distinctive.The special sections which help prevent snarls and give helpful pointers are great , and make it easy to follow . Also fun are the suggestions of dialogue heavy movies ( so you can watch your hands more as you knit ) and various & quot ; famous & quot ; knitters and how their styles have influenced the knitting world . There 's a bibliography at the back ( I 'm looking at it right now - 8 books on knitting , 7 on crocheting ) as well as a glossary , and perhaps most importantly - how to fix mistakes without ripping out and starting over ! ! ! The overall format is easy to read , and very approachable ! To quote the owner of a frequently visited yarn store - you 'll never need another book on knitting !	1
Certainly a complete book about all the ancient & # 34 ; gods & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; goddesses & # 34 ; along with their associated myths . This was the most informative and organized book I have read on this topic . My only & # 34 ; negative & # 34 ; comment would be the authors seem to approach this subject matter from a modern day Christian perspective and , as such , discount any reality or hidden meaning or symbol that may be contained in these & # 34 ; fairytales & # 34 ; . Other works are available that highly research these hidden meanings , but that was not the purpose of this work-nonetheless , this work is well worth having as a valuable asset that will save one hours of personal research . Easy to read .	1
Lots of great information in this book to help you learn tarot and fortune telling . I enjoyed the book and am glade I added it to my personal collection	1
This is s really good book that gets to the emotional root causes of overeating . I would have given it 5 stars if it was n't filled with not-so-subtle pitches for joining Weight Watchers.Each chapter was accompanied by exercises and activities that hep you to work through those issues , for example anger or boredom and gives you alternatives to overeating .	1
The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Being Psychic , by Lynn A. Robinson , M.Ed . and LaVonne Carlson-Finnerty , has everything you need to recognize and develop your innate psychic abilities . Robinson is an intuitive consultant who has been helping people for more than 20 years , and Carlson-Finnerty is a writer specializing in health , alternative health , and spirituality . Together they 've written an easy-to-understand book that will answer every question you might have about being psychic.Robinson emphasizes that everyone is psychic . It simply takes a bit of practice to develop your abilities . The book is filled with easy exercises designed to help bring you recognize psychic experiences and develop your own `` sixth sense . `` The authors present a brief history of psychic phenomena , beginning with the Babylonians , who `` read '' animal entrails to predict the future . They also list people who have depended on their psychic abilities , including Sir Winston Churchill , Albert Einstein , and Henry Ford . They also tell you how to choose a psychic , or intuitive , consultant and what to reasonably expect from a reading.Most of the book , however , is devoted to developing your own abilities . They emphasize that `` your intuition is sending you information all the time -- you just need to start noticing it . '' People receive information in various ways . The most common are clairvoyance ( inner vision ) , clairaudience ( inner voice ) , and clairsentience ( inner sensing ) . Others can touch an object and know its history ( psychometry ) , while some receive information via taste or smell . They also discuss hypnosis , dreams , telepathy , auras , precognition , ESP , channeling , and astral travel.Once you learn to recognize and develop your particular psychic abilities , you can then use them to improve your life , especially for mental and physical healing . Your intuition can help you decide what your ideal life is , and then help you live that ideal . For those who wish to help others , the authors provide information on how to give a reading.Robinson and Carlson-Finnerty have also compiled several appendices of resource material , including Internet sources.The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Being Psychic is a useful reference for anyone wishing to understand or develop their innate talents . It 's easy to read , with lots of practical examples , and it thoroughly covers all things psychic .	1
The complete idiot 's guide to cycling is really appropriate for , well , a bicycle idiot . That 's me . I buy my bikes at WalMart and Target . I like the cool basket on the front with the flower . I do n't change gears , gears are for people who can put chains back on . That is all behind me now ! I know what the different sized Chain Rings ( lingo alert ! ) do , and which ones I want the chain on while I 'm gasping up some hill . I adjusted the seat ! Now my knees do n't slap me in the chin on the upswing . And I bought a helmet and started wearing it , IMMEDIATELY . Survival of the smartest do n't you know . If you are like me , and you want to be like Lance , this is a good place to start , along with your local professional bike shop ... and some bucks !	1
I discovered and was very surprised that there are so many ways to make bread machine bread that is healthful and very tasteful . I even make bread for gifts and they are received by my friends who enjoy them so much . We love eating bread without all of those additives and this book has many recipes for & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; bread .	1
I owned my breadmachine for about a year before buying this cookbook . I had stuck to the recipes that from the booklet that came with the bread machine . I was looking for new , creative ideas and I got them with this cookbook ! What a revelation ! So many fantastic bread recipes ! I learned to use the dough cycle alone and then shape the bread into whatever shape I wanted and still get perfect loaves of bread . I used to think I could n't possibly make a braided bread , etc . but Betty Crocker 's cookbook gives the best diagrams I have ever seen . They make it look so easy -- and it is ! We love the seeded breads , the cinnamon raisin bread ( to which I add chopped walnuts ! ) , and so many others . I ca n't wait to continue trying with these great recipes . Also , the photographs are wonderful . I like the binding because it lies flat while I 'm reading and preparing the bread . If you 've been looking for a bread machine cookbook to add to your repetoire of breads you can proudly say you made yourself , this book is aptly titled : THe BEST Bread Machine Cookbook .	1
I recieved this item in record time , and I love the quality of it ! ! Thank you	1
Tons of great easy-to-follow recipes ! I am very pleased with this book !	1
This is an easy to use dictionary . I possess a copy and just recently bought a copy for one of our kids in college .	1
I have tried a number of fish cookbooks , both in English and Chinese , and was not satisfied with any of them . The two main problems : ( 1 ) the dishes are too *heavy* - e.g . they use too much butter or heavy cream , or involve deep frying , which I avoid ; and ( 2 ) they rely too much on the same sets of stereotyped ingredients , e.g . tomato- , cream- or soy sauce-based sauces.Mark Bittman tends towards light and healthy cooking , which is much more to my taste , and he offers incredible variety from cuisines all over the world . My very favorite salmon recipe is on p. 235 , Salmon Roasted with Cilantro `` Pesto '' . Even those not crazy about cilantro may like this one - it 's light , delicious , fast and easy to make in a toaster oven , and likely very *different* from any style of salmon you 've had before.Fish cookbooks occupy a crucial niche for me - I do n't eat meat and general cookbooks tend to concentrate very heavily on meat and sweets , neither of which interests me . And vegetarian cookbooks by definition include no animal food , but I eat and like fish . So the easiest way to bridge this gap is to get a fish cookbook . The problem was finding a good one . Well , this is definitely the best one I 've found . I recommend it highly .	1
This is a great cookbook for chicken recipes . There is a large variety of recipes , from Asian to Mexican to Italian to Southern as well as sandwiches , soups , and stews . Most of the recipes are simple and many are quick . These are mostly made with ingredients that I buy at the grocery store on a regular basis , without a lot of hard to find or uncommon additions . That 's especially nice considering the large variety of tastes and textures included.Many of the recipes feature suggestions for side dishes as well , which is particularly helpful , and tips to make the cooking go easier and faster . The recipe instructions are rather brief , and for the inexperienced cook , they may find this a slight obstacle , but with the reference guide in the front , it would be impossible to not know what to do . The front of the book has a wonderful guide about storage , safety , and cooking techniques.The best part about this book is that there is a glossy color picture of every recipe on the main pages ( there are a few recipes inside the cover of the book that do n't have pictures ) , which is great when flipping through the book to decide what to have for dinner . It 's especially helpful for those that are more visually oriented and for whom it is difficult to get a picture and the taste of the recipe by just reading the words.A very helpful chicken cooking guide !	1
This book manages to explain the history and practices of Judaism in a way that can be understood by anyone . Not a dry commentary , this book provides solid information in a friendly , absorbing manner . This is one of the best resource guides on Judaism I 've ever read .	1
I 've been interested in graphology for many years and have read many books on the subject , but `` Handwriting Analysis '' is the best one yet . It has a soft cover , but who cares ? It 's humorous and appealing and a very thorough look into the subconscious of an individual . I recommend it highly .	1

I am currently living in Italy and got this book so I could learn some Italian dishes . I made a traditional Italian dinner ( appetizer , first & amp ; second courses , salad , fruit and dessert ) using only recipes from this cookbook for me and my husband . We could not believe how delicious these dishes were . I did not tell my husband until AFTER he had eaten all the dishes that they were from a Weight Watchers cookbook . He had no idea ! ! I can not wait to try even more recipes from this cookbook and have my Italian neighbors taste them ! !	1
This is very good for its intended purpose - a basic overview of introductory psychology.It covers a wide range of topics including the following : The physical structure of the brain , the effect of genetics on the brain , human development , reinforcement/extinction , the senses , memory , motivation , normal/abnormal psychology basics , and psychotropic drugs.Within the parameters stated above , I would recommend this book .	1

If you are going to Walt Disney Word and looking for the book to cut through the publicity machine that Disney is , you will want this book . Its tone , can be skeptical ( some say cynical ) , and not always the Disney & quot ; cheerleading & quot ; guide that some purists insist only be written about Disney properties .

I have saved time and money , and always find this book to improve the quality of my trip . My three tips for YOU to make your WDW vacation the best ; 1 .

My husband had quadruple bypass in January of this year . I started looking for low fat-low cholesterol cookbooks ! I purchased this cookbook along with a few others , and this one is by far our favorite . The meals are fast , taste great , and use ingredients you usually have on hand . We have been cooking new recipes out of this book frequently and have n't found one that we did n't like . We bought the book as a gift for friends and they love it too . When we have people over for dinner , they do not even realize they are eating a healthy meal , as every recipe has great flavor . Definitely a star !	1
The Candidate ( Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy # 3 ) The Replacement ( Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy # 2 [ [ ASIN:0800759346 The Chase ( Jill Lewis Mystery Trilogy # 1 ) I have found this book to be invaluable in my search for a new agent , a publisher and how to query . Many writers make the mistake of launching out without knowledge of how to approach publishing houses or what they specialize in . This is a clear , consice book of how to presnt your manuscript to a market saturated with wonderful pennings of authors . If you are a serious Christian writer , then this book is a must get .	1
I bought this book soon after its release and read it . ( I was single and living in New England . ) Now in 2012 I found it on my bookshelf and decided to read it again , or toss it . ( Married 10 yrs , one son in school , and living in ` the OC ' ... So . CA . ) This book makes you think about alternatives . How you live , where you live , values , friends , finances , food and thoughts on parenting ... Even though many of the resources are outdated ( i.e.-websites , electronic gadgets , etc . ) , there is still plenty relevant food for thought . I used it this time as a workbook , by underlining and making notes . It gave me some insight on what I could do to do adjust my current life without having to move away to some isolated community with like-minded individuals . ( Even though for some this could be a great option . ) Bottom line : A useful read for anyone who would like to get out debt , explore a more intentional way of living , or just expose themselves to lifestyle options that could lead to more life choices .	1
First , let 's get one thing out of the way -- this book is NOT for complete idiots , or dummies , or Republican Jehovan telemarketers . It IS a simple yet intelligent guide to the craft of writing and marketing science fiction . Cory Doctorow , a former staff writer for the late , underrated Science Fiction Age magazine , uses simple , clear language to instruct Joe Writer-in-Training in the methods and manner of smart story construction , followed by comprehensive lists of agents and publishers.Highly recommended for the newbie who does n't want to hurt his brain on the complex `` craft-of-writing-sf '' books .	1
I had learned a lot about screenwriting once I had read the book . The book has lots of helpful tips in it for any aspiring screenwriter .	1
I love the Idot and Dummies series of books for making complicated subjects easier to understand , and this is no exception . If you hesitate to buy this book because you think it does n't have meat , you are mistaken . Not only does this ease you into the subject of Zen , it gives you the tools to start using Zen in your life right now . The book contains additional information on recommended books , internet links , etc . If you are new to Zen like me , this is a great place to start . You will not be dissapointed .	1
I 'm completely new to the world of writing poetry ; in fact , it 's one of those things I never thought I 'd be picking up a book for , let alone an Idiot 's guide . I 'd like to learn the basics because not only am I a big word nrrd whose idea of an exciting night in is hunkering down and learning what `` iambic pentameter '' really means , I know darn well that all those economy of words and lyrical language skills are really going to come in handy on the fiction writing tip , too . Overall , the other reviewers here are right on the money : this book does a great job of explaining the basics , is an excellent reference for all those poetry terms you never learned , and is packed with fun exercises that are sure to get you writing . I 've been very happy with this book -- I carry it around on the subway and whip it out when I have a free minute , and always have a good time when I do.However.There 's one thing that really sticks in my craw about this book , so much so that I 'm sitting down to type out this review . And that 's the unrelenting admonishments designed to steer us humble students in the direction of writing `` good '' poetry . I 'm thinking that anyone who is picking up a Complete Idiot 's Guide to Poetry has probably got a heck of a long way to go before their work is what you would consider `` good '' . I 'm also pretty confident that , for anyone picking up said Complete Idiot 's Guide , writing `` good '' poetry is probably a little further down the list of priorities , perhaps nestled somewhere between `` adapting all of MOBY DICK as a fixed-form ballad '' and `` writing `` Twas The Night Before Christmas 2 : Electric Boogaloo ' '' .One thing that really troubles me , here , is that the author never misses the opportunity to bring up the `` good poetry '' issue . Perhaps she 's just had to read a lot of bad poetry , in the course of teaching or editing literary journals or whatever , and is just plain sick of it . I can appreciate that . Here 's the thing , though : bad poetry is just a fact of life for beginning writers . And beginning writers , especially those who have been traumatized into not writing for one reason or another , do n't need yet another negative voice in their head to concern themselves with , no matter how well-meaning . They 've probably got images of their horrid seventh grade English teacher in there already , the one who humiliated them in front of the entire class or sucked all the joy out of putting words together . A concern for `` good '' too early in the game is misplaced , in my opinion , and I found all the comments on it to be condescending distractions that just served to get my dander up.All in all , this book is excellent , but gosh darn it all , it would have done well with a little less schoolmarming and a little more cuddling .	1
Nikki Moustaki , The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Writing Poetry ( Alpha , 2001 ) Some books ' titles just beg for bad reviews . And I admit , I took this out of the library expecting I 'd skim it quickly and give it the bad review it so richly deserved . I was somewhat surprised ( and , I admit , a little nonplussed ; sometimes you just need to give SOMETHING a bad review , no matter what it is ) to discover that The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Writing Poetry is actually a pretty decent stab at sticking a writing course between two covers . There are some pieces of text where I wanted to cringe ( the idea that line breaks are arbitrary , the idea that haiku is a 5-7-5 strict form ) , and a few that seem to contradict one another ( mostly having to do with meaning and message ) , but overall not a bad little book . Take it with a grain of salt , and question everything , but definitely recommended for aspiring poets who are sick of getting rejected whenever they submit something for publication . ***	1
I refer to this and use this as a piano teacher . Its like a dictionary for piano learning .	1
I bought this for a friend who knew nothing about football . Idiot 's Guides tend to be very good or very bad and this one definitely scored high ! This book is fast paced , interesting , and filled with knowledge . It is careful not to assume that you know anything about football , perfect for beginners , but is also entertaining enough for veterans . A really great overview of the game .	1

I am still in the process of reading this book . It is chock full of information and you ca n't sit down and read it in one sitting . It is a book that even when I am finished , I will come back to for more information . I do not like the title of & # 34 ; idiot 's & # 34 ; guide but I do like the simplicity of it . I would recommend this book despite the degrading title .	1
Do n't let the name fool you , this is a good book with lots of information on playing and etc . I really enjoyed it and I think anyone will . There is a lot of good stuff in this book and it is well worth the money . It covers a lot of ground and goes beyond just basics . Get it you 'll like !	1

This is one of the best feng shui books out there . If there is only one feng shui book to get , then I 'd recommend this one . And I 've read about 10 feng shui books so far , from flying star , to black hat , etc..I recently switched my bed from a position that indicated robbery and homosexualty to career success , and it seems to be working.Feng shui is much an art as it is a science though . You have to do some experimentation to see which method works best for you as there are several methods outlined in this book.The only downside to this book is that it is not comprehensive in terms of feng shui schools of thought - and in a sense no book really can be unless it is a ridiculously thick volume . Study many methods of feng shui - even non flying star methods as is advocated by books by Lillian Too for example as they contain methods that are useful - even if they are not necessarily traditional .	1
Anyone can get arrested-even by mistake . This book advises what to do in the critical initial hours . The authors remind us that we & quot ; have the right to remain silent ( Miranda Warning ) . They caution us not to volunteer any information or agree to a lesser charge . We have the right to & quot ; Due Process & quot ; ( 14th Amendment ) . They urge readers to & quot ; be a stand-up guy & quot ; : do not talk , request a trial and fight the charge . They advocate not being an easy case for the police.But what if you lose ? They describe the various prisons : the poor food , the constant noise , the physical dangers and the loss of hope . They provide a list of prison Dos & amp ; Don'ts.The book ends with a plea for change in the prison system.Glossary and Index.I found this book fascinating and fun to read.Dan Poynter , author , The Expert Witness Handbook , ParaPublishing.com .	1

This is a good introduction to economics . These ideas are made simple and understandable for virtually anyone . One should easily come away with a solid understanding of many economic concepts.There are a few problems with this book . One is a simple factual error ; two others are a bit more involved.On page 78 , the author claims that sales taxes are imposed by all states except New Hampshire . This is inaccurate . Other states that also do not impose a sales tax include Montana , Alaska , Oregon , and Delaware . Although this error is not critical to the main focus of the book , it does make one wonder what other mistakes are present.Another problem occurs on page 239 . In this case , the author makes the strange claim : `` The idea that everyone who wants a job should be able to get one is associated more with the liberal side of the political spectrum . '' A more accurate summary of the liberal position would be that anyone who does n't want a job should be entitled to be supported by the taxpayers in perpetuity.One other bizarre observation by Mr. Gorman is regarding 'partisan economists ' . The author criticizes these who are paid for 'objective analysis ' stating that they 'always find an argument in favor of their party 's program . 'Although that statement is probably accurate , he goes on to talk about 'academic economists who have no ideology or political paymasters ' . I 'm not sure what planet Mr. Gorman is living on , but his view of academics in the United States is either naive or intentionally deceptive . Virtually anyone who is lucid and has spent much time in a university setting in the USA is aware that most academics on the political science and economics faculties of most universities here are not only ideological , but are overwhelmingly leftist in the viewpoints . To say otherwise is absurd.Regardless of the weaknesses in the book cited above , this is pretty good for anyone wanting a good overall lesson in economics . However , I would recommend works by Henry Hazlitt and Thomas Sowell as being far more realistic .	1
I have several relatives who fought under Jackson and was a bit reluctant to read this book . Robertson is the premier historian of the Army of Northern Virginia and I thought this would be deification of Jackson . I was so wrong . Robertson has written THE definative work on Stonewall Jackson . Going back in his family history had my interest from the start.Robertson does a wonderful job of looking at Jackson-warts and all . He brings out all of Jackson and explains so many aspects of him and is certaintly not an apoligist . Without a doubt , Jackson was one of the most complex people to don an American uniform , next to Patton . When he was one his game he was briliant-such as The Valley Campaign , Second Bull Run or Chancellorsville . But When he was cold he was horrible-such was First Kernstown or the Pennicula Campaign . Robertson tells the story as it was , without excuses . If you want to really know the great Stonewall-read Robertsons book .	1
Many argue that Thomas Jonathan Jackson ranks as one the best soldiers in America . Certainly Jackson was one of the most dynamic , intelligent , and interesting officers of the Civil War . Known for discipline , poise , and religious faith , Jackson showcased remarkable traits that few officers possessed . With Jackson , men followed . He remains as one of the most well-known military figures this country has ever produced.What makes Robertson 's study of Jackson unique and credible to other biographies is its attention to detail and Jackson 's life before the Civil War . Too often , Civil War biographies focus too much on the subject 's military career rather than the social and personal apsects which shaped the subject 's character . In the case of Jackson , Robertson illustrates that his past shaped the man we now know on the battlefield . Robertson 's insight teaches us that his upbringing in West Virginia and his education at West Point forced Jackson to discipline himself in order to be the best.Finally , Robertson 's biography will not be the last on Jackson . But it certainly may be the best tribute to one of America 's best soldiers .	1

The Encyclopaedia Judaica is a 22-volume English-language encyclopedia of the Jewish people , their faith , Judaism , History and Culture . It 's a cumulative result of over three decades of prodigious study and research by about 2,200 contributors and 250 editors around the world and includes approximately 21,000 entries with 2,700 new entries by 1,200 new contributors . Its Scholarship , comprehensive scope , authority , and widespread availability make it a great first and often indispensable resource for Rabbis , Scholars , Academics and laypeople.Three valid critiques of the new edition are 1.Prominent scholars decry the wholesale reprinting of many outdated entries ; Current scholarship is shortchanged . 2 . Minor and marginal Jewish figures and events , are still included , while major figures and movements are absent or minimized . 3 . A difference between the first edition of the 72 ' Encyclopaedia Judaica and the second edition of the New Encyclopaedia Judaica is the paucity of visual images though the new editions are in color.Nevertheless , it is recommended by the Library of Congress and by the Association of Jewish Libraries for use in determining the authoritative romanization of names of Jewish authors . Furthermore it 's guidelines for transliterating Hebrew into English are followed by many academic books and journals . Additionally there are many improvements such a separate category of Jewish Law , reducing Legendary material , the inclusion of Scholem 's classic essay on Kabbalah , greater material on Hasidim and many new findings in Archeology , Israel and Post-Holocaust material , etc . In sum , it is an indispensable reference purchase for Universities , colleges , seminaries , Libraries and all who care about Modern Judaic scholarship . Highly Recommended and remains indispensable .	1
This book , along with Crime Classification Manual , is essential reading for an understanding of serial-killer behavior and detection . Douglas and Ressler are considered the fathers of modern profiling , and this book gives readers the nuts and bolts of their method . While not as entertaining as their more popular books ( Mind Hunter , Whoever Fights Monsters ) , this book is a must-have for readers want to know how real serial offenders think and operate .	1

Unpreparedness is a major theme in American military history . In his popular and unsympathetic view of America 's involvement in Korea , T.R . Fehrenbach argues that the American armed forces were psychologically unprepared for the type of limited war that took place in Korea ( `` this kind of war '' ) . The author questions whether the citizen-soldier and the society from which it breeds were willing to fight and die for an intangible foreign policy in Asia . Originally published two years before a full American commitment in Vietnam ( 1963 ) , the author warns that this type of conflict will become the rule rather than the exception and America had better train a professional force both physically and mentally to deal with such future conflicts . Fehrenbach 's reporting contains many lessons learned and leadership analysis which appeals more to current active duty military personnel . Fehrenbach 's book is considered a classic , and is listed on many of the professional military reading lists . Fehrenbach 's strengths lie in his combat narrative , particularly at the small unit level , however , when the author attempts to place the conflict in its overall political perspective , he falls short . Many paragraphs contain merely two or three sentences , that for this reviewer , made this book a chore to read in places . In this regard , Fehrenbach trails behind other authors on the subject such as Roy Appleman , and a recently published series edited by Allan R. Millett . Having himself commanded units at platoon , company , and battalion level in Korea , Fehrenbach is direct and pulls no punches . In contrast to those who argue that Korea was a success in that the United States accomplished its mission of re-establishing the Republic of South Korea , Fehrenbach holds the war was a stalemate resembling trench warfare on the Western Front from 1914-1918 . Although stating that his evidence is compiled from many sources : official records , operations journals , memoirs , newspapers , and oral histories , the reprinted edition reviewed here contained no notes or bibliography : inexcusable for a work of history ! The author is adamant in his conclusion : `` A nation that does not prepare for all the forms of war should then renounce the use of war in national policy . '' He adds : `` A people [ America ] that does not prepare to fight should then be morally prepared to surrender . To fail to prepare soldiers and citizens for limited , bloody ground action , and then to engage in it , is folly verging on the criminal . '' I 've read better books , but this one deserves checking out for the author 's uncanny foresight and solid analysis .	1
A critical look at the Koran war that puts you right in the mountains with the cold , scared soldiers and Marines . The book , however also documents the poor decisions and incompetence on the part of the nation and some senior officers that unquestionably prolonged the war and cost the blood of the protagonists .

Finite and Infinite Games : A vision of life as play and possibility ; James P. Carse , The Free Press , 1986I recovered this book after many years on loan and realized I must not have read it before it was lent . Whiz bang wonderful is what it is , and way deep . As Robert M. Pirsig ( Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ) said about this book , `` Normally we add new facts to existing knowledge . But once in a while a book like this comes along and does just the opposite -- it adds a new pattern of knowledge to existing facts . The result is striking . Old dull things you 've known for years suddenly stand up in a whole new dimension . '' Yo Bob ! Carse builds his case point by point , a view of the world in terms of games . Most games are played to win but there is a type of game in which the goal is simply to continue play . Games played toward winning require closure : an end in which winner and losers are identified . Infinite games are not closed either by time or space , and infinite games may encompass many finite games ; indeed , all finite games . There are no winners in infinite games , only players . Wonderful . Wonderful . Full .	1
This book is provocative and persuasively written . D'Souza carefully examines racism with a sober approach supporting and refuting positions with remarkable scholarship and revealing anecdotes . At times D'Souza 's analysis is far too laborious than the subject matter deserves but you appreciate his sincere effort in making sense out of all the related issues.This work is more than just a rendering of the role of race in America . It 's a remarkable analysis of the philosophical foundations of Western society and how it corresponds with the liberal notions of proportional representation , cultural relativism and multiculturalism . D'Souza 's painstaking study examines the historical and cultural roots of these ideologies and what the consequences have been for African-Americans and for America as it fulfills the vision of its creed : 'all men are created equal'.This book is a must read for anyone who thinks about race in America .	1
In the opening and closing chapters , Edgerton makes it clear that he rejects a central tenet of cultural relativism which states that all aspects of a culture are necessarily 'adaptive ' and therefore beyond criticism by any other culture 's system of beliefs . He then fills the intervening chapters with example after example of practices from every corner of the globe that , if not to the detriment of the health and well-being of many or most members of the culture , are at least without apparent benefit , including : human sacrifice and environmental destruction among native Central and South American tribes , institutionalized gang rape among Papua New Guinean cannibals , sanctioned indolence among Tazmanian men and female genital mutilation in Africa . It would be difficult for a die-hard cultural relativist to explain the 'adaptive ' value of say , footbinding , epidemic alcoholism or spousal abuse , which is Edgerton 's point exactly . Those who are inclined to reflexively call the author racist should note that even modern American and European cultures , with their widespread belief in astrology and tendency to wildly misestimate certain health and environmental risks , do n't escape his focus.Though the main body is short ( a little over 200 pages ) and easy to read , the text quickly begins to feel like an extended laundry list , which I suppose makes it an excellent reference for shattering the politically correct myth of social and environmental harmony among non-Western cultures . Even the bibliography , which runs 40 pages , though now a little out of date , is a goldmine .	1
The Enlightenment view of history is the triumph of the rule of Reason , which operates in the realm of ideas . Hegel produced a dynamic and material version of Enlightenment history by stressing the dialectic between ideas and materiality , whereby each stage in the development of Reason is instantiated and codified in a concrete social formation in which the reigning ideal Zeitgeist is the motive force driving history forward . Marx accepted Hegel 's view of history ( actually he `` turned Hegel on his head , '' but Hegel upside down is still just Hegel ) , and located the motive force in class struggle . Many European intellectuals saw clearly that Marx 's communism was just one peculiar moment in the general move from autocracy to democracy , by which they meant not a schema of majority rule and political freedom , but rather rule by and for the masses . This was the end of history.Nietzsche saw and lamented this turn of history in Marx 's time , and Heidegger and many others followed in Nietzsche 's path in the twentieth century . Others , like the brilliant Russian-French philosopher Alexandre Koj & egrave ; ve , saw clearly and triumphantly that Marx was indeed a footnote to Hegel , and in the long run the end of history would culminate in a general emancipation of the masses.Fukuyama is a student and admirer of Koj & egrave ; ve . The collapse of the Soviet Union became for him the occasion for writing this energetic and apocalyptic defense of modern liberal democratic capitalism , as well as some warnings concerning the implication of the ` end of history . ' The collapse of the Soviet empire , the transformation of Chinese Communism into a capitalist system with an authoritarian state , the withering away of socialist and trade union forces in Europe and America , and the success of Pacific Basin capitalism all solidified liberal democratic capitalism as they only viable emancipatory wealth-generating social form . Fukuyama carries this train of thought deep into the future by claiming that modern technology is uniquely suited for liberal democracy , obviating any possibility of an alternative system arising in the foreseeable future . He recognizes that there will be all sorts of rear-guard actions , such as unstable dictatorships backed by military force and religious ideology , but these must eventually give way to liberal democracy.The cautionary dimension in Fukuyama 's argument is indicated by the `` Last Man '' notion present in the book 's title . Fukuyama is sympathetic to the Nietzsche-Heidegger argument that true individuality and creativity is incompatible with mass democracy . Here Fukuyama expresses a key worry of mid-twentieth century American intellectuals , such as Daniel Bell ( The End of Ideology , 1960 ) , Sloan Wilson ( The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit ) , and Herbert Marcuse ( One-Dimensional Man ) , who were reviled by the shallowness and vapidity of popular culture , and longed for a return to the high culture of Voltaire 's salon and the Wiener Kreis coffeehouse ruminations.I often find Fukuyama a pedestrian writer , but this book is inspired , and Fukuyama 's energy spills out onto the pages in into the reader 's heart . I would love it if his argument about liberal democracy were correct , although I do n't believe the one-dimensional man argument at all . However , there is one major and one minor problem with his analysis . The minor problem is that technological change in the future could either destroy civilization altogether or render capitalism anachronistic for one reason or another ( e.g. , intelligent robots take over the role of innovation and entrepreneurship , or people tire of more and more material goods ) . This possibility is remote at the present time , of course.The major problem is simply that Hegel 's theory of history is only a half-truth , and a misplaced half-truth at that . History is indeed an interplay between human aspirations and human technology , but human aspirations are not based on Reason but rather upon a human nature that is the product of gene-culture coevolution , and as such , is imbued with certain preternatural values . Most important is that humans desire freedom , dignity , and the capacity to control their social world through association with others as co-equals . To appreciate the centrality of evolved human nature , suppose some termite species ( order isoptera ) had evolved large brains and complex societies as opposed to Homo sapiens ( subtribe Hominina ) . Termite nature being inherently eusocial and hierarchical , the ideal yearnings of the mass of intelligent termites would include no element of social equality , personal dignity , or self-determination , but would likely center around the sublimely harmonious and completely ordered group mind and flawless bureaucratic structure . `` Reason , '' Hume once famously noted , `` is , and ought only to be the slave of the passions . '' It is the human passion for freedom and dignity that determines the thrust of emancipatory history , not the dictates of abstract Reason.I do not consider this a major problem with Fukuyama 's argument . Evolutionary biology gives the truth to Hegel , but this turning of Hegel on his head is no more revolutionary that Marx 's , although obviously more descriptive of human reality ( E. O. Wilson , when induced to read Marx to help understand the Marxist hostility to sociobiology , wrote in the margin of the Communist Manifesto `` terrific theory , wrong species '' ) . Much more important is that human technology , rather than being an unambiguous emancipatory force , is a seriously two-edged sword , in some eras liberating , and others enslaving , the human passions . Let me explain.It is well known that the hunter-gatherer societies that defined human existence until some 10,000 years ago were extremely egalitarian , involving widespread sharing both communal child rearing ( Sarah Blaffer Hrdy , Mother Nature : Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species , Ballantine , 2000 ; and Mothers and Others : The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding , Belknap , 2009 ) and hunting ( Christopher Boehm , Hierarchy in the Forest : The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior , Harvard University Press , 2000 ; and Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis , A Cooperative Species : Human Reciprocity and its Evolution ( Princeton University Press , 2011 ) . It is the human nature that emerged from this nexus of social institutions that defines contemporary human passions for emancipatory social institutions , of which liberal democratic capitalism is the contemporary most advanced form.Why did hominids develop egalitarian societies while the other social primates , especially chimpanzees , gorillas , and bonobos retained hierarchical political structures based on personal power ( bonobos appears to have a less linear hierarchy that the other social primates , but there is still a hierarchy based on physical strength of males and the coalitional capacities of females ) ? The answer is probably technological . Hominids developed lethal weapons at least 400,000 years ago , in the Middle Pleistocene ( Harmut Thieme , `` Lower Palaeolithic Hunting Spears from Germany '' , Nature 385,27 ( 1997 ) :807-810 ) . Most important were sharpened wooden thrusting and throwing spears developed for hunting , but quite effective in killing or maiming the strongest male while asleep or otherwise inattentive . Because of these lethal weapons , there was no possibility of maintaining a political hierarchy based on physical prowess alone . By contrast , non-human primates never developed weapons capable of controlling a dominant male . Even when sound asleep , an accosted male reacts to hostile onslaughts by awakening and engaging in a physical battle , basically unharmed by surprise attack.The reaction of hominid political structure to the emergence of lethal weapons was , logically , either to sustain leaderless social coalitions , or to find some other basis for leadership . The superior survival value of groups with leadership doubtless led to the demise of leaderless hominid social formations , and the consolidation of new hominid social relations based on novel forms of leadership . What might these may be ? Clearly , if on can not lead by force , one must lead by persuasion . Thus successful hominid social bands came to value individuals who could command prestige by virtue of their persuasive capacities . Persuasion depends on clear logic , analytical abilities , a high degree of social cognition ( knowing how to form coalitions and curry the favor of others ) , and linguistic facility . For this reason , the social structure of hunter-gatherer life favored progressive encephalization and the evolution of the physical and mental prerequisites of effective linguistic and facial communication . In short , 400,000 years of evolution in the presence of lethal weapons gave rise to Homo sapiens.If this argument is correct , it explains the huge cognitive and linguistic advantage of humans over other species not as some quirk of sexual selection ( the favorite theory through the ages of Charles Darwin , Ronald Fisher , Geoffrey Miller and many others ) , but rather as directly fitness enhancing , despite the extreme energy costs of the brain : increased cognitive and linguistic ability entailed heightened leadership capacities , which fellow group members were very willing to trade for enhanced mating and provisioning privileges.With the development of settled trade , agriculture , and private property some 10,000 years ago , it became possible for a Big Man to gather around him a relatively small group of subordinates and consorts that would protect him from the lethal revenge of a dominated populace , whence the slow and virtually inexorable rise of the state both as a instrument for exploiting direct produces and for protecting them against the exploitation of external states and bands of private and semi-state-sanctioned marauders . The hegemonic aspirations of states peaked in the thirteenth century , only be driven back by the serious of European population-decimating plagues of the fourteenth century . The period of state consolidation resumed in the fifteenth century , based on a new technology : the heavily armed cavalry . In this case , as in some other prominent cases , technology becomes the handmaiden to oppression rather than emancipation.In Politics VII , Aristotle writes `` there are four kinds of military forces -- -the cavalry , the heavy infantry , the light armed troops , the navy . When the country is adapted for cavalry , then a strong oligarchy is likely to be established [ because ] only rich men can afford to keep horses . The second form of oligarchy prevails when the country is adapted to heavy infantry ; for this service is better suited to the rich than to the poor . But the light-armed and the naval elements are wholly democratic ... An oligarchy which raises such a force out of the lower classes raises a power against itself . `` The use of cavalry became dominant in Europe through the success of the Parthians in the Roman-Persian wars that lasted from the late Hellenistic period until the Middle Ages . The Romans armored infantry could not stand up to the Parthian cavalry and the Romans adjusted by adopting the practices of their enemies . The increased strategic role of cavalry was enhanced by the emergence of new breeds of horses engineered for the battlefield , and deployed adeptly by the Germanic invaders and the Islamic warriors . From this , enhanced by the development of the wraparound saddle , stirrup , and spurs , the preeminence of cavalry in the Middle Ages was assured , whence the oligarchic character of European feudalism , which centered around a knightly cavalry.The history of warfare from the Late Middle Ages to the First World War was the saga of the gradual increase in the strategic military value of infantry armed with longbow , crossbow , hand cannon , and pike , which marked the recurring victories of the English and Swiss over French and Spanish cavalry in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries . Cavalries responded by developing dismounted tactics when encountering infantry , using heavy hand weapons such as two-handed swords and poleaxes . These practices extended the viability of cavalry to the sixteenth century in the French and Spanish armies , but gradually through the Renaissance , and with the rise of Atlantic trade , the feudal knightly warlords gave way to the urban landed aristocracy and warfare turned to the interplay of mercenary armies consisting of unskilled foot soldiers wielding cannon and other weapons based on gunpowder . Cavalry remained important in this era , but even in the eighteenth and nineteenth century , cavalry was used to execute the coup de grace on seriously weakened infantry.The true hegemony of the foot soldier , and hence the origins of modern democracy , began with the perfection of the hand gun , with its improved accuracy and greater firing rate than the pistols of a previous era . Until that point , infantry was highly vulnerable to attack from heavy artillery . By the early twentieth century , the superiority of unskilled foot soldiers armed with rifles was assured . World War I opened in 1914 with substantial cavalry on all sides , but mounted troops were soundly defeated by men with rifles and machine guns , and thus were abandoned in later stages of the war . As Samuel Bowles and I showed in Democracy and Capitalism ( Basic Books , 1985 ) , the strength of the political forces agitating for political democracy in Twentieth Century Europe was predicated on the strategic role of the foot soldier in waging war and defending the peace.It is clear today that the material basis for liberal democracy is no longer the armed infantry but rather a combination of the willingness of ordinary people to rise up , fight , and die for freedom , together with modern communications and transport technologies that are virtually impossible to suppress , especially if authoritarian states have an interest in promoting economic development . Fukuyama is wholly correct on this point . An oil-rich outlier state like Saudi Arabia is not constrained by goals of economic development , but their security extends only as far as oil remains in high demand , which will not be for long . For the most part , modern technology is highly emancipatory.Where his wrong , however , is in not contemplating the possibility of new technologies capable of controlling masses of people by a powerful few , as envisioned by the apocalyptic anti-Communist writers Aldous Huxley ( Brave New World ) , 1984 ( George Orwell ) , Darkness at Noon ( Arthur Koestler ) , and cinematographers like Jean-Luc Godard ( Alphaville ) . The totalitarian ambitions of the Soviet state foundered on the new technologies that were too synergistic with modern industrial life and private incentives , but there is no reason that a progressive economic system like that of the Chinese might not find new technological means of controlling masses of affluent workers and even middle-class entrepreneurs over the long run . There is no extant technology that would facilitate this control , and those of us who value freedom and democracy must struggle to promote emancipatory over enslaving technologies in coming decades . Even should we survive nuclear Armageddon , global warming , and other byproducts of emancipatory , it is not at all the `` end of history . ''	1
Fukuyama 's style in discussing the history of man is captured by the following paragraph extracted from his book : '' An American politician could harbor ambitions to be a Caesar or a Napoleon , but the system would allow him or her to be no more than a Jimmy Carter or a Ronald Reagan - hemmed in by powerful institutional constraints and political forces on all sides , and forced to realize their ambitions by being the people 's `` servant '' rather than their master . `` He describes his concept of the `` last man '' with this paragraph : '' Nietzsche 's last man was , in essence , the victorious slave . He agreed fully with Hegel that Christianity was a slave ideology , and that democracy represented a secular form of Christianity.In the ultimate society , he uses the analogy of a dog to describe his last man 's outlook , '' A dog is content to sleep in the sun all day provided he is fed , because he is not dissatisfied by what he is . He does not worry that other dogs are doing better than him , or that his career as a dog has stagnated , or that dogs are being oppressed in distant parts of the world . If man reaches a society in which he has succeeded in abolishing injustice , his life will come to resemble that of the dog . `` As is clear from the above , the book is well written and full of thoughtful insights .	1
Good book . I recommend . It is interesting to notice that the author himself consistently falls prey of the fallibility he so cleverly brings to our attention . He interprets many things according to his needs . Many things could be said about they way he criticizes those who oppose the `` germ theory '' , holisticmedicine , etc . He tends to imply that `` holistic '' is the sameas `` quackery '' . Of course , quackery is quackery , no matter what a quack calls his `` medicine '' , be it `` holistic '' , be it `` orthodox '' , be it whatever you chose . At least what I know about `` holistic '' medicine has nothing to do with quackery and nothing to do with Gilovich 's description . The same thing can be said about his condemnation of those who oppose to the `` germ theory '' that is dominant since Pasteur . As far as I know real doctors who oppose it do not say germs are not important factor . What they say is that germ is only ONE factor and very often not the most important one . That explains why you can subject hundreds of people to the same germ and most of the time only a few will get sick.In page 6 he refers to Rhea Sullins . Her father may have killed her , as the author implies . Nevertheless , this is far from certain based on what he says . Would she be cured using conventional medicine ? Did her father use a proper natural medicine ? Statistically , is her case important ? He mentions a single occurrence of a victim and a perpetrator and expects us to believe this is enough to prove `` Natural hygiene '' is bad or that hygienists are all dumb and irresponsible.When he goes to Homeopathy he applies every single technique he denounces in others . He implies homeopathy is quackery and has no scientific soundness . Far from this . Homeopathy does not pretend to understand why it works . Nobody knows . But it follows the same scientific methodology other sciences follow . Like the so much beloved `` double blind '' , for instance . Also , homeopathy practioners tend to make much better prognosis then orthodox medicine , like the course of a remission . With very objective measures , like changes in body temperature , weight modification , skin alterations etc . Also , homeopathy is used in animals with great success . And in emergency rooms too . Also -- in Brazil at least -- in order to practice homeopathy a person must first go to a regular medicine school for about 6 years . After that 3 years more are needed to become an homeopathist . It is hard to believe a homeopathist is less educated and trained than a `` regular '' doctor . The reverse seems to be true.By the way , I have no affiliation whatsoever with Homeopathy . I am among those ( also more or less rediculed by Gilovich ) who believe our health should be in our own hands , doctors being only helpers . So I try to understand what we should expect from our mind and body ( not two separate entities ) , from our food , from the doctors and from the drugs ( in this order of precedence ) .The final chapters are a little boring . It seems the author wanted to put as many things in as few pages as possible in order to support his views . It is quite miscellaneous and clearly shows the author has an axe to grind.Again , this is a good book that deserves to be read . The fact that the author is himself victim of the failures he sees so clearly in our reasoning does not belittle his work .	1
I first stumbled across this book in 1994 , and it has remained one of my favourites ever since . It is clear , fairly short , filled with examples that are backed by supporting evidence from research , and it is excellently organized . Because it describes systematic reasoning errors all of us make , this book should have universal appeal . Unfortunately , its readership seems to have been limited to skeptics , students , academics , and a small group of other people who have been lucky enough to happen upon it.I 'd recommend potential readers use Amazon 's `` look inside the book '' function to browse the table of contents . What you will see is that the book is divided into three sections each containing three chapters . The first two sections outline why people make fallible decisions and why we wrongly believe things to be true that are n't . The final section looks at applied examples of judgment biases and faulty reasoning leading to erroneous beliefs.15 years since it was first published the book has hardly dated . As a psychology academic , I could point to more , and more recent , research that supports Gilovich 's main points , but I can point to almost nothing that contradicts him.There are several other books that people wanting to free their thinking from errors should read in addition to this one . Gilovich 's more recent book `` Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes And How To Correct Them `` is again excellent , and covers a lot of errors in everyday financial decision-making . I 'd also recommend Jaime Whyte 's `` Crimes Against Logic '' and David Myers 's `` Intuition '' , and Dan Gilbert 's `` Stumbling on Happiness '' as good starting points in examining the limits of human reasoning .	1
What 's wrong with a few questionable beliefs ? You sold me in the introduction with the rhinoceros and black bear.This is a fascinating book with a lot to teach about disastrous reasoning . I have been guilty many times in my life of knowing what is n't so . This book provided important insights into why I have exercised poor judgment in the past having thought all the angles were covered . This is a very relevant book for those in management . If you want to improve your skills , I would put this book on the top ten lists . While not a management tome per se , it is actually much more useful than 90 % of the current management books on the market . Back by solid science from cognitive and social psychologists it provides ample ammunition for those knuckleheads that need to be convinced that their instincts are often wrong.As a management consultant with a focus in leadership , I found this book to be a wealth of useful information . Adding Gilovich 's insights into my leadership classes has enhanced and deepened the training.I hope you find this review helpful.Michael L. Gooch , SPHR - Author of Wingtips with Spurs	1
This book has stirred up controversy because we live in a time where political correctness has shifted way too far from common sense . I 'm tired of people saying statistics can be manipulated any way you want to . That is an ignorant observation . Facts are facts and if research is done carefully and logically , then the results can not be disputed . This book plainly shows tireless research and an impressive accumulation of information . But what can we draw from the findings ? To say that all Asians are smarter than Whites and all Whites are smarter than Blacks is ridiculous and certainly not the direction of this book . What is laid plain is on the whole Asians score a little higher than Whites on IQ tests and Whites score a little higher than Blacks . Raw intelligence is certainly a desirable human trait and plays an important role in how a person develops in life . However , other factors such as motivation , environment , parenting , etc . also are critical in shaping people . Simply said , the more positive aspects of these traits you have going for you , the better your chance is for succeeding above others . The question of why is there a racial division in intelligence can be answered by looking at history . When you look back in time as to where various groups and societies stood in terms of discovery , inventions , education , and other noble human endeavors , it 's plain to see that being a member of the groups that had advanced farther than others would tend to predispose you towards having higher intelligence , especially since intelligence tends to be hereditary . I believe this whole common sense observation was what The Bell Curve was trying to get across to us .	1
Aggressively controversial and now something of a classic , this book has aged well . Landsburg delights in winding his readers up , but the writing is a lot of fun , the analysis is always sharp , and the book is strongly recommended . Economists will look at their subject differently after finishing it , I suspect . My only reservation : David Friedman 's `` Hidden Order '' covers a lot of the same ground , and is perhaps even better .	1
I own a 6-person research and consulting firm . I was just turned onto Maister after 7 years in business ... man , I wish I 'd read this book sooner ! First , Maister 's style . I like authors who know what they 're talking about and who share it with you in an easy-to-read style . Check.Then , the content . I want take-home value . Maister offers quizes , self-assessments and checklists that my team and I have used to further drive profitability and performance . Check.Next , I want to read an author who shares my values : that work should be fun , rewarding , and engaging for employees at all levels . Check.Finally , the book is backed up with an online archive of articles and insight that Maister has developed over his career in the professionals services industry . ( [ ... ] ) Maister has been a mentor to my young company , and we 'll be rewarded for our diligence in using his tools and plumbing his insights .	1
I 've read a lot of books on leadership , management and selling - this is one of a select few that I find myself referring back to frequently since I first read it 5 years ago . I just logged on to buy a new copy - I 've loaned out my old one again and forget who has it . The chapters on selling professional services are particularly strong , because Maister recommends dignified , professional approaches to client development . I personally practice ideas like 'marketing from the inside ' and it 's helped me help a lot of people - and make a lot of money in the process .	1
This is an excellent book . It helped me to understand my BPD behavior much better , and also to understand how I got that way . I wish I had been diagnosed twenty years ago . I was misdiagnosed with depression , bipolar , panic , etc . Knowing that I did not really fit those categories , I stopped medication for several years . I coped by using nutrition and solitude . But as soon as I was around people , my behavior would come out again . That was the key that no doctor ever looked at : I 'm only crazy when there is someone there . Someone to cling to , manipulate , and feel abandoned by or attacked by or criticized by . My illness is a lot like the three-year-old who stops their tantrum when there is no one listening or watching . Now , with a diagnosis and study , I can use medication , nutrition , and counseling to cope with this illness and deal with people much more calmly and sanely . Sorry , I have not said much about the book . Well , this is the book that explained the illness better than anything else I read on the topic .	1
it turns out there is a lot more than martin luther king and the NAACP . this book will tell who were the backbone of the civil rights movement	1
For years , Richard Neustadt and Ernest May taught a course in Decision Making at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard . It must have been one heck of a course.The subtitle of this book is `` The Uses of History for Decision-Makers . '' That could actually be broadened a bit to something like `` The Uses of Precedents and Analogies for Decision-Makers . `` Remember when we were debating going to war in Iraq ? How many times did you hear the precedent of Viet Nam invoked ? And , if you 're old enough , remember Viet Nam ? How many times did you hear about Munich ? How many times in business have you heard a colleague invoke a historical precedent to justify a particular course of action ? We use historical precedents and analogies all the time . Most of the time we use them as if history repeats itself . It doesn't.Mark Twain 's aphorism captures best what really happens . `` History does not repeat , but it does rhyme . '' This book will give you tools that you can use to sort out what 's the same ( the rhymes ) and what 's different and then use your analysis to make better decisions.The authors introduce you to methods that will help you sort things out in all kinds of different situations . They teach you about separating `` facts '' into known , unknown , and presumed . They discuss analyzing precedents that you 're about to base a decision on in terms of likes and differences from the current situation.By itself , no individual idea or tool is unique . None of this is rocket science . But the authors give you a systematic application of common sense and proven techniques . That system gives you power.There are lots of little `` sidebar '' points as well . For example , there 's the Goldberg Rule.That rule tells you not to ask , `` What 's the problem ? '' Instead ask , `` What 's the story ? '' I picked up that technique from this book when I first read it years ago and I 've used it ever since in my consulting work and research . Try it . You 'll like it.There 's also Dr. Alexander 's question , which : `` What fresh facts , if at hand , by when , would cause you to change your presumption ? '' Instead of presumption , you can insert direction , or recommendation . This simple question forces decision-makers in a group to look at underlying assumptions and to look at when those assumptions need to be changed . It , too , is simple and powerful.The techniques in this book will definitely help you sharpen your decision-making skills . But there 's an added benefit for you if you 're a history buff . You 'll enjoy the anecdotes and analysis of historical events , such as The Bay of Pigs , where one of the authors was an advisor.There are a lot of books on decision-making . This is the only one I 'm aware of that deals clearly and systematically with the use of precedent and historical analogy .	1
Neustadt offers a view of presidential power . One that stresses the many informal resources that are at the disposal of each President . What each of these resources has in common is that they are best used to persuade others to follow the President 's wishes . The President must persuade because they do not have many formal powers to require other actors to do what they want in very specific instances . Rather , the can reward these individuals for acting in a way that they favor , but they must rely upon informal tools to accomplish these goals . Rewards such as a ride on Air Force One or Presidential Box Seats at a National 's game can be used as rewards to persuade other actors to follow the President . Neustadt presents this information in a way that is both accessible and scholarly , but not too intellectually relaxed as not to be useful for political scientists . Great example of a scholarly book being useful .	1
The book arrived promptly , in perfect condition , and well packaged.Also , it is a very good book , just what I wanted . There is so much less information available about the Pacific war when compared with the European that I wanted just such an overall view.I 'd also highly recommendDownfall : The End of the Imperial Japanese Empirewhich concentrates on the ending of the war .	1
If you need a good belly laugh for your health this is the author to be reading . Love his books .	1
Nicely written textbook for the first year student in astronomy and astrophysics . Clearly written .	1
Regrettably out of print , Craig Thomas 's FIREFOX is an expertly-crafted military thriller that once begun is nearly impossible to set aside . The author creates a realistic Cold War atmosphere even as the eponymous MiG-31 Firefox pushes the envelope and infuses the story with an intensity and excitement rarely achieved . Nearly as interesting as the protagonist 's bid to fly the Soviet Union 's prize superfighter right out from under their noses is his struggle with his inner demons , a bitter duel whose outcome is open to doubt -- like his near-suicide mission itself -- up to the very last breathtaking page . Spawned the somewhat underrated motion picture starring a well-cast Clint Eastwood in the hero 's role which is worth seeing on its own merits , but the book , as is so often the case , remains the frontrunner . Surely the novel will be re-issued sometime soon , but if not then I heartily recommend any used copy you can get ahold of . For breakneck thrills and aerial pyrotechnics , FIREFOX is a rarely equalled winner .	1
Parts were interesting , but other parts boring due to excessive documentation and background . I enjoy the first person perspective , and there was n't enough of that .	1
I am using this book in History of Mathematical Ideas course from math department . The book starts with ancient number system in different cultures and advances chronologically . It is fairly narrative , but is classic textbook for math history class.My copy arrived much earlier than expected and it was almost new copy . I am happy with this purchase .	1
wiesel writes a mean memoir ... but his experiences , as opposed to his literary technique are his real , dare i say , `` gift . '' i was surprised at how straight faced and unmoved i was while reading this novella . he uses punctuation to make up for his lackluster prose ( e.g. , `` dead babies ! `` ) .it is so difficult for me to come down on wiesel because he has been such an outstanding spokesperson for human rights ( bosnia , iraq , darfur ) . his experience during the holocaust and his unshattered will are tragic and inspiring ... but as a writer ? im not sure what to say . and as the title says , the theme of `` night '' is underdeveloped and i am still not quite sure why he chose it.you would expect such a memoir to move you , to crush your optimistic views on humanity , but really , growing up in the late 20th century and thus being exposed to the horrors of the holocaust ad nauseum , this novel was just sort of a first hand distillation of what my generation has been told/shown a hundred times over . i understand that it was originally published in 1955 , but its oprah-book-club-resurgence needs to be spat upon . in the present day realm of holocaust literature , `` night '' does not take the cake.i gave it 4 stars because at 126 pages , everyone should read it . skip an episode of america 's next top model and youre done . but i cant help but acknowledge that there is a reason wiesel was given the nobel peace prize , as opposed to the nobel prize for literature .	1
I 'm making this review short and simple . NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is a horrifying book based on the author 's survival of the Holocaust . The book explains the terrible conditions of the concentration camp at Aushwitz and how his family and millions of other Jews died scarcely by the Germans during the terrible time . The book is absolutely astounding ! A must-read for any great literary fanatic !	1
I saw the book listed on Oprah 's list while searching for something my wife might like . After reading a short summary , I really did n't think she would like this book . To dark and full of history that I was sure she could n't handle ( my wife unfortunately does n't know much about history ) . I ordered it anyway ( the audio version , we both drive a lot ) and figured if she does n't like it that 's ok , she can move on to another book . Myself , I love history . And I truly remember everything we learned in school about the holocaust , as well as watching shows on the history channel . Of course , when I was young I read `` The Diary of Anne Frank '' . It had been a very long time since I re-visited this topic . She loved it . I loved it . She learned . I learned . She cried . I cried . Elie Wiesel did a great job with this book . The audio version used Jeffrey Rosenberg to narrate . He did a most excellent job !	1
`` Night '' is the remarkable work of Elie Wiesel that gained him notoriety as a writer and caused him to win the Noble Peace Prize in 1986 . Originally , the book had difficulty finding a pulisher as it was found to be too depressing . Depressing as it may be , there is nothing about the Holocaust that is not depressing . It is reality.In `` Night '' , Wiesel recalls the numerous locations that he endured as a Jew in World War II Europe . After being forced from his home to the ghetto , he was transferred to several different concentration camps . It was at the first camp that he saw his mother and sister for the last time . However , he was able to stay with his father through most of his relocation . His father only passed away near the end of the war , just a short period before the Jews were liberated.What strikes me about `` Night '' is the stark , cold reality presented by Wiesel . I could almost feel that cold with Wiesel as he shivers through the cold night . The physical and mental pain he felt was authentic , though he grew calloused as time passed . The emotions expressed by Wiesel are also very authentic . Even to this day , he still feels abandoned by God . How could an all powerful God allow this to happen to his people ? While it is difficult for me to empathize with his anger toward God , I can certainly understand his rationale .	1
The horrors of the Holocaust are gone , thankfully , but they can not be forgotten , especially with the scourge of some current events . Elie has done well by writing about the horrors- the evil doctor who decided who got burned up , the fights for food , the executions that the Jews were forced to watch , and most tragically , the death of Elie 's father-which he missed because they took him away . It chills you to the bone , but you must read it ; the horrors of the Holocaust can not be forgotten .	1
This man is one of the greatest role-models of our time and his book is a fascinating unforgettable un-put-down-able read . Here 's the history you did n't get in school . Strength , courage , wisdom , ethics - this man has them like no other politician today .	1
The name James M. Cain never registered on my radar , although I was already familiar with some of his work : & # 34 ; The Postman Always Rings Twice & # 34 ; and what is often considered the epitome of film noir , & # 34 ; Double Indemnity & # 34 ; . Upon opening this I expected more of the same , but was surprised to see a greater variety and depth the Cain 's writing and fiction plots/genres . Several days after finishing this and I wish I had more of his work at hand to read , both the original stories that birthed those classic noir films and his other less known output.This particular collection is an excellent primer on the scope of Cain 's writing , being split into three sections of form : dialogues , short stories , and one serial novella . Each section is preceded by an introduction to Cain 's use of the form , and a general introduction opens the entire collection . These introductory essays are skimmable if you are really just interested in the meat of the fiction , but they are useful in grounding you in why Cain wrote each style of fiction , the merits he viewed in each , and how they were received by critics and fans.Throughout all the forms Cain has two clear strengths . First is creating a clear , compelling conflict or plot , regardless if large-scale like a crime in a film noir , or a simple , brief confrontation in a doorway . Second is his strength in writing dialogue and regional dialects , particularly of working class people . This shines most obviously in the brief dialogues that open this collection , but even within the short stories they dominate , stretching a bit longer , and broken up from time to time with narration describing the setting or actions . Yet , even these narrations , rendered in the first person , are strongly reminiscent of spoken word , a dialogue between the working class narrator , and the reader , who can easily imagine themselves as an unnamed character in the story , listening to a yarn in a diner over a coffee , or bar over beer.In these dialogues and short stories the genre of crime or transgression appears from time to time , but many also do not approach anything as grandiose , focusing instead on small aspects of human emotion or psychology in a pure manner . These are Cain 's most literary moments , and the ones ( based on the introductions ) that he was most proud in writing . What is interesting is that Cain did not set out to write honest , emotional dialogue-laden fiction per se . That is simply the only writing he was able to create that appeared authentic and sincere . He had to become the character and 'act ' , writing as if he were not Cain at all , but an imagined personality , role playing . The result are stories and dialogues that do n't come across as fictions necessarily , but honest , imperfect recollections , most wonderfully perhaps in the story that gives the collection its name.The collection ends with a serial novella , a style that Cain did not have any artistic appreciation for , but simply used to pay the bills , much like a serious actor doing some light , mindless blockbuster . But Cain ca n't help inject some artistry into the serial , shaping a genre that would translate into the film noir and eventually the French new wave . His serials turned out immensely popular , both with general readers and critics . The serial included was made once into a film that was n't particularly successful , which I have n't seen , but it does lack the spice and sordidness of & # 34 ; The Postman Always Rings Twice & # 34 ; or the precision and tautness of & # 34 ; Double Indemnity & # 34 ; . Nonetheless it is a nice conclusion to the collection , bringing it round to the style of story Cain became most noted for popularly.Although I am interested in reading more of Cain 's work , I appreciated the length this collection kept . By the end of the dialogues and starting the still dialogue-laden short stories , that style was beginning to wear on me , much as Cain found it did when trying to use it to such a degree in his novels . By making this a mixture of styles but allowing none to overstay their welcome , this collection found a great pace . The publisher is releasing a lot of Cain 's old work in ebook format , so once I obtain an actual reader I 'll be checking out some more titles that pique interest .	1
This is a book of short stories . I bought the hardcover . Never having read any of Cain 's short stories it was a pleasure for me . Most were written before he wrote his first novel , & # 34 ; The Postman Always Rings Twice. & # 34 ; The stories are not as impressive as his better known novels . I gave this book 4 stars because they 're written clearly , clear and simple , which makes for a lesson in writing for writers .	1
This was my first time to read Sharon Kay Penman . She 's the best . The other reviews will tell you about the story . I 'm just wanting to brag on the writer . This was her first novel which is set in 15th century England . Next she wrote a trilogy about 13th century England and Wales , Here Be Dragons , Falls the Shadow , and The Reckoning . They should be read in that order . I hope this review is helpful . I look forward to reading all of Sharon 's books .	1
Whether or not you like this book will depend in large part in where you stand on the person and character of Richard of York , Duke of Gloucester and by the Grace of God , King of England , ( however briefly ) .If you are an unswayable proponent of the `` Black Theory '' -- that is , that Shakespeare , More and Richard 's other critics were correct , that Richard killed the Princes and a lot of other people as well -- you 'd probably better move along . This is n't for you.If you have n't been persuaded yet , or are in favor of the `` White Theory '' -- that Richard was a good man , slandered by history -- then this is right up your alley.It begins shortly before the deaths of Richard 's father , uncle , cousins and brother at Sandal Castle and follows the fortunes of Richard , his brothers -- the hapless and self-serving George , Duke of Clarence and the shining Edward IV , the Sunne in Splendour -- and the other major players in the War of the Roses through to Richard 's own death on Bosworth Field.My only complaint -- and it 's minor -- is that perhaps Richard as presented here is just a little too perfect , a little too saintly . I 've no doubt he was honorable and decent -- yes , I hold to the White Theory -- and I believe he was loyal to his brother , but he comes across as someone who really never made a misstep , and I find that hard to believe.All the same , it 's a vivid portrait of its time , and very readable . You 're going to want to read more about the Lancasters and Yorks when you 're done .	1
This was a wonderful story . Although I was prepared to keep an open mind as to my previous opinions on Richard III ( from reading Alison Weir 's Princes in the Tower ) , I was sure I would still come out believing that Richard did the kids . Now I am not so convinced , I am prepared to believe he was a good man . This book also covers much about Edward the IV , Richard 's brother . All in all a very good history lesson.The book was well written , the story line kept me interested through all 900 + pages and I will definitely read more from this author . I have already read the Welsh trilogy ( highly recommended ) .	1
I have had this book and the accompanying tape ever since the 1980 's when it first came out . Both products are 5 star and I would give them 10 if I could . Raquel did a lovely job with the book and tape , very high quality , some of her best work . You can tell she really believed in it and had taken the time to build her knowledge . My advice is to get the book on Amazon , and go at your own pace , the step by step photos and explanations are detailed , yet easy to understand.BACK STORY : The reason the tape which goes with this book will never be put into DVD format , unless you do it yourself at home for personal use , is because Bikram sued Raquel . His claim was that the particular arrangement of yoga poses was patented and copyrighted by him , and the court unfortunately agreed with him . That 's how he got his fancy house in Beverly Hills , with Raquel 's money . My , my , what a jealous temper tantrum , just because she did such a nice job with it.IMHO Bikram was hypocritical because HIS teacher , by the last name of Ghosh , had actually done the work of putting this series together , and it was customized to Bikram 's physical problems that he was trying to recover from . Bikram did n't start teaching this series until the year after his teacher 's death , so of course he did n't have to pay his own teacher any royalties . Yoga has been around for 5,000 years and this type of behavior does not make a good impression on me , plus the fact that I am heat sensitive , so I will NEVER patronize a Bikram studio at $ 18 per visit . I happily do the exercises at home . Here 's the list , and if you do n't have the book yet and want to start right away , you can get a lot of information from the Yoga Journal website.STANDING POSESDeep Breathing in standing position , 10 timesThe ReedChair PoseEagle PoseStanding Head to KneeDancer 's PoseBalancing `` T '' Standing `` A '' StretchTriangleStanding `` A '' Head To KneeTree PoseToe StandDead Man ( Savasana ) MAT EXERCISES , SITTING AND LYING DOWNKnee SqueezeSwing-UpCobraLocustFull LocustThe BowKneeling PoseHalf TortoiseThe CamelThe RabbitShoulder Stand into PloughStretching CycleSpinal TwistThe LotusBlowing Pose sitting on knees , rapid panting , blowing out for 60 repetitions	1
Five stars because everybody needs to be familiar with the disturbing contents of the book , NOT because I support the content.Bertrand Russell was a gifted mathematician and logician of the late 1800 's and early 1900 's . His `` Principa Mathematica '' paper developing formal systems in mathematics continues to be cited today 100 years after its publication ( although it has since been proven to be an incomplete theorum ) . There . Let it never be said I did n't give him his due.Sadly , he goes off the rails at that point . Instead of living an honorable life contributing to society by developing his mathematical theories , Russell instead elected for riches and accolades under the aegis of eugenicist robberbarons J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller ( among others ) . At their behest , Russell turned from math and logic to advance degenerate philosophies and social engineering schemes . Chief among these were his contributions to the ongoing Morgan/Rockefeller plan to unify the world into a hegemonic totalitarian oligarchy . Where Napolean and others failed , Rockefeller intended to succeed using the new sciences of psychology ( propaganda ) , genetics ( eugenics ) , and emerging engineering fields . Russell calls this the `` scientific dictatorship '' ( p.32 ) The Impact of Science on Society is broken into three speeches Bertrand Russell gave at Columbia University in the early days of the Cold War . These lectures sell his scientific dictatorship as the only reasonable ( ! ! ) alternative to certain worldwide nuclear catastrophy . In these speeches , he brazenly details ( in glowing , enthusiastic terms ) just a few programs this new world order is cooking up for us , including:1 ) Mass indoctrination ( p.32 ) , which he brags will be capable of `` producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black '' , if that is what rulers wish the public to think . To achieve this , he advocates development of psychology as a tool for controlling masses , noting ( p.31 ) : `` This study is immensely useful to practical men , whether they wish to become rich or to acquire the government . `` 2 ) War against the family : ( p.32 ) `` the influence of the home is destructive '' . After all , Russell opines , to be effective , `` not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten '' .3 ) ... And a host of grusome suggestions to achieve global mass depopulation.Rockefellers and their ilk continue to wield untold influence through their ownership or dominance of the member banks of the Federal Reserve , the `` seven sisters '' oil cabal , many universities , and a constellation of tax-free foundations and policy-influencing `` think tanks '' , including the Council on Foreign Relations . Close examination of these institutions reveals a concerted and unified effort towards developing a `` vertically integrated '' world political/economic system -essentially the scientific dictatorship Russell advocates in this book . The players pushing us down this road include : the European Union , NAFTA , CAFTA , the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , the World Court , the World Trade Organization , and the United Nations and its subsidiary organizations . There is little to suggest these banking Elites have wavered from the vision outlined in this book .	1
This was one of my favorites as a kid . And one of Roald Dahl 's most famous - it is surprising that lesser known titles of his are available on Kindle already , but not this most popular one .	1
Perhaps I should confess right up front that this review of what is popularly regarded solely as a children 's book is being written by a 50+-year-old male `` adult '' who had n't read a kids ' book in many years . For me , Welsh author Roald Dahl had long been the guy who scripted one of my favorite James Bond movies , 1967 's `` You Only Live Twice , '' and who was married for 30 years to the great actress Patricia Neal . Recently , though , in need of some `` mental palate cleansing '' after a bunch of serious adult lit , I picked up Dahl 's first kiddy novel , `` James and the Giant Peach , '' and now know what several generations have been aware of since the book 's release in 1961 ; that this is an absolutely charming story for young and old alike , with marvelous characters , a remarkably imaginative story line and some quirky humor scattered throughout.As most baby boomers and their kids and grandkids probably know by now , this short novel introduces us to James Henry Trotter , a young boy who is forced to move in with his nasty Aunts Sponge and Spiker when his loving parents are eaten by a rhinoceros on the streets of London ( ! ) . His miserable existence takes a turn for the better when a mysterious old man gives him a bagful of magic green crystals , which James promptly and accidentally spills near the base of a barren peach tree . What follows is wondrous in the extreme , as James discovers a septet of insectoid friends inside the enormous , house-sized fruit that soon develops . Along with his new buddies -- a centipede , an old grasshopper , an earthworm , a glowworm , a silkworm ( which character was oddly dropped from the 1996 Disney filmization ) , a spider and a ladybug -- James sets off in the detached peach on a trans-Atlantic journey , and this is just the beginning of his great adventures . Dahl makes sure that each of his insect characters has a distinct personality of his or her own ; the centipede is a snarky showoff , the earthworm a constant worrier , the grasshopper wise and serene , the silkworm a quiet nonentity , Miss Spider sweet and caring , the ladybug warm and maternal , the glowworm mainly concerned with keeping her light going . Each brings its own set of abilities to the fore in times of crisis , James ' own particular strength being his great boyish intelligence , natch . They are a terrific team of characters that effectively show the little ones the value of teamwork and overcoming differences.Adult readers of `` James and the Giant Peach '' will likely be struck by errant thoughts as the story progresses . For example , the violent deaths of Spiker and Sponge , not to mention James ' parents , are surprising , if glossed over lightly . Perhaps these instances of violence are the reason why this book ranks # 56 on the American Library Association 's list of `` The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-1999 . '' ( Dahl 's `` The Witches '' is # 27 . ) Still , generations of impressionable youths have managed to take in the `` objectionable '' aspects of this book with no discernible damage to their delicate psyches , as far as I can tell ! Adult readers may also be amused at the mention of a `` famous factory where they made chocolate '' in the book ( a foreshadowing of 1964 's `` Charlie and the Chocolate Factory '' ? ) , and wonder at the number of sophisticated words ( such as `` wampus , '' `` manticore '' and `` prock '' ) that Dahl dishes out for the kiddies . They may also get a huge kick out of the hilarious poems and songs scattered throughout the story , as well as by the lighthearted humor in general . ( I think it 's hilarious that Miss Ladybug winds up marrying the head of the NYC Fire Department ! ) Grown-ups may also find cause to wonder why all those 502 seagulls fall into James ' lasso trap . Could n't all those birds detect this trap after 50 or so were snared ? But this is a quibble . From magical beginning throughout its action-packed length ( I have n't even mentioned the shark sequence yet , or the extended segment with the Cloud Men , which the Disney film unwisely drops if favor of an underwater ghost ship that is not in Dahl 's novel ) , this book is a joy and a pleasure for young and -- as I have just proved to myself -- um , older alike . This classic work hardly needs MY seal of approval at this late date , but I just wanted all the adults out there to know that this might be a fun read for them , too . And now , I think I 'm gon na go pick up `` The Witches '' ... .	1
Thirteen-year-old Jose Cruz has been in La Rupa , Honduras his entire life . The tiny village of 56 people holds everything and everyone familiar to him . He lives in a comfortable house with his mom and dad ; older brother and sister Victor and Ruby ; younger siblings Juan , Maria and Angela ; and beloved dog Berti . He goes to the International School , where he learns in both English and Spanish , and in his free time enjoys playing soccer with his friends . He also always keeps an eye out to catch sight of the colorful parrots that live in the trees on top of the hillside above the village . But in 1998 , a category five hurricane hits Honduras and changes everything.Hurricane Mitch strikes land in a fury of rain and wind . Jose has never experienced anything so scary in his life . To make matters worse , his father and older brother and sister are out of town making deliveries , and his faithful dog is missing . Jose knows he must stay brave and strong to help his mother take care of the younger kids . He tries to think what his father and admired older siblings would do , and has to dig deep for courage because the situation grows even worse.The torrential downpour of rain causes a mudslide and buries half of La Rupa in seconds . Many of the villagers are killed , and the survivors are left with the heavy burden of worry and sorrow , and without shelter , food or fresh water . Jose does n't know what happened to his dad , older siblings , or even his dog . He prays that they are safe and will return soon , but fears the worst . Knowing that if they were home they would be working hard to help the village , Jose pitches in where he can . He helps to dig for survivors , and then the dead ; shares his house with the homeless ; searches for food and water ; and offers to go for a doctor when his little brother gets sick . He tries to be brave , but inside he 's terrified . Will Honduras ever be the same ? Will his family ever heal ? Terry Trueman is no novice writer , and his talents prove themselves in this terrifyingly realistic story based on the true disaster of Hurricane Mitch . Jose and his family are fictional , but the nightmares they and their neighbors endure are very similar to the real ones the Honduran people experienced in 1998 . With Trueman 's moving story and admirable characters , readers will be able to sympathize with and feel for these individuals . They may even learn from Jose how to dig for strength to face their own potential scary situations in life. -- - Reviewed by Chris Shanley-Dillman , author of FINDING MY LIGHT and THE BLACK POND	1
The history of the Cathars and their struggle against demise in the face of the Inquisition and French military is a very interesting episode in history . Sophy Burnham brings this history to life by telling the story of a fictional character , Jeanne , who was at the center of the Cathar religion in the final stages of the Cathar retreat of Montsegur . The story of the Cathars is the highlight of this novel along with the historical descriptions and scenes . It is like reading a history book regarding the age of the Inquisition characterized by the oppression of other religious sects or practices by the Catholic Church . Burnham provides scenes of the daily lives of villages who attempt to provide for themselves and care for their families while staying in the good graces of the Church.The story of Jeanne is told from the character 's point of view and at times in the 3rd person or in another character 's voice . We are introduced to Jeanne as being something of a mentally-disturbed wanderer . Her character then shifts into someone more stable and even enlightened . We learn that she grew up within the Cathar retreat after being discovered as an orphaned infant alone in a field . She is highly educated and was once refined . Her character is somewhat inconsistent in the novel ; however , through her revelations the story of Montsegur is shared.The Cathar religion and story is told with a sympathetic leaning , as they are illustrated as being a peace-loving , ascetic clan interested with spiritual enlightenment rather than institutionalism or politics . This image is contrasted with the Roman Catholics who are painted as being paranoid and vicious regarding other forms of spirituality . The Cathars are referred to `` Pure Ones , '' `` Perfected Ones , `` Friends of God '' and the `` Good Men . '' The enlightened of the Cathars are those who have undergone the `` consolamentum , the spiritual baptism that permits a person to find the passageway to Light . '' The consolamentum is given through the laying on of hands by the Perfected Ones . This fills the person with the `` Christhood Light '' and transforms him or her to be like Christ.The novel reveals the heretical teachings of the Cathars and tells their story in an entertaining manner . In the novel , I thought the story of Jeanne ended abruptly and confusingly . The narrative contradicts itself as it concludes . From the author 's explanations , it sounds like she wrote truthfully about the historical vein of the novel .	1
I purchased this book based on the fact that I have read the Spiral Dance by this author . I look forward to reading it .	1
Modern Paganisms like to call themselves `` nature religions '' because their key metaphors are rooted in the cycles of the seasons and the natural world , but as one friend of mine says , `` Sometimes it feels more like we 're living-room carpet religions . '' If you 're feeling like you 're more in touch with the dust-bunnies under your furniture than with the elements , plants and animals in your environment , this book is for you . Actually , this book is for anyone who lives on this planet and is concerned about its fate . Informed both by science and spirituality , this beautifully-written book takes the reader through the four elements plus spirit in search of our deepest ancestral roots ( bacteria , anyone ? ) and the intricate systems of interdependence between all the life-forms and elements on earth . It will inspire you to connect ( or re-connect ) with nature and perceive its inherent mystery , sacredness and magic .	1
Ca n't wait to read the next book very good author I just wish there was more books after this series is over	1
Great for introducing how to write in a journal or diary . I love how they weaved in many facts about worms in a fictional book .	1
Yet again , I find that I love a story for the reasons others dislike it ... but then , that 's what reviews are for- to give another point of view.This is the story of Amelia and Luc , two people who have known and loved each other for YEARS , but- for different reasons ( He , being in dire straits with the family finances and trying to restore them . She , for fear of rejection and scarring him away- being the RAKE that he is ... AND HOW ! ! ! ) never expresses or verbalized it in any way ( although it was apparent to EVERYONE around them ) . I LOVED the friendship angle and that , to me , made the love story and sexual scenes ( though VERY long and DETAILED ) so powerful and moving . This is also , what I loved about `` A Secret Love '' and `` All About Passion '' , it showed more than high flying emotions and outrageous deeds ... it showed how two friends struggled to see eachother as a man/woman.I feel that Amelia was a refreshing change from her sister ( who was at times foolish and too demanding ) . She was always pegged as the `` sensible one '' from previous books and this shows throughout the story , but we also see that she has a VERY `` wild '' ( or shall we say accurately `` WICKED '' ) side of her own demonstrated very surprisingly in a funny scene showing how she trapped and seduced Luc at a house party ( A 1st for him as we could see ) . Both Amelia 's and Amanda 's stories were based heavily on their sexual relationships , the only thing that sets them apart where the mysteries involved . Amanda 's was a necessary evil that led to happiness- Amelia 's was not , it just served as the usual catalyst to make the players confess all.I did find it a change that the Hero KNEW he was in love , but it angered me that he would not admit it and his reasoning was absurd , but then all of the men before him had the same thought pattern- why would he be any different ( except Richard , he was READY for it all , but Catriona was not ... Luc reminds me of him ... love that RICHARD ! ) .To sum it all up- great love story ... unnecessary mystery and the dreaded use of the MISUNDERSTANDING ( albeit purposely ) ... but a fun read . You will definently be cheering for Amelia ... hey , give a girl credit for being original ... she got her man FIRST , then came the emotional tug of war ... great planning if I say so myself ... *WG* ( I am also very anxious to see the possibility of a romance between Portia , Luc 's sister , and Simon ... '' Incestious , indeed . `` , as Martin would say , but I 'm sure we will be loving every minute of it ... )	1
I really enjoyed the book . This was the first Stephanie Laurens book that I had read . Yes , it was long and there was some inconsistances , but this is fiction and you should be able to suspend reason just a little bit to have to fun , and this was definitely FUN ! I have now read several other of Ms. Laurens works and this is still my favorite . ENJOY ! ! !	1
THE LADY CHOSEN is the first book in the Bastion Club series . It is the story of a group of men who acted as spies in the war , returned to titles and fortunes and matchmaking female relatives . The men agree to form a club where they can support one another and also find refuge from the social whirl . Tristan Wemyss , Earl of Trentham , must marry within a year or lose the fortune that helps support his relatives . While preparing the house where the Bastion Club will meet , he meets the neighbor Leonora Carling . He talks on helping her when mysterious events and break ins threaten her.I liked the mystery here . Laurens tends to have her characters involved in mysteries when falling in love . The two are attracted to one another , but while Trentham is thinking of marriage , Leonora is not . Leonora is self contained and a bit lonely . She had learned to trust no one except herself . She is strong and worried about being vulnerable . This is a reversal from the normal romance novel where the man does n't want to be vulnerable.The love scenes between the two are hot.There is a lot of setup in this book as might be expected from a first book in a series . The characters and the situation interested me.Fans of Laurens Cynster series are treated to small cameos that demonstrate that all these characters inhabit the same world .	1
I just got done reading & quot ; A Gentleman 's Honor. & quot ; I love the characters , Stephanie Laurens did a great job with Alicia and Tony . Alicia longs to follow her dreams to be married to a man who loves her in return . But she puts that aside for the sake of her 3 young brothers and her sister who are left improverish . They made it to the balls by luck and wit , dressing to the next fasion and a false pretense of Alicia being a widow . Only Tony seem to get close to her emotionally and physically . Tony , who assume Alicia is a widow , sets his mind to seducing her into passion . Alicia finally accepts herself as a mistress for Tony . Along the way they are very attatched to each other emotionally . From the first time Tony sees her , he protects her from start to end . There are several scenes of sex , just to give a little warning.The only thing that I really do n't like is the story behind it , it seems her new series is more into mystery than romance . The book is so longwinded that it takes forever to finish a paragraph and so long to finish the book . It 's a good thing she made the characters very likable else I would n't have finish the book.I believe the next book will be about Charles St. Austell who goes out to find out the second traiter who is worse than A.C	1
Stephanie Laurens is an awesome author . She captures the readers interest and holds onto it until the book is finished .	1
I stumbled across this book rather by accident but decided to read it because it looked somewhat compelling . This is a novel containing a fictionalized account of the Tiananmen Square incident . The story itself is told through the eyes of 3 different people so you get more of a whole perspective . We hear the story through the dissident protester ( younger brother ) , through the soldier called into Beijing to help squash the rebellion ( older brother ) and through the eyes of the old Chinese ruler Deng Xiaoping . The younger brother Xiao Di has more liberal views and even attended college in America . While returning to Beijing he got caught up in some protests that had dire effects for him when the state dept . learned of his identity . His older brother Lu is a solider in the army and seems to be somewhat mentally facile , more or less doing what he 's told and never really questioning that his orders may not be best for the people . Deng is shown as a semi-retired old man who does n't quite understand how the people could doubt that he acted in their best interests and why they would want to cause a disturbance with the way things are presently . After all , are n't things better now than they were in the past ? It 's obvious while reading this book that the Author Cheng has done quite a bit of research . I felt that the book kept me interested in reading to see how events would turn out and also gave me a somewhat fresh perspective on how difficult and trying life can be under a state-controlled regime . It made me think of how we should all appreciate the freedoms and rights we 've been granted in the United States . You also come to understand the reasons why the ruler Deng Xiaoping acts as he does even if you do n't quite support his thoughts or ideas . All-in-all I was pleasantly surprised with this book . It reads pretty quickly and I would recommend it . I hope this author continues to improve and give us more works in the future .	1
I highly recommend this book . This was my first Rollins adventure and it kept me glued . I loved the twists in theAmazon especially the mutated phirana fish which could hope like frogs . I read frequently and this is the only book in the last 3 months that really gripped my imagination . The end is a far reach - but I enjoyed it .	1
I could n't put it down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I kept saying , ok , just one more page then I 'm going to sleep . Before I knew ... I was so near the end I just had to know , therefore , I was up to 3:00 a.m . Thank you James Rollins for keeping me in suspense . Loved all the mysteries , the Gigantic Croc fight . AWESOME ! ! ! Believe it or not , I 'm not gon na it again , but at a slower pace this time .	1
This is the first book that I 've read by James Rollins and it will not be the last . I 'm not going to bother summarizing the plat for you . that 's what the book jacket is for . This ia an adventure story set in the Amazon jungle . The character 's are fairly well developed . The story just flys ! After about the first two pages you wont be able to put it down until it 's finished . My only complaint is that some o the things in the book seem pretty far-fetched , even for this time of book . Pirhanas that come out of the water onto land ? ? As far as new authors go , Rollins ranks just below Jack DuBrul and just above Matthew Reilly . Amazonia is well worth the money , like I said it will keep you turning the pages .	1
I 'm normally a zombie book reviewer , so Amazonia is my first thriller review . At one of my book signings a rep was giving me a tour of the bookstore and asked if I 've read Amazonia ? I told her no and that i write zombie stories and reviews . She started telling me the hook of the story and yeah , it hooked me . `` A Special Forces agent goes into the jungle with one arm and comes back with both . '' Who would n't be hooked by that ? I stopped reading zombie stories for a few days to read this book . Wow ! I freaking loved it . The writing was perfect and so was the plot . The book really had me at the edge of my seat almost the entire way through . I liked most of the characters in the book . I truly felt compassion and anxiety for them as they ventured into the jungle . I enjoyed the story so much that i let my boss borrow my copy . She 's loving it as well.Spoiler ! There were a few tiffs i had with the story though . In the beginning when Nathan saves the girl from the anaconda and then has to fight the girls dad , what happens to those characters ? Rollins made a big deal about Nate becoming a Yanomama brother , but we never see that man again.Also , the Ban-ali are suppose to be this fierce warrior tribe , but at the end they almost get wiped out by a few mercenaries . I would think that even if it was an ambush the Ban-ali would be able to defend their own home.Despite my minor tiffs i thought this story was fantastic and it opened up a whole new world to me . I 'm taking a break from zombies to read other genres . Thanks Mr. Rollins !	1
Love his books , specially the Sharpe 's series . I am trying to read all of them , they are historically accurate and very entertaining .	1
This is an exciting , well written , story that has been a highly successful Read Aloud to present to groups of K-4 students . The parts of the story where the main character child rock climbs to save his dog during a lightening storm provide adults with wonderful `` teachable moments '' , I always ask my studetns why it is dangerous to be the highest point in electrical storms , many students are n't even aware of the fact that `` Electricity strikes the highest point '' , and it could be an interesting way to introduce a unit on weather , storms or electricity . We also discuss how the main character could have avoided putting himself and his pet in such a dangerous situation , ( by keeping a better eye on his dog instead of allowing it to walk off with strangers ) . I do not think this book makes dangerous situations seem `` cool '' it makes them seem really dangerous . I definitely think this is a fantastic book for kids and does not have a bad influence on them if you present it in the appropriate manner .	1
Setting England - 1072 -- -- - In this sequel to THE LILY AND THE SWORD , Lord Radulf has intercepted a missive from one of his vassals asking for assistance from one of his enemies . In order to determine if the widow Lady Rose of Somerford has turned traitor to him , he sends one of his mercenaries , Gunnar Olafson and his men to see if what he fears is true . If Gunnar can prove that Radulf 's beloved wife Lily 's prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; has turned against him , then Somerford manor would be given to him once he regains control.Rose , a product of her time , knows she has been a bargaining chip and although she was shown kindness from her elderly and now deceased husband , she did not trust her heart to any of the male species . She would do whatever was necessary to keep control of and the care of her people . Sir Arno , her knight whom she thought loyal , convinced her , that if she asked Radulf for help he would think her incompetent and take the control of Somerford out of her hands . Gunnar , riding up and seeing a great looking harvest in the fields was thinking only that once the traitor , Lady Rose was ousted , this fertile demense would be his . However , when Rose and Gunnar meet their attraction to one another is mutually fierce and disturbing . He to think he was attracted to a traitor , and she to a mercenary ; though both attribute it to lust neither wanted to trust their feelings or each other.THE ROSE AND THE SHIELD is an exciting historical romance sequel set during the reign of William the Conqueror after the Norman 's landed . Being a female in those tumultuous times , the thought of a loving and caring relationship would be but a dream , with your value being determined solely upon political alliances . Knowing that a mercenary warred for coin , Rose fought her attraction as much as she could . Gunnar , raised in a home of love and devotion and once he realized Rose was innocent of treachery , prayed that she would learn to trust both him and her feelings . Unfortunately , her independence was for me , just a little too rigid when she should have been able to see past his profession especially after such a sensual and thoroughly satisfying tryst ; to still doubt him , was a little hard to swallow . This was still a good and satisfying read for lovers of this historical period and well worth your time . The writing is crisp , passionate , and quite visual so I am looking forward to the next sequel .	1
Vishnu lies dying on the staircase , which has been his home , and his neighbors , families Pathak and Asrani , argue , who should pay for the ambulance . This is the beginning of the chain , which transports the reader to the higher and higher floors of the building in Bombay and reveals the drama behind the closed doors of its dwellers . We follow Mr Jalal through his obsessive search for the sense of life , we see the widower Vinod Taneja , who is missing his wife so much he renounces life altogether , and young Kavita Asrani , who imagines herself as a heroine of a Bollywood romance movie and runs away from home.The story , infused with Indian mythology , is a metaphor of a social and political division in the contemporary Indian society , shown here as a building , inhabited by people of different social status and religious beliefs . The Pathaks and the Asranis are very similar Hindu families , who live in constant competition and jealousy , uniting only against those who are much different , like the Jalals , who are respectful Muslims ( and whose son elopes with Kavita Asrani ) , or like Vishnu , a poor drunk who is allowed to live on the stairs of the building in exchange for favors . The stairs provide shelter for many people , nearly as many , as those who live in the flats , and equally diverse . There is Ganga , who is assigned the task of bringing the milk to the flats , and the radiowalla , whose only pride is his small transistor radio . The building sparks with life , everyone is going about their business , and in the middle of the staircase there lies Vishnu in a coma.The story of the few days before Vishnu dies is interrupted by Vishnu 's visions of his past and afterlife , his prostitute lover , Padmini , his dreams of a better life and his misery and happiness in life . These fragments bring spiritual depth into the witty novel , giving it perspective and rounding it up as a thoroughly Indian story . The author , Manil Suri , is a mathematician , and maybe because of this he managed to give his debut novel exceptionally good structure . The ending is open and leaves room for imagination ( at the same time , it was a bit unclear and blurred to me , the only flaw I could find in this amazing debut ) . The language is light and clear . The book reads fast and absorbs the reader . I will start reading the next novels of the other two of the Indian divine trinity , Shiva ( the novel appeared at the beginning of 2008 ) and Brahma , with a lot of anticipation - with `` The Death of Vishnu '' Suri has set the bar very high .	1
This is mesmerising book that I read in one afternoon and have been thinking about since . Suri has condensed the human cosmos into an Indian apartment building and to the journey of the dying Vishnu as he rises from the landing to the top of the building . The inhabitants of the apartment building are all very well drawn in all their human shortcomings and with their imperfect souls . As the story evolves tragically through the inevitable entwinement of the lives of the apartment dwellers , we witness , step by step , how evil unfolds in ordinary human experience . Although very much Indian in terms of its setting and the mythology it draws from ( as far as I can tell , since I am not from India and have never been there , although I am from the east ) , I think this is a piece of writing that is universal in its appeal as its focus is really the human psyche . However , it does give us a very vivid window into the Indian society through the voices of the apartment dwellers . Suri 's writing is like a woodland stream , light and appealing to the senses . His story takes you to another realm , to the River of Life , as you close to book .	1
What great news to hear that Howard Zinn and the New Press are creating a & quot ; People 's History & quot ; series ! Even better news is the outstanding job Ray Raphael has done of this first effort in that series . He has taken on the overall approach of the 'original ' , Zinn 's & quot ; People 's History of the United States & quot ; and applied it to the & quot ; creation myths & quot ; of our country in a way that creates real history which is captivating even as it strips the gloss from the schoolboy history handed on for generations.The really nice thing is that Raphael has accomplished this with a voice that is unique to himself and to this book . No mere expansion of a chapter from the earlier Zinn book , this . Even having read Zinn 's book , I found that this one retained the same ability to amaze me with fundamental reexamination of core beliefs.At its center this book is , more than anything else , a study of how revolution happens . As such it is important reading for anyone who considers how fundamental change might happen in this country , if ever , again . The real myth of our history is not so much the focus on individual heroics or great battles as the implicit claim that our revolution fell into place so neatly , so quickly . Somewhere between chapters 3 and 5 in our history books the Brits passed some taxes , the Colonists rose up in righteous indignation , the battle was at hand - then won.Raphael demonstrates at length , through original sources created by regular folks , that the whole business was much longer work than that . People do n't just rise up overnight , casting off habits of mind and cultural expectations of what can and can not be done . People do n't just sit down and pen some pamphlets or high-sounding declarations and raise armies.This book shows how , over decades , a broad sweep of reaction against oppressive institutions by everyday people built a solid groundwork which meant that the final & quot ; revolution & quot ; was neither unexpected nor un-practiced . He describes how many earlier uprisings , revolts , and proto-revolutions radicalized the populace and eroded assumptions about rights of elites . He describes how the vast majority of disenfranchised poor played a fundamental role in shifting those assumptions.Throughout he reminds us of what a complicated business it was . From the broad in scope - the impossibility of raising a standing army from reluctant and other-committed farmers and family men , ( and the consequential injection of a military draft and a messy cash-buyout business ) to the narrow - why the `` tea party '' energized so many common folk to whom tea was the ultimate class icon.Thoughtful people have learned to be skeptical of delivered history . But it really helps to have something real to counterbalance mere skepticism . This history is real , this is eye-opening stuff , this is the rest of the story .	1
I love a good mystery ... .who does n't ? Jonathan Santlofer 's Kate McKinnon books definitely fill the bill . `` The Death Artist '' , `` Color Blind '' and `` The Killing Art '' all feature an appealing heroine named Kate McKinnon , who can pull off an evening with a group of socialites who would n't say `` CRAP '' if they had a mouthful , and the next day be sitting around with a bunch of detectives and swearing like a sailor . These three books are mesmerizing . The heroine has a conscience and a heart , as well as the occasional foul mouth and a willingness to get her hands dirty . Appreciation of fine art is woven in and around the plots and characters so skillfully that I soaked up knowledge of different schools of art , without even realizing that it was happening . The murders are vivid and creepy and full-bodied , no pun intended . I will not give away any of the plotlines or any more about the characters . These things are amply covered in other reviews . My advise is start with `` The Killing Art '' and work your way through the other two books . You will not be disappointed , except perhaps that you will be so sucked into the books and the people who populate them that you wo n't accomplish much else while reading them . Time very well spent .	1
Historians and Political Scientists tend to focus on what leaders ' have accomplished , weighing them as effective or not , rather than examining how they achieved them , or even how they came to office in the first place . This overlooked aspect of history is known as political strategy , and Dick Morris has taken a huge step in filling that void with his stunning new book `` Power Plays . '' Morris cites six different types of strategies that political leaders can use . But the use of these strategies alone are not a prescription for success or failure . It is how leaders ' execute these strategies that determines whether or not they will prevail . For example , both Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater pursued the same policy goals using the same basic strategy , what Morris calls Standing On Principle . But whereas Goldwater was combative and negative , Reagan was joyful and positive . Goldwater ran against the liberal establishment , while Reagan ran against the Soviet Empire . Morris continues to examine the successes and failures of the six strategies through well-written historical examples , and his juxtaposition of the two outcomes from the same strategy makes the book convincing . Along the way , Morris treats us to other previously unknown illuminations of history . Wilson could have the vote for the League of Nations had he campaigned on idealistic and nationalistic principles rather that legalistic ones . Gore would have won in 2000 had he stayed aligned with his traditional environmentalism . Rockefeller strayed too far to the left to be elected but GW Bush managed the feat by not isolating his base of support . We are also introduced to how leaders should act in times of crisis , as exemplified by Roosevelt and Churchill durin the Second World War . How not to act in a crisis was exemplified by Johnson during Vietnam , which cost him his Presidency . Morris ' book is therefore a real achievement , which incorporates historical examples into a well-defined theoretical framework , making this a genuine piece of political science that will not only stand the test of time , but may well influence more scholars to study campaign strategy in addition to more traditional historical pursuits .	1
Tess Lindsey has lived on the remote island of Isle of May and has been raised by the only two other people who lived on the island , all the time uncertain of who she is and her true identity . After the death of her caretakers , she is left on the island all by herself and must do battle alone . That is until one day she rescues a stranger -- -a stranger who also holds her questions of her past in his very hands . Colin MacPherson has the knack for adventure and a beautiful girl at every single place he visits , that is until he meets Tess ... a strong-willed girl that intrigues him at every turn . As the two form a bonding trust Colin begins to piece together the clues of Tess 's mysterious past ... and a future that most likely will not include him . This definitely has to be one of the best Avon True Romances so far , after Anna and the Duke . I did n't expect it to be this good so it really took me by surprise . Every teenage girl who loves romance should read this book !	1
You do n't need to read THE GIVEN DAY before this follow-up , although the pair together is a formidable look at the Prohibition era in America . The first book takes place in Boston , whereas LIVE BY NIGHT settles primarily in Tampa , Florida , where , deals are made at the corner of a speakeasy and verbal confrontations go down at the back of a still . Organized crime and romance are rendered with a hard-boiled , noir patina.The Coughlin family is at the center of the action , including Tom , Deputy Police Superintendent with political aspirations . His son , Danny , who was the focus of the first book , has a small but pivotal role here . The main character is Tom 's son Joe , who , in the course of the book , goes from petty thief to gangster.Joe Coughlin considers himself an outlaw , which is different from a gangster , until he realizes that he has crossed over to the more violent shades of criminality . In this story set in the roaring 20 's of the Prohibition era , Joe is intent on making his notoriety outside of his family . His father 's corruption leads Joe into some stark territory , and he eventually moves away from Boston and into the belly of Tampa 's organized crime network.The atmosphere is spot-on ; Lehane excels at making this period in history come alive . Sometimes the characters seem a bit wooden and stock , and the story presentational , diminishing the emotional quality and intimacy . However , the richness of period detail and the effortless prose made it quite enjoyable . If you enjoy the loftier Lehane stories , this one is a must-read . It is currently a film project with Ben Affleck directing and starring , to be released in 2015 . Affleck did a superb film from GONE BABY GONE , and I look forward to his interpretation of this historic piece .	1
Live by Night is one of the very best novels I have read in some time . A compelling and disturbing story , a very American story . Joe 's choices cause you to cringe and grieve and cry `` No ! '' but your love for him , somehow , will endure .	1
A very literate friend had recommended Dennis Lehane to me , especially `` Mystic River . '' But I found this book first at the library and decided to give it a try.After reading page 1 , I almost decided this was not the book for me . I 'd gotten all the mob psychopathology I needed ( ? ) from watching The Sopranos . But , being too lazy to get up and identify another candidate book , I kept reading and was glad I did.There is not much more to say about this book that hundreds of others have n't already said . I will just say that I found it an absorbing read , with ( mostly ) sympathetic characters set against interesting historical and geographical backdrops . I look forward to reading more from Mr. Lahane .	1
. good read but not Lehane 's best . the ending seemed a little contrived as if the author did n't know where to go next with his story	1
I really enjoyed this book . In this day-and-age , where there are so many books to choose from , I find myself trusting reviews and then being very disappointed by the writing and the story . Cream does rise to the top , but often it is so hard to find a really good book . Dennis Lehane does a marvelous job and I highly recommend his books . In the end , we writers are entertainers . Lehane is top-notch.Nat Goodale , author of VACATIONLAND .	1
This has to be one of Denis Lehane 's best books . Very well written with fantastic characters .. has the making of a really good film in my view and could be up there with LA Confidential if it goes to Hollywood . Great suspense throughout and a great ending	1
This book is in excellent condition , no tears or rips anywhere . There are very good pictures in the novel as well . Thank you .	1
This book surprised me because Meg Cabot generally writes more modern themed books . That is one of the reasons I got it , to see if Cabot wrote another excellent book . I was happy to see that she had ! Nicola and the Viscount is about an orphan girl named Nicola who lives in the late 1800s . She is madly in love with a gentleman named Lord Sebastian Bartholomew . When she learns that Lord Sebastian is n't quite who she thought he was , she does n't know what to do.This book was nicely written and the story was good , but it lacked excitement . Everything just happens to fit into place perfectly , when she is in danger there just happens to be somebody there to save her . Theres no feeling of , `` OMG whats going to happen next ! '' like there is in most of Cabots books.Luckily , that is my only complaint ! Another great book by Cabot !	1
This is the first his books that I have read . Like all books in a series I am sure that it helps when you have read the preceding novels but the author does a very good job of allowing this to be a stand alone read . I enjoyed it enough that I am now reading the first in the series .	1
Sally Fenning has been murdered . Shot to death as she sat at a red light in her Mercedes . She leaves a will naming six beneficiaries to her estate which is valued at 46 million dollars . The six are a mixed bunch : an ex-husband , a shameless lawyer , a newspaper reporter , a hired killer , an assistant state attorney and a mystery person that no one can locate . There is no apparant reason that she would have left a dime to any of the people listed , much less 46 million dollars . But of course , there is a catch . She leaves the money to the one amoung those listed who is the last one left alive.After the reading of the will is when the fun begins and the blood starts to flow.Jack Swytech , a Miami criminal defense lawyer has been hired by one of the beneficiaries , Tatum Knight . Tatum is the brother of a man that Swytech has saved from death row by the use of DNA to prove that he did not commit the crime he was convicted of . Tatum 's line of business is that of a hired killer , although he claims to have retired from that line of work for a few years.It turns out that a couple of weeks before Sally was murdered , she tried to hire Tatum to kill her . He claims he turned it down . Others are not so sure.Grippando has done a masterful job with the interaction bewteen the beneficiaries as the plotting and scheming go on to convince others to drop out of the running . And then people start dying.Who is behind the scheming and killing are not revealed until the very end of the book and the reader is kept very much in the dark until that time when all becomes clear . Last to Die is one of those books that you look forward to picking up and reading while you enjoy a master story teller at the top of his game .	1
One would think that having more choices would be a good thing . It would , but up to a limit , or so says Barry Schwartz . Schwartz backs this claim up with studies , some of which have been related in other recent and similar works by other authors . The classic example here has become the case of the sample jams in a restaurant , where people are more likely to buy when there are fewer choices . There are many reasons for this , one being the feeling of future regret , which is amplified when there are more choices , so that the number of potential errors in choice increases , thereby resulting in a sort of paralysis . Schwartz gives other examples like these throughout the book about psychological states and other phenomena that affect how we feel about choices . He spends some time talking about maximizers , or people who want only the best . These folks are victimized even more in a world of plenty because they will never be satisfied with whatever they choose . Schwartz offers some prescriptions : for example , people should seek to become `` satisficers '' , that is to choose what is good enough . Also , expectations should be lowered , and choosers should account for adaptation when they think about the effects of their choices . These all seem like good advice in a world where choice can become overwhelming . Anyway , I read this book instead of a hot romance novel , now I do n't feel so good about my choice .	1
All business leaders and professional software engineers MUST read this book . There are many insights in this book that you all probably already know , but that it will help reinforce , identify and provide a foundation for taking the concepts into your everyday business practices and decisions.While this provides a general psychological/sociological overview of the issue , it also presents some wonder examples of how to deal with things that are related.A good read for all , but a must have for all the engineers and overall `` thinkers '' out there .	1
I wish I had written this book ! As modern Americans with myriad choices for every minute and mega aspects of our lives , choice becomes a job rather than an opportunity to express and satisfy . Schwartz carefully demonstrates this , brings in relevant related research and discusses the possible implications for our happiness . Well written and well considered , THE PARADOX OF CHOICE has validated that gnawing suspicion that I 've felt for years that the responsibility of making all the right decisions is more than onerous , it is counterproductive to our wellbeing .	1
The book may look on the outside like a social , economic , or political critique . But it 's actually addressed mostly to individuals , and probably belongs mostly in the self-help category.Most books of this kind - even some good ones - have only enough interesting ideas to justify a sizeable magazine article . The authors of such books also usually overstate their case drastically by claiming that everything in the world that they do n't like can be explained by the one insight that forms the premise of their book.This book is an exception . It 's not long , but that 's largely because there 's no padding . Schwartz uses several examples to illustrate his point that our modern , economically productive society has provided us with an unprecedented range of choices in areas of our lives where formerly we did n't have to even think hard to make a decision.For me , one of the most thought-provoking and enjoyable things in the book was the inclusion of many creative and revealing psychological experiments which produced unexpected insights concerning how we make decisions , and what the consequences of the decision-making process are.Schwartz makes a good case for his thesis that `` choice overload '' can have a wide range of negative results . And instead of delivering a political diatribe or social critique , blaming politicians or greedy corporations for all of these problems , he addresses himself primarily to his readers , and tells us what he thinks WE as individuals can do to ease the undesirable consequences of having to make too many choices.The only part of the book I found unconvincing was when Schwartz argues that ( 1 ) when people have to make individual choices in too many areas of life , they then have to take responsibility for the results of those choices , and ( 2 ) people who take responsibility for most of the things that happen in their lives tend to be unhappier . I 'm condensing his argument here , but he definitely does give the impression that he believes that . And I 'm here to say that even if people who take responsibility for the results of their actions **are** unhappier , that 's just tough . The last thing we need in our society is fewer people who take responsibility for the results of their choices . Just about every failure and every criminal that I have ever met , or known anything about , has REFUSED to accept responsibility for his or her choices - and that 's why they 're failures and criminals . If taking responsibility increases your stress level , well is n't that just too bad.But that one disagreement does n't prevent me from giving the book 5 stars . The book makes so many important points , and explains them so lucidly , persuasively , and non-ideologically , that I think everyone should read it .	1

I saw the movie & # 34 ; The Sound of Music & # 34 ; many , many times and am anxious to see how the book compares .	1
If only our lives could example these , then happy we all would be . What a example of true Christian living . Through unimaginable hardships to joys made of love , this family saw and lived it all . Highly recommended .	1
Along with everyone else who has read this book , I loved `` The Sound of Music '' and knew that it was a glossed over account of their real life . I picked up this book , hoping that there would me some truth to it . While I am sure that the majority of the events DID happen , they way they are presented leaves much to be desired . I got the impression reading this book that there was yet a 3rd side to the story that is not presented here.This is the story of the family , as told by Maria . This is the book on which the movie is based . The book leads the reader to believe that everything was sunshine and roses and that whenever anything bad happened , God provided the opportunities . While I am not doubting Maria 's faith , I also think that she worked her tail off to get some of the opportunites the family recieved.This book is very moving . Some of the antics of the little kids made me chuckle and the story of Georg 's death brought tears to my eyes . I would be interested in finding out what happened later ... ..I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the movie .	1
I am a big fan of The Sound of Music and read this book just prior to visiting Salzburg for the first time . It was fun to compare the actual story of the von Trapp family to the movie -- many similarities , yet many differences . I enjoyed this book ... and loved Salzburg !	1
Excellent read ! So interesting to discover the & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; story behind the beloved musical ! So engaging and well written I could have read on forever !	1
There is so much more to the true story of this family than the movie portrays . Most of the book tells of their life in America where they lived and sang after fleeing Austria . This is a family who kept God first in their lives and He used and blessed them mightily in many ways .	1
Great short-story type reading with plenty of detail and colorful characters . Thoroughly enjoyed a trip back to & # 34 ; the good ol ' days courtesy of Sonny Barger .	1
I caught this work via a 2002 Recorded Books feature with narration by Norman Dietz . Surely Gulley has a great talent to speak about simple people and simple truths . Being a pastor 's son and even today involved in church work , I can relate to some of Gulley 's accounts . I thoroughly enjoyed this work and look forward to other Gulley pieces . Dietz does a great job reading this for audio .	1
Home To Harmony is a delightful and entertaining anthology of Philip Gulley 's short stories introducing the reader to a hometown community of neighbors and friends that moves to a slower , less complicated rhythm of quaint , colorful , familiar , funny , heartwarming , and inspiring personalities , events , and circumstances . Highly recommended reading set within the framework of the four seasons , Home To Harmony features Spring ( Home to Harmony ; Settling In ; The Bobservation Post ; The Swordfish ; Revival ; Uly ) ; Summer ( Miss Rudy , Wilbur , and Friday Nights ; Burma-Shave ; The Birds and the Bees ; This Callous Pride ; The Aluminum Years ; Brother Norman and the Bus ) ; Fall ( First Grade ; Noodle Day ; The World ; Mutiny ; The Twins ; Roger and Tiffany ) ; Winter ( Miriam and Ellis ; Memory ; The Spelling Bee ; The Testimony ; Legal Grounds ; The Shroud of Harmony ) .	1
This book was not what I thought it was . I will not be reading the other books in this series . I did n't enjoy it but maybe I was expecting to much ( something like Jan Karon ) .	1
This is an excellent book like Gulley 's others . It was slightly worn , but in usable condition . I would recommend it .	1
This book is composed of two interwoven tales : an autobiography of the author 's life from the 1950s to the 1990s , and the history of China 's formative years . These two tales are joined together at crucial points to illustrate how the lessons of life , love , war , and diplomacy practiced 3000 years ago by fuedal warlords are still applicable today , in this case in the life of the author.The author has had a challenging life as she had to put up with an unloving stepmother as a child and scheming siblings as an adult . She bore this anguish and torture quietly for most of her life until she finally quit her medical career and put her pain to words . The result was several books , with this as the latest . This illustrates various parts of her life and her relationships with various people , including family , friends , and people she met in her career . This latest offering shows how her relationships had parallels in the relationships between the various warlords and politicians involved in China 's synthesis from 6+ various kingdoms about 3000 years ago.The text itself is broken into chapters , each of which is named after a famous Chinese proverb . Each chapter is then dedicated to the historical origins of that proverb , and how that proverb has applied to the author 's life and to life in general.Overall , the book is good reading . It provides insight into the foundations of Chinese culture , how Chinese think , and the mindset of the Chinese people . To a lesser degree it also serves to illustrate the differences between Chinese and Western cultures .	1
This is my first book by this Author , and wont be my last . I took it on vacation , and could n't put it down . When my kids yell at me , or my hubby , to quit reading , and I have to sneak it into the bathroom , it makes it a 4-5 star book in my humble opinion . This book is what makes you hooked all over again to romance , it was romantic all the way to the clouds , and sizzled back down to earth . I salute you Samantha James , A very fun read . Thank you .	1
Frederick Taylor has the benefit to draw on archives and sources only accessible since the fall of the East German regime in 1989 . He could therefore verify claims as to the extent of bombing damage and the estimated number killed on the ground . Taylor succeeds in cutting through the politics that have beclouded the events in 1945 . Just as the clouds obscured some of the pilots ' view of the great city , these political agendas have blocked our view of what really happened that night , and how it occurred . Mr. Taylor is an honest witness , not a voyeur to the gruesome carnage . He guides us along the streets through the eyes are many eyewitnesses and does so in a revealing , yet humane manner . It is a most serious subject and Mr. Taylor handles it in a most respectful and honorable way . The reader is given a broad view of the cultural , historic , ethnic and industrial history of the Saxon capitol..	1
If you have an interest in what 's known as the 'Black Plague ' then you will be very pleased with John Kelly 's detailed and thoroughly researched book . A lot went over my head so I must say I skipped a bit in certain parts , however all my curiosities were satisfied . Incredibly sobering , this book seems to bring back histories most shocking and devastating periods right to the forefront of your mind and thoughts .	1
Kelly has written a wonderful book describing the causes and effect of the Great Mortality of 1347-1350 . To me the most striking aspect of the book is the author 's representation of the plague not just as a bacterial organism but as a living force that acts to disrupt culture and civilization . While I found that I was n't interested so much in the human affairs such as the trial of Queen Joanna in Avignone , I was completely absorbed as the author discussed the ecological upheavals that took place leading up to the plague 's entry into Europe as well as the socio-economic factors that spread it . This leads to a personification of the spread of the disease that is powerful and gripping in its intensity . It is almost as if one is reading a thriller where the plague 's spread is the antagonist stalking an unsuspecting victim.This book is a very good treatment of not only the plague but of the series of events and combination of factors that lead to the significant decline of Europe following its initial blossoming in the 13th century .	1
The pattern of the Black Death would be funny if it were not so ultimately tragic . Kelly shows time and time again how it started . First came the rumors and people would say oh it ca n't be as bad as all of that . Next would come the wave of fugitives assuring you that YES it really was that bad and was probably even worse . Then you fortified yourself with courage and faith knowing that unless you were of the nobility there was no where to run . Time and time again this story is repeated until the pestilence spread from Italy to England and maybe even beyond . The great question of the book is ultimately who is to say weather or not such a thing could happen again ? And would modern society survive ? Overall-While there are times when the author gets bogged down in having to give every single country a voice I had a generally positive experience .	1
Wow , this book is simply amazing , recounting the horrors , and I mean HORRORS , of the Black Death that decimated the populations of the medieval world . So why the 4 stars ? First let me tell you why I would have given it 5 stars : I love the dramatic events of history that have changed the course of humans and the plague certainly is one . You only need to visit the affected areas in Europe to realize the historical impact of this event . Mr. Kelly seems to have done extensive research ( even though I am no historian ) . He documents his accounting through writings from various sources closely connected to the event , sources who often did n't live to see a brighter day . Yet these very personal accounts of the plague are the strength of this book . We really can feel the impact of this horrendous event on the individuals whose accounts he discovered in his research . And perhaps more interestingly , we see how the rich and powerful ( and holy ) tried to escape almost certain death.Another reason I would have given this book 5 stars is the author 's research on the origins of this plague and its differentstrains ; I kept a map of Asia/Europe beside me while reading so as to trace the beginnings and follow its destructive path . He answers many questions about how it took hold and was so successful in its biological mission to kill and the various ways scientists , philosophers , teachers , and ordinary people tried to understand and deal with this crisis . ( This often made me think about diseases killing us today for which we have no answers for cures . ) A third reason I would have given this book 5 stars is its pure & # 34 ; fright & # 34 ; factor . This event must have been one of the most horrifying ever experienced by man ; parents watched as their children died one after the other , or worse , they fled to avoid catching the disease , leaving their children to suffer an excruciating death all alone . The details can be gruesomely overwhelming yet fascinating at the same time.So why 4 and not 5 stars ? It 's pretty much the same story from place to place , whether in Venice , Florence , Avignon , Paris or London- people died in the same patterns and numbers . In fact , I 'm half way through the book and may not finish because it 's the same thing again and again . True , there are interesting stories tied to specific people , like the Pope in Avignon , that are injected here and there , but basically , once the plague got going , it killed in the same way over and over again.So who should read this book ? Anyone who loves history , particularly of Europe , and is familiar with the places so dramatically affected by the plague . Anyone who likes to contemplate how something we can not see can wreak havoc on the human population ( still true today ) and anyone who loves a gruesome , gory TRUE story . Maybe I 'll give it 5 stars !	1
I have read a great number of books on the Black Death of varying approaches ranging from the scientific ( trying to identify the exact identity of the illness , its symptoms and its vectors ) to the social ( trying to give a sense of the human impact of the disease ) . Within this ranges of approaches some have written more readable accounts than others . In The Great Mortality , Mr. Kelly definitely leans more towards the social approach and , as a writer , he is . . .not bad.The title itself indicates Mr. Kelly 's desire to give us a feel of the times . Terming this plague `` the Black Death '' is actually quite a modern designation . Writers in the day more accurately called the event `` the Great Mortality . `` In terms of the focus of the book , Mr. Kelly traces the progress of the mortality from the steppes of Asia through Italy , Spain , France , England and spaces far flung and in between . Always , he tries to track its logical progress and , always , he tries to give us a sense of its impact on the people by quoting from writings and statistics of the time . Much of this primary source material is fascinating though it is sometimes feast or famine . England , for example , seems to get more attention simply because it is from there that we have more records of the time . Still , there is a lot of good stuff here about a lot of places and events.The problem with this book is that , overall , it gives the impression of a certain vagueness . There is an expected amount of uncertainty dealing with an historical event so many centuries ago ; however , as a reader , I like to get the sense that the author I 'm reading has a certain confidence in his assertions and his sources . Mr. Kelly 's anecdotes get quite circular as he recounts tale after tale of death and the medieval writer 's tendency toward hyperbole can make things difficult but he rarely draws conclusions and is sometimes unclear when he does . He often quotes things like death rates for different regions but always in ranges and rarely spells out why he decides to settle on a certain figure . He notes the extraordinarily high death rate for clergy in England and implies that this is because of their care for the people but then hints that they might not really have been doing there jobs so well after all . This kind of writing can get a bit unsettling.However , these are quibbles in what is basically a well written account . As a math & science teacher , my tastes tend more towards the scientific accounts of the plague but I found this book quite enjoyable . I would n't say Mr. Kelly manages to take us back to the fourteenth century but he gives us a taste of it and definitely gives us a logical and informative look back . I recommend it .	1
If you love a story about orphans , and mischevious bad guys , and parents and most of all ... family , this is a great book , and perhaps a gift , for younger readers . A great story with great life-lessons !	1
I have this part of my classroom library . My fifth grade students , well some of them , have picked this up and read it . A fun read .	1
My little second grader really enjoyed this story ! She thought it was funny and related to it . She will read this one again !	1
Even though I agree with most of what he says , I still feel vaguely dissatisfied , like his thoughts are n't the last word on any of the topics he covers . I feel that beyond his very simple and straightforward arguments , there are further complications and subtleties that he does n't touch on . I 'm supportive of the mission of utilitarian thinkers to set up rational foundations for our practices and decisions , but I feel like there is much further work that needs to be done in this area to bridge the still wide gap between utilitarian theories and the infinitely more complex world and society it seeks to understand . I guess I 'm looking for an approach that combines the pragmatism and clarity of analytic philosophy with the richness and sophistication of continental philosophy , and I have n't found it yet , neither here nor anywhere else .	1
This book was so realistic ! You really got a taste of what people went through in the concentration camps . It made me realize what we take for granted . Can you imagine eating bread made out of sawdust ? Can you imagine eating in the same cup you used the bathroom in ? This book is about a 12 year old boy named Jack who is separated from his family . Almost immediately he is taken into a concentration camp . The book focuses on Jack 's struggle to survive in the camp for 3 years . If you enjoy World War 2 , then I 'd recommend this book for you .	1
When I was in college back in the early 80s I felt a strange attraction towards Solzhenitsyn 's books.I read many of them twice.The reason was as I read them I felt a strong bond with Solzhenitsyn.I think somehow fate wanted me to read these books at that time to prepare my own mind for the struggles that lay ahead in my own life and to perhaps put them into perspective.This is the story of people from different walks of life including highly educated intellectuals who are cast into a brutal and sinister environment.Solzhenitsyn himself was one of those people . A very gifted writer . This is the story of his journey.After I read books I do n't have space to keep them all so I give a lot of them away.However I have hard cover issues of the Gulag Archipelago books as well as my all time favorite 'The First Circle ' . They have made it into my permanent book collection.Who knows maybe someday I may brush them off and read them a third time.Jeff MarzanoThe Mind of Adolf Hitler ( The Secret Wartime Report ) Cancer WardThe First Circle ( European Classics ) Hogan 's Heroes - The Complete Third SeasonMein Kampf	1
This book is a learning experience . It is somewhat difficult reading , but it contains so many valuable lessons about life . The book made me think of Buddhism , although it was never mentioned . It is filled with descriptions of the torture the inhabitants of the gulags went through ; on looking back on reading these I concluded that it was important to laboriously read and think about all of these painful experiences in order to genuinely feel the insights the author gained . Here is a condensed quote : `` It was granted to me to carry away from my prison years ... how a human being becomes evil and how good ... it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sense within myself the first stirrings of good ... And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil ... good is retained . And even in the best of all hearts , there remains.. an unuprooted small corner of evil . '' But I feel this message would not really have gotten to me if I had n't read all about the horrible prison experience .	1
What 's nice about this survey ( or any survey ) is that you 're bound to find half the essays good and half bad with one or two essays that are spot on . Personally , I think the key to enjoying this book is to skip the sections that you do n't click with -- though I have to say I wanted to skip the exerpt from A Savage God and I 'm glad I didn't.This book is also interesting if you 're a writer since it offers so many different writing styles . Sort of reminds me of an episode of , I think , Sesame Street in which two painters rendered the same tree . Here , different writers render their own version of a similar emotion , depression . Definitely worth reading .	1
Sometimes a full book of ones personal account of depression or other illness can be too much . This book shares one chapter from each of the authors about their experience centering around their serious depression or someone close to them . I have read the full book by William Styron.. `` Darkness Visible '' That was excellent ... ive found no other more complete account of Melancholia or more descriptive than his . Granted though , each persons depression is at least a bit different . There is one chapter in Unholy Ghost from Darkness Visible .	1
I love Dr William Glasser and his Choice theory . In this book he takes this process and shows parents how to use it with their & # 34 ; unhappy teens & # 34 ; . Too bad we ca n't clone Dr Glasser I would love to work with him ! : )	1
Are the novels of Marian Keyes assumed to be for women and lightweight ? Ha , I 'm a guy and could n't tell a sandal from a mule . I read Marian Keyes and I do n't go to the beach and I do n't like things simple . Although not intellectually challenging , this book tells a great story with wit and intelligence . I had a weekend to myself and wanted something I could read which would entertain me , transport me and allow me to leave my so-called thinking brain somewhere else so I could relax . In other words , I just wanted a good book and not a Pulitzer Prize winner . I was happy to find it in ANGELS.Maggie lives in Dublin and finds out her husband is involved with someone else . She leaves him , and after vegetating for a few weeks with her parents and sisters , splits for Los Angeles to visit her best friend Emily . There she encounters Hollywood types and hijinks , and the weird but really entertaining world of the movie industry . Emily 's best friends , her neighbors and her script-writing career drive this story into high gear as Maggie discovers a new world and herself . As we go along on this fun ride we learn why Maggie and her husband have reached an impasse and why pain can be a touchstone for growth.The Hollywood setting and Maggie 's Irish family ( who show up in Los Angeles and add to the frivolity ) make this a lot of fun but there 's an unexpected punch here when Maggie reviews her two miscarriages and teenage abortion and their influence on her marriage . These are handled by Marian Keyes with so much depth that I was taken aback by being so suddenly immersed in another world of pain , loss and confusion . Not all of this book is comedy and not all of it can be dismissed as simple entertainment .	1
With its combination of high divers , Detroit con men , hard up waitresses with love in their hearts , casino denizens and good ole boys all wrapped up as Civil War Reenactors , Tishomingo Blues is one of the cleverest and most entertaining of Elmore 's offerings . Dennis Lenahan has seen a murder from his high platform he should n't have seen . This is the man who knew too much motif on steroids.The plotting is sharp , the dialogue is funny and wicked , and the imaginative mix of characters is constantly on the move . With Mr. Leoard gone , we wo n't have more than one more Elmore to savor . For those who have missed him up till now , this is a very good book with which to start a delightful and now sadly limited reading program	1
I bought this book in 2011 and finally decided to read it.First , let me tell you `` where I am '' in fitness . I am a 62-year old male , who WAS morbidly obese and diabetic 2 years ago . I beat the diabetes completely ( which is another topic ) and have lost about 65 lbs.Note that this was all before I read this book.When I picked up this book I had been doing weight training for a month , 6 days per week , so I had some pretty clear benchmarks to begin with . I saw more improvement in from the first 3 sessions than I had from my previous 24 sessions of conventional lifting . *have a Body Solid home gym . *adopted the 2-session program from the book . *started with workouts every 5 days , then went to 6 days . *First workout was Aug. 7th , 2013 . *This is being written on Sept 18th , 2013 , about 6 weeks after the 1st workout.These are successive workouts since then . The example exercise is compound row.1 . 85 lbs for 40 secs2 . 100 lbs for 80 secs.3 . 100 lbs for 100 secs.4 . 110 lbs for 98 seconds.5 . 120 lbs for 102 seconds.6 . 120 lbs for 60 seconds . ( short 1 day of rest ! ) 7 . 130 lbs for 136 seconds ! ! ! ! 8 . 140 lbs for 105 seconds.So , assuming that the first workout was an inaccurate benchmark because of technique issues , let 's use the 2nd workout as the benchmark.Since then I have gone from a 100 lbs lift for 80 seconds to 140-lb lift for 105 seconds . That is a 40 % greater lift and 31 % gain in time , a truly remarkable result.Another exercise- Lat Pulldown:1 . 80 lbs for 40 secs2 . 85 lbs for 35 secs ... .8 . 120 lbs for 83 seconds.A 41 % increase in weight and a 137 % in time ( from exercise # 2 ) .All of my exercise results are like this.My wife is also on the program ( with my coaching ) . She has had very similar results with no real previous weight training experience.As crazy as this sounds , we are now in the gym for only about 25-30 minutes EACH WEEK ! The only bad news is that I truly miss the daily exercise but the gains are just so much worth it . In the near future I am planning on adding cardio for a couple of days each week.I hope this helps you decide that this book is worth a look .	1
Zickerman 's humorous style makes this book fun to read even though you are reading a book about pain ( otherwise known as working out ) . He is right on the money about weight training verses aerobics . Tons of personal success stories are very motivating .	1
A few years ago , I started using the Power of 10 workout . I started with a trainer to understand the method , but then I pretty much followed the program in the book . This was all I did for 12 weeks , my diet was ok , and I still won the women 's division of the body transformation contest at my gym .	1
Being a Beatles fan , I am wary of how the `` lads '' are portrayed in books & media . I like a balanced POV of a band that was both a musical & cultural phenomenon and whose music ( for the most part ) still sounds as fresh and exciting as the day it was recorded . That being said , I think the author did a fairly balanced job of portraying them as talented , intelligent yet without mythologizing them . I especially liked how he showed the unique contributing factors of their native Liverpool & later , Hamburg 's ) influence on their music & look . They were originals , ( the first rock band to work as a collective unit , for example ) which we take for granted now and this book reminds of us this fact . ( though the author 's description of them as `` androgynous '' is a bit extreme , in my opinion ( perhaps `` boyish '' is a better term ) & their effect on the women 's movement is an interesting concept , if a bit over-stated . That being said This book is a fast , highly involving read that does make you appreciate the band 's contributions to popular music even more .	1
This review based on the print version of the book : I wish I could give this book 5 stars , but I ca n't . It 's a great read , and I recommended it to a lot of my friends , but something is missing.It 's a very well written story of someone who should , by his own account , be dead by now , who pretty much hit rock bottom , and was saved by the Dharma . That may sound strange , but it 's not a simple `` I found X , and now I 'm saved '' book . The author found a better way to live , a quieter way to live , and to appreciate life . He could still do the ( legal ) things he enjoyed , and probably even enjoyed them more . Great story , great life lesson.But I would have preferred if he would have put as much detail into his `` awakening '' as he did in his juvenile life . A minor knock to be sure , but something that stuck with me after I was done .	1
This is just one in a series about Major Abel Jones of the Union army during the American Civil War . Maj. Jones was born in Wales and the story is told first person through his eyes and his viewpoint and his Welsh mannerisms . All are riveting and painful , and are even more enlightening than the Jeff Shaara books .	1
I 'm always wary of historical novels , since they have a tendency to transfer 21st Century sensibilities to their subject matter . Owen Parry ( whose real name is Ralph Peters , the great Russian expert and strategic thinker ) avoids that , creating a hero and a story which live and breath the Civil War era . I was impressed , although not overly so , with the first book of the series , but I am increasingly moved by every addition to the series.Major Abel Jones is pompous and priggish and if were n't so clever in solving murder mysteries , he would be a classic comic figure ( one on-going theme is the pride this Welshman takes in his singing voice , when it 's obvious ( though not to him ) that it 's rather awful ) .The walk on parts of various historical figures is impressive . I always judge the walk ons in historical novels by using as my gold standard the Abraham Lincoln in George MacDonald Fraser 's Flashman series : lovely little vignettes which both capture the essence of the man and allow the reader to see his hero in a new light . In River Jordan , Parry manages a General Grant who is every bit as real as Fraser 's Lincoln . That is the first time I can say that about anyone 's novel about any era .	1
Fav Author of mine . Already had in a worn old copy of paperback and downloaded digital for reread during kiddos practice in pm . Yum !	1
She may be a Seattle Times columnist , but Jane Alcott was surprised when her boss put her on team coverage of the Chinooks , Seattle 's NHL hockey team . Surprised , but in need of the money from the extra income , so Jane gritted her teeth and started to cram hockey stats and rules into her head and prepared herself to travel with the team . Just one small problem ... the team wanted nothing to do with her and initiated a thorough , if passive ( and ... uh ... eye-opening ) , shutout and intimidation campaign.One of the worst was Luc `` Lucky '' Martineau , decorated goalie and big dollar talent for the Chinooks . Though much of his reputation as one of the baddest bad boys in hockey is a mix of lies and exaggeration , he is walking attitude and pretty upfront about his dislike of Jane 's career , her appearance , and her traveling with the team . Every chance he gets he 's either riling her up or stirring up his team members to annoy or ignore her.She thinks Luc 's good looks are exceeded only by his arrogance . He thinks her gloomy wardrobe and flat chest are personality flaws . Both would be happy if they never had to speak to the other . Neither can stop thinking about the other . Suddenly road trips are a lot more interesting for both Jane and Luc , and that pesky , inexplicable attraction sparking to life between them is hot enough to melt ice rinks from coast to coast.Light , breezy , and fun , See Jane Scoregave me exactly the sort of reading pleasure I was looking for when I picked it up . Jane and Luc were likable and perfect foils for each other , and Gibson moved the plot along at a lively pace . Sure , there were some predictable elements , some formula that is familiar to the genre , but the make-it-or-break-it points were firmly stacked in the make-it column for me.I 'll admit , I have a weakness for sassy , intelligent spitfires and the men who fall helplessly under their spell . Jane , for all her lack of fashion sense and her pessimistic views towards matters of the heart , did n't back down from a fight , was n't afraid to speak her mind , and was more than capable of going toe-to-toe with a gorgeous hockey star bigger and stronger than she . I admired her chutzpah , that 's for sure . Beyond that , she had an endearing ability to be both vulnerable and dignified that was very appealing.Luc was the prototypical male 's male , with a `` friend '' in every city and a self confidence that more than bordered arrogance , it crossed wildly into arrogance waving banners of its awesomeness . Behind that , though , in the dark recesses he let no one see , was an aging hockey star who had suffered a near career-ending injury to both knees and had pulled himself back from the edge of pain and pain reliever addiction with sheer stubbornness and determination . Hockey was obviously his life , and he loved his life , but he knew the pain and the work required to live it . And while he was arrogant , and started out seeming very superficial , his vulnerabilities and his confusion - in dealing with a growing attraction for Jane and in raising his teenaged sister , humanized him . I liked him , and I liked Jane , and I loved them together.I also loved the secondary characters , from Jane 's best friend Caroline , to Luc 's sister Marie , and of course Darby ... poor , hapless Darby . They added a lot of depth to the story and helped round out the main characters ' lives beyond hockey and reporting , and the plotlines and threads that included them added depth to the romance story arc . Gibson fleshed the book out nicely with them , and with the more ancillary characters of the other hockey players.The premise for Jane becoming the team 's sports reporter was a little hokey and unbelievable . The woman did n't know sports , let alone hockey , and the idea that other sports reporters at the paper would n't have gotten first dibs on the assignment was a little hard to swallow . The end , too , with its predictable conflict between Jane and Luc , gave me some trouble.I do n't mind knowing that the relationship is going to have at least one major conflict that it has to survive to get to the Happily Ever After . I do n't even mind , not in this sort of light read , anyway , seeing it coming as soon as the potential for conflict is explained in the story . That 's just something I accept as a fan of the genre . What bothered me in this case , though , was when in the story it happened and the manner in which it got resolved.It came so late in the book , and the core issues that led to it were so quickly glossed over , that the wait for it ended up being more significant than the issue itself . Instead of seeming like a genuine stumbling block that got true issues out in the open and expanded and solidified Luc and Jane 's relationship , the conflict was discussed and resolved in what seemed like a mad rush to the book 's finish line , just one more plot point to touch on before the end . I ended up feeling a little cheated by it . Some of that was assuaged by a truly lovely epilogue , but only some of it.See Jane Scoreis a light romance designed to be fun and sexy , and on that score it definitely delivered . I gobbled it up like the brain candy it was . Yes , I had a couple of issues , but in the end , Gibson gave me exactly what I was hoping for when I started reading . A few hours of escapist fun that did n't make me think too hard ( except , of course , about hockey terminology ) , and made me smile a whole bunch . I enjoyed it immensely.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another .	1
I have read a fair number of RG books and I will admit that there are some that were better than others . I ranked this one a little closer to loving it compared to just liking it . While the premise of the story does happen to mimic some of RG 's other books , she does at least try to make each of her stories their own . With that being said , here is where the predictability comes to focus ... .Daisy , Steven , and Jack were best of friends growing up . A classic love triangle formed when they got older . While the pact was broken , friendships were torn apart and years of holding onto resentment , anger and also love , we got to hear the story of how that thick-as-thieves friendship was put to the test as well as how it gets mended along with the reveal of a secret that should have been told way earlier.While it is understandable about Jack 's anger at the secret that was kept from him for 15 years , I had a little problem with how the mending managed to happen . Daisy never got the chance to explain herself nor did she get the chance to understand fully what Jack was thinking . Also , the story about Steven was left to speculation regarding his intentions . At least there was some mention of how things changed in their past . I would have at least hoped that there would have been a better tie between their childhood and the point where the book began . Well , that and to have Jack realize how important he was to Daisy as well as how painful it was for her to leave him and marry Steven while carrying his unborn child . I understand the loss of parents , but it did not get the recognition it deserved when it came to being the excuse for Daisy and Jack to part ways and marry Steven.As we all know that there is a happy ever after in these books , I would have wanted to see at least an epilogue to what happened after Daisy said yes to Jack and how it Nathan ( their son that Jack did not know about for his first 15 years of life ) handled it . Where was the moment that Nathan embraced his biological father and would finally call him `` dad '' . While the ending left us knowing that there was a happily ever after , it does feel a little unfinished.I enjoyed the book regardless of those lower than I would have thought of ratings , but I know that people have certain expectations when it comes to what they read and will rate accordingly . As this book was predictable from the beginning , I will say that it was enjoyable nonetheless and I would suggest it to a friend . In fact , I may reread it someday ... not real soon , but someday .	1
After having read all of Rachel Gibson 's book in one week , I read Daisy in one day . Each of her books kept getting better and better and I actually liked this one very much.I had read the lower ratings that she was getting for this one so I was a little apprehensive about it . I decided the best way to enjoy Daisy is to not compare it to her other books.I gave it four stars because I truly felt all the emotions that the characters did even if I did n't always agree with what was happening . It was very well written and one I hope to reread some day .	1
Love is hard to know for sure when two people seem to only lust after one another . A broken marriage can make one unsure if lust is enough to make one try again . Happy endings .	1
I purchased this book and read it all in one sitting . It is another hit for Rachel Gibson . Her hockey players are unforgettable and the way she works them into a story is wonderful . Kate Hamilton comes home to help her Grandfather with his business and to help him move on with his life two years after her Grandmothers death . On the way to Gospel , Idaho she stops at a ski lodge for the night , Valentine 's night at that , as she drowns her sorrows , an attractive man sits next to her and the next thing she knows she is propositioning him to spend the night with her . He turns her down flat and leaves the bar . A few weeks later she meets him again , his name is Rob Sutter former hockey bad boy owner of the sporting goods store across the street from her Grandfathers store.. sparks ignite ! One thing leads to another and they give clean-up on aisle 5 a whole new meaning ! This book is full of the trademark Rachel Gibson mix of humor , love and warmth . The characters are likable and the backstory between Rob 's mother and Kate 's grandfather is adorable . I give this book Five Stars ( ok Five HEARTS- for the Holiday ) !	1
Who would have thought it ? This is an autobiography by a fameous actor , who won more than one Lifetime Oscar , and a Jew , who did n't disclose his identity early on , but after a number of near-death experiences , not only returns to the God of his fathers , but commits to his second bar mitzvah . This in my book is a miracle ! Kirk Douglas ' life turn-around not only chronicles his return to God , but his return to the stage , after suffering a debilitating stroke , leaving him void of speach . From near suicide to full recovery , this autobiography will pump courage into the discouraged to keep on pressing toward the goal.In My Stroke of Luck , Douglas reveals that once he returned to the God of his fathers , he began to really care about others and , thereby , health and strength became his once more . An excellent testimony for all of us to heed .	1
This book is very well written and has been a wonderful help to me . I find myself rereading sections when I find myself in a particular situation . This book would be good for anyone going through trust issues .	1
Dr. Thomas C. Foster is a Michigan Professor of English who has written this bestseller and its sequel `` How To Read Novels Like a Professor '' . This is the initial volume published in paperback by Quill in 2003.Foster is well versed in all aspects of the literary field from ancient works to fiction by living writers . In his lively little book he introduces us to such terms as the following : Seasons ; Food ; the Bible , Greek and Latin classical allusions and the world of fairy tales . He discusses irony , plote , motif and theme . All of this can be found elsewhere and in greater depth but Foster does an adequate job by using cogent illustrations from outstanding works such as `` The Alexandrine Quartet '' of Lawrence Durrell ; '' A Clockwork Orange '' by Anthony Burgess ; `` Grendel '' by John Gardner as well as classics penned by such notables as Dickens , Henry James , James Joyce , D.H. Lawrence and the ancient Greek dramatists . He also uses examples from African-American , Latin American and Native American works which is commendable . I especially enjoyed his contention that the chief character in Hemingway 's `` The Old Man and the Sea '' is a Christ figure.The best part of the book was the chapter in which we are asked to peruse Katherine Mansfield 's `` The Garden Party '' short story and then analyze it using the tools of the literary critic which we have acquired1 This was great fun ! Valid interpretations of a literary work are myriad making it fun to become engrossed in literature ! Foster alludes to the sonnet and Shakespeare but otherwise has little to say about legitimate drama . The book is a beginner 's guide not for the advanced literary scholar . It will keep your interest for several hours ; you will learn new ways of looking at old books and you will become a better reader . Recommended !	1
I like the way Gaiman writes with a little humor all throughout the book . It keeps the boring parts interesting and makes everything more realistic when you read it . At first a little slow but the story picks up quick and there is plenty of action throughout . I definitely recommend .	1
The story is about a man named Richard who is stuck in an ordinary life , with little say in where it 's going . But one event changes all of that , throwing him into the pit of London Underground where nothing is normal , and certain death ( or at least uncomfortable torture ) is lurking around every corner . Richard grows from being a spineless character who only does what he 's told to a man who learns how to take control of his own destiny and fight for the things he believes in . Most important , he discovers what those things are - the things that make him feel more alive.This was the first book I 've ever read by Neil Gaiman . What I love about his writing is how he creates this whole world , but does n't overcomplicate the flow of the story . He has a way of describing a scene , a person , a scenario without lingering too long in the details . I had a clear picture if what was going on , and how each person moved or spoke . I look forward to reading more of his books .	1
Richard is not the kind of guy to make waves . He lives a normal life in London with a fianc & eacute ; e who tells him what to do and a good-enough job where he performs well even if he does n't distinguish himself . That all changes the day he sees what appears to be a homeless girl on the sidewalk who is hurt . When he stops to help her , his life cecomes entwined with the underworld of London , a place full of hardship , danger , deprivation and totally unlike anything he has ever experienced before . He also discovers that if he wants his old life back , he 'll have to be daring in ways he never thought he could be.Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman takes the reader on an adventure in a richly imagined world with demented assassins that live for centuries , a family that can open doors where there are none , a separate underground system existing alongside London 's Tube , along with the darkness and dirt you would expect to find in a world below.Richard has never considered himself a hero or any kind of risk taker . He has always plodded along doing the thing expected of him . But thrown out of his normal life , and with his life threatened , he learns to call upon personal resources he never imagined he had . His relationships with the characters he meets in the underworld are more intense than any he has had above ground . It all makes him wonder if regaining his old life is really what he wants.Neverwhere is a great book for mother-daughter book clubs with girls aged 16 and up . Discussion can center around the world Gaiman creates as well as Richard 's struggle between his desire for his old life and his thrill at stepping out of the bounds he has created for himself . That theme should resonate well with girls on the cusp of finishing high school and moving on to what comes next .	1
Nuff said . Classic early Gaiman is imaginative , creepy in some places and hilarious in others , charming all over the place . If you love well-written fantasy , you 'll love this .	1
I love Neil Gaiman . This book did n't disappoint . It a good story that is easy to follow . Entertaining and fun .	1
This is n't the first Neil Gaiman I 've read , having also listened to the author himself read an unabridged version of 'Coraline , ' and having read in print 'Good Omens . ' I like his urban fantasy ( dark usually ) style quite a bit.This story follows Richard , a fella who lives a rather normal life in a rather normal part of London , and who , out with a girl you 'd rather he not live a normal life with , bumps into a small young woman who basically falls at his feet , beaten and bloody . Richard , being the nice guy , picks her up and helps her recover.You know that adage about no good deed going unpunished ? Woah.Richard ends up running from two demonic sorts , after the girl , into 'London Below , ' with the added bonus of that place sucking his above-London life into some sort of void , where no one can remember him . Before he 's done , he 'll suffer , try to find the girl , suffer , try to rescue the girl , suffer , meet an angel , and suffer . And there 's some suffering , too.As always , Neil Gaiman 's villains , and his heroes , have a fantastic depth to them , and the other characters are shifty and confusing enough that you ca n't quite figure out anyone 's motives . It 's a great story to listen to - and even though it was abridged , the sound effects and reading voice really added a great deal of tone to the story . I 'm a little bit tempted to go find this unabriged and/or in print . The world itself is easy to slip into , deep and dark and just wonderfully full of shadowy danger.I think I need to find more Gaiman , regardless . 'Nathan	1
Neverwhere is one of Gaiman 's best yet ! I highly recommend this novel !	1
This being my first Gaiman novel , I did n't quite know what to expect . I saw MirrorMask and was very impressed so I thought that I would enjoy the read , but I had no idea how much.Richard Mayhewis a sympathetic if somewhat whiney character who does not seem to be particiapting in his own life very much . in fact he gives new meaning to the phrase mild mannered , drifting through a painfully avarage exsistance almost literally apologising for being alive . With a girlfriend who 's in love with his `` potential '' , only one real friend , and a job where he 's barely noticed . Richard is hardly living on the edge . Then in one night with one random act of kindness his safe , sane , predictable life quite literally disappers . Richard finds himself traversing the eerie darkness , and nightmarish unreality of London Below . traveling with a motley crew that may very well get Richard killed . He unwillingly joins a quest to help a young girl with mysterious ablities solve the murder of her family . All while being persued by seemingly immortal assassins . Contracted by an anonymous employer.Admittedly the first few chapters were slow , but it 's completely worth hanging in there . Neverwhere is elegant , inventive , and as rich as a vintage photograph . I 'll definetly be reading more from Mr. Gaiman	1
Classic Gaiman . Predictable ending.but a quite fun read , all in all . My favorite Gaiman writing has still got to be The Sandman , which is a hard act to follow .	1
This is my first Gaiman book and I enjoyed it all the way through . I do n't read a lot of sci fi but I will read other books by this author . A great twist in the story and very believable characters . Gaiman is able to paint a really clear picture with his writing . I was able to see London below and all of the characters . I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read !	1
Richard Mayhew is one of the most appealing `` nice guy protagonists '' I 've ever run across . He 's kind-hearted , unassuming , and altruistic . And it 's his altruism that catapults him into another world : London Below.If you become a denizen of London Below , you 're all-but-invisible in London , which is known by those who dwell Below as London Above . But Richard knows nothing of London Below when he and his fussy , relentlessly self-absorbed fianc & eacute ; e , Jessica , are on their way to meet Jessica 's boss for dinner and run across an injured young girl in the street . Richard tells Jessica to go on , that he must help the young girl because she 's bleeding . Jessica hardly seems to see the young girl and warns Richard , quite nastily , that if he skips dinner to help the girl , their engagement is off.Arrrgh . No wonder I was glad for Richard to fall through the cracks . It got him away from that awful woman . Alas , I 'm getting ahead of myself.The young girl is from a family of Openers in London Below . Her name , fittingly *wink* , is Door , and she can open all kinds of doors , portals , and passageways . Her family has been killed , and she , the survivor , is on the run from a vile duo of men -- at least they 're shaped like men -- whose names are Croup and Vandemar.Door does n't tell Richard about London Below , but after he helps her with her injuries and assists her with contacting other people in London Below to get her safely away , he discovers that because he 's had extended contact with residents of London Below , people in his world , London Above , can no longer see him . He ca n't hail a cab to get to work and once he gets there , extremely late , nobody can see him . Jessica no longer knows him . To make matters worse , strangers move into his apartment on top of him as though he were n't even there.To get to the bottom of his predicament , Richard sets out to find Door , and as fun as things have been up to this point , the real fun starts here . Soon he , Door , Hunter ( Door 's bodyguard -- a powerful woman who lives to hunt prey ) , and the self-styled Marquis de Carabas ( who owes Door a favor ) are journeying together in search of a Key to bring to a wingless Angel , Islington , who holds the key , in the figurative sense , to the mystery of who killed Door 's family and also to Richard 's way back home to London Above . If they bring Islington the physical Key , he 'll give them , in return , their keys to what they want.But there 's a catch . A big catch . In Neverwhere , nothing is what it seems.The story is laden with mythical overtones , cultural references and social commentary . Richard and his friends in London Below call to mind Dorothy and her companions in The Wizard of Oz . There are allusions to John Milton 's Paradise Lost . And London Below strikes me as an allegory for the plight of homeless people , the dispossessed , those who have fallen through the cracks or through the Gap , if you will ( `` Mind the Gap '' means something very different to those who populate London Below than it does to those who live in London Above ) ; people who are all-too-often tragically `` invisible '' to those who live `` normal '' lives.And I love the way in which this book suggests that `` normal '' life , as it 's lived by people who adhere to some sort of Lemming-See , Lemming-Do Life Script , may just be tremendously overrated , at least with regard to society 's presumption of its desirability for everyone.One of my favorite chapters in Neverwhere is where Richard is put to the test to get the Key from the Black Friars , who are its keeper . During his trial , Richard is led to believe that the entire time he 's been in London Below , he 's actually been wandering about in London , hopelessly insane and disconnected from reality . I shivered all the way through.I do n't want to give anything away , but I loved the ending to this book . I tore through the last few pages , the last few paragraphs , the last few sentences , to find ... hmmm , well . Again , I do n't want to have any spoilers here . But the ending was perfect , masterful.Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer with a formidable imagination , and I will run , not walk , to read more of his books .	1
So the blurb says & # 34 ; Richard Mayhew is a young man with a good heart and an ordinary life , which is changed forever when he stops to help a girl he finds bleeding on a London sidewalk. & # 34 ; Now , if you 're expecting a knight in shining armor with a quest to save the damsel in distress , you can just drop this book . Because Richard Mayhew is the one who needs saving.Richard leaned against a wall , and listened to their footsteps , echoing away , and to the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping station of East London , and the sewage works . & # 34 ; Shit , & # 34 ; he said . And then , to his surprise , for the first time since his father died , alone in the dark , Richard Mayhew began to cry.CharactersWow , I 'm so used to perfect , alpha males as MCs that I was totally taken aback to have met Richard Mayhew . He 's the sweet , & # 34 ; safe & # 34 ; boyfriend who would make a dull , henpecked husband in the future . He 's a bit of a muddlehead - the kind who messes up his appointments and locks himself out . Richard Mayhew is , for lack of a better word , a total pussy. & # 34 ; Richard began to understand darkness : darkness as something solid and real , so much more than a simple absence of light . He felt it touch his skin , questing , moving , exploring : gliding through his mind . It slipped into his lungs , behind his eyes , into his mouth . . . & # 34 ; Then we have the other characters . Lady Door , the bleeding girl , has the ability to open doors . Now , do n't let my ineloquence fool you - it 's an extraordinary gift . However , she 's a total *yawn* . Her companions ; marquis de Carabas and Hunter are much stronger and notable characters . And the antagonists were really dark , violent , magnificently thought-out characters . It was like as if Neil Gaiman had spent more time developing the secondary characters than the MCs.Storyline and WritingI have never heard of Neil Gaiman before this . But one fine day , the local bookstore had dedicated a whole section just for his books . And that got me intrigued . Further probing around GR got me to believe that Neil Gaiman is a magnificent storyteller . It was evident , from beginning to end , that he is excellent at creating this parallel universe. & # 34 ; So the day became one of waiting , which was , he knew , a sin : moments were to be experienced ; waiting was a sin against both the time that was still to come and the moments one was currently disregarding. & # 34 ; How do I categorise Neverwhere ? I grew up reading Roald Dahl 's children 's books and watching the movie adaptation . Do you remember the movie & # 34 ; The Witches & # 34 ; ? It scared the hell out of me . I could vaguely remember the part where the little boy was forced to drink this potion that turned him into a mouse . I could n't help thinking about that movie while reading Neverwhere . It gave me the same chills as The Witches . Neverwhere reminds me of Roald Dahl 's , ironically , children 's fiction : dark and violent.Conclusion : Do n't let the MCs deter you from attempting this well-written piece by Neil Gaiman !	1
Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman creates an amazing world that seems utterly plausible . It is a rare fantasy novel that feels completely real - I was halfway through this book when it finally dawned on me that I was , in fact , reading a fantasy novel - something which I seldom do . Gaiman 's prose carries the reader along at a breathless pace and each character he introduces is somehow even more interesting and engaging than the last . The world of fantasy is the one Neil Gaiman is best known for inhabiting , but the bottom line is that he is , without question , a great storyteller .	1
I used this beautiful picture book to prepare my lesson for Garden Club . The Garden Club liked it so much that we purchased it for the local Grade School library .	1
Well was n't this a thriller . The characters were a mixture . Fran was sure a victim . Poor guy . Susan turned him into a girl ? Wow . Big John seemed to come out okay . Many times ... many , many times . The Bobsey twins , the writer/agent got dragged out of the closet . Again by the fearsome Susan . Wow , what a broad . The neighborhood garbage guy probably was n't even safe from her wiley charms . Again , Mr. Block is the Grand Master . Good book .	1
When I read this book , I was shocked at first ; here is a method that turns & quot ; conventional wisdom & quot ; about dieting on its head ( that 's why this book offends so many & quot ; nutritionists & quot ; , it violates principles they 've long accepted as gospel ) ! But , I 'd known many people who had been successful at it , so I decided to give it a try . Sure enough , six weeks and thirty five pounds later , I can say that there really is something here.My advise to anyone with a weight problem would be to read the book and give it a serious chance without breaking the rules , then learn its lessons and apply them to their own weight loss program . As far as & quot ; lessons go , I 'd specifically mention the following:1 . There are two ways to lose weight . One is to reduce the amount of calories one consumes until the body is not able to maintain its short-term fuel , causing long-term reserves to be burned instead ( and weight loss ) . The other way ( I 've learned from this book ) is to lower carbohydrate intake to the point that the body automatically begins using long-term reserves , due to the hierarchy of how the body processes food . Which method is best for you ? That 's up to you . But at least this book arms you with the knowledge of how your body processes work.2 . The one thing that virtually all diet experts agree upon is that refined sugars and simple carbohydrates are bad . No matter how you choose to eat , that fact should tell you something . ( Interestingly enough , those two items make up the great majority of & quot ; junk & quot ; foods produced by the food industry ... and therein lies the secret of understanding why things are the way they are ) . This book teaches you to eat real food ! As to my own experience with the Atkins Diet : Yes , I felt awful the first week . But that experience is short-lived , the body adapts , and the results have generally been positive . Will I remain eating this way all my life ? Doubtful ... I ca n't see myself eating meat like this forever . But whatever I do , I 'll have greater control over my weight than ever before , because I have a better understanding of how weight gain happens than I ever had before . This book has given me that .	1
The classic low-carb diet is back and it looks like it 's just as good as the original !	1
That may not sound like much but I have been trying for 2 years to lose weight and nothing was working . Due to working night shift and having a stressful job my metabolism is about as fast as a sloth , so this has been a breakthrough for me . As a RN the science of this diet for disease prevention and weight loss really makes sense to me.I have also noticed an improvement in my mood and energy also . The Induction phase was a lot easier than I thought it would be because I was eating the food ( meat , cheese and green leafy veggies ) that fill me up . Oatmeal , cereal and wheat bread has never done that for me . I could eat a bowl of cereal and 2 hours later I felt like chewing my own arm off.Anyway , I think this book is well worth your time . But I will say it will only work if you 're determined to stick it out . BTW , I 'm not Skip . This is his wife Dee .	1
I lost my old copy of this and just needed to replace it . I always lose weight on Atkins and just needed a memory refresher and reference .	1
High school is hard , and Russel Middlebrook is here to tell you it 's a whole lot harder when you 're gay . So Russel and his friends start a gay/straight/bisexual alliance support group called the `` Geography Club , '' because really , who would want to join a geography club ? Russel and his friends figure they 'll have a safe place where they can talk and support one another . But life is never that easy.Russel 's voice is real , and you will become a student at Goodkind High School as you read this book . He shows you what it feels like to be bullied and to be a bully . You 'll experience a first crush , the ups and downs of teen life , and what it 's like to be different . You 'll enjoy friendship and endure betrayal . And even though much of this book is serious matter , Russel tells it in an engaging , often humorous way , and if you do n't identify with the main character , you 'll want to be his bff.The admiral thing about Brent Hartinger 's ability as a writer is that even though this is a book about teen agers , adults will find it intriguing , enlightening , and enjoyable . This is the first book in the Russel Middlebrook series , and after just a few pages in , I was hooked . I highly recommend this series .	1
I enjoyed this book a lot more than I expected . It has interesting characters an interesting names for those characters , indeed . The whole mystery of Bad Blitz and it 's hated rats and rat catchers is interesting to me . This book was very different in many ways . I recommend this to fans of talking animals and quite different stories about them .	1
Let me give you an example of how seriously this author can mess with your mind : I was watching a CNN news clip concerning a New York City Taco Bell restaurant that was infested with rats , and I actually leaned forward to see if I could spot the tap-dancing rat ( his name is Sardines ) .Pratchett rules ! `` The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents '' is about a leader ( Hamnpork , not to be mistaken for Moses ) who dies before he enters the Promised Land ( an island without humans ) . The holy book of his people ( `` Mr. Bunnsy Has an Adventure '' ) is torn apart and thrown into a sewer . His followers are in disarray . Who can a rat turn to for help ? Well , there 's Darktan ( picture John Wayne playing a tough-but-tender-hearted-rat-sergeant ) , who treats his recruits in the trap-disabling squad with a sort of gruff-tough love.There 's also Maurice , the shifty , jiving cat who could be played by Will Smith ( with the addition of two chewed-up ears and a case of the mange ) . Maurice used to hang around the dump behind the Unseen University , where the wizards discarded their trash . He was just a regular alley cat until he ate a rat that had been nibbling candle-ends in the wizard 's dump . Now he and the rats can talk and think . Whereas the rats used to eat books , now they read them . Maurice acquires a stupid-looking street musician and together with the rats , they roam from village to village on Discworld , pulling the old Pied Piper scam . The rats invade the targeted village , widdling in the flour , gnawing on the sausages , and ( yes ) tap-dancing across kitchen floors with a straw hat and cane . The kid with the flute shows up , pipes the rats out of town , and is given a bag of money by the grateful villagers.Unfortunately for Maurice , his educated rats are acquiring ethics along with intelligence . They decide to hit one more village before retiring to the Promised Island -- -the village of Bad Blintz in the mountains of Uberwald.And as all serious Discworld fans know , there are stranger creatures in Uberwald than tap-dancing rats.I see that this book has been turned into a play , and other subterfuges for educating children , but it 's still pretty good Pratchett although a bit preachier than usual . The characters are as weird and wonderful as anything on Discworld and you DO N'T want to miss the scene where the stupid-looking kid and his tale-spinning friend confront the real rat catchers . What a perfect revenge !	1
A fun and amusing book , full of fascinating characters and witty banter . Reminded me slightly of the Rats of NIMH series .	1
I waited a long time to read this book . I love Terry Pratchett and I thought . . . `` A children 's book I shant like it ! He 'll have to simplify ! '' But I was wrong , silly me I should have known better . If you already like Terry Pratchett there is nothing not to like here . If you are new to Terry Pratchett and Discworld , this is n't a bad place to start . You wont be too confused and you 'll get in on the fun . Plus , if you do n't like the wee free men your crazy ! My inner monologue has not yet recovered . Crivens !	1
Since Amazon would n't post my negative review of this book , I guess I 'll just have to give it a positive review .	1
I have the feeling that Mr. Bourdain would hate the title that I have given to this review . I have the feeling that he is trying for something harder-edged and more gritty than `` a fun culinary romp '' . All the same , this is how I would characterize it.A Cook 's Tour has obviously had heavier editing and more attention to structure thanKitchen Confidential . It serves the book well , because while in Kitchen Confidential I struggled over Bourdan 's attempt to create Fear and Loathing in the Kitchen , I had no such problem with A Cook 's Tour . His skill and tone are best suited to these small chapters -- little moments of eating spread out across the world.The reflexive nature of his observations about the creation of his own television show work well . It is easy to imagine him wondering what he has let himself in for , and the uneasy relationship between his self-image and his new role as the charmingly bad boy chef of American television . I particularly enjoyed the writing about Vietnam and the chapter on the French Laundry . I enjoyed less his political opinions , even when I agreed with them ( surprisingly often ) . It did n't seem to fit with the book and felt like a desire to add a justificatory footnote to the television program.Recommended for foodies looking for a light , entertaining read .	1
Mr. Bourdain takes a tour through different parts of the world , mostly Asia , and lives on food most Westerners would n't want to look at . Yet many of the dishes and condiments he describes in loving and precise detail do make sense . Others he swallowed , I am sure , more or less on a dare . He gives us excellent chapters on the places he visits . But mainly it is the food , the hero of this book , that you can almost smell and taste . Some of the well-reasoned asides hit hard on vegetarians , on all the places where you can no longer smoke , and today 's pasteurized , sanitized and emasculated mass food production.If you are curious about unusual food , then this low-calory , high-intensity book is for you . Bon appetit .	1
Anthony Bourdain has a sweet job . Traveling the world , sampling its culinary delights ... its the kind of job that one would never even imagine exists until someone creates it . And it is a bit odd that he should have this job . Anthony Bourdain is not a great writer , although he manages to turn a decent phrase . I have no idea if he is a great cook or not , but by his own admission he is not one of the greats . He is a great traveler , and has enough courage and sense of adventure to give it all a try , even though things do n't always go well.Which is pretty much the same with `` A Cook 's Tour '' . I have never seen TV program that the book is based on , but I am a big fan of `` No Reservations '' so I suspected something along the same lines . This book follows much the same format of `` No Reservations '' , with Bourdain hitting various culinary spots across the world and trying what they have to offer , no matter what that might be . A whole pig in Portugal . Haggis in Scotland . All the goodness Mexico has to offer . And of course the infamous cobra 's heart in Vietnam . He does n't like everything he tries , but he tries everything that is offered.Its good . Its interesting . One of the great things about Bourdain 's style of travel-eating is that we could do it too . He does n't hit the high-priced , pretty and polished restaurants that most readers of the books could never afford . He hits the street stalls , the home cooking , and wonders at the delights of the common meals that make everyone happy . I have been to a few of the places showcased on `` A Cook 's Tour '' , and it makes for a nice walk down memory lane to think of breakfast vodka in Russia , or deep-fried pizza in Glasgow.Strangely enough , I think the one place he did n't get it right was in Japan , which is where I happen to live . I was looking forward to see what he would have to say about the place , and what delights he tried and what he thought . Instead , he had a traditional kaiseki dinner at a ryokan in Atami , accompanied by no less than two geisha . We are talking probably a multi-thousand dollar event here , something experienced only by the very super-rich of the Japanese populace . Not exactly `` eating local '' , and a bit of a disappointment .	1
The first section assumes you 're familiar with the Discworld novels , particularly the ones about Commander Vimes . If you are n't , you 'll be confused . If you are - read it today . It 's quick and clever , and I can only hope that the new characters show up in future novels .	1
Some years ago I grabbed a short book , reasd it , liked it a lot , than lost it ! Browsing through Kindle books I came upon that lost book then knew the authors . Raylon - not at all like this present book in genre happily showcases the author 's multi-diminsional ability 's . Regrettably , Elmore is no longer with us having died recently . Fortunately , he 's left us with a wonderful collectiorn of novels , short stories andnovella . Several of his works have been adapted to the big screen starring actors such as Paul Newman and J Lo . This guy is really good ! I 'll be buying more . Join me in sharing pleasurable reading . You 'll be glad you did .	1
Nancy in Tacoma , WA : Got ta love the slow walkin , slow talkin lawman who gets it done and how . The crafting of a western with history , action , interpersonal dynamics , realistic dialogue , a little love and the 'looming question ' is not for the faint of heart . This story is a great example of how all of those elements come together .	1
But a good read , none the less . The Kindle version was cheap and I was stuck in a place where I finished my book and my library card was not valid . I also read his novel : LaBrava under the same circumstance .	1
Richard Cohen knows about sorrow as well as joy . When he was twenty-five , life seemed to have endless promise . He was an up-and-coming television news producer who felt physically fit and self-confident . One day , Cohen dropped a coffee pot , and he chalked it up to a clumsy moment . On another occasion , he was standing at a curb and he lost his balance for no apparent reason . He gave these symptoms little thought until his leg began to itch and Cohen realized that the outside of the skin on his leg was completely numb . After speaking with his father , a physician , Cohen learned that he has multiple sclerosis , a devastating and potentially crippling disease. & quot ; Blindsided & quot ; is not just a story of sickness and physical deterioration . It is also a testament to the faith , love , and determination of a very special family . Cohen married Meredith Vieira after he was diagnosed with MS . They have three children whom they adore , and they have remained unified throughout many years of suffering and sacrifice . Besides his battle with MS , which has left him legally blind , Cohen has also survived two bouts of colon cancer.Each day , Cohen lives with the knowledge that he will most likely never recover his strength , that he can not work at the job he adores , and that his wife and children will see him growing weaker as the years pass . Yet , he chooses to fight back by doing his utmost to remain as strong as he can , and by setting an example of courage that is an inspiration to those who know him . Although Cohen 's prose is not subtle or elegant , his story is compelling , unforgettable , and unflinchingly honest . After reading this powerful book , most readers will consider every day of good health to be a tremendous blessing that should never be taken for granted .	1
Most parents with teenagers know all too well the highs and lows of teen life , alternating between manic bursts of happiness and spiraling , sudden depths of pain and confusion . But the author of this book , Martha To Dudman , has a daughter who goes beyond even the extreme highs and lows of many teens . She is truly in trouble , deep in emotional pain and taking out much of her frustration and anger on her mother . There is one paragraph in this book which struck home to me and echoed my own fears and worries ( and probably that of most parents ) when their teen is particularly emotional or upset : & quot ; When your daughter is eleven , when your daughter starts to act different , you do n't know if it is because her parents are divorced . You do n't know if it 's because her mother works too much , or because your daughter 's too smart for her classes , or because she has maybe a learning disability you never caught , or because her teacher ... is n't smart enough to teach your daughter . Or maybe it does n't have anything to do with school at all . Maybe she is becoming a teenager and this is how they act . Maybe they are supposed to be quiet like this and stay up in their rooms. & quot ; Honesty like this runs through this book , the kind of gut-felt honesty that speaks from the heart- and reached the heart of this reader . I 'd say this one is a MUST for parents of teenagers , highly recommended for anyone else as well .	1
When I was rearing my children back in the 70s and 80s I knew about ` authoritarian ' discipline and ` permissive ' parenting but neither met my needs or , more importantly , the needs of my children . I knew there was another way . Among the mothers I knew were many who enjoyed being parents and whose children I liked . They followed another path , one that had no name . Barbara Coloroso not only gives it a name -- backbone parenting -- she gives understandable , feasible guidelines for doing it.Being a parent with a backbone starts with the golden rule : treat your children as you would like to be treated yourself.On page 12 , Coloroso tells the story of how , even with all the behavior modification techniques she had learned as a special education teacher , she found that she could n't control a child dedicated to not being controlled . That story alone is worth the price of the book.Then she goes on to describe how to constructively influence children and build relationships of mutual trust and respect , working collaboratively with children in their natural quest to grow strong and find meaning in life . `` Discipline is handled with authority that gives life to children 's learning . '' ( page 37 ) . What some might see as something to punish , Coloroso sees as an opportunity to teach.For example , quoting from page 39 : There is no problem so great , it ca n't be solved . Realities are accepted . Problems are solved . ( `` You failed math this term [ reality ] . I know you can do what you need to do to get the required math credit you need for graduation [ problem to solve ] . I 'm here to help if you need me . `` I suppose there is some parent somewhere who would n't benefit by reading this book but I do n't know him or her . I predict you 'll be glad you bought it .	1
This is everything I should have known , and did n't , when the kids were little . I 'm wondering if it 's too late now . Never ! A good read for those who will , those who are and those who have .	1
Barbara lists the different type of parents , and gives examples of eahc.There is the Jellyfish familyThe brickwall familyand the back bone family.We all need to learn to be the back bone fmaily.The only thing I did not like was her sleeping advice . I do not agree with locking children out of the bedroom .	1
Something about Ira Levin really intrigues and impresses me . The guy wrote a legendary horror novel in Rosemary 's Baby . His book This Perfect Day won a Prometheus Hall of fame award and seems universally loved . Only seven books published , all of them on the short side , and five of them have AT LEAST 1 film adaptation . Impressive.I remember finding Rosemary 's Baby at a library sale and instantly grabbing it . Later on when I looked up the author I saw the Stepford Wives and said , & # 34 ; Hey , I 've heard about that. & # 34 ; For some reason I always really wanted to read this book , so I was very happy when I strolled into a thrift store a few weeks back and came across it . It 's very short , at 186 pages with big block words ( I doubt that the story is actually novel length ) , yet has many blurbs praising it , including one from King . In addition , Peter Straub provides an afterword . I applaud the writing for keeping the story moving forward almost constantly while seemingly building something outside the words . You know something 's coming , or you think there is , there has to be , right ? As a reader , it 's always a joy to be kept guessing.To sum up this book , I 'd say the ride is fun , the conclusion is okay , but it certainly felt a bit short of the greatness I expected from it . It 's billed of a thriller novel , and without giving too much away , but that 's only true for maybe 10 % of the time . I do have the feeling that this book is the type that one might want to read through a second time to see if there 's anything they missed the first time around ( and if there is , I 'm sure I missed them ) . As for now , my 3.5 star rating stand . A good but slightly disappointing book .	1
I found this book in a library sale . I read `` Sliver '' some time ago and thought that book 's idea was good and the writing style was quite economical -- but the ending was a huge letdown . Apparently , this is a habit of Levin 's -- `` The Stepford Wives '' also takes a fairly interesting idea , has great execution , and finishes badly . Though in this case , it may be attributed more to current pop culture vs. the pop culture of the '70s . Let me elaborate : If you have n't noticed , late '60s/early '70s movies either end in a serious maiming of the protagonist ( sometimes even death ) . `` Soylent Green '' comes to mind . So does `` Cool Hand Luke . '' How about `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest '' ? Believe me , if you look , that 's how they all end -- with the lead character in some form of a sorry state . This is a far cry from the movies from the '80s and beyond -- all the Rambos , all the Schwarzennegers , etc . So it comes as no surprise that `` The Stepford Wives '' also feature a similar ending.Kudos to Ira Levin for using feminism as a backdrop -- it 's smartly done . Is he saying it 's bad or good ? I do n't think he 's saying one way or the other . It 's just a cool way to tell a story about men vs. women , especially when feminism was taking the country by storm .	1
This book is one of my Grand Daughters favorites . Great value and great pictures . She turns the pages regularly and asks for stories to be read .	1
Perhaps this book 's intelligence and the depth of imaginative feeling achieved in its stories has overwhelmed some readers who came to the work expecting a more straightforward , stern and heroic treatment of Lincoln 's life . Perhaps that explains the anger expressed in the negative reviews here , reviews that are all apparently from one or two individuals . I believe myself to be a careful and thoughtful reader , and I have read widely both in fiction and in non-fiction . Braver 's stories are compelling and beautifully told . Braver calls his work a novel , but I experienced it as a loosely linked collection of short stories . In that regard , it 's a terrific collection , among the finest I have read . My congratulations to Mr. Braver . Highly recommended .	1
This a very nice book with the Night Before Christmas story in it . I wouldnt call it 'overly small ' . Its perfect size and has beautiful illustration and story in it . Nice small gift .	1
Children will love this attractively illustrated version of Moore ` s famous poem of Christmas Eve . EVERY page has a picture : from soft snowy scenes , an expectant Victorian living room in dusk , colorful sugarplums and presents , to the jolly old elf , himself : each page could be a Christmas card . Illustrator Kathy Wilburn surely enjoys her work . A lovely Chrismas book at an affordable price .	1
There are many different printings of Clement C. Moore 's THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS . However , none is as beautifully illustrated as this edition by Mary Engelbreit . Engelbreit has taken the beloved holiday classic , and put a spin on it all her own . Using bright colors , she has created a winter wonderland that takes us through the home of a little mouse , whose house is decorated with various baubles , from jewelry to food , and even pencil stubs . From there we see various depictions of children sleeping in their beds , sugarplum fairies flitting about as they dream ; Jolly Old Saint Nick , accompanied by a slew of elves , as he arrives by sleigh to leave gifts for each little boy and girl within the house , and much more . Readers will be delighted to see that Engelbreit has not forgotten the eight tiny reindeer - from Dasher to Dancer , Prancer to Vixen , Comet and Cupid , and Donder and Blitzen - each with their own characteristics , from eye color , to fur color , and even to various decorations adorning their antlers.Clement C. Moore 's THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS will always be a classic around the holidays . But now that Mary Engelbreit has decided to embellish the Christmas poem with her illustrations , the poem takes on a whole new life . One of imagination and wonder that will please all readers , as they take in the gorgeous illustrations , and share this classic tale with friends and relatives of all ages . A family heirloom in the making ! Erika Sorocco	1
This book blew me away . The pop-ups are fantastic and the fact that each page has a flap with another pop-up is extra special . I would recommend this book to all parents .	1
Twas the Night Before Christmas by Clement C. MooreISBN : 9780987902306Very colorful illustrated children 's book about the night before Christmas . Each part of the story is displayed inhigh graphics bringing magic to the page as you read each one.This classic along with the pictures would be a delight to read every night til the holiday arrives .	1
I purchased this book to replace a 60+ year old one that was lost in a house fire.The book has the same warm and traditional flavor that I enjoyed in my previous version . The illustrations fit the story perfectly . The book has the same text as in my original copy.I would purchase this book again , and have done so , since I ordered another copy as a Christmas 2013 gift after I received my copy .	1
I got this book for my 3.5-year old to teach about Christmas , and I thought the illustrations were beautiful and classic . Was exactly as expected .	1
This book is great . The pop ups are so great and worked well for our holiday fundraiser . However , would be great for a gift too .	1
I bought this book for my children . I really wanted for them to have the christmas feeling and it was accomplished . They were in love with the beautiful , bright , realisitic illustrations . I was reading this book for a couples of days until I decided to give another book a try , they could n't get engough , all i heard was again , again , again mommy.I think that this book is for all ages my daughter is 4 years old and my boy is 2 and they just love this story . Give this book a try i believe that it can be something that we can share with our kids.It is a such a sweet and tender story , I just loved it and i loved that I could share it with my kids .	1
I buy Christmas books for my grandchildren each year and this Mary Englebight version of the classic Night Before Christmas is beautifully illustrated . My granddaughter loves it .	1
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my friends son and he loved it . His mother said he want to read it every night before bed	1
This is one of the three copies of The Night Before Christmas that I grew up with . I got it so that I could have my own copy to enjoy and perhaps share with my nephews . What really appeals to me about this version of the classic poem is the illustrations . I can , and have , spent hours looking at the pictures in this book and am always noticing details I missed before . One of my beefs with most modern children 's books is that the illustrations are wretched . This book has lovely illustrations and I recommend it without reservation to children and adults .	1
I could n't find the old pop-up version I remember as a child . But this book fits the bill as it stands . It tells the original poem and the accompanying artwork is rich and classy.If you can find the pop-up book , buy that . Otherwise get this book . It 's great looking and has the same poem you remember from your childhood . Your kids will love the great pictures .	1
This is the classic The Night Before Christmas book . I was looking for the classic the night before x-mas book and this one hits a home run . It was exactly what I was looking for . A must for all children !	1
Cute illustrations . I ordered used with a Very Good status and it certainly was not . Because of the price , I will not bother returning .	1
I read so many books that I do n't remember the plot now . Ido know that the book was well written and keeps the readerinterested until the end .	1
I 'm both a sailor girl and an avid reader . I 'm also a huge Paul Garrison fan , so whenever he comes out with a new book , I know my day and most of my night is shot , because once you start something of his , you just ca n't put it down , and THE RIPPLE EFFECT is certainly no exception . In fact , if I may be so bold to say , I believe this is Mr. Garrison 's best work . He delivers up people you believe in , puts them in unbelievable situations and makes you believe in them too . And he weaves the real world into his fiction so tightly that you ca n't tell what 's real and what 's not.The story opens with Aiden Page in the Caribbean . We learn that he miraculously survived the tragedy at the World Trade Center on September 11 , and that the world thinks he 's dead . Because he was being investigated for crimes he did n't commit , because he was faced with losing everything and because he had life insurance , he disappears , leaving a daughter that misses him horribly . He has too much to drink one night and calls her , but he hangs up without speaking . However daughter Morgan knows it 's him.Aiden feels to the bone that his older brother Charlie also survived and just before the planes hit the towers , Charlie gave him a fake passport and told him if anything bad ever happened to run for the island . Blind Man Island , one of the many islands that make up Tonga in the South Pacific , was the island he was talking about and Aiden signs on as crew with a of couple gay nuns who are heading that way in their ageing sailboat . Charlie did survive and he 's headed toward the island with a wealthy widow on an expensive yacht . And Morgan steals a small boat in California and is also heading toward the island.But the island is not the idyllic resort local in the South Seas they 'd been lead to believe it is . There are very bad people there who are plotting an act of terrorism that will make what happen at the Twin Towers seem like child 's play . Plus getting there is no easy feat for the family Page . Rough seas , kidnapping pirates , a hurricane and more will conspire to stop them as they all race toward the exciting climax .	1
The author told the true historical story of the big hearts of the folks in and around North Platte , Nebraska in an interesting way . The many personal interviews done with those impacted during WWII included in the book made it a great book in my mind .	1
Bob Green tells an amazing story . The citizens of North Platte were there to meet every military troop- train that passed through the town during the Second World War . The whole area of that part of Nebraska donated time , money and food to make sure the serviceman had a meal and a greeting by a friendly face . Thousands of trains and millions of men came through and the people were always at the ready , from the beginning to the end of the war .	1
It all happened because of a mistake . It was 1941 , ten days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor , and the people of North Platte , a small town in Nebraska , had heard that a train carrying Nebraska National Guard 's Company D would be passing through , carrying soldiers to the West Coast and to war . It would be their very own sweethearts , sons , and buddies , and the town showed up at the station with food to give to the boys . But it turned out that this was the Company D of _Kansas's_ National Guard . The citizens of North Platte may have been chagrinned about their mistake , but they made sure those Kansas boys were sent away as well appreciated as their own sons would have been . After all , they were going to war for them as surely as if they had been home town boys . The idea struck some of them that sending the soldiers off this way was just the sort of appreciation the little town ought to be showing . And so the North Platte Canteen was born , serving soldiers crossing the nation during ten minute refueling stops in a little town of people they did n't know . Serving millions of soldiers and sailors , train by train , day by day , until after the war ended.Bob Greene says he was on a hunt for the `` best America there ever was , '' and if there are other nominations in the category , I bet he has them beat . His _Once Upon a Town : The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen_ ( Morrow ) is the story of his visit to North Platte , research into the history of the Canteen , and interviews with the now quite elderly people who took part , both as donors and recipients of the town 's hospitality . Twelve thousand people lived in the little town , and six million soldiers got a sincere greeting on their way through . The members of the town paid for it all themselves , used their rationing coupons , made do somehow , and made sure that the tables set up in a room of the station house were full of fried chicken , cakes , pheasant sandwiches , hot coffee , and chewing gum . They made an unforgettable impression on the young soldiers and sailors , many of whom did not even know , for security 's sake , where they were eventually headed and many who would never get American hospitality ever again . One remembered , `` Those people spent all that time and donated all that money - to get the sugar and all that stuff . They gave up their own ration stamps . They were using their ration stamps for us . We all knew what that meant . I wrote home about it . `` And their mothers wrote to the town , having read their sons ' stories of how well they had been treated at North Platte . `` Heaven bless you for what you did for my boy and every other mother 's boy . '' The town still gets letters of thanks from the servicemen who came through , but Greene 's fine book must be the best thank you written . He has told about the current North Platte , too , and of course it is n't anything like the one of sixty years ago , though his visit to an abortive Bikini Contest is hilarious . His last book , _Duty_ , was about patriotism writ large in the crew of the Enola Gay , and this one is about the smaller , home-grown version . It is sweet , and if he gets schmaltzy now and then , that 's the right tone exactly , and thank goodness he got some of these old folks to tell this story before it was too late . There are other fine stories of Americans doing the right thing , stories that are current ; but the North Platte Canteen was inspiring , and sentimentally fulfilling , and unique , and gone forever .	1
The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR is a good overview of the weaknesses of the advertising sector . The rising costs ( far in excess of inflation ) , declining credibility and decreasing media audiences for advertising are all valid points . But as my high school journalism teacher used to say , there is & quot ; an abundancy of redundancy & quot ; in this book . That in fact is it 's first major weakness.It 's second major weakness is the premise that PR is & quot ; THE & quot ; answer for marketers . That simply is n't the full truth . The truth is that PR is an answer and an important one . But , PR is far from a silver bullet . As someone who has been involved in the marketing communications industry for 34 years and who owned a successful PR firm for 13 of those years , I can say that PR suffers from its own significant limitations . PR ca n't be controlled ; the & quot ; news hole & quot ; in newspapers , magazines and in the electronic media is shrinking as costs increase and the audience is balkenized ; and , PR efforts are never guaranteed to deliver any audience . Those are n't insignificant problems to overcome.The real answer is an intelligently integrated mix of advertising , Public Relations , direct , interactive and viral marketing selected by someone who knows what they are doing ; who is focused on matching the marketing communications plan and its implementation to the budget and financial objectives of the client ; and who takes the time to understand the wants and needs of the customer.Nevertheless , Ries and Ries perform a valuable service of exposing the weaknesses inherent in the advertising business . The points they make are valid and one conclusion is clear . Somethings going to give in the advertising world . This is the books major strength . To get the full picture , read & quot ; The Tipping Point & quot ; and & quot ; Integrated Marketing. & quot ; Finally , as an old PR practioner who has fought this fight inside many an agency meeting , it 's simply delightful to read a book ( however repetitive it might be ) extolling the virtues of Public Relations .	1
I am a 10-year veteran of NYC top public relations agencies and found it no less than ironic that it takes an ad guru to point out the value and significant role that marketing public relations should have in marketing strategies . Beyond the title , the book puts forth excellent provable arguments . It gives plenty of examples , maybe a little too many , but the point that advertising lacks crucial credibility and many times serves as entertainment only is loud , clear , and about time . Sheer common sense should send up a BIG RED FLAG for exactly these reasons , not to mention the exorbitant costs of advertising ( i.e. , art ) . This book is specific to marketing public relations , not public affairs , corporate communications , investor relations , etc. , and is an excellent read and tool to help agency execs communicate their value to clients .	1
It is the future , a time after an apocalyptic 60 minute war that wiped out much of the world 's natural resources . Now the world is comprised of these mobile traction cities that must consume one another in order to flourish . Tom Natsworthy is a 15 year old apprentice in the Guild of Historian in the great traction city , London . One day as he is working with his hero , Thaddeus Valentine , a girl with a tremendous scar across her face attacks them , pulling a knife on Valentine in an attempt to kill him . Tom manages to spoil the attack and when the scarred girl runs off Tom pursues her , partially for his hero but more in effort to impress Katherine Valentine , the teenage daughter who he has a crush on . After a confrontation ensues the girl tells Tom to ask Valentine about Hester Shaw before she flings herself into the trash chute.When Tom tells Valentine about Hester Valentine does something equally shocking , he throws Tom down the chute . Now Tom and the strangely magnetic , Hester , must find their way back to the great traction city , or die in the Out-Country . Meanwhile , back in London something called the MEDUSA project has come to light and Katherine is investigating it in Tom 's absence.Wow . I am beginning to think that every word that Philip Reeve writes is gold . He is such a fiercely inventive storyteller it 's surreal . I almost feel that if I never read another good author I can be joyous in the fact that at least Reeve has a place on my shelf . He has such a way of crafting a story that draws you in and does not let go , and never once is anything awkward or terribly done . It 's brilliant . He 's brilliant . I want to have coffee with him . He 's brilliant ! ! !	1
Elmore is not one of my favourite authors and this is the first one I have read for years . However I did enjoy this . It has the usual cast of characters , from very shady to slightly . A solid gangster thriller , not terribly memorable but one I enjoyed reading none the less . Probably not one of best but well worth the read if you like these .	1
Elmore Leonard does it again , with this hip tale of a kidnapping gone horribly right . Crisp dialogue , smartly paced action , great characters . It 's unpredictable but always believable . It 's Elmore at his finest .	1
Truthfully , you never know for certain how a story by Elmore Leonard is going to end until you get to the last page . There are more twists than a switch-back mountain hiking trail . The dialog is easy , never contrived and flows like you are evesdropping on something you might not want to know anything about . You can see the thought process as characters try to work out their next step . Ryan is a thinking person 's antihero in the classic sense , slow moving and looking at all the odds . I have always liked Mr. Leonard 's women . While Denise , 'Lee ' , might not be the girl next door any longer , you get a good picture of what she has been through and how she is trying to redefine herself . This is not an action thriller bloodbath , it is worth reading over and over .	1
The book came promptly . It was well packaged , and in excellent condition . I 'd recommend it to anyone , because thyroid issues are becoming a silent epidemic . The book is very user friendly and informative .	1
Bernard Cornwell is one of my favorite writers of what I call historical fiction - stories set in another time and another place . Although his books are fiction , they are very entertaining and you will learn some history without realizing it . I have just finished reading THE GALLOWS THIEF ( ISBN 978-0060082741 , trade paperback , $ 13.95 ) .The story is set in England in 1820 . Captain Rider Sandman late of the British Army has returned to England after Waterloo to find his family 's fortune dissipated , the family name disgraced , his engagement broken and his father dead by suicide . He is forced by economic circumstances to live in a room in a public house ( in Drury Lane ) frequented by outlaws of various types . He can earn a few pounds per year playing cricket but not enough to enhance his lifestyle . The Home Secretary offers him a temporary assignment based on his military skills and reputation ( sounds a little like Cornwell 's Richard Sharpe hero ) .His assignment is to look into the murder of a Countess by an artist who has been tried , condemned to death and is waiting to be hanged at Newgate prison . One of the Queen 's entourage has convinced Her Majesty that her son is innocent . The Queen prevails upon the Home Secretary to investigate . That is a rare occurrence in 19th C. England . Along the way , Sandman enlists the help of a young woman ( struggling `` actress '' ) , a former army Sergeant ( bouncer at an exclusive men 's club ) and a clergyman ( second son of an Earl ) . Together they put together pieces of a serial crime spree by privileged and wealthy young nobles . Time is short and they may not get evidence they need to avert the hanging . The descriptions of prison life and executions by hanging are chilling to say the least.If you have not read any of Cornwell 's books and series , here 's a good place to start . Several of the Sharpe novels were seen on PBS a few years ago . I hope there will be more Sandman stories.GO ! BUY ! READ !	1
I just HAD to purchase this book once I read an excerpt of it in one of my magazines . I read The Dominant Blonde while on vacation at the beach this summer , and have read it a second time since then . I enjoyed reading the book because it 's a fun book with an interesting storyline , but my husband just called it `` fluff . '' If you are looking for a great way to simply relax and destress , you definitely need to try this book .	1
In this abridged audiobook , Kenneth Davis provides an episodic history of the US spanning from the voyages of Columbus to 9/11 . Much has to be left out in an abridgement , but I think his choices are reasonable for giving a feel for the major events and general contours of US history . Moreover , he describes these episodes in significant depth , thereby presenting facts which wo n't be known to most people , so the tradeoff between breadth and depth is a good one.As any serious historian must , Davis is willing to openly present his interpretations and opinions , and I think he proves to be balanced and fair in this regard . He does n't hesitate to reveal the many mistakes and moral failings which have occured in the name of the US , but he 's not anti-American : he recognizes the time-tested value of our founding principles and the pivotal occasions when we 've lived up to those ideals.The net impression one might take away is that America 's good has prevailed over the bad , resulting in two centuries of success and progress in many areas , especially human rights and economic development . I think that 's a reasonable conclusion , but we have to always remember that European settlement of North America effectively decimated millions of Native Americans who 's ancestors had lived here for thousands of years and comprised hundreds of diverse cultures . Since so few Native Americans are left , this sad fact does n't get discussed much . Personally , I think this is a tragedy even worse than our legacy of slavery , and I ca n't really think of any response other than lament ... Anyway , this audiobook provides an excellent and engaging episodic overview of US history , so I recommend it .	1
This is the book that Loewen 's `` Lies My Teacher Told Me '' should have been , which is to say , talking about the little-known , glossed-over , or erroneous facts that are in our history textbooks . Loewen , however , wrote a book that was simply a defense of Revisionism , and focused very little on the actual history.I like this book . The history is a bit too basic , and stays to a rather low level of knowledge ( Lewis and Clark did such and such , Washington did this-and-that ) without talking about the greater context or meaning -- ironically enough , the crticisms that Loewen lays on textbooks -- but does a good job covering the entire scope of American history in a very readable fashion.While Davis tries to make the claim in the newly revised introduction that his book was not written to be liberal or conservative , but solely to find the truth , he 's , well , not quite telling the truth . For example , he makes the claim that Washington rather cautiously put forward the idea that people could be moral without religion , in his farewell address . Quite to the contrary -- what he actually said was that we should regard that belief *with caution* , and `` ... reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle . `` He makes similar deceptive claims throughout the book , but his bias is relatively mild , compared with Loewen 's explicit Marxism and dislike for the United States . It is my hope that the critical reader of his book will be able to identify the errors Davis makes , and be able to think for themselves. -- -- -Update : After being most of the way through it , I 've found myself gritting my teeth a lot recently . While it was refreshing to actually listen to history after Loewen 's meta-historical criticisms , I found that not only is the book at a very , very basic level of understanding ( not even at AP US History level ... closer to a middle school class on US History ) , but it omits points which are often the most critical to understanding something , and is often factually wrong , repeating a commonly believed lie . Which , ironically , is one of the main criticisms Loewen had of textbooks -- they repeat each others ' erroneous oversimplifications . Worse , he ca n't draw cause and effect in historical context , instead relying on `` historical inevitability '' to explain away why events happened , as if it were a real historical cause . Why are we going to war ? Historical inevitability ! Why are we having a great depression ? Historical inevitability ! He actually uses it to explain every major event studied so far . It 's terrible . As Lee Simonson once said , `` Any event , once it has occurred , can be made to appear inevitable by a competent historian . '' In truth , this is actually the sign of an incompetent historian -- one who does n't actually understand the causes of an event , and so hand-waves the actual causes away.Some examples of bad history in the last couple chapters : He talks about Margaret Sanger in quite a lot of detail , including quoting a primary work by her -- but never mentions her beliefs on eugenics , which are *central* to understanding her beliefs on birth control . His portrayal of her is thus biased , heroic , and incomplete . This is the person who wrote , `` The campaign for birth control is not merely of eugenic value , but is practically identical with the final aims of eugenics . '' Her socialism and belief in eugenics must be stated in any work on Sanger , or a reader is left with a dangerously biased view.In talking about the Yalta Conference , he states that the Kuomingtang ( KMT ) was already losing China at the end of WWII . However , it was not until Chaing Kai-Shek 's disarmament agreement with Mao after the war ( brokered by General Marshall , of the Marshall Plan fame ) that the KMT was significantly weakened in comparison with Mao 's army , and not until 1949 was mainland China lost to the KMT . Up until the disarmament agreement , the KMT held the upper hand.There 's plenty more problems in the book , but making an exhaustive list of his omissions and errors would be tedious , here . I dropped my review from 4 to 2 stars , as his history is just too bad to recommend to others .	1
Elmore Leonard 's writing sets the Gold Standard for noir fiction . He treats words like fine-cut jewels and never wastes a single one on unnecessary ornamentation . He is so disciplined in following his own rules ( & # 34 ; Kill All Modifiers & # 34 ; ) and his ear for dialogue is so true that opening one of his stories is like moving into a new neighborhood for a few hours . Like a great actor who can deliver a whole speech with an eyebrow lift , Leonard can package a character in less material than it would take to stop the bleeding from a razor nick . I 've rediscovered him , only to realize that I had no idea how large his oeuvre is , or how deep and rich . Every one is different , and every one is captivating . If you want to learn how to write anything well , read Leonard , and take notes . You 'll be at the knee of the master .	1
Bouncing around is what Nancy Hayes does best , flitting out into the resort town , shooting out windows , leading men astray , planning for that big , cheap , yet dangerous , thrill.But Jack Ryan stays oh so close to her , hoping , hoping ... for what ? Certainly Nancy is stylish and cunning , but a psycho-babe is not what he needs , now that he 's escaped from the dangers of migrant work . Why does n't he just go home to Detroit , grab himself a beer and a nice woman ? Elmore Leonard , author of THE BIG BOUNCE , probes his daring hero 's motivation , but can never give us a clear answer to Jack 's attraction . Why would anyone want to climb into Nancy 's web willingly ? Why get that close to such a manipulator , unless , oh the horror , he 's just too stupid to leave ? Once again , Leonard creates a fictional woman we 've read about in our local papers . She 's the babe who got our friend in jail on trumped-up sex charges . She 's the one who was involved with the captain of the college basketball team , causing him to lose his scholarship . She 's the one who smiled as the TV cameras whirred , designating her as the most dangerous woman in black . Oh boy , she loves fame , and she does n't mind taking you to your own grave , while she shovels the first load of dirt on top.Gentlemen , read this cautionary tale before some mysterious lady winks at you in the cocktail room of your neighborhood motel , and you go along with one of her intrigues.Larry Rochelle , author of the mysteries DEATH & DEVOTION , DANCE WITH THE PONY and TRACETRACKS .	1
I read this book because I knew Leonard was a master of pacing and I wanted a refresher course . I was n't expecting the tapestry of characters , the elegant choreography of the plot , the inevitability of both the violence and the redemption at the end . This is sophisticated writing that rocks so well on the page you do n't notice how fine it is . If you want to know how to write , study Leonard and Maximum Bob .	1
I picked this up after seeing the great movie with George Clooney , Jennifer Lopez , and Ving Rhames . I wanted to see how close to the original the movie came . Yes , it is very close.The book is very heavy on dialogue . I found this well done . The book moved rapidly , but I felt I understood the characters involved . It is hard to read the book without seeing the actors in the movie , because the words in the script are identical , in places , to the words in the novel.Some of the characters described by Leonard are not as you would find in the movie . In the book , Buddy ( Foley 's partner ) is described as a white redneck . For Mr. Ripley , the stock swindler , he has little to no part in the novel , just a brief mention.If you think you should n't read the book because you know how it ends , you are mistaken . Without giving details , the ending of the book is not the same as the ending of the movie . It is a quick , but good , ending .	1
Written in the early 20th century , the stories include Lord Peter Wimsey and share the language and thinking of a person of peerage at that time . The plots are quite original , and surprises come without warning . Quite a pleasant read , the stories also inform us about the authority and privilege of position in a class-based society .	1
Although this book was written in a very different format than what I am used to , I found that I really liked this book . The story is told through emails , instant messages , and journal entries and was a very easy read . I could n't put it down and it was a nice change of pace from the other books I have read . Great book - I really recommend it !	1
Best written book I have read.. Easy to understand and answers about every question you can have .Such a good clear directions to all fruits	1
Last Chance Saloon is such a great book ! I have read four Marian Keyes books , and she has yet to disappoint me . She has a wonderful way of mixing serious issues and sadness with huge amounts of laughter and fun . Last Chance Saloon is no exception.Tara , Katherine and Fintan have been friends since their small-Irish-town days . Now living it up in London , the three friends have made a life for themselves in very different ways . Tara , who just turned 31 , is a wee-bit depressed that she 's getting older and involved with a terribly selfish , penny-pinching boyfriend , Thomas . For fear of dumping him and never being able to find anybody else , Tara manages to convince herself that being miserable is better than being alone . Katherine , or as her co-workers call her , the Ice Princess , is a brilliant accountant and very independent woman . Who needs a man when you 've got success , right ? But there 's more to that statement than meets the eye -- could it be that Katherine 's forcing herself to stay single ? As for Fintan , growing up gay has n't always been easy . But he 's finally found soulmate status with Sandro and life is good . But then something tragic happens that completely tears Fintan 's world apart . But through tragedy comes wisdom , and Fintan has a few things to say to Tara and Katherine about the way they 've been living their lives.It 's the Last Chance Saloon for these three friends , or so it seems . There 's a lot of growing up to be done , a lot of realizations to be made , and many changes to go around . Will they somehow make it through to the other side ? Marian Keyes weaves a thought-provoking and humorous story and leaves no question left unanswered . Toss in some side characters like the trio 's friend , Liv , who is in search for spiritual wellbeing ; Fintan 's family , the O'Grady 's , who look like Hillbillies compared to the modernization of London ; and suave , debonair , Lorcan Larkin , Ireland 's answer to Fabio.Expect to be laughing and crying with this one ! Wonderfully written with a nice flow of short chapters that make the book fly by . Last Chance Saloon holds within its pages a great cast of characters and an unforgettable story . Witty , charming , and believeable . Excellent job !	1
What can I say - Marian Keyes has done it again . She just keeps getting better . The trials , tribulations , good times and bad times of Tara , Katherine and Fintan - three old friends from Ireland now living in London - keep the reader enthralled page after page . Gentle , loving Tara with her possessive , overbearing miser of a boyfriend - who frankly , you want to slap about the head ; ice-queen Katherine in total control of her life - or so it seems ; and Fintan the delightful gay friend battling the biggest fight of his life . There are plenty of other characters to keep this book action-packed from beginning to end . I have now read every book Marian Keyes has written and ca n't bear to think about how long I am going to have to wait for the next one - but you can bet your life , I 'll get it hot off the press !	1
The Right Questions is the right book at the right time . I use the questions every day to look at my life in a new and empowered way . This is a practical guide to running your life with all the tools you need to make all the decisions we face day to day whether life changing or unimportant . If there was a `` Care and Maintenance Book '' for our emotional and spiritual bodies ... this would be it . Finally , a self help book that works in any situation and is practical for everyday life . This is a great book for anyone.This book has all the answers .	1
An unusually public revelation of self-insight for a person who seems to have kept most of his life private - quite a feat for someone so well-known . I appreciated that there was little to no gossip . His struggle to achieve a positive outlook on his life is clearly and touchingly written . I found it an inspiring lesson to myself to avoid prejudging other people . A couple of the later chapters which explained his philosophy at length were heavy going . Probably just me , Still , the book was completely satisfying , and made me want to cheer for Richard Chamberlain 's current happiness with himself .	1
Up until two weeks ago I knew very little about Richard Chamberlain ... ..I had not seen any of the Dr. Kildare Series or any of his movies except for The Towering Inferior . I did not know that he was also a singer and artist ... .I did know however about his strained relationship with his father because I once heard Chuck Chamberlain speak..I am not sure what I was researching on the internet when I happened upon a Richard Chamberlain You Tube video but it caught my interest to the point that I watched all of the Richard Chamberlain You Tube videos that I could find ... .Purchased Shattered Love , and The Thorn Birds , The Bourne Identity , and Shogun DVD 's , and Richard Chamberlain Sings Album ... .My Daughter said , `` Mom you are really going Richard Chamberlain overboard . '' ... .HAHAHA ... She is right ... .Maybe I should start a Grandma 's for Richard Chamberlain fan club ... .HAHAHAHis singing has a very calming effect on me ... .I did n't tell my daughter that but had her listen and asked her opinion about his singing and she said , `` His voice is very relaxing '' ... I totally enjoyed reading his book and found him to be as talented a writer as he is actor , singer , and artist ... ..His goodness shines through in all of the movie characters that I saw him play ... .well maybe not so much in The Towering Inferno ... ..HAHAHA ... ..I can see why Shogun seems to come first on his list of favorite parts ... .it was the most versatile part ... ... . it even gave him opportunities to play and laugh ... ..Thank you Richard for having the courage to share so much of yourself with others through your book ... ..A man once told me `` We are only as sick as our secrets . '' And he said that his life is now an open book.Thank you for choosing to uplift rather than tear down others in your book ... .You 're a good man Richard Chamberlain and I wish you well always ... ..Vicky	1
Very well organized and researched , very engaging . I was actually surprised when I got to the ending and wanted to read more .	1
There are two major reasons why this book will be a classic.First , if you ever thought that after 400 years , there could be nothing new to say about William Shakespeare , this will prove you wrong . Although the author graciously acknowledges predecessors , his ability to place Shakespeare 's plays within the context of their times is extraordinary . You have a much better grasp of the plays that Shakespeare wrote in 1599 - including Julius Ceasar , Henry V , As You Like It and Hamlet - after Mr. Shapiro informs you of the current events which colored their writing . The author 's excellent prose makes this as much a book to read for pleasure as it is for learning , a difficult combination to acheive.The other reason is that as a `` biography of a year , '' the book is unsurpassed . There is an interesting subgenre of popular history which sets out to inform the reader of the events of a particular year . These can be enjoyable exercises , but , ultimately , even the best of them are , when the smoke clears , no more than a collection of headlines . Not 1599 . Mr. Shapiro sets out , not to recount everything that happened in that year , nor even everything that happened to England or to London in that year , but simply to tell about how the events of the day had an impact on one man , Mr. William Shakespeare . The result is that you have a stronger sense of what it was like to live in that year in that place than any other work of history I know . You can sense the smells and sounds and sights of turn of the 17th Century London almost as if you lived there.This is an extraordinary acheivement .	1
This book gives a basic overview of beauty as it pertains to every age group from 20 's up , as well as specific situations such as dealing with cancer , job interviews , special events , pregnancy and the like . The highlights of the book are the stories of women who radiate beauty despite the fact they are approaching 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , or even 102 . The book skims over actually applying and using makeup , and some readers might findBobbi Brown Makeup Manual : For Everyone from Beginner to Proa better choice for learning how to apply and use makeup . Overall this book is highly specific to women 's lives and routines , and the information in it is very good .	1
`` On Friday noon , July the twentieth , 1714 , the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travelers into the gulf below . '' When Brother Juniper witnesses this tragedy first-hand , he resolves to find in it scientific evidence of God 's plan . The randomness of this evident , in Juniper 's mind , makes it the perfect laboratory for investigating this question . `` Here at last one could surprise His intentions in a pure state . '' Before the victims had even hit the ground , he already plans on investigating their lives . Short , beautiful , and nearly perfect , THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY earned Thornton Wilder the first of his three Pulitzer prizes.The lives of the five victims of the bridge are thoroughly recounted leading up to the moment they all came together to cross the bridge . Brother Juniper came up with his conclusions regarding the tragedy , but ultimately , he was not satisfied with his results . He did , however , realize that he learned least about the victims in question in speaking with those that were close to them . It was these very survivors , however , away from Juniper 's questions and after the friar 's execution who ultimately did find some answers.I was moved by the final conclusion of the book : that out lives are transient and unremarkable but to those whom we love and who love us , and our very existence dies with those that cared for us . `` ... almost no one remembers Esteban and Pepita but myself ... But soon we shall die and all memory of those five will have left the earth , and we ourselves should be loved for awhile and forgotten . But the love will have been enough ... '' I ca n't find a better argument for living in the moment.Jeremy W. Forstadt	1
The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a short , exquisite meditation on life and the meaning of our existence . This winner of the 1928 Pulitzer Prize centers on the collapse of a bridge in 18th-century Peru that takes the lives of five people . A priest who witnesses the event wonders about the five who die . Why were they chosen ? Was there a master plan or did the event occur simply at the whim of God . Being a religious man with a desire to place theology amongst the sciences , he sets out to empirically prove why the event happened by learning about the lives of those who perished.Wilder 's prose is a wonder to read , near perfect in its pace and pitch . But this is a moral fable , with the conclusion that love is the meaning of it all . And with the novel consisting of almost exclusively characterization , this novel has almost no chance of finding appreciation among the masses today , who need a fast-paced plot and do n't liked to be preached to . This probably explains why Wilder , a courageous writer who pushed the boundaries of literature , is under-appreciated these days . That 's a shame ; we could all learn something from his books . And if nothing else , if we 're insistent upon learning nothing from our literature , we could sit back and enjoy the beautiful writing .	1
What is loving some one , truly , about ? What does it mean to love `` for the sake of the other '' ? This book answers both questions succinctly , beautifully .	1
This is one of Leonard 's earlier crime thrillers , but he was already on top of his game . ( And stayed there . ) Bryan Hurd is a homicide lieutenant in the Detroit PD -- a city with an unusual number of murders every month , so he stays busy . One of his detectives used to be Walter Kouza , before he cleared out for Palm Beach , and Walter gets called out to evaluate the shooting of a Haitian refugee by a rich man in front of his house overlooking the ocean . The homeowner is Robbie Daniels , heir to a Detroit auto parts fortune , and it quickly becomes clear that Robbie likes to use his gun collection . And then there 's Angela Nolan , freelance journalist , who has been interviewing Robbie for a magazine article about lifestyles of the rich and non-famous . And when Bryan and Angela meet up unexpectedly , it 's a game-changer.Leonard is a master both of characterization and of cinematic scene-setting , both of which are obvious in this slowly-building thriller . Robbie 's growing hobby as an assassin , Walter 's growing frustration as a bodyguard/chauffeur/investigator , and Bryan and Angela 's cautious but growing passion are all painted in numerous dimensions and in glowing colors . It 's not a long read but it 's a very enjoyable one . Even so early in his long career , it might just be one of his best .	1
This is top drawer Leonard , but definitely is aimed at a particular generation . It does open with pages and chapters of dialogue between pairs of characters before things truly start happening , but it will definitely please Leonard 's fans .	1
I 've read just about all of Elmore Leonard 's thrillers up to & quot ; Maximum Bob & quot ; ; I 've missed many of the recent ones , not for any particular reason , just have n't picked them up.His early works -- & quot ; 52 Pick-Up , & quot ; & quot ; Unknown Man # 89 , & quot ; and & quot ; City Primeval , & quot ; among others -- display a very gritty , street smart view of tough guys . Starting around the time of & quot ; Get Shorty , & quot ; he seemed to lose some of the grit , replacing it with sharp humor , while retaining the street smart view . It was as if he were writing with a slight tinge of Carl Hiaasen. & quot ; Freaky Deaky & quot ; straddles those two eras . It 's got the humor but also the grittiness . The plot revolves around four characters , two & quot ; good guys & quot ; and two & quot ; bad guys. & quot ; ( Actually , a bad guy and a bad woman . ) The two good guys are police detectives formerly on the bomb squad , and the others are 60s radicals who never grew up . As in any Leonard novel , the two pairs are in a collision course toward each other , with a slam-bang climax . The dialogue crackles ( Leonard has a terrific ear for dialogue ) , and the characters are sharply drawn .	1
I love Elmore Leonard 's writing . This book is an unusual one , different in many ways from his usual style and with an unusual subject too . In the preface he says it was difficult to get it published for this reason . But the story and characters are , as usual , unforgettable .	1
Written in contemporary prose with plenty of opinions thrown in to spice things up , this is an eye-opener of a book with lots of discoveries to be made about Abigail Adams , Martha Washinton , Mercy Warren and their contemporaries . Did you know Eli Whitney might have stolen the idea of the cotton gin from Kitty Greene , according to no less an authority than MIT ? Did you know slave Elizabeth Freeman pretty much single-handedly forced Massachusets to end slavery ? What 's really amazing about this book is how obvious it is that while the men may have been in revolt against the British , the women were in revolt against their condition . I do n't think the men had any idea that all this revolutionary dealing would start the women down the road to Seneca Falls in 1848 and the 19th Amendment in 1920 .	1
Our history books are loaded with information about the male founders of our country . Rarely is a woman mentioned . Cokie Roberts ' book finally provides us with the stories of those women and their tremendous contributions .	1
This book really makes one wonder why it took so long for someone to write it . I really thought about the subject long after I read the book . Actually started to 'google ' some the founding fathers in subjects that were famous in American history to find more founding mothers to learn their history too !	1
This is my favorite of the three Marian Keyes novels I 've read.Keyes ' humor is a little dark , but quirky and uncompromising . She 's great at describing real life frustrations . Her heroines are always strong and have a warped sense of humor . I love the introduction to Claire 's family . Helen is hilarious , and even though she may make a better secondary character , I hope she gets a book of her own . Every character in Claire 's family is wonderfully drawn.However , I could not understand why Claire 's husband , James , had an affair and acted as he did . I did n't feel like I understood his character or motivations at all . At least if he 's going to act like a jerk , have the reason be fairly credible.I am seeing a trend where Marian Keyes ' stories follow the same basic storyline . Fairly attractive heroine involved in crisis , must rebuild her life or meet challenge . Her life and the people in it no longer look the same . Everpresent male friend/boyfriend eventually steps forward for relationship . Heroine renews life.This story is a pageturner , but still in the Marian Keyes way -- predictable . And I do n't always appreciate Keyes ' humor , which is sometimes too wry for me.If you like this storyline check out the 1986 movie Heartburn with Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson.Autobiographical novel is by Nora Ephron , who was briefly married to and had two sons with Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame . Deftly directed by Mike Nichols . Kevin Spacey can also be spotted in his first feature film role .	1
I liked this book . The only complaint I have is that the author went on tangents so often . I ended up skipping a lot of the tangents to get back to the story . I find this is pretty much the author 's style but it was just overdone in this particular book.That being said , I liked it , it 's a quick read , it 's touching at times . Overall , good British Chick-Lit	1
As I am a big fan of Marian 's books this was n't my first , but certainly the funniest and most insightful of her stories . I was actually more than shocked to find out that she had n't gone through anything like her perfectly described newborn baby days at her parents ' house in her real life . Made me chuckle up even at work while I was secretly flipping through her adventures , hiding the book under the table.This is certainly one of those books you want to gift your best friend on her baby shower as it would put a unique cherry on anyone 's first child experience .	1
This book was pretty good . This is the first book I read by Marian Keyes , and it wo n't be my last . The book was a little slow in the middle , but then I read the last 100 or so pages in one day . It is a page turner ! Great book !	1
I just finished reading Watermelon , and boy was it funny . I loved the main character , Claire , and her zany family . Her story of healing and self-discovery after her husband leaves her and their new-born daughter is touching and funny . When I first started reading Watermelon , I could n't wait for James ( her husband ) to come back to her ( I 'm a sucker for romantic reconciliations ) . But , as I saw Claire heal and grow with the help of her family and Adam , I did n't really want to see James come back into the picture . I think everyone got just what they deserved in the end . And the ending - well , without giving anything away , that 's just the type of thing I 'd expect from that crazy Helen ! Keyes has a great writing style , and I was hooked on Watermelon from page 1 . This was a great first novel !	1
This books is so much fun ! It reads like a conversation , as if a stranger in a queue started talking to you , and talking and talking and then suddenly you know all these parts of their life ! Kind of life the image of Forrest Gump , sitting waiting for a bus.Claire has just given birth to their daughter , when husband James decides to tell her that he 's having an affair with the woman in the flat below them . Claire goes home to her family to fall apart , which she accomplishes successfully and then , with help , to put herself back together . When her husband shows up to play husband and daddy , Claire has to decide whether no father for her child is better than a cold no-blame father.Totally memorable and life-like characters , really looking forward to reading Rachel 's Holiday now !	1
I thought this was a cute book , albeit very obvious . I enjoyed this book and thought it was very witty with a cute ending .	1
I just loved this book . I have not read any other books by this author , so I ca n't compare , but as this books stands alone , I think it 's perfect.The first-person dialogue is amazingly funny , and you fall in love with the secondary characters almost as much as you do with Lucy . The wit and humor were priceless , and so was the ending ( which would have been disappointing if it were anything else , since you spent the entire book predicting it. ) . I 'd recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a deliciously funny romantic comedy .	1
My favorite Keyes novel . Follow Rachel in her journey to self-discovery , in a hilarious , heartwarming story . After her near-fatal overdose , she begins to discover what really counts in life . Watch her relationship with boyfriend Luke unfold in flashbacks -- from laughing at him to loving him . Wonderfully written , laugh-out-loud funny .	1
I 've read all of this author 's books , and this is by far my favourite . Funny and sad , and nice and thick , so you can really get your teeth into it . Definitely one of the better examples of & quot ; chick lit & quot ; , it probably wo n't change your life , but it will provide a nice distraction for a few hours .	1
Rachel 's friends are worried about her `` use of recreational drugs , '' and just to make them happy , Rachel checks into what she things is going to be sort of a spa holiday with a few optional chats on her little problem . To her horror , she finds herself in an honest-to-God drug rehab program - and she 's pretty much stuck there . Hard to imagine a story based on this premise being funny , but since the Irish M. Keyes is the author , well , yup , it 's funny . Rachel confronts her addiction , learns a bit about herself and some destructive relationships , and we have a longish but fun read .	1
I was given this book by respected historians , so I felt confident that this book would be good quality , not full of false information or unchecked/invalid sources . It has been a while since I 've done any study of American history , so what better new start than to begin at the very beginning . This book read as easy as a novel , which is rare in a history book because they can get rather technical , dry and textbook-like . There were times when it did n't even feel like I was reading a nonfiction book because it was just so interesting and full of adventure and intrigue . You 'll get it all in this book : political manipulations , death , disease , mutiny , war , sabotage , desperation and adventure . This book is neither oversimplified nor overly complicated . There are times , I admit , where you may feel that the book drags . I suffered during the parts about British government and technical arrangements , but they were mere pieces in a book that is largely very entertaining while remaining informative . It 's a far cry from Disney , though . By the end of it , you 'll be well aware of the brutality of America 's early founding ... from both the settlers and the Natives . Additionally , this book includes an international scope . While discussing the founding of the Jamestown colony , the author writes about how other leaders in countries like France and Spain felt . If you love history , nonfiction or a good adventure book , this one is definitely for you .	1
A very gripping account of how the famous fall out of the Firestone ATX tire recall and Ford Explores high rate of roll over was brought to the public knowledge . The research it required is unbelievable . Thanks for staying with it for so long and getting it done .	1
Our kids love this book and many others in the series . Our 7th grade science teacher at school has even used this one to explain concepts to the kids . I would also recommend : What Is the World Made Of ? All About Solids , Liquids , and Gases ( Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science , Stage 2 )	1
The first 75 % of this book is a 5 star book ... love both main characters , love the friendships , love the banter . However , once the two finally marry ( which seemed like it should be the end of the book ) , the book continued for the last quarter of the story where it sort of lost something . It was mostly telling , rather than us living the story ... the author narrates what 's happened . The characters ' personalities seemed to have changed too . Annabel , who is fiesty and smart and challenges him throughout the beginning of the book , becomes a simpering , annoying female . I liked the end occurrence ( do n't want to ruin it for anyone ) , but found myself wanting to edit it and make it more like the two characters I loved in the beginning . I still recommend it because I wanted to get back to it and read it . It was entertaining and I 'd read the Wallflower book about Evie ( which I loved ) , and I liked seeing how it all started . I also loved all the forshadowing for Westcliff and Lillian . That one will have to be next !	1
Simon Hunt is a self made millionaire . But his millions ca n't buy him a place in the upper tiers of British society . He , and the growing number of self made commoners , are looked down upon by the aristocracy and thought of as opportunists and social climbers . Simon is only barely tolerated in `` polite '' society because of his friendship with the estimable Lord Westcliff ( the hero of the next book in the series ) and because the crumbling aristocracy ca n't ignore his millions try as they might . Simon does n't care less about his pariah status in the upper circles since he disdains their boring parties and inane conversation . Only one thing keeps Simon from swearing off balls and soirees altogether and her name is Annabelle Peyton.Annabelle and her family are in desperate straits . They are living in genteel poverty and desperately trying to keep head above water . The obvious solution out of their predicament is for Annabelle to marry a peer , however , her chances of getting a proposal are virtually zero due to her lack of a dowry . As her fourth season draws to a close , Annabelle knows that it has to be now or never . To that end , she meets a group of fellow wallflowers and they strike up a friendship centered around their immediate need to catch husbands . They concoct a plan to help Annabelle trap a peer into marriage during a house party . But Annabelle 's confidence and her plans are shaken by the presence of Simon Hunt . Annabelle cant't forget the day she allowed him to kiss her and she ca n't forgive him for making her like it . Simon makes it clear that he has only wanted one thing from Annabelle ever since that day and she will not yield regardless of his wealth or his handsome looks . As the days go by and she gets to know the real Simon and she ca n't help but be attracted by this tender , sweet and oh so sexy man . However , she mus n't forget not only that Simon only wants her for his mistress but the fact that he is not a peer . Even if he proposed marriage she could n't bring herself to marry a commoner since as far as she is concerned it would be social suicide.For his part , Simon is determined to make Annabelle see him for who he is instead of his lack of a social pedigree . At first he set out to charm and disarm her with the goal of making her his mistress . However , Simon did n't count on falling head over heels in love and while she is responsive to his kisses he knows that his feelings are n't reciprocated . So , Simon sets out to change matters and make Annabelle his body and soul.After finishing this book I have decided that Lisa Kleypas is virtually unbeatable in the hero department . Her heroes are an incredibly potent mix of tender , loving , sexy , arrogant bad boys that I simply ca n't resist and Simon is no exception . I also have to commend the author for pushing the envelope with Annabelle . She is unapologetically selfish and mercenary and she will stop at nothing to get what she wants . She clearly wants to marry a peer not only for the well being of her mother and brother but also for her own well being . She makes no bones about wanting to be part of high society and having money and servants . So , if you are looking for a self sacrificing heroine who will put herself through hell for the sake of others you wo n't find her here . I admit Annabelle is a little hard to like but I found her refreshingly real and so she won me over by the end . The love story is heart clutchingly romantic and the love scenes are incredibly tender and of course this being a Kleypa 's book they are also very hot . All in all this is a hell of a story and I highly recommend it .	1
This book was amazing I finished it within 24hour period . The first I 've ever read of Lisa Kleypas ' work . I would compare her writings to Julia Quinn 's masterpieces . She has written a brilliant love story about overcoming social standards and how love conquers all . I ca n't convey how much I love this story of Simon & Annabelle . Kleypas created a great segue into her next book in the Wallflowers series . There 's an emotional attachment to all the characters in this book . I liked this book so much that I also bought the E-Book for my iPhone . : )	1
Let me put it this way : I have an 18-month old . Like most new-ish moms , I need my sleep . Desperately . That 's why , when I started this book one night at 9pm , I thought I 'd only read a chapter or two . Instead , I stayed up until 2am to finish it . It 's that good . It 's also not flashy . Kleypas does n't rely on a lot of bells and whistles to tell her story . It 's not particularly `` high concept . '' What it is , is an intense , character-driven story that 'll keep you turning pages long after you were supposed to go to sleep .	1
I really enjoyed Clara and Morgan 's story . This is book 4 of the series and I have enjoyed all of them . They keep your interest and you do not want to put the book down . I would recommend Sabrina Jeffries Books to everyone .	1
Setting , 1822 , England and America -- - The Viscount Ravenswood , Spencer Law , was in America with his younger brother & quot ; Nat & quot ; to investigate a business prospect with the owner and his daughter Abigail of Mercer Medical Company . Abby , soon demonstrated that American woman were a different breed from the insipid British aristocracy he was used to and Spencer letting go of some his normally reserved ways , was entranced . His brother Nat soon discovered that although , Spencer was intrigued with the lovely American , he would not act upon his attraction convinced that because of a war injury , he could ` never ' marry and beget an heir . On the eve of sailing home to England and bemoaning the fact that he would probably never see Abigail again , Nat , witnessed Spencer 's uncharacteristic lapse of both getting foxed and quoting Byron 's poetry in describing the lovely American and decided that he could n't let this opportunity slip by.Some months later , Spencer , was highly irritated that Nat had failed to show up for his betrothal dinner to Lady Eveline . He was furious at having to make excuses to her for his brother 's tardiness when he was informed by his butler that he had an uninvited female visitor . A visitor claiming to be , of all things , Lady Ravenswood , his wife ! Unaware of Nat 's machinations , Abigail smilingly informed him that before sailing home a month earlier , his brother Nat had stood up for him and had married Spencer and her ` By Proxy ' . Evidently , it turned out that his brother Nat had forged documents in Spencer 's name and now it appeared that he had absconded with Abigail 's dowry . With the surprise announcement of their being a ` Lady Ravenswood ' made in front of the biggest gossip columnist in London , and in order to avoid a scandal over his brothers seemingly nefarious deed , a furious Spencer convinces Abby to go along with the ruse until he can locate Nat , get Abby 's inheritance back to her , and extricate himself from this beautiful and too attractive ` bride'.Written with undeniable charm , humor and a beautifully scripted sensual love story , this latest offering by the master word-smith , Sabrina Jeffries , is sure to be a hit for the dedicated fans of this author . While I was really furious at times with Spencer 's high handedness in dealing with the innocent and duped Abby , I forgave him at the end as the author skillfully wrote him a beautiful and touching redemption . The sensuality was really hot , especially the scene where Spencer fought so hard against his base inclination to ravage his wife , and she so innocently convinced him that they could just be ` playing ' . The dialog was witty and skillfully crafted secondary characters all added to making this a completely wonderful romance that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy . - Submitted by Marilyn , Official Reviewer for [ ... ] -- -	1
This is a pretty good offering from Michael Crichton . Like all of his books , it is a page-turner , I read it in one sitting once I had the chance . It is a good story , and has some thought-provoking scenes . However , it 's not Crichton 's best work . Why ? Well , there are some scenes that explain certain complex medical procedures in detail that many people may find self-indulgent . Also , the ending was weak.Still , this is a Crichton book for God 's sake , so it is good , just not his best . Do n't make this your first read of MC ( or the second or third for that matter ) , but do read it ... eventually .	1
Michael Crichton at his best . With today 's technology digging deeper and deeper into our brains this book should make everyone stop for a minute and wonder if we need to leave that unexplored frontier alone .	1
I read this book as a teenager when it came out in the 70 's and really , really loved it . I have not re-read it so I wo n't give a detailed review . But I 've read hundreds of books and the fact that I even remember it at all says something ! ! As I remember , it was very entertaining and compelling - a real page-turner .	1
The duke has lost his daughter , Madeline de Lacy , the future duchess of Magnus , to a total stranger in a card game . Madeline 's betrothed has urgently requested her presence at his home . While en route , Madeline , accompanied by her companion and cousin , Eleanor de Lacy , make a stop at the house of a notorious gambler . Madeline is sure her father must be there , for what is taking place is being dubbed & quot ; the game of the century & quot ; . Trading places with her look alike cousin Eleanor , Madeline poses as a companion while attempting to keep her father from gambling away their remaining family fortune . If matters were n't bad enough , also at this game is Gabriel Ansell , the earl of Campion . The man Madeline was engaged to four years ago . She 's never forgotten how he betrayed her . He 's never forgotten how she ran out on him so easily . But the increasing danger present at this gambler 's house just may pull them together again.This is the first installment in the trading places series . I 'm a huge fan of Ms. Dodd 's work , and have read most everything she 's written . While all of it is good , this particular book was not one of my favorites . There is a dark , almost brooding mood to this story , and it lacks the humor she does so well . Overall , the story is good , the writing wonderful , and the love scenes steamy . I really liked the supporting character of Gabriel 's valet , MacAllister , because he did add a note of humor to the story . The sequel , & quot ; One Kiss From You & quot ; , which is Eleanor 's story , is the better of the two . So while this is not Ms. Dodd 's best work , it 's still a worthwhile read . And if you 're like me - if it has her name on it , you just got ta ' read it !	1
I had to rate this book higher than Scandalous Again because it is most definitely better . Although it probably deserves just under 4 stars , I pushed the rating up to account for the signficantly better aspects of this sequel.Remington -- you do n't know whether to like him or not at first , but he definitely grows on you -- just as Eleanor grows on him and he ca n't help falling in love with her . It 's lovely to watch Eleanor blossom under his care ; even though he is sometimes harsh and angry , there 's honor and kindness beneath it . Eleanor 's goodness and quiet strength get under his defenses . And they have some scenes that most definitely sizzle , too.While the murder mysery was not heart-stopping or pulse-pounding , it moved along at a good clip , made sense as a plot , and ended perfectly . A really enjoyable , light read .	1
We love Kate and Jim McMullan ... great books and great pictures , I bought this book for my 4 year old grandson . He enjoyes `` reading '' them to me also . We had checked these books out at our Library so many times , I just decided to have them in our home library .	1
It only took me a few days to read it all . I could not wait to get to the second book . Every chapter had me laughing , Raven is so funny . She 's almost like me . I love vampires.- Skylar , Age 14	1
This book has been sitting on my shelf for a little over a month . After picking it up last night I was mad that I had not started it as soon as I got it , I could not put this book down . This is the perfect book for a teen to read about vampires . There is n't a lot of sex , or bad language in it . It also reads more like a YA book . And it has lots of vampire reading in it , even though that does n't start until the end of the book , not going to say anymore because I do n't want to ruin the book for anyone.The book starts off with a girl named Raven who wears black all of the time and has never fit in , only with her best friend Becky who never fit in either . Raven has a lot of trouble with a guy named Trevor in the book , which I think he secretly likes her since he always seems to end up where she is and is always talking to her . But Raven gets her revenege over Trevor towards the end of the book , without even really trying.The best part of the book , and the most entertaining for me is the house on top of the hill . It is a mysterious dark house that no one has lived in for a long time until a strange family moves in that the town thinks are vampires . Which makes Raven very happy since she has wanted to be a vampire since kindergarten . After Raven meets the mysterious boy that moves into the mansion the book really takes off .	1
Raven is a 16-year-old goth girl social pariah who becomes obsessed with the weird new family who have just moved into Dullsville - and who are rumored to be vampires . She is especially fascinated by the handsome teenage son Alexander , who she hopes will transform her into a vampire . He , in turn , becomes fascinated by Raven , but is he or is n't he a vampire ? I liked this book - and I really liked the character of Raven , even though she had plenty of goth cliches built into her character . I found the book to be well-written with a good deal of humor , and it dealt realistically with the idea of being different and being a high-school misfit .	1
If you appreciate an 'old fashioned ' tale free of graphic intimacy and violence , if you appreciate vivid description , romance and intrigue this is for you . I read all but one of Mary Stewart 's books in my early twenty 's through late thirties . Now , nearing seventy , I am rereading them and cherishing the stories I read in my young years . I have divested myself of hundreds of books . Mary Stewart 's remain a constant . `` Wildfire at Midnight '' tells of a young divorcee , unusual in Ms. Stewart 's books , traveling to the Isle of Skye to recover from and get over her ex . BUT ... he is in the same hotel on the remote Isle . Like many of Ms. Stewart 's work murder has been done , intrigue and danger abound and one is constantly wondering WHO DID IT ? a good read .	1
I did not have this novel in my collection from the '60s of Mary Stewart romantic mysteries , so it was very good luck to find it suddenly reissued . This is certainly one of her best . The heroine is complex , as is her problem ( an ex-husband who turns up in a vacation spot unexpectedly ) . She is beautiful and likeable and brave and kind , however , a great heroine to identify with . This is the romantic thriller at its best . A quick and light scary read .	1
& # 8220 ; NOVEL . The great prose form in which an author thoroughly explores , by means of experimental selves ( characters ) , some great themes of existence. & # 8221 ; So writes Milan Kundera ( translated from the French by Linda Asher ) in Sixty-three Words , which is Part 6 of the 7 parts that form & # 8216 ; The Art of the Novel & # 8217 ; . Here is one more definition from the author & # 8217 ; s Part 6 personal dictionary : & # 8220 ; LETTERS . They are getting smaller and smaller in books these days . I imagine the death of literature ; Bit by bit , without anyone noticing , the type shrinks until it becomes utterly invisible. & # 8221 ; Just imagine the definitions of his other sixty-one words ! Actually , I begin with two quotes to convey the richness and depth along with the playfulness one encounters with Milan Kundera ; matter of fact , I couldn & # 8217 ; t imagine a book where there are more gems of wisdom on each and every page . Since Kundera consistently composes his works in a 7 part structure to accord with his own artistic and literary sensibilities , I think it only fair to the author I list below seven comments coupled with seven quotes , one from each of his seven parts.Part One & # 8211 ; The Depreciated Legacy of Cervantes & # 8220 ; To take , with Cervantes , the world as ambiguity , to be obliged to face not a single absolute truth but a welter of contradictory truths ( truths embodied in imaginary selves called characters ) , to have as one & # 8217 ; s only certainty the wisdom of uncertainty , requires no less courage. & # 8221 ; I recall a lecturer on The Platonic Tradition accusing non-Platonists of being nihilistic skeptics and relativists for denying there is a truth as well as thinking how even if there was a truth it couldn & # 8217 ; t be known , and even if it could be known , it couldn & # 8217 ; t be communicated . -- -- Well , in this section , Kundera outlines how the wisdom of the novel transcends good/evil , either/or , black/white dogmatic discourse.Part Two & # 8211 ; Dialogue on the Art of the Novel & # 8220 ; I & # 8217 ; m too fearful of the professors for whom art is only a derivative of philosophical and theoretical trends . The novel dealt with the unconscious before Freud , the class struggle before Marx , it practiced phenomenology ( the investigation of the essence of human situations ) before the phenomenologists. & # 8221 ; Kundera underscores how his novels ( and the great novels of other writers ) are not philosophy per se ; rather , any ideas or philosophy arises from the specific existential situation of characters.Part Three & # 8211 ; Notes Inspired by & # 8220 ; The Sleepwalkers & # 8220 ; The world is the process of disintegration of values ( values handed down from the Middle Ages ) , a process that stretches over the four centuries of the Modern Era and is their very essence. & # 8221 ; This is a most intriguing section where Kundera analyzes the historical and cultural context of what possibilities of freedom we face and how the novelist Hermasnn Broch outlined three such possibilities in his great work.Part Four & # 8211 ; Dialogue on the Art of Composition & # 8220 ; Let me return to the comparison between the novel and music . A part is a movement . The chapters are measures . These measures may be short or long or quite variable in length . Which brings me to the issue of tempo . Each of the parts in my novels could carry a musical indication : moderato , presto , adagio , and so on. & # 8221 ; The author tells us how he was drawn more to music than to literature up to the age of 25 and much of this section compares the structure of music with the structures of his novel in some detail . Enough material here to keep both musicians and non-musicians going for quite some time.Part Five & # 8211 ; Somewhere Behind & # 8220 ; There are periods of modern history when life resembles the novels of Kafka. & # 8221 ; In this section , the author relates some of his own experience and stories living in Prague under a totalitarian regime . One story is about a mother of a one-year old baby boy who was unjustly imprisoned by the government . Years go by and the mother is released from prison . Then , some years after her release , the author visits the mother in her apartment . He watches as the mother dissolves in tears , waling and heaving , upset at her now 25 year-old son over some minor matter like oversleeping . The author watches all this in shock ; he see how the mother has taken the place of the totalitarian state and the son , like many of Kafka & # 8217 ; s characters , accepts his guilt.Part Six & # 8211 ; Sixty-three WordsIDEAS . My disgust for those who reduce a work to its ideas . My revulsion at being dragged into what they call & # 8220 ; discussions of ideas. & # 8221 ; My despair at this era befogged with ideas and indifferent to works. & # 8221 ; At another point in the book , Milan Kundera says how novelists who think they are larger than their novels should get another job.Part Seven & # 8211 ; Jerusalem Address : The Novel and Europe & # 8220 ; No peace is possible between the novelist and the agelaste . Never having heard God & # 8217 ; s laughter , the agelasts are convinced the truth is obvious , that all men necessarily think the same thing , and that they themselves are exactly what they think there are. & # 8221 ; The agelaste is a man who does not laugh , who has no sense of humor . You know the type & # 8211 ; and they hate novels as great literature , like the ones written by Milan Kundera .	1

I read this book during two three hour flights ( while entertaining my five year old son ! ) . It was really an enjoyable , light book . The style of the book ( written all in emails ) allowed for multiple points of view from each of the characters ( even minor ones ) . I did n't expect to enjoy it as much as I did . Very Funny !	1
The book , Pipe Dreams , Six-Time World Champion Kelly Slater , is the interesting story of our greatest surfer . His normal life led him to become the most talented surfer in the world . When you read the biography of Slater , you feel like you have become this surfer . The story told give visions inside your head making you think you are a spectator watching Slater break the records . Kelly Slater and Jason Borte made this ordinary biography into the best adventure ever read .	1
As a novice surfer , and an obsessive one , I am in awe of people like Kelly Slater , and only wish I had grown up close to waves so maybe I could be a quarter of what he has become.This book was really easy and interesting to read , and the only problem I have with it is that he did n't really touch on how surfing FELT.I wanted to know ... how did it feel , the first time he caught a wave ? What is it really like to ride places like Pipe for the first time , or any time , other than scary ? What is it like to be inside a barrel ... etc etc.I learned a lot about his competitive nature and his triumphs and shortcomings . The great parts of this book is when he is sharing feelings , not ratings .	1
The best book on this subject that I 've ever read . Refreshing to know there is at least one doctor out there who is human and humble . He was n't afraid to talk about how much he cared about his patients .	1
Jack Sasso has brought to life each of his real characters in a way that made me care for them like no other book has done for me in some time . The camaraderie was so real , so endearing , that at times I blushed at their conversations . There are a few men whom I know that would thoroughly enjoy reading the book for that alone.My emotions ran the gamut of the spectrum , laughing aloud as I read what men really discuss , to the sadness evoked through his vivid description upon finding just why they were fighting this war.This author is truly gifted in translating the spoken word to the written without losing the impact of it .	1

With the support of her sisters , her friends , her clients , not to mention the reappearance of Nick in Holly 's life , slowly she finds the inner faith that helped the dating service become successful in the first place.Although this book could be termed & quot ; chick lit & quot ; because of its themes , Anna Maxted brings a reality to her characters that goes beyond such labels . Despite the fact that the novel is set in London , and some of the more British turns of phrase are unfamiliar , the reader is drawn into the world of Holly and her cohorts at Boy Meets World.Maxted is able to make these people seem like friends , co-workers or others you might know . She also brings a lightheartedness to the novel so that even in its darkest moments , you know things will work out . As Nick tells Holly at one point - most people want to see a happy ending .	1
This book was really , really good for the first part ... not so great in the middle and returned to good at the end . I laughed aloud at parts where Hannah encountered her rival , Lucy for Jason 's attention . I do n't think this book was quite as good as some of her previous work .	1
This review was originally posted on `` The Historical Romance Critic '' [ [ ... ] ] This medieval romance was a much darker read than I usually select . Growing up , the heroine was bought at the age of fifteen and sexually/emotionally abused for a number of years at the hand of a viscount . During this time , she became one of the most popular courtesans in London . Three years before the book begins , she escapes and runs with a group of outlaws before becoming a seamstress . As the novel opens , the hero has tracked the heroine in order to have her help him . He blackmails her into helping him search for his sister , who has also been enslaved by the viscount . With this , their adventure of joining outlaws and searching the stews begins , eventually accumulating into an final battle against the villain and his men . During this adventurous backdrop , the hero and heroine develop deeper feelings than they realized was possible . The heroine forces the hero 's perceptions of prostitutes to change , while the hero helps the heroine overcome her deep emotional scars . It 's an intense read , rather than comedic or entertaining , yet I ca n't be sorry I read it . The overcoming of such emotional obstacles allows for a sort of cathartic enjoyment .	1
The Flat Stanley picture book is great . Good starting project for little ones to design and create one of their own for travels .	1
CDs of 4 very popular Flat Stanley series chapter books read by author Jeff Brown . My grandson ( 6 1/2 ) was already familiar with the stories as his parents had read two of the titles . These CDs allow him to listen to the charming activies and antics of Flat Stanley again and again . Listening and recalling helps children with their visual imaginery and memory of the delightful tales . I hope that by next year he will begin to read along with the tapes . His parents report that they have taken the CDs with them on auto trips and played them with the whole family enjoying the adventures of Stanley . If you do n't know this series and have children or grandchildren rush to your nearest library and check out at least one title . I wish there were more audio CD sets available for beginning readers . His whole family will soon be attending a musical performance of Flat Stanley performed by a children 's theatre in a nearby city !	1
This story of social climbing in an ammoral segment of society is as relevant today as it was when Fitzgerald wrote it .	1
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a piece of Americana . I read this book in high school , of course this book was assigned to us and boy did I love this little tale of murder and love in the Roaring '20s . Gatsby and Daisy 's secret passion for each other kept this book a page turner , it 's intriguing and i love the twist ending , if you do n't like this book then there is something desperately wrong with you . One of the best books I 've read , the first is The Catcher in the Rye . I hope teens are still reading this in high schools today . Classic , great style of writing from Fitzgerald , flows well and easy to read . Buy The Great Gatsby today !	1
This book was really good the only thing is that you have to reread some parts because they can get confusing because the narrator changes the scene . He could be telling the story or having a flashback and it can get confusing but other that b that I recommend this book it has a little bit of everything . It has romance , death , parties , cheating , and a good story .	1
To understand Fitzgerald 's ( perhaps personal , autobiographical ) motives , laid behind in `` The Great Gatsby '' , I think , one needs also to consider `` Tender is the night '' and the relationship between Fitzgerald and Zelda ( who , if I recall correctly , was from the `` higher circles '' , than Fitzgerald himself ) .In short , I see elements of Zelda not only in Nicole , the heroine of `` Tender is the night '' , but also ( though somewhat in more abstract way ) - in Daisy as well - both of them , being `` careless people '' ( see the last line in `` The Great Gatsby '' ) did not appreciate and ultimately betrayed someone , who truly loved them.Likewise , I see elements of Fitzgerald himself in protagonist characters of his both novels ( more explicitly in `` Tender is the night '' ) .I see also another angle in `` The Great Gatsby '' - the parallel between protagonist characters ( Gatsby ) and that one of Willy Loman ( in `` Death of the salesman '' ) - both of them are `` idealistic dreamers '' ( though in different economical times and on different social achievement levels ) .Like Joyce Carol Oats ones said in her essay , which she wrote about `` Death of the salesman '' - there is little bit of Willy Loman in all of us , Americans ( this is not exact quote - sorry ) .	1
I do n't know why I decided to read this , I do n't even know if I read it in HS , but as an adult the nuances of the book are much more relevant . This is a timeless read .	1
I never would have read it . Always heard about it but I am not a classic reader . However , if time permits , I prefer to read the book before watching the movie and this is one movie I want to see ... glad I read it . Not at all what I was expecting , especially for the time it was written in .	1
First and foremost , this is a great book . Anyone who enjoys literature will fall in love with Fitzgerald 's examined manipulation of the English language that can be called nothing else but art . Every word speaks volumes in this tale of minimal pages but endless emotions . It is a book to be savored and one that continues to get better with age .	1
The Great Gatsby is now 87 years old and still feels fresh , edgy , modern , and still has something fundamental to say about the American experience . The writing is stunningly beautiful and whole paragraphs deserve to be savored again and again . Yet the story is bluntly sad and tragic . It 's a story about chasing after elusive dreams -- once you seem to have reached these them , they evaporate . Fitzgerald packs a lot of punch , style , and tragedy into less than 200 pages . I loved traveling back to New York in the 1920s and spending some time peering into these character 's lives . I also just loved reading the words of an absolutely brilliant writer .	1
Fitzgerald is a great writer this story really feels like its based on his life with Zelda . Just read the Paris Wife ( Hemingway 's first wife ) and their time in Paris during the 20 's . Life was so different then they were all on a collision course toward early death . But a lot of the para phrases in this book are so appropriate for today . I first read this in the early 70 's so it was good to read it again and now go see the movie	1
This is one of the best classics American Literature has to offer . Fitzgerald has painted a telling portrait of a time and a class of people . His portrait is so accurate and suble , however , that it was completely misunderstood upon publication ; now it is considered Fitzgerald 's masterpiece . This novel offers a look at the luxerious and shallow lifestyle of the aristocracy during & quot ; the lost generation. & quot ;	1
I just finished reading The Leopard by G. Lampedusa and was struck by the description of the lavish balls thrown by wealthy Sicilians in the late 1800s amidst the poverty of the locals . The parties of Gatsby were even grander affairs , and all for the sake of winning back the woman he loved . I enjoyed reading this novel for its description of life of the affluent and not so affluent in the 1920s in NY . The story was intriguing and the prose succinct and elegant . It 's rare that I finish a book in three days but this one was compelling . I wanted to read this as a prelude to seeing the new film and I am glad I did as it made me appreciate both mediums even more .	1
I reread this in preparation for the movie coming out this year . I am so glad that i did as i had forgotten just what a classic this book is . A great story with robust characters that will transport you to another time .	1
I read this originally at school and then again in the light of Baz Luhrmann 's recent film version . The light across the bay had stayed with me for the thirty years in between . Not many books stay in my mind that strongly . Reading it as an adult I really appreciated the sense of place and time .	1
I 'm not sure if it 's possible to not like this book . It 's eloquently written and interesting . A classic love story , that will remain timeless . If you were forced to read it in high school and did n't like it I suggest a quick revisit to the timeless tale . It was wonderful . I 'd recommend it to anyone and since it 's a short book it only takes a weekend to get through .	1
This is a great novel . I really liked reading this . The narration by Nick Carroway gives the story some distance from Gatsby and the other characters . His pursuit of Daisy Buchanan ends tragically , with the husband of the accident victim blaming Gatsby for her death . He then shots Gatsby in his swimming pool . The writing by Fitzgerald is of a very high quality , and standard . The character of Gatsby is a bit of an enigma . He gains wealth in order to try and rekindle his relationship to Daisy , who is married to a thug . Although the parties at Gatsby 's house are glamorous and decadent , the novel is really a warning about the consequences of the love of wealth and status on society . Daisy will not leave her husband because she does not want to sacrifice her status and access to wealth . I particularly liked the last 50 pages or so of the novel . There is a number of passages that contain great writing . The ending was very sad , but it was in keeping with the story . I will always remember reading this book for another reason . Just before I read about Gatsby 's death , I heard about someone close to a member of my family , who had been unjustly murdered . We had seen him only months before . It obviously made reading about Gatsby 's death more painful . I suppose it is just one of life 's coincidences .	1
Of couse this is a good book . Has been since it came out . Thanks for the great movie concept . READ	1
This book is one of the 1920s most popular , and shows how life was back then . Before the depression , people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot . Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him , and it just shows how during the 20s , not many people cared about affairs , racism , nor drinking . I feel Nick is obsessed with Gatsby because Gatsby has the personality and class he does n't . The story is somewhat hard to follow at parts , especially near the end , but it has a nostalgic feeling to it , and basically is a portrayal of life during this time period .	1
This book was very good . I saw the movie after I read the book and it followed the book very well . An enjoyable read .	1
I had heard a lot of great things about The Great Gatsby but never read it before and was eager to finally read it . It was well done and an easy read even after all this time.The tale is told by the neighbor of Gatsby . It is a twisted tale of adultery and adoration . Some say it is the quintessential American novel . Gatsby 's neighbor tell us of Gatsby 's quest to win a married woman 's , Daisy 's , heart . Daisy struggles with a husband who cheats on her with another woman and she married him for money . The whole tale ends in a tragedy not unlike a Greek play.The tale was an easy and quick read and fairly engaging . Fitzgerald does an excellent job describing the era and the surroundings , making everything easy for the reader to picture.The story quickly gets twisted and complicated with various characters involved with other characters that they are n't supposed to be with . The tragic ending is strangely ironic and suiting of all the selfish characters present.I can understand how some might root for Gatsby and Daisy and their supposed quest for true love ; but personally I found all of the characters to be selfish , shallow and deserving of what they got in the end . This tale truly shows an era of American decadence.Overall a decent read and I am glad that I read this . I loved the ironic symmetry of the story , but did n't really enjoy any of the characters much . The story is paced well , has great description throughout , and is engaging . I would n't run out and read everything by Fitzgerald based on this book , but I enjoyed this book and am glad I can say I finally read this .	1
Decided to read book before seeing movie . Can see why it has remained a standout of 20th century American literature . Fitzgerald 's language is very evocative and he manages to tell a marvelous story in a relatively short tome . I recommend it highly .	1
I was surprised that the characters were so one dimensional . The story unwraps well , with further and further glimpses into Gatsby . It 's not that he is becoming more multi-dimensional , just that we are learning what about what drives him . In the end it was an interesting story that reads more like a short story than a novel . Worth the read , but not a book that haunts or enlightens .	1
This was required high school reading and I could not get into it . As soon as I chose to read it on my own for fun , I loved it . Saw the film first , and it helped to make the story flow more easily in my mind so that I could appreciate the true genius of F. Scott Fitzgerald . In my opinion the film could not have captured the story any better than it did , but even if you see the film , still read the novel because it is a classic and deserves to be read .	1
The fourth star is actually for the quality of the novel itself ; `` The Great Gatsby '' is one of my favorite novels and surely the best in American literature . Every line in Fitzgerald 's novel has a meaning and a purpose . The reading on this audio book was not the worst I 've ever heard , but Tim Robbins needed a good director to work out the many problems in his reading . While there were generally good voice characterizations ( except for the initial chapters ' readings of Daisy and Jordan -- who sounded like a very exaggerated version of Southern women but improved as the novel went on ) , the narrator 's voice varied from sounding bored to a tempo more in keeping with Nick Carraway 's feelings about the people in the story . Sometimes there were problems differentiating Nick 's voice from Gatsby 's , and Gatsby mostly sounded like someone falling asleep . In addition to characterization problems , there were small problems in sentence phrasing -- perhaps caused by turning the page -- and in pronunciation consistency . I suppose it 's all right to have a character 's name pronounced in a non-traditional way ( as Wolfsheim 's was ) , but to have it move back and forth between two pronunciations even when the same character is supposed to be saying it seemed to me a problem that a good and conscientious director could have solved .	1
This is an interesting story of the rich people who lived in the early 1900 's . People went to people 's houses who had money and extravagant parties . It seemed to me that money instead of true friendship was more important . I enjoyed the story and it is a quick easy read .	1
Did you ever want to go back ? Back to those great times ? That 's what Gatsby wanted to do but he additionally wanted to CHANGE THE RULES too ! This work is told from the perspective of a third party about a determined man , Gatsby , who fails to secure an early love , a vain immature gal , Daisy , and now that he 's hit the big time and has become a high-roller , he wants his Daisy back ( even though he never had her to begin with ) -- and he 's willing to go to any extreme to OWN her.The setting is the 20s , a period of excess and near social insanity in New York City in particular . Gatsby puts his plan into place and things go fine for awhile in that Daisy responds quickly to his overtures . But what Gatsby never figured on is that Daisy is a mile wide and an inch thick . She RE-responds to her husband 's overtures to come back , albeit this act is spurred on by a personal tragedy and the death of a near-innocent.Gatsby , in the meantime , has inadvertently set into motion a chain of events over which he no longer exerts control and , ultimately , it leads to his demise.This book is arguably Fitzgerald 's best work and it 's bulging with symbolism and metaphor . It 's a book that is set apart from most others of the period and now is thus referred to as `` literature '' -- quite the professionally written novel.It 's not for everybody but if you 're up for reading some great prose , you love scandal , and do n't mind all the subtle ethical lessons that accompany the work , then this one is probably for you.Tom Wolf wrote a very similar work which was all about having rotten friends and the parallel excesses of a much more contemporary period , if you 're interested : The Bonfire of the Vanities	1
I thought everybody already knew that . There is no better American novel in existence . I read it first in high school and it captured my heart and imagination . I have read it many times since , and each time discover more depth and nuance .	1
I 've probably read this book 3 times , listened to it on audio tape once , and read it aloud while on a car trip . What can you say about such a powerful and classic book , a book that has come to be symbolic of the Jazz Age with all of its excess and smarmy decadence ? The enigmatic and subtly evil Jay Gatsby , self-made man and millionaire , and his passion for Daisy , the wife of the man who lives across the bay from him , are at the center of this novel , which is told from the point of view of Nick , an occasional guest and neighbor on East Egg , who is able to tell the story , eventually , with some degree of detachment and cynicism . There is the inevitability of a Greek drama to the cadences and pacing of The Great Gatsby , a tragedy lying in wait for all involved.Exquisite and spare prose , tight plot , and wonderful characters . It 's as good as a novel gets .	1
I enjoyed how Fitzgerald used phrases and words to describe what he was seeing or feeling . I always thought it was just a superficial story about very wealthy people . It was much more than that . The display of racism and antisemitism was difficult for me to take but I understand that was the thinking then .	1
The Great Gatsby has been reknowned for some time as one of the greatest pieces of American fiction . And , after reading the short but incredible novel , I will have to agree with this assertion . The story is vivid and colourful , and the narration truly engages the reader and makes him/her feel that s/he is living the story . You will feel the pain of long lost love , the shallowness of the urban-socialite community , and respect and admiration for an incredibly well written novel . The novel is fairly short , which is one of the strengths of the novel , as it is not verbose or overdrawn . Concise and moving , a must read for those who appreciate great prose and situational novels ...	1
I probably read this many many years ago , but did not remember much of it at all . I was very glad I read it before I saw the Movie . It 's a quick read and made me wish I lived back then !	1
F. Scott Fitzgerald accomplished exactly what he set out to do with this novel . He wrote a simple and beautiful tale about sustaining the American dream.Fitzgerald offers us Jay Gatsby the overly confident , charismatic portrait of excess who falls in love with something beyond his reach , Daisy Buchanan . It is a classic love gone wrong story that embodies itself on the theory that we always want what we can not have . Once money is added to the calculation the pursuit becomes all the more desperate.This novel is a must read if only for its classic status . It is an easy summer day exploration into the mind of greed , lust and all that it leads to . Fitzgerald managed to write something simple minded with great prose and compassion . But while uncomplicated it is also written with terrific insight questioning the concept of greatness at its very core .	1
When I read Gatsby in my teenage years , I did n't appreciate all the nuances of the characters and writing . Though I now think some of the descriptions were a bit too over the top , I enjoyed most of the writing . I saw the characters now as quite flawed and some -- like Daisy -- as self-centered , weak , drifting along in life and unsympathetic . I now understood the obsession driving Gatsby as a sad flaw as well , not the heroic element I once read into him . Overall the book has improved with a re-reading as an adult with life experience and perspective .	1
A friend of mine lent me this book recently , raving about how moving and powerful it was . I 've read enough about 9-11 over the years that I was n't exactly eager to read it , but after I reluctantly picked it up , I found it to be a very engrossing read.One thing became clear early on in this book ; this author ( whom I know nothing about ) is a very skillful writer who not only holds the reader 's interest with sparkling passages , but does a fantastic job of organizing the various elements to this drama/tragedy to weave this story . And that 's not an easy task . There are so many personal stories to share , that in the early parts of this book , it all becomes a bit overwhelming trying to absorb it all . But the story must be told and each person on that flight plays a role . Thankfully Longman does n't linger too long on any one person , and manages to give us background on everyone involved without boring the reader.I also like the way that the author gives a balanced overview of the aftermath and the various reactions from the relatives . It 's not all mindless patriotism and dubious stories of faith and unwavering religous beliefs . I particularly like the comment from the father of one passenger : `` People ask about the healing process . I say , 'What healing process ? ' There 's no such thing . `` That 's just one of many sobering comments that provide food for thought . Hopefully , this book does n't just stir up anger and feelings of revenge -- - or conversely , that it was `` destiny '' or `` God 's will '' that caused these particular people to be on this flight -- - but makes us all think about the causes of this tragedy and what we can do to prevent any such events in the future . All in all , a very riveting and well-written book .	1
Something about the way these Big Max books are written kids just love ! The mystery , dialogue and fun plot make this a favorite . It captivates our 4/5 year old at bedtime and is just long enough so you do n't have to read too long before they loose interest . Great find !	1
If you take Tae Kwon Do , this is a very good book . It has the Palgwe forms & helps with obtaining your black belt/2nd don . I found it helpful .	1
Amazing , almost unbelievable but true love stories . I thoroughly enjoyed it and now I 'm going to read it to my True Love , my wife of 32 years .	1
When I visit a place that 's historically important , I like to try and get a sense of what it was & # 34 ; like & # 34 ; to live there . In this book , Lord does a great job of immersing the reader in the context of the time he 's chronicling - what people did with their time , what they talked about , what they cared about , how they interacted , etc . Lacking any anchor point ( like a great war or great person ) to hold the story in place allows the reader to simply be & # 34 ; among & # 34 ; the people of the time , which is extremely gratifying . Many history books are intentionally myopic ( going deep on a single person/event ) , and it was nice that this one was much more focused on creating broad perspective . Truly an enjoyable read .	1
I 've read this book twice and I have to say that it is one of the most vivid accounts of war I have every read.Guy Sajer was a half-German boy from Alsace who was impressed into the German Army and then sent to the Eastern Front . The book recounts his experiences throughout the war . Guy Sajer is not trying to make a political point . He is not trying to make any point , instead he is just telling of his time in the German army.This is the book to get if you want to know what life was like for your average soldier in WWII . You can almost feel the Russian winter as he describes trying to stay warm while escorting trucks across the frozen steppe . You can almost feel the pain and the fear of battle and the relief when the war ends .	1
Really enjoyed this account of a survival on the Eastern front during World War two . Mr.Sajer was doing his job and trying to protect his friends .	1
First time reading this book was amazing . The way he describes the battles is so real-life , when a battle is over your left out of breath and glad your still alive . Some say this book is not true- some say it is- Regardless- anyone who reads it will not deny its one of the best World War 2-no- military history books of all time . Worth the money and worth the time . Anyone who is interested in reading about World War 2 can not pass this book up .	1
The book could have used some maps . The ordeal and his survival is almost unbelievable . I know some have questioned the veracity of the account . No way of knowing this but still a good read .	1
This book is a 1000+ page-turner . When I picked it up , I knew nothing about the Spanish Civil War . This book definitely remedied that . Hugh Thomas begins shortly before the outbreak of the war and tells the story through to its completion ( essentially 1936-1939 ) . It is somewhat long , but the story itself is so compelling and Thomas ' writing so good that it sucked me in and moved along nicely.I have only a couple of gripes . First , if someone wants a short introduction , this may not be the book . I am sure there are other titles out there that will give you the basic facts in less time . As I said , however , reading the book was entertaining enough that I did not mind at all . As an example of an interesting factoid that emerges from this book , it seems that a substantial portion of the treasure from America that Spain won in the 16th century was given to the Soviets for safe-keeping . It is still there.Second , while the book is strong on narrative , it is a little bit weak in analysis . What is especially lacking is an understanding of the factors that led to the outbreak of war in the first place . The books starts with a short chapter describing Spain in the early 20th century and plunges directly into the events leading up to the war . While the suspense before the outbreak of the war is palpable , the basic question of why a country would degenerate into civil war is hardly touched . In fairness to the author , he may have deliberately chosen to focus on the war itself rather than its causes . On the other hand , the discussion about why the Nationalists defeated the Republicans is fairly good . Two factors stand out . First , the Republicans were crippled by in-fighting amongst the factions , a fact that is admirably discussed . Second , the Nationalists received substantial help from abroad.Author background : I am not a historian , but have read a handful of books on Spanish history .	1
Excellent . John D. MacDonald - The boys go to Mexico	1
As a mystery writer making the convention circuit as my debut novel is in initial release , I find that John D. MacDonald 's name frequently comes up in discussions with readers and authors . While Travis McGee is always Travis McGee , I always contend that CINNAMON SKIN is the best work in MacDonald 's colorful series . Meyer 's niece is killed and our gentlemen adventurers hunt down the woman 's killer . They end up in the jungles of Mexico , Mayan Country . That final detail is important , and you have to read the book to find out why .	1
For anyone interested in the Nuremberg Trials , this is a great start . It has been well researched and documented , and the stories of how this was put together and played out in the courtroom is truly fascinating . Good value and highly recommended .	1
Interesting , fun-to-read book about a mismatched bunch of eccentrics , some of them would-be psychos , who come together to form a pretty good baseball team without losing their hangups , uncertainties , fears , hopes , dreams and odd-ball ways.At times a laugh-out-loud book , always a fun , `` can't-put-it-down '' book especially for lovers of baseball , the game and all the personalities and stories that surround it . Not for the baseball purist , however , just the fun lovers . As with life and most good books , it has a serious side mixed with humor , compassion , anger and , always , emotion . Good Read ... ( Out of Print , but worth trying to find ... )	1
This book is a classic . I read it 15 years ago , but remember it well . It has a lot of wisdom embedded within its pages . I recommend not paying much attention to the one star reviews on this book . Note the dates that they were reviewed : all before the big market slumps of 2001-2002 and 2007-2008 . Back in the 90s many intelligent people thought we were in a new economy , recession proof , and that the market would never take another big dive because our technology and knowledge was so `` superior '' compared to what it was in the past . Hopefully they learned something from that experience . Graham tells it like it is . He is worth paying attention to . For a more complex version of this book read , `` Security Analysis '' by Graham .	1
I purchased this book shortly after I was introduced to Tony Hillerman 's series of books . His brother Barney Hillerman was the photographer . The book paints with images what Tony had painted with words . The photos are accompanied by brief ecerpts from Tony 's Books . I ordered ths copy because I knew my nephew enjoyed the books .	1
This is a massive ( 700 page ) , comprehensive , if not especially analytic , study of the United States ' relationship with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War , told from the perspectives of the superpowers ' leaders , John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev . At the beginning of his administration , Kennedy may have had sincere desire to improve relations with the Soviets , but his famous inaugural address was interpreted by many as a committed cold warrior 's call to arms , and , as Beschloss 's title implies , a series of foreign policy crises followed . Often in minute detail , Beschloss discusses the disastrous invasion of Cuba by opponents of Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs , the construction of the Berlin Wall , the proliferation of nuclear weapons , and the Cuban missile crisis . For those who enjoy narrative history liberally sprinkled with portraits of colorful personalities , this is a fascinating book.There is little in this book which is new , but much of it bears repeating , especially for readers too young to remember the early 1960s . However odious Castro 's dictatorship was to become , the attempt to topple it in the spring of 1961 was destined to fail . According to Beschloss , one of Kennedy 's advisers warned him that `` he could not recall a single case in history when refugees returned and successfully overthrew a revolutionary regime . '' The Berlin crisis that summer did not escalate into a nuclear confrontation because , as Kennedy observed : `` A wall is a hell of a lot better than a war . '' And Beschloss writes about the missile crisis that the 39 hours ' warning of the naval quarantine that Kennedy gave Khrushchev `` demonstrated the President 's wisdom in starting his response not with an irreversible air strike but with milder pressures that gave Khrushchev time to ponder his move . `` Some of Beschloss 's observations about the leaders border on gossip . He lends credence to reports that Khrushchev could be a buffoon who occasionally drank too much and that Kennedy 's enthusiastic womanizing continued while he was president . But personal traits and predilections often could not be separated from matters of substance . For instance , the author reports that Kennedy was regularly treated by a medical practitioner with `` vitamin shots '' which `` also contained amphetamines , steroids , hormones , and animal organ cells . '' Beschloss proceeds to explain the importance of this revelation : `` Even in small doses , amphetamines cause side effects such as nervousness , garrulousness , impaired judgment , overconfidence , and , when the drug wears off , depression . '' Beschloss implies that Kennedy may have been under the influence of amphetamines at his summit meeting with Khrushchev in the spring of 1961 , when the Soviet leader , by Kennedy 's own admission , `` just beat hell out of me . '' Beschloss concludes that Kennedy `` should have been vastly more careful in pursuing his medical experimentation than he had been as a Senator . The stakes now were not one political career but literally the fate of the world . `` This book is not without its limitations . As I implied above , it is much stronger on narrative than analysis , and some passages give the impression that Beschloss was more interested in the personalities of Kennedy and Khrushchev than in the substance of the policies they devised and pursued . Beschloss 's discussion of Kennedy 's approach to the growing conflict in Vietnam is brief and generally superficial . The book 's organization is quirky : The role of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in the development of Kennedy 's national-security policy is barely mentioned until page 400 . And the index is not entirely reliable . ( For instance , the index 's listing for Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , inexplicably omits reference to Beschloss 's description of a critical briefing Lemnitzer gave to the President in September 1961 in which the `` bottom line '' was that `` the United States enjoyed vast nuclear superiority . `` ) While I was preparing this review , I discovered that this book , which was published in 1991 , is already out of print , and that surprised me a bit . Some aspects of it clearly have been superceded by more recent scholarship , such as Lawrence Freedman 's Kennedy 's Wars : Berlin , Cuba , Laos , and Vietnam , which I reviewed here shortly after it was published last November , but I believe that Beschloss 's book continues to be of value . The magnificent 19th-century English historian Thomas Carlyle once wrote : `` The history of the world is but the biography of great men . '' Few eras provide more validation for Carlyle 's perspective than the crisis years of 1961 and 1962 , dominated as they were by the intensely personal diplomacy of Kennedy and Khrushchev . Beschloss 's coverage of that aspect of U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations during this period is superb .	1
I love the Tony Hillerman Southwestern Navajo reservation stories . They just make me want to live in a trailer under a cottonwood tree ! ! Seriously , I enjoy the Navajo religion aspects and the detective work is always interesting . It is almost a timeless book .	1
This book is solid gold . I absolutely recommend it.HOWEVER , the Kindle edition I bought is full of oddly-placed dashes and hyphens . Some of the drop-cap letters mysteriously do not appear where they should . I 've noticed spelling errors.Perhaps the printed edition does not have these errors ? The Kindle edition absolutely needs a copy editor to go through it .	1
I feel like I have reviewed this before . This book gives you a lot of what if scenarios , it is thought provoking and after reading it I can not see how we would survive if the Moon did not exist .	1
Ever wonder about the true story behind the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia ? Have you ever visited Abraham Lincoln 's Log Cabin , and wonder if it is authentic ? Well , look no further . In this book , Richard Shenkman sheds some light on some of the & quot ; stories & quot ; behind U.S. History as we know it.This book was , if anything , a really fascinating read . Shenkman did a lot of research in objecting to the time-held beliefs and traditions of some of the greatest pieces in American history . He mentions several historical things , and then counters them with his own detailed views and findings.The writing is very easy to follow , and the short , yet detailed chapters make the book a fairly quick read . I ca n't say that the book was a total & quot ; eye-opening & quot ; experience , but it was rather interesting.Is the tourist attraction of Betsy Ross ' house really hers ? Was Colombus ' reason for the journey to the New World really made up by Washington Irving ? Find out the answers to these and several questions like them in this entertaining book .	1
I 'm writing this review while still in thralls of finishing Maupin 's novel . I 've spent my Saturday trying to read The Night Listener through a veil of tears . I 'm not too ashamed to admit how much this book touched me . As a reader of Maupin since Tales of the City , I am in awe of Maupin 's ability to use his life experiences to throw light into the dark corners of my own experience ... the illuminations , the ruminations about life and love ; relationships ending , but not really ending ; musings about love and the intermittent times when that love also means war or worse yet , the horror of becoming irrelevant to the person you love the most ; father-son dynamics ; the pairing of insecurity and celebrity ; hope for new , different , more emotionally healthy beginnings ; the possibility of unconditional love ... ..analysis of how difficult that may be because our egos stand in the way . Can you tell I liked this book ? Yes , the book has a dark tone , a sad edge , it could challenge anyone not used to blunt language or the reader who does not possess a curious , open mind ; those readers however will never understand the power and resonance of Maupin 's work . Please read .	1
` Chez Panisse Vegetables ' by Alice Waters is a book you will want to seriously consider for your library in general , and especially if you are very fond of cooking vegetable dishes . This is not to say this is the best book on the veggie bookshelf , as there are several , both vegetarian and non that are as good or better . The most similar volume is ` Vegetables Every Day ' by Jack Bishop which , like Waters ' volume is organized by vegetable . And , in most easily measurable regards , Bishop 's book is superior if you simply can not have more than one veggie book on your shelves.For starters , Bishop 's book weights in at 388 pages for a list price of $ 30 while Ms . Waters has 336 pages for a list price of $ 35 . Bishop covers 68 named vegetables in his table of contents while Waters covers only 44 ; however , some of her 44 chapters cover two similar veggies , as in the chapter on broccoli and broccoli raab . Yet , while Waters gives us five recipes on these two products , Bishop gives us eleven ( 11 ) recipes on broccoli and four recipes for broccoli raab.Bishop also gives a lot more routine information on each vegetable . Every article , regardless of how many recipes may be given , has the same seven ( 7 ) paragraphs in the introductory article . The first paragraph simply introduces you to the vegetable and gives you a general idea of the appeal and usability of the vegetable . The next paragraph on availability gives the best season for the produce and whether or not the vegetable is currently available year round in American markets . The third paragraph on selection gives us criteria for whether we want to pick up today 's selection of a species or let it alone . The paragraph on storage is especially useful , as there is probably very little wisdom handed down from your Eastern European grandma on storing tomatillos , taro , or jicama or from your Mexican mom on dealing with arugula , bok choy , or burdock . The basic preparation paragraph can be simple for leafy greens or very complicated for artichokes . The very short section on best cooking methods is primarily useful for totally unfamiliar vegetables . A very useful last entry gives recipes on other vegetables in which the titular ingredient appears.But then , this review is about Waters ' book , so let 's get back to it . From the point of view of a book lover , there are a few things that recommend this book . First , like all of the Chez Panisse cookbooks , this one is very attractively illustrated in a vaguely French Art Nouveau style with what appear to be color pencil drawings for each vegetable . The table of contents also has the complete title of every recipe in the front of the book , which is a great help if you happen to be doing a quick search for a particular carrot or sweet potato recipe . Ms . Waters ' volume also includes recipes for some vegetables not covered in Mr. Bishop 's book such as Amaranth Greens , but Mr. Bishop returns the favor by covering several not highlighted by Ms. Waters.Even though Ms . Waters dedicates more pages to mushrooms than does Mr. Bishop , Bishop offers fourteen ( 14 ) mushroom recipes to Ms . Waters twelve ( 12 ) . And , Mr. Bishop tends to give more basic and more traditional recipes . Among his mushroom recipes , for example , he has a recipe for duxelles and for duxelles with scrambled eggs . Bishop also includes more recipes that include meat ; but neither book should be considered a vegan or vegetarian book , as both make heavy use of dairy products in their recipes.The two most positive things I can say about Ms . Waters book are that there is very little overlap of recipes between her book and Mr. Bishop 's book and her comments are much more fun to read between commercials while watching Rachael Ray or Alton Brown on the Food Network . The introductory text is less formal , but more interesting.While I have had Ms . Waters ' book longer than I have had Mr. Bishop 's volume , I still go to Chez Panisse first over all my other vegetable books , as Waters ' recipes are simple , elegant , and very well explained . I go to Bishop second if I ca n't find anything that appeals to me from Miss Alice.If you can , get both of these books over any other vegetable cookbook I have seen ( although I have certainly not seen all ) . But do not get them if you need strictly vegetarian recipes . For those , see Deborah Madison 's books , ` The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen ' by Peter Berley , or Crescent Dragonwagon 's encyclopedic ` Passionate Vegetarian'.Highly recommended for foodies and cookbook collectors .	1
I could n't stop reading this book . It seems to be a fair assessment of one of the world 's richest women . I especially loved the anecdotes about Ms. Duke 's sense of humor & sexual escapades . It just goes to prove money CA N'T buy you love . Highly recommended ! !	1
A look inside the personal life of an amazing woman . A story of someone who just wanted to have a good time and be loved .	1
I loved this book very much . I have read the original `` Les Miserables , '' and I find that `` Cosette '' is perfectly able to stand on her own two feet . It is very much a book for the more romantic reader , in the sense of the prose style being in places lush and dramatic , and yes , at times melodramatic . Some metaphors and similes Kalpakian uses would have been better left unsaid.As far as the rewriting of Hugo , well , if the idea was to copy Hugo , then Kalpakian would have been plagiarizing it . Why should n't Cosette 's character develop from a childish waif into an assertive woman ? I realize that the romance of Marius and Cosette was , at first , chaste , in the Rue Plumet , but once people are married , things change . People grow and mature and experience physical love . It would not have been appropriate for Hugo to discuss characters ' sex lives in the original , but Kalpakian 's novel was written in 1995 . I do not want to refer to thise book as others have done : a dime-store novel - because to me it is not ; I have read such novels and this is not one of them . Cosette is grand , sweeping and has its own flavor . The dialogue may have been updated to appeal to a certain more modern public , but you can be sure that profanity existed in Hugo 's day . Whether one chooses to express it or not is their own affair.I do take issue with some lines being taken directly from the musical - that is plagiarism and just plain bad judgment on the part of the author . For example , I much preferred Hugo 's original depiction and dialogue of the relationship between Marius and Eponine . Marius loved Cosette , and not Eponine - it is as simple as that .	1
I love this book as much for the stories as for the recipes . I also loved Paula Wolfert 's Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean . This is not a book about basic Mediterranean cooking that you usually see , nor is it vegetarian . These are wonderful , authentic recipes that taste like they are supposed to taste . I highly recommend this book .	1
This was my first Connie Briscoe novel and as it was worth every minute I spent turning those pages -- I 'll definitely be in the market for another Briscoe story , and I thank the members of my book club ( the Final Word Literary Guild of Fort Washington , MD ) for recommending it to the group . Only if you have a penchant for stories of history , particularly African American history and moreso , the slave era , can you have an appreciation for this book . I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the lives of a generation of slave women , getting to know intimately their day-to-day lives and the experiences of growing up a slave . The ultimate reward , of course , was witnessing their slow walk to blessed freedom . The reunion between the long separated sisters is touching . My absolute favorite and memorable characters were the sisters Susan and Ellen , the handsome Mr. Oliver Armistead , and Daddy Walker the hero . I promise you the reader that you wo n't be disappointed in this book or the author 's ability to bring the story to life .	1
I started out looking for a definitive biography of Jim Bowie and could not find one . But what I did find was this book , which wraps biographies of Bowie , David Crockett and William Travis together and separately until they all show up at the Alamo . The facts uncovered in this book are amazing . We all know that Travis was a lawyer who had some legal and social difficulties before moving to Texas , but this book spares nothing in the details . And Bowie ? A land swindler , forger , slave trader , liar . Again , the case made in this book is amazing . And Crockett ? We follow his career in the military , in Congress , and even in the route he took to get to Texas . This book is so well researched , it 's scary . And well written as well . I loved it . And I learned a lot about three men who , no matter what their failings , were prepared to die for their belief in Texas . A great book . A brilliant book .	1
Extremely well-written account of three of the most well known remarkable heroes of the Alamo . Anyone who is a fan of the Alamo , or anyone planning to visit the Alamo would want to read this book . It is extensively documented with almost 200 pages of notes . After visiting the Alamo , I ordered this book and could n't put it down , just having finished it . Will read it again . This book gave me new insights into what happened leading up to this famous battle and what may have happened during the battle . If you enjoyed this book or would like to read a shorter version of the story of the Alamo , I would recommend & # 34 ; The Bugles are Silent & # 34 ; by John R. Knaggs which is an historic novel but very well written . Both books will give a better understanding to the call : Remember the Alamo !	1
I loved Boy George in the 80 's . Did n't know that he had so many problems and `` friends '' that took avantage of him . I could n't put it down .	1
Again another great book by John Gilstrap ... wonderful development of the characters and I have preordered the next two John Gilstrap books..A very good series ...	1
Suspend your disbelief and get ready for a most intense ride.It 's got so much going for it . A fabulous plot that mixes a kid wrongly accused on the run , a police manhunt , a savvy contract killer on the loose , a politically motivated DA , a cop who beleives the kid ( Nathan ) just might be a victim and not a murderer.Add a top rated DC talk show host to give the country the play by play and you have a book impossible to put down . I knocked it off in two sittings . It was nonstop action and I felt exhausted when all was resolved.If I am not mistaken this is John Gilstrap 's initial novel . I will be tracking down his later works .	1
I started reading The Angel On The Roof : The Stories Of Russell Banks , his de facto Collected Stories- thirty-one of them , twenty-two old tales and nine new ones , right after I had finished David Foster Wallace 's Girl With Curious Hair . Thank God ! Banks is everything that is claimed about Wallace- he 's a terrific writer who challenges the form of short story writing , has depth and insight , and writes well on a range of people and subjects , although the bulk of the stories follow a group of people in a small New Hampshire town called Catamount- many set in a trailer park . I 've not read the longer novels of Banks , but I shall , some day , as that is what he is primarily known for , and many critics say he is even better in that form . As it is Banks is right there with Raymond Carver as one of the best published short story writers of the last forty years . While I do n't think his best is as good as Carver 's , and does not have as many great short stories , he is far more consistent . The worst tales in the book are still solid , perhaps too long ( ala The Guinea Pig Lady ) and/or a bit unfocused , whereas Carver 's worst is really bad . Either way , his stuff beats the PoMo crap of a Wallace by a mile.The typical Banks protagonist is a middle-aged blue collar man with failed relationships behind him , and a bleak future ahead , yet whose optimism remains unfettered . There is usually a moment of epiphany , although the character often misses it . His characters are not as drunk , nor as dilettante as a Raymond Carver protagonist , and their world is more twilit , but they also are more competent , and generally nicer . It 's also good to see that Banks refutes many of the claims made about him as a writer- which , while positive , are wrong . He is most certainly not a brutally honest writer , but a massively skilled prevaricator whose lies cut an emotional swath that few published writers of fiction or non-fiction ( and even poetry ) can match . The only real weaknesses he shows is occasionally going on too long , and merely competent dialogue . His tales involving real life people as Edgar Allan Poe and Che Guevara are also not particularly good . It 's in the poetic reaches of his speaker 's monologues that he truly shines.Yet , Banks is no mere regionalist . As strong as his tale of New Hampshire is , his tales set in Africa , India , Indochina , and other parts of America , are equally engaging . Russell Banks is a great short story writer and this book is the proof of that claim .	1
This is one of the very best cookbooks I have ever used ! Out of 75+ cookbooks I own , this one gets used repeatedly . The sauces are delicious , and for the most part , very easy to prepare . The recipes are so simple to follow that I prepare most of the sauces from memory now , and it should take only 2 or 3 preparations before you can do these sauces by heart . With a few exceptions , the ingredients are all pretty commonplace . There is almost nothing in your garden that can not be used in one of these sauces.This is just a great cookbook in all respects !	1
I read & # 34 ; Cutting for Stone & # 34 ; which is Dr Vergehese 's first novel and had to find out more about him . This is his second memoir and I think better than his first & # 34 ; My Own Country & # 34 ; although that was very good too . FYI : check out his Facebook page ... lots of cool links particualr & # 34 ; 1000 Awesome Things & # 34 ; blog .	1
I read , at least , five books a week and once in a while , buy one I 've read before . This was the case with Chuck Logan 's , & quot ; The Price of Blood. & quot ; I must admit , I was delighted to find I enjoyed it even more the second time around . The beautifully fleshed out characters , the plot and search for hidden treasure , the contrast between brutality and compassion , along with subtle , but titalating love scenes can do nothing but cause you to turn pages with a longing for more . The ending is up for grabs until the last page and makes you hunger for his next book .	1
I just recently bought this for my husband so it is not a book a can review but it was recommended to him by several people	1
I found the first two thirds of this book incredibly exciting and enjoyable . I loved the way events were strung together from five different angles . I thought the way the style of writing change depending on whether it was the mother or one of the daughters telling us the story was superb . I enjoyed the poetic and sensitive parts of the mother and Adah . The forthright Leah and the so very cute parts of Ruth May were also a pleasure to read . I think Barbara Kingsolver had trouble trying to write for Rachel Price , an ignorant , self absorbed and mean spirited teenager and a woman.I was so captivated by the beautiful writing of Orleanna , in the first section and found the book impossible to put down after that . The way Kingsolver described life in a Congo village from the five different perspectives made feel like I was actually there , smelling the forest and looking over the little black kids in rags playing in the red dust.I loved the parts about the language and how one word can mean so many different things , that at times are related yet appear almost opposite . I found myself laughing out loud at the `` Tata Jesus is bangala '' , which what Rev . Price used to come closer to the villagers yet had a different meaning from what he intended . Kingsolver 's appreciation of the Congolese culture , people and habits was rooted in her appreciation of the linguistic subtleties of their language . She did a masterful job getting this across to the reader.My main criticism of this book , is the way some of the characters come across so very narrow . Rev . Price and Rachel practically have nothing good about them , both are self centered and generally mean spirited . On the other hand Anatole is perfection itself in every facet . The other characters were much better rounded and a lot more believable.As to the politics of the book , even though I do not know much about Congolese and Belgian colonial history , I suspect Kingsolver analysis is again one sided and overly romantic . ( I finished reading this book on the day Mugabe said he would rule over Zimbabwe even if he loses the elections . ) I struggle to think of one African leader from the liberation movements of the 1960 's who did not end up an oppressive dictator . Could Lumemmba have been a different kind of a leader ? No one will ever know .	1
The only mystery to me is why I waited so long to read this.Comparisons to & # 34 ; Mosquito Coast & # 34 ; are inadequate . I loved Mosquito Coast and have revisited it a few times over the years . This book is better , richer , multi-dimensional . The author plays the five voices like a virtuoso . Highly recommended .	1
This is one of the best books I 've read in a long time . This was required of a literature class I 'm taking and it 's incredible . I love how the author uses crazy southern slang in the novel , as the characters are from Georgia . Being from the South , I appreciated the dialect . This book is an easy read and I highly recommend it .	1
This novel took my breath away . The writing is exquisite , the characters are alive and real . But most of all , this book offers an insightful view into the inter-relatedness of all life on earth ... how even the smallest action has a reaction . While telling a compelling story , it also urges us to move through the world with greater sensitivity and understanding about the role we play and the impact we have . This book has it all -- beautiful writing , great story , insight into the human condition , and a thought-provoking view our our relationship to the earth , the world and to each other . This is a & quot ; must read & quot ; book .	1
I am listening to the tale of the Price family 's devaststing adventures in the Belgian Congo as it shifts from colony to unstable and frightening independent state . The reader , a perfect choice for the story , enhances the experience tenfold .	1
I do n't know really what I was expecting from this book and it was a little slow to start , but soon discovered myself pulled in and enjoying every page of it ! I thought the story was well-told and kept my interest . The format added to the story as well ... getting to hear various sides of the story from different characters was a unique way to go , but effective and gave the feeling at times that you were flipping through different books . This was especially true as time went on and the family members all parted ways . I 'd recommend it definitely , but would warn that you need to push through the first few chapters to really get into the story .	1
It took me a couple of chapters to get the feel of the book and to get me hooked . Reading the same story told from four different perspectives gave you the insight to each of the four characters challenges . In some ways it is a coming of age story but at a different caliber . It is heartbreaking and insightful into the lives of African nations and how they compare to ours and how they may have viewed Christians coming into their lives to save their souls . Also it touches on the way countries have exploited the continent and the corruption of the African people even at the hands of their own . Even though it is fiction I would dare to say there is truth in the writings . It is humbling to read and makes you relies how blessed and fortunate our lives are even in the worst of times .	1
Each person in this book , and I say person because they all are well defined , is some aspect of a friend , acquaintance or family member you have experienced in life . I miss these people and mourn for an entire continent . The language and nuances are perfect and the emotions expressed from the characters and evoked from the reader are tender and real . This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it .	1
This book begins a little slow , but is really worth those few pages to get to the meat of the story . Getting inside the heads of these characters was great and the overall book was fantastic !	1
I enjoyed this book up until about 80 % through it . Basically , I thought at first that I would completely hate it since it was about religion and about Africa - both of which frankly do n't usually interest me . However , I found it captivating and intriguing . I was addicted and read it non-stop . ... That is , until the main story ended and the & quot ; aftermath & quot ; story began . Then , the book lost it 's magic and lost what made it so captivating to begin with.The first 80 % of the book was tremendous - deep , beautiful and just grand . The different conflicts that were going on - between husband and wife , children and parents , and community and preacher are just terrific.Some other reviewers call this book & quot ; male bashing & quot ; - I do n't quite see that one . I guess the antagonist happens to be male and a wife does battle her husband , but I do n't think I would characterize it as & quot ; male bashing. & quot ; My recommendation is to read the book . However , be aware that the interest may be lost after a certain time .	1
Barbara Kingsolver 's ambitious novel `` The Poisonwood Bible '' charts the course of Nathan Price , his wife and four daughters as they travel as missionaries to the Congo in the 1960s . The narration alternates between Nathan 's wife and daughters in turn , and each voice is pleasingly distinct . During their first year in Africa , the children ( and their mother ) find that in this jungle they can never quite succeed in holding on to the familiar beliefs that have brought them this far , and struggle to discover what can replace them.The first two-thirds of the book are luminous . The multitude of characters are all piercingly human , the African environment richly realized , the writing sheer poetry . ( The first page alone should have word lovers salivating . ) These first four of the novel 's seven `` books '' can be recommended without reservation.In the last third , things , as they say , fall apart . After spending 350 pages on roughly one year in the life of her protagonists , Kingsolver takes us on a whirlwind tour of the next three decades of African politics in what comes to feel like a 200-page epilogue . The last three `` books '' bear a gratingly didactic tone , and the rushed account of the girls ' sudden adulthood is much less pleasant reading than their meticulously-rendered first year in Africa.But despite the misplaced history lesson and the weak , belated ending , the brilliance of the first four books is enough to qualify this as a must-read.~	1
I have read the posted bad reviews ( or as many as there were through the 220th review ) and they did not convince me that this is a book not worth reading . This is a book to be cherished and discussed because it is a work of literature.I had the pleasure of hearing Barbara Kingsolver on her book tour promoting & quot ; Prodigal Summer & quot ; . Most of the questions from the audience were about Poisonwood , and Kingsolver expained her writing style . She starts with a theme , then comes up with a question that the story must address . After that she decides what voices are needed to explore and resolve the theme and the question . This book started out with four narrators , but she realized that four points of view were not enough , so one character split into two , the twins Adah and Leah . The theme of this book is redemption , and the question posed is how can we redeem ourselves after we have made mistakes . All kinds of mistakes are made in this book by all of the main characters , and they are all seeking redemption , whether they know it or not . Some do not find it , some stop looking , others do find it . It is an epic journey spanning 30 years , and a story to be savored by her readers.There are a couple of posted reviews saying she needed to research this book more . She researched this book for 20 years ! She had file cabinets full of information that she collected over the years ; so much so that she referred to this book as 'The Damn Africa Book ' . She told a story of standing for hours in a zoo waiting for a green mamba snake to open its mouth so she could put it in this book . She wrote every scene in this book from all five narrators ' perspectives so that we could distinguish their voices without seeing the name at the beginning of the chapter . It is her magnum opus , and readers who do not understand it are not serious readers of literature ; they just do n't get it.This is a book to be read , and re-read , and discussed , and studied , by readers of serious fiction . It is not a light-hearted read , and it is not for everyone . But for those of us who get it , we are in awe .	1
Having been to Kenya a few times , I relished her descriptions of the sights , smells and sounds of Africa . The family dynamics kept me engaged throughout the book . A great read !	1
I read the Poisonwood Bible when it first came out . I never really loved Barbara Kingsolver 's earlier books , but both Poisonwood Bible and Prodigal Summer are amazing . I ca n't believe that Poisonwood Bible only got 4 stars on Amazon -- it really makes me question the whole review system when I see other books get higher marks . Anyway , the writing , concept , characters , setting , etc are all incredibly vivid and compelling and readable . I envy the person who is getting to read it for the first time .	1
Poisonwood Bible is set in the 1960 's in Georgia and The Congo . A missionary family travels to The Congo to bring Christianity to these people . The trip is ill-fated in many ways . There is a lot of humor , too , in some of the characters . Ms. Kingsolver 's insights continue to amaze and so many lines in the book are very quotable . This is the second book by Ms. Kingsolver I have read and I really liked both of them .	1
The growing legion of feminist writers are taking us along some disturbing paths . Earlier demands for 'equality ' have been replaced by the 'FemiNazis ' approach of judging and condemning men who are denied a defensive voice . Historically , male writers may have overlooked or patronized women , but rarely presented them as arch-villains . Kingsolver assembles four daughters and a wife as Star Chamber prosecutors sitting in judgment of man selling Jesus in the Congolese jungle . Dragged from Eisenhower 's America to an African village , the wife and girls heap scorn on Nathan Price for his failure to comprehend the new setting while they deftly learn to cope . Closing the last page brought disappointment at not learning the motivation for Price 's bizarre behaviour . What torments drove him to such a narrow outlook and single-mindedness ? The sliver of evidence about Bataan was grossly inadequate . It 's tempting to contend Kingsolver ca n't grasp a male viewpoint.Fortunately , this book has too many redeeming features to condemn it for feminist bias alone . Kingsolver 's descriptive powers are a seductive force . They lead the reader from the narrow personal issues expressed Orleanna and her daughters to the weltanschauung of America 's imperialism . From the abrupt culture clash opening the story , Kingsolver goes on to grant Orleanna and her four daughters an increasing sense of African realities . Their growing awareness raises the stress between Nathan and his brood . He can not perceive what they learn - Nathan 's dogmatism has no place on this stage . They find ways to circumvent his rigidity , even his favourite draws away from him over a question of survival . Finally , the loss of one of them triggers the diaspora of the rest . Nathan is abandoned to continue his failed mission.The real missionary here is n't Nathan Price , however . It 's Barbara Kingsolver . Using the Price family to portray the spectrum of American views of other cultures , she strives to educate Americans about the follies of their own self-righteousness . Aware that the phrase 'globalization ' is but flimsy camouflage for & quot ; Americanization & quot ; , Kingsolver fathoms the resentment of the Kilangan villagers toward Nathan as a small symptom . It is an example of the growing enmity of the remainder of the world to Americans imposing on other cultures . Kingsolver uses the later lives of the daughters as an observation platform to make today 's generation of Americans aware of the legacy of missionarying geopolitics . Nathan comes to a fiery end . Will Americans come to understand why their ships and embassies are bombed ? These are but sparks heralding a greater conflagration to come . Given the overwhelming power America exercises , there will be no trial weighing its transgressions . But there will be judgments.Self-righteousness clouds vision and judgment ; Kingsolver 's effort , beautifully crafted as it is , may be lost on those who most need to perceive it . If the general tone of the reviews here is representative , her powers of description may have overwhelmed the message . Pity , it 's a message that needs to be heard clearly . Recent political events suggest too few are listening .	1
An exciting story about a fanatical missionary and the impact he and Africa have on his family . Kingsolver 's descriptive powers are excellent . Although a little drawn out at the end , it still keeps you turning pages .	1
In my mind , the `` Poisonwood Bible '' is probably Barbara Kingsolver 's best work . It 's a lot deeper than her other literary accomplishments , and it manages to wrap a generally good theme around a half-way decent plot.On the same note , however , that theme is especially tainted . The reader should realize the Kingsolver never visited the Congo and could not fully grasp life under Mobutu 's dictatorship , on which she becomes exceedingly vocal . If you intend to read the book , do not read it to get a better insight on African tribalism and political nature , for you will only come away with a Super-PC viewpoint of anti-Western interventionism . Kingsolver fails to incorporate the many successes of Western intervention in Africa , especially in the modern-day context , and even portrays many missionary organizations that were particularily helpful in immunizing children in Africa as `` agents of the West . `` Understandably , it is not possible for a fiction book such as this of an `` Oprah 's Book Club '' caliber to sensibly endeavor in Africa 's political system . Although some of her descriptions are justifiably legitimate , her own agenda toward non-intervention is increasingly clear throughout the novel . ...	1
I was assigned this book for summer reading , and I was expecting it to be typical Oprah book material . I was pleasantly surprised . There is a lot of hidden cynical thoughts , and some sassy comments . This book was a delight to read , and kept me turning the pages . It can be a nice story , or if you want to look deeper , it can be a book with a lot of umph to it . There is a lot of symbolism . The story is about a semi-mad missionary who drags his wife and four daughters into the Congo with him , during Independence . Kingsolver follows not only the Congo 's transformation but also those of the mother and daughters . Brilliantly written , the author can switch characters with such skill .

Oscar Hijuelos writes of people with intense rich interior lives . These are people we admire for their emotional constancy and pity for their obsessions . I 've read three of Oscar Hijuelos ' novels . This is the least engaging of the three , but still a very nice book .	1
After 30 years of not reading , I began an aggressive reading program in 2001.The highlight of my high school years ( graduated 1969 from high school ) was a summer course at St Olaf College , Minnesota , on the Romantic Era . That was all the culture I really had except for a liberal arts education in which I majored in biology/chemistry.Having said all that , and having enjoyed that aggressive reading program as alluded to earlier , this is a fantastic summary by a noted writer.This is just like having Jacques Barzun in my home every evening for a year or so for dinner and listening to him expound on western culture.Are there errors ? I assume there are in a book of 800 pages covering 500 pages . Do they matter ? Hardly . This is for enjoyment . I never listened to the symphonies of Berlioz until I read Barzun 's description , and now I love Berlioz . That experience alone was worth the price of the book , but one can not value such a book in dollars and cents.This is a book that I would take on summer island vacation ... .and indeed , I have . It is one of two `` big '' books I am reading this summer ( the other is a biograpy of William James ) .I have added excerpts of the book at my blog ; google million dollar literature .	1
Getting from one end of this epic work to the other is a gargantuan and less-than-simple task , but it is also entirely worth the effort . In the first ten pages , I had developed a new appreciation for how ( and why ) religion is practiced the way it is in the West , and the insights went on from there . It 's dry in patches ( as any history of five centuries is apt to be ) , but Barzun presents a compelling case for the decline of Western civilization . This is several history courses neatly wrapped into one book , and for a remarkably low price .	1
OK , a HISTORY text of this length is a challenge . But the depth & amp ; scope are so thoughtfully displayed -- it creates a sense that there is indeed -- actually some pattern amidst the chaos & amp ; madness.Life , legacy and self-examination often become overwhelming . This book cuts through the bog of self-doubt and frustration . It provides a path thru the journey of who we are and where we 're going -- by clearing discussing where we 've been.I know it 's good , when I find myself picking it up to browse again and again . I know it 's great when I am compelled to recommend it to others .	1
Of course , this masterful work of 800 pages is not perfect in every detail . In the many references to political events I noticed some errors and imprecisions . Of course , one can argue about the selection of the many hundreds of persons described by the author , who have made geat cultural , artistic or scientific contributions . As a Dutchman , I regret that Dutch leading artists , philosophers and scientist did n't get their due share of attention . Barzun 's chapters on the sciences are not quite on the same level as those on the arts , and especially literature . But in such an ambitious and , on the whole , succesfull master piece , all these objections only concern points of detail . The author justifies his sometimes arbitrary selection of the persons he describes with the argument that new developments rarely are the work of a single person . Mostly , new ideas are already in the air . There are always different contrasting and conflicting ideas at work . One of the major advantages of Barzun 's magnum opus is that the author has a sharp eye for the fact that no epoch is characterized by a single idea . For instance , Barzun makes the reader conscious of the fact that there is more to Victorian morality than a narrow-minded , repressed attitude towards sexuality ; that puritanism was not solely characterized by fanaticism and bigotry ; that Rousseau 's ideas were less absurd and one-sided than most people believe and that Nietzsche ment almost the opposite of what the larger public thinks he ment.Barzun starts his work around 1500 , the time of Renaissance and Reformation , two currents of ideas he rightly considers as representing a new starting point for western culture . He frequently reports events which you hardly will find at any other place . For instance the political activities of de Beaumarchais , author of The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro , who in 1776 as a secret agents helped to finance the American revolt against the English . A very positive thing is that Barzun regularly gives advise about accessible books in which questions treated by him are exposed at greater length . The drawback is , of course , that reading all these books would represent almost a life time of reading ! An other objection against the book could be that little notice is given to economical factors . Phenomena like the labour movement , colonialism and decolonialism could have been treated at greater length . And when Barzun critically notices that all these modern household appliances do not always make life more easy , but often tend to complicate it , het omits a reference to the important social phenomenon of the virtual disappearance of the domestic . But in defense of the author , I have to point out that for economic and social history there exist other books . Barzun 's speciality is the history of ideas . In this he excells . He considers literature to be our most important source for studying the ideas that dominate a certain epoch.Quite controversial , of course , is Barzuns opinion , which he expresses in the title of his work , that Western Civilization has now entered a period of decadence . Barzun sees a number of manifestations of this decadence : - the dominant exagerated relativism , which prevent people of distinguishing works of real merit from garbage ; this results in artists and thinkers not being stimulated any more to great exertions in order to produce works of quality ; ( This is a tendency also criticized by the French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut in his book La d & eacute ; faite de la pens & egrave ; e ) - the prevalent moral laxity , which leads to the decay of education and the increase of criminality ; - the persistent denial of the necessity of self control and a sense of responsibility , which increasingly erodes the moral foudations of our society ; - the by now almost unbridgeable chasm between an avant-garde art , that in some respects has derailed , and the larger public ; - the co-existence of a technical elite , who excells in a one-sided , very specialized expertise about small areas of knowledge , with a semi-literate mass , which does not have any respect for anything pertaining to higher culture ; - the increasing fragmentation of society . Under the pretext of national identity , auto-determination and subculture even larger groups of people are turning their backs to the rest of society . With the decay of Christianity a whole set of values and norms shared by the entire society has disappeared.Barzun recognizes that techne ( science and technology ) is florishing more than ever before , but in his view that does not compensate for the prevailing decadence in other , more important areas of culture . Barzun recognizes that decadence is not an abnormal phenomenon in an overly mature civilization . He situates the beginning of this decadence not in the years after 1960 , nor even in those after 1920 , but already in the period around 1890 . When the author claims that in the past decades this decadence has reached a terminal stage , he is to somber , I think . Or anyhow , I hope . He does not exclude the posibility that on the ruins of western society , as we know it from the past 500 years , a new civilization will arise in due time.Those who think that current society with its lazy we are the world ethos of cheap progressivism , unbounded relativism , indifferent tolerance and uncommited humanitarianism represents the akme of moral perfection , will be well advised to take notion of the signs of desintegration and decadence which Barzun brings to our attention.To conclude , I can heartily advise reading this book to anyone who has the time and the stamina to read a fascinating , but demanding book of 800 pages . You do n't have to agree on every point with the author to recognize the value of this book . Having formulated quite a few minor objections , I have to say that in view of the merits of this book , I would consider it a sign of Dutch stingyness to withhold Barzun even one of the five stars .	1
Imagine being a smart , intelligent man who just also happens to have a mental illness . Dr. W.C. Minor began his adulthood with every promise but mental illness , following his service in the American Civil War , resulted in his killing of a man and his commitment to an English asylum . While there , he discovered a query for people to submit definitions for the first Oxford English Dictionary . Suddenly , Minor had a purpose . The result was that he submitted more than 10,000 definitions and an unusual acquaintance between Minor and the dictionary 's editor , James Murray.This book details the history of the dictionary , the history of Minor and its similarities to Murray 's own life . It has no action , but the tale fascinates from the beginning to the end . A good read if you love words and history .	1
This true tale of two lexicographers ( and friends ) is a most engaging story . Contrary to what one critic has termed a & quot ; spare & quot ; style , author Simon Winchester 's prose is elegant .	1
but a little long in some places . As a matter of fact , there were a few episodes I could have gone without knowing ( body mutilations ) , but otherwise , a very informative read . Who would have thought that such a scholary work would have been influenced by such a strange individual as the & quot ; madman & quot ; ? What was also interesting about this book was the background regarding the making of the dictionary itself as well as its place in history . I am not a real avid reader of history , but this was quite informative and held my attention .	1
I never thought that I would like a book about dictionaries and the geeks who write them . The story was complex but understandable .	1
This book is great in a historical aspect . It shows how the brutality of the American army back then could scar a person for life . This book also gives a good idea on psychological disorders .	1
I will never take a dictionary for granted again . The effort that went into the compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary in Victorian England , long before the days of computers , was a cumbersome and manual process that took decades . Professor James Murray is a fascinating character and his passion for words and their etymology is admirable . But the interesting facet of this story is that of Dr. W.C. Minor . The creators of the dictionary readily accepted his significant contributions , despite his confinement to an insane asylum . Minor 's paranoia and delusions are masochistic and Winchester presents his madness in a disturbingly gripping way . But at the heart of this book is the love of words that Murray and Minor share . It was an extremely intriguing tale of the history and creation of one of the definitive works of the English language .	1
I heard about this book on a history podcast and knew I needed to read it . It is fascinating on many levels . First of all , the amount of thought and work that went into the original Oxford English Dictionary is unbelievable . That such a project was ever completed is mind bogglilng . Then , to discover that one of the more prolific contributors to the project was certifiably criminally insane , and to juxtapose these two interesting stories , makes for an excellent read . I enjoyed the long chapter beginnings which quote the dictionary at first , but found myself skipping them towards the end in order to get on with the story !	1
One would not expect a history of the Oxford English Dictionary to be particularly interesting , but indeed , there is quite a story behind it . A tremendous amount of the dictionary 's research was done by a convicted murderer mired in severe mental illness . This book recounts the strange tale of how W.C. Minor came to write significant portions of the dictionary and , more broadly , how the OED came to be.The OED is undeniably a tremendous achievement . Winchester is clearly enamored of the dictionary ; he states unequivocally that the OED is the most important dictionary in human history . He makes little of the various criticisms that have been waged against the dictionary : its orientation towards white , middle class language conventions , its imperialist outlook . Winchester has other interests , and can not be criticized for that . Still , his dismissal of these criticisms is so absolute that it does make one wonder . Overall , this is a compelling story , enjoyably told .	1
As someone who never uses dictionaries because she finds them dull and loaded with complicated abbreviations , I thought Winchester 's story would be much the same . However , I truly enjoyed getting to know Professor Murray and W.C. Minor ; their long distance relationship by letter was focused on apt quotations for well-defined words , but it 's apparent their correspondence meant much more to both men .	1
I enjoyed this book . This was another book I read because I am in a book club . I did recommend it to a friend .	1
A very interesting and entertaining story incorporating a feel for the Victorian Era , historical treatment of mental illness and the personal story of the relationship of two men who were instrumental in creating the OED .	1
I love words -- the way they slide off your fingertips letter-by-letter and dance on the screen in front you ; the way they roll from your tongue out into shared space . I also love the history of words , the meanings behind the words we use -- yet never before have I loved the HISTORY of a DICTIONARY . Odd thing to read about , yes ? No.This book is a fantastic history of the evolution of the greatest English dictionary ever created . More fabulously , it details the friendship between two men -- both with unique minds -- and how that friendship influenced their lives and the dictionary.A good ( and thin ) read . And with a bonus & quot ; call for readers & quot ; at the end , we are given chance to contribute . Although it 's doubtful that any single person could contribute half as much as the & quot ; Madman & quot ; did .	1
This was an excellent read from start to finish . The small details of how the Oxford English Dictionary came to be were fascinating as well as the explanations of the histories of some of the words we use everyday . Even better than that was the histories of the Dr. Minor and Professor James Murray and how they came to know and respect each other and even become friends . It was also good that the author gave a lot of information about the vitim and what became of his family after the fact . Often this is neglected in stories of this nature . In all I thought it was a great book .	1
This book is an interesting story about the characters involved in the creation of the Oxford English dictionary . The story was new to me . The book is written not as a dry history , but more as a popular fiction would be . The discussion of the mental illness of one of the important volunteer contributors to that effort was treated with respect and with the complexity that the subject deserves . I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested in a fascinating story .	1
Grippando is a fascinating author . Unpredictable endings . Always interesting character development . We have ordered three more of his books . Printed out a list in order .	1
Put simply , I LOVE this book ! I 've just finished reading it for the second time and it 's even better than it was the first time.I read it when it first came out in 1994 and was so jazzed to find it a few weeks ago in a used bookstore . I had a few other things to read before I picked up Dolly , but now that I have , I do n't want it to end ! I ca n't say enough good and great and amazing things about this biography . She wrote it herself and it 's honest , down to earth and funny as all get out . Because of it , I even added some more Dolly Parton CD 's to my music collection and it was a very much needed trip down memory lane.Thanks , Dolly , for such an amazing , revealing look at what makes you tick . Now , what I want to know is : when is your next book coming out . : )	1
This was a really fun book to read . Dolly tells it like it is . She tells stories of choosing to take a spanking as a child rather than work , running around in the moonlight naked because it was fun , and hiding in the trees during the day so she did n't have to do chores like her siblings.Dolly always knew she was destined for stardom and had the personality for it from an early age . You will roll in the floor laughing at her stories and frank observations of life . A must read for any Dolly fan , or country music lover .	1
Some people who 've posted reviews here feel this book is not significant but I think we can all relate to being teased at school and trying to get by as a child . I loved this memoir and recommend it to anyone else who also loves memoirs or autobiographies .	1
This book is certainly not your average book . Mister B. talks directly to you throughout the whole book as if the two of you are sitting at a table having a discussion ; Albeit one-sided and very demented . He interrupts his own stories to demand repeatedly to BURN THIS BOOK or he will kill you . And do n't think he wo n't . He means it . Seriously.There are no chapters to define different settings or trains of thought . It 's just one continuous writing . Or speaking . Or ... I do n't know , it 's so weird . He 's talking to you , but it 's in typed words due to the fact that he is , essentially , the book itself.So basically , he regales you with the sordid tales of his life 's journeys beginning with his abusive and unloved life in hell , to his ascent to the upper realm of Earth and his `` relationships '' with others on Earth , and then on to how he became stuck where he is now : In your hands . All this in exchange for your agreement to BURN THE DAMN BOOK ( or him ? ) when he 's through . After all , he knows we humans are too curious - or stupid , in his opinion - for our own good , and would n't just burn a book because some character in it told us to without telling us why . I mean , really ... that 's just absurd . Even if it is for our own good . And life.What I liked : First , the pages of this book are beyond cool . They 're made to look like old , weathered , water spotted pages and give the book a truly unique appearance . Second , the fact that the main character of the book talks directly to you is awesome . He makes you believe that he is actually looking at you from between the words on the pages and is watching every expression your face makes . It would be as if you had a demon friend from the lowest level of hell who you just happened to run in to one day and sat down to catch up with one another . You , only listening while he talks because , of course , your boring , inconsequential human life does n't matter compared to his more intelligent , purposeful demon life.What I did n't like : there are certain parts of the book when Mister B. has a tendency to ramble.Last word : All in all , this book and its characters were well thought out and put together nicely . Clive Barker truly has a wild imagination and reading a book written in such a way was truly a unique experience.Reviewed by Ceara	1
Every woman over the age of forty should have this book on her shelf ! It is a tribute for staying young , current , and 'with it ' .

Joan will guide you , page by page , to living your life to the fullest , and yet , be age-appropriate !	1
I happened to pick this book up at a garage sale ~~ and this past week was just perfect to unwind from the holiday craziness with a good book and this one just happened to beckon my name ! I could n't put this one down for the world ! Thankfully , my husband was home to entertain the kids ( thankfully also , the kids were entertained by their new toys ) ~~ and I was able to sit and read this book through . Like I said , this is my first Socttoline book and it wo n't be the last either ! Judy Cartier agrees to take on the case of Pigeon Foot Tony , an Italian man accused of murdering another Italian man . What makes this case even more difficult is that he did n't deny killing the man . Digging deeper into the backgrounds , Judy finds out what vendetta really is and fighting against a top Italian family as well as the police force , Judy races to find a way to defend her client . The investigation takes several twists and turns and digging deeper into a feud that has lasted over 50 years.This is an enjoyable mystery novel ~~ for one thing , it really gives an idea of who the clients are and it gives a background history of the client that brings the reader to an understanding of the vendetta and the characters are better developed than most mystery novels are . It was n't predictable like I thought it would be ~~ I find myself holding my breath in several spots . And it was n't a typical mobster story either . It was a great read ~~ perfect for a lazy winter afternoon by the fireplace . Scottoline is definitely an author I will keep an eye out for ! 1-2-06	1
This is a great novel brimming with typical Scottoline action and cutting-edge humor ... ; I love the books that revolve around Rosato & amp ; Associates , taking you into the head of each character . Where I disliked & quot ; Murphy & quot ; in & quot ; The Vendetta Defense , & quot ; seeing her through the eyes of Judy , I developed a true affection for her in this novel . The author takes you into the head of Anne Murphy , where you find that everything is n't as it appears to be ; where she appears to be the epitome of physical perfection , the truth is she struggled with a congenital birth defect during her younger years . While grappling with a newfound affection for her coworkers and her boss , and discovering the value of true friendship among the same , Anne must track down the man who thinks that he actually killed her ... before he truly succeeds.Scottoline fans wo n't be disappointed ... . !	1
I bought this novel after some discussion on an Internet Forum . The novel provides some light reading - something like chocolate for the mind . Anne Murphy is similar to Stephanie Plum . If you like the novels about Steph , you will like this novel . If you do n't like Steph , than you wo n't like Anne . The novel is not great literature , but the three stooges were not great theater . Publishers are in a business to make money and novels of this type appeal to an audience looking for light comedy . The novel has its moments , like when the women from the law firm act like happy hookers . The novel opens with a male stripper showing his stuff in a courtroom , and that sets the tone.There is a plot , actually a couple wound together . Anne is having trouble with a stalker , the reason she left California , and she is defending a man in a lawsuit in a case where he is charged with sexual harassment . There is also a sub-plot about her relationship with her mother . There is a twist at the end , something one expects in Scottoline 's novels.You get a little Philadelphia background along the way , and a picture of 4th of July activities ranging from traffic to the beach , to block parties in the city , to the main event with fireworks .	1
The intellectual and political climate of Jacobean England is the core subject of `` God 's Secretaries '' . Indeed , Adam Nicolson is primarily interested in showing how the leading personalities and issues of the day combined to make this great book possible . This means that readers ( such as me ) who are looking for a book about the writers and translators of the King James Bible-imagine `` Here at the New Yorker '' with a biblical twist-will be disappointed . Alas , most of this information is lost.Nonetheless , there were a few amazing tidbits about the participants in this great project . My favorite is about John Layfield , a writer who actually journeyed to the Caribbean and then contributed to the work on Genesis in this bible . The experience enriched Layfield 's prose and perspective , Nicolson claims . He says : `` The seventeenth-century English idea of Paradise , a vision of enveloping lushness , was formed by this seduction of an almost untouched Caribbean . ''	1
As always , visiting and reading the words of the previous 63 reviews has proved to be enlightening and useful . Because of certain comments and objections offered in the past , it seems to me that I should begin with statements of what this book is NOT : -- This book is not an advocate of any particular religious issue , sect or cause. -- This book is not a Bible study or , indeed , any sort of religious study guide . Those seeking an exposition of religious truth should turn away right now . This is not for you. -- This book is not an academic text , being largely free of any formal thesis and paying no particular homage to whatever Theory happens to be on the academic boil these days . Academic drudges burrowing for material with which to footnote their footnotes will be wasting their time here in a manner even more dramatically pointless than usual. -- This book is not a self-consciously designed `` easy read '' written in words and phrases suitable for the comprehension of fourth graders . This author occasionally dares to quote people who lived four hundred years ago in their own words , styles and spellings . Consider this passage : `` I am persuaded his Royall mynde reioyceth more with good hope , wch he hathe for happy successe of that worke [ the new Bible ] , then of his peace concluded with Spayne . '' [ Page 65-66 of the hardcover edition ] If that taxes your reading skills to the breaking point , seek enlightenment elsewhere.This book does provide an overview -- or perhaps more accurately , a sketch of religion and politics in 17th century England . In many ways , the two words were alternate terms for the same phenomenon , much as they are in Baghdad today . ( A single generation after this translation of the Bible was made , the intertwining of religion and politics would become almost as deadly as it is in Baghdad today . ) The book offers thumbnail biographies -- and in a few cases , somewhat more than that -- of the fifty or so grave and learned scholars tasked with preparing the translation . In so far as the records survive , it outlines their organization and their contributions -- for even in those long-ago days there were bosses and drudges.Finally , the book deals with the majestic 17th century translation of the Bible as a literary entity . Here , at last , Adam Nicolson becomes an advocate . While acknowledging that scholarship and learning have made advances in the three centuries since the translation was made , he argues forcefully that no English translation made before or since has matched the King James Version in effectiveness , directness , power and sublimity.Nicolson is such an advocate of the grand style of the KJV that it affects his own writing style . He does not emulate the actual style of the Bible -- a thing , he makes clear , that was deliberately chosen and already noticeably archaic in the early 17th century , but he is much more orotund than is common in our piping times . He models his prose more on Gibbon or Macaulay than , say , Hemingway.Consider the author 's handling of a meeting at Hampton Court that involved the newly crowned King James , some gorgeously bedecked senior bishops of the Church of England and four black-clad Puritan ministers . All were assembled to bring sweet harmony to the land under a King who liked to think of himself as a peacemaker -- and who sometimes was . That , of course , turned out to be a flat failure , but one of the Puritans , John Reynolds , almost casually remarked that the ministers he represented would like to have `` one only translation of ye Bible to be authenticall and read in ye churche . '' Richard Bancroft , the Bishop of London ( who a few years earlier had taken up a pike among his own armed guards to repulse the Earl of Essex 's ragtag rebellion and who would soon become Archbishop of Canterbury ) sneered at that , saying `` If every man 's humour might be followed , there would be no end of translating . `` To everyone 's surprise , the King commanded that a translation be made . In Adam Nicolson 's long-breathed , parentheses-strewn , semi-colon-laden words , it was a `` translation that was to be uniform ( in other words with no contentious Geneva-style interpretations set alongside or within the text ) ; with the learned authority of Oxford and Cambridge ( which , at least in their upper echelons , were profoundly conservative institutions ... ) ; to be revised by the bishops ( the very influence that Reynolds did not want ) ; then given , for goodness ' sake , to the Privy Council , in effect a central censorship committee with which the government would see that its stamp was on the text , no deviation or subversion allowed ; and finally to James himself , whose hostility to any whiff of radicalism ... had been clear enough . And this ferociously episcopal and monarchist Bible was to be the only translation to be read in church : ` no other ' . '' [ Page 60 . ] It must be pointed out , however , that Nicolson 's prose does not always march to the solemn beat of the kettledrums ( `` for goodness ' sake '' ) , but sometimes dances to a merrier piper : `` For these Puritans , and in a way we can scarcely understand now , the words of the scriptures were thought to provide a direct , almost intravenous access to the divine . '' [ Page 135 ] This is a good , middleweight book that , so far as I can tell , does not push unduly beyond the bounds of the scanty evidence . It can be justly criticized for being as much a series of raconteurial anecdotes as a logically-structured book . Its underlying preference for style over content is , at the very least , open for debate.Four stars -- but well worth reading in any case.A MINOR OBSERVATION : Adam Nicolson is obviously an Englishman , but my American edition from HarperCollins consistently uses the typically North American term , `` King James Version , '' rather than the English `` Authorised Version . '' I therefore suspect that other Americanisms may also have been edited into the English text .	1
Too bad five stars is the highest rating available , because this book deserves more . Warm , witty , and wise , this is a story that resonated with me , perhaps because I 'm half Italian , but mostly because Gaffney is such a terrific writer . This book made me cry , especially during the touching love scene between Theo and Rose . And contrary to what the Amazon reviewer thought , I loved the developing relationship between Anna and Mason . It was nice to see a prickly , very human woman portrayed so realistically , with every single one of her warts showing . Of course , their fledgling romance did n't have the same depth and richness as Theo and Rose 's . How could it ? They were just beginning to know one another . Trust and the deep kind of forever love we all want will ( one hopes ) come later , whereas Theo and Rose have all that history and are nearing the end of their time together . I highly recommend this book and want to thank the author for a wonderful reading experience . I 'm looking forward to many more Gaffney books .	1
On a fluke I picked up this audiobook at the library when they were out of Stephanie Plum novels and anything else that looked interesting . Normally , I do n't go for `` black '' novels , because they have a tendency to embody the `` authentic '' black experience that smacks back to a misogyny or masculate black women - people that I ca n't live up to and have no desire to imitate . This book is hilarious , moving , and just feels honest . Highly recommended . I ca n't wait to start reading other books in the series .	1
As someone who is passionate about the 18th century France , I purchased Mr. Dolan 's book with great excitement and many anticipations . I am happy to say , it was a purchase well made . Ladies of the Grand Tour is an interesting look into the minds and hearts of European Women living during a tulmultuous times . Mr. Dolan deftly weaves contrasting views on society ( ex : Burke and Wollstonecraft sound off opposing opinions about my idol , Marie Antoinette ) making for a well-balanced read.Though I have never been a huge fan of the unctuous Wollstonecraft , I found her quotes in this book illuminating and thought-provoking.Christopher Hibbert published a wonderful book titled THE GRAND TOUR which reads like an 18th Century Tour Book of several of the finest cities in Europe . As fantastic as that book is , it does not deliver the human drama , the emotions of the female travelers , that Dolan 's masterpiece offers.Bravo ! Leah Marie Brown , Author of Willing Captive	1

Jeffrey archer never writes a story that is not a cliff hanger.Consequently , you MUST read all of his books .	1
When I realized that I 'd picked up a bunch of short stories instead of the novel I was looking forward too , I was vaguely disappointed , UNTIL I read the first short story . I knew then that I was in for a treat . Each story IS short , BUT very entertaining , interesting and worthy . I 'd not hesitate to recommend this series of short stories , even to those who , like me , would prefer one of Archer 's excellent novels ...	1
Jeffrey Archer is at his best when he writes short stories . I am not usually a lover of this format but I love the way almost all his stories have a sting in the tail . My only complaint is that I finished the book too quickly . The style is so easy and each story just pulls you on the next . Did not like all the stories , but most , especially & quot ; Crime Pays & quot ; and & quot ; The grass is always greener & quot ; were brilliant . His use of language is exciting . Hope he puts out another book of short stories soon .	1
Usually , books by Jeffrey Archer are hard to set down . The short stories make it much easier although I still had trouble putting the book down between stories . More good Archer reading .	1
I wish I could have delivered Serge 's commencement speech . A lively romp through a Florida grid neighborhood , complete with the reef-like night life . Stun the consultants and the car dealers - do n't taste me bro , test drive the Ferrari , and keep track of Ambrose . I think I missed what happened to Sharon . She will probably show up again . Another enjoyable Serge Storm .	1
Triggerfish Twist is the 4th novel in Tim Dorsey 's Serge Storms comedy/crime series . This series is an absolute blast , amazingly fun to read , and even a little bit educational . It is crazy Florida satire of the most outrageous order , and should not be missed . Rarely do I laugh out loud at books , but with Triggerfish Twist it seemed to happen nearly every few pages.Jim Davenport is transferred for work and he and his nice Midwestern family move to Triggerfish Lane in Tampa Florida . Immediately after settling in they begin to meet their eccentric neighbors , including stoner college students , members of the witness protection program , and Serge Storms , Sharon Rhodes and the ever-wasted Coleman . Lance Boyle is trying to buy up all the homes on the street , and to drive out the other homeowners he actively seeks the most rock-bottom lowlifes possible to fill his rental properties . The Davenports slowly come to realize that they are living in a hotbed of criminal activity , but they do n't take it lying down . Although wary , they end up befriending Serge and Coleman , who help them deal with a giant cast of unruly malcontents . Serial killer Serge Storms , of course , is the star , but he does have principles - he never murders anyone who does n't really deserve it.One of the funniest scenes in the book comes when Jim joins the neighborhood watch . They almost immediately get robbed and lost on `` Crack Street , '' only to be found by Coleman cruising on an adult tricycle and led through the underbelly of the Tampa night . Coleman and Serge later go on one of Coleman 's infamous `` Night Tours '' with hysterical results . Somehow Author Tim Dorsey manages to throw in a death ray that threatens to vaporize bank employees at their desks , an insanely disreputable used car dealer , the elderly `` E Team '' slowly sinking in a drainage pond just off an interstate exit ramp , a fake millionaire , American Presidents playing Twister without pants , and Serge somehow delivering a college commencement address.I am reading the Tim Dorsey novels in order , and Triggerfish Twist is probably my favorite so far . Dorsey is getting better at managing his zany characters as they wreak havoc all over the state of Florida . I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next one in the series , The Stingray Shuffle .	1
It has to be difficult to write a LIKEABLE homicidal maniac . But that 's just what Tim Dorsey has manged to do in Florida Roadkill , Hammerhead Ranch Motel , Orange Crush , and now Triggerfish Twist.This time Serge is back together with old pals Coleman and Sharon the summer before their wacky adventures in Florida Roadkill . We are treated to a little more of the lighter side of Serge as he passes the summer playing house in a typical Tampa neighborhood.Of course , if Serge , Coleman and Sharon are around , then you know things will be anything but typical as plotlines swirl wildly around the neighborhood until crashing together at Jim Davenport 's Fourth of July party.If you enjoyed any of the previous three books by Dorsey , this one should be no exception .	1
If you want to become a better all-round baker , get this book . It is packed with education , instruction , advice , and expertise of 13 top bakers . Yet , it unpretentious and very practical . Let me be honest , I simply could not make an edible pie crust until I got this book ... shingles and tile I could make but not a crust . No longer is this the case . It is compiled well and clearly communicates its baking principles .	1
Stella Pope Duarte 's is an excellent novel about the long-lasting effects of the Vietnam war on an Arizona family and how they finally come to face some of the devastation . The novel is narrated by Teresa , whose older brother Jesse , was killed in 1968 .

The trip and the events leading up to it are difficult , bringing up painful memories of Jesse and their own lives before and after his death . The trip and what they find when they get there will change their lives completely . Let Their Spririts Dance is a satisfying , moving read .	1
As a fan of horror movies and overall 'eerie-ness ' I thoroughly enjoyed Heim 's second novel ( after the also recommended MYSTERIOUS SKIN ) . IN AWE is certainly one of the most original , poetic , amd menacing gay novels outside of Dennis Cooper 's work in recent memory . It 's a moody and atmospheric horror movie with deep literary significance ( Imagine a Gen-X Faulkner on acid writing a horror novel - and toss in equal parts Shirley Jackson , Dennis Cooper , and David Lynch ) . This meticulously crafted novel follows a season in the STRANGE lives of 3 Lawrence Kansas misfits . The completely absorbing and slightly surreal plot defies succinct description but includes mutilated mannequins , a vile of urine , and numerous other surprises . Suffice it to saw IN AWE is one hell of a ride . Demented , evocative , descriptive , deeply profound , and not recommended for the squeamish ... big ole GORE ALERT ... and I 'm not talking former VP Al or his wife Tipper . The characters were a bit tough for me to get a handle on ... but the strongest presence in this novel is that overall menacing mood and that holds it all together .	1
I found this book fascinating . It 's a great story set against an anthropological backdrop I did n't know existed.The only reason I did n't give it five stars is because there were a couple of characters that I kept getting mixed up , and the prose sometimes got so deep I felt like I had been separated from the story.I ca n't even describe it ... just a rich , rich story .	1
I have not read this book yet , but love the ease of the Kindle and receiving books this way . Thanks	1
I was quite happy with this recipe book . The recipes are simple enough to seem do-able but complex enough to offer flavors that are not available in the supermarket .	1
One of the better ice cream maker books I have read , ca n't wait to try some of the recipes . Gives alot of ideas I would have never though of .	1
At least one seminary requires those in spiritual formation to read this biography of Pope John Paul II . I rank the book just below the Bible and the Catechism of the Catholic Church in my list of books that are important to read . I can usually summarize a book in a page or two , but not this one . The book offers so much that I filled thirteen pages with terse notes written in paragraph form.The first 250 pages of the book inspire the reader , who realizes the great hardships the Pope endured from his early life through his priesthood under Nazi and Communist rule . His work with the Church 's intellectuals and performing artists developed the cultural base that succeeded in combating these totalitarian regimes . His discussion groups tolerated all ideas , provided that all were striving for truth . His development of a new Christian Humanism was , and still is , effective in combating social and spiritual ills everywhere.The remaining 600 pages show how the Pope dealt with specific problems in the Church and in the world . He approaches all as a sincerely holy , humble , and reverent pilgrim , full of hope for humanity . He apologizes for the failures of Catholics . He invites those who oppose him to join him in dialog , yet he never compromises Church principles . The book covers each such case , including each encyclical , with sufficient detail that the reader learns from the Pope throughout the book.Because I have read probably every encyclical and many of the apostolic letters written by the Pope , much was familiar to me -- after the book jarred my memory . The most important new point that I learned from the book pertained to a question I have asked many a philosopher : Can every philosophy describe all of the truths of the Catholic faith ? The Pope answered that some philosophies are so poor or so closed as to make any real dialog impossible .	1
An eye-opening biography of the life of Pope John Paul II -- it is a tapestry of the life of Pope John Paul II that weaves the 'threads of his life on the cloth of the world stage ' . It progresses from his childhood and youth in totalitarian and Nazi controlled Poland , to his rise through the ranks of the Church through his role in resolving many world conflicts , including his historical involvement in the 'demise of Communism ' . Weigel weaves his story with JP II 's encyclicals and other writings to portray the character and mission of JP II papacy -- his belief in the truth of God and Jesus Christ ( providence ) as guiding the world and providing us hope , even in spite of all of the horrors of the 20th century . He also portrays the deep intellect of JP II as well as his basic , intuitive understanding of the human person.This is an important look at his life and influence on the 20th century , not only for Catholics and Christians but on the world as a whole .	1
Very interesting read from an insiders perspective ! Watched several shows on this duo and truly enjoyed the book from the Son/Brother 's view .	1
People always say it , but you 'll never know it until you read it . This truly is the best novel ever written .	1
One thing about Don Quixote , it 's possible to have any number of different readings of it . One that seems to get a lot of play is Don Quixote as a passionate idealist who pursues his dreams no matter how crazy they seem ; and I suppose it is possible to read the book this way . But my view is that Don Quixote is stark raving mad and delusional from filling his head with the nonsense of chivalric romances , and that this is Cervantes ' acid way of skewering that literary tradition . The first part of the book consists of Quixote 's misadventures , his encounters as he tries to superimpose his lunatic hallucinations on the real world , always with bad results . Cervantes is pretty harsh with Quixote , who receives any number of severe beatings from persons with whom he has interfered in the course of his `` gallant '' deeds . But it 's actually a lot like slapstick because no matter how grave his injuries , Quixote always snaps back in the next chapter , ready for another round.While this satire is entertaining , it 's in Part II that the book really gets interesting . Something like 10 years passed between the writing of Part I and Part II , and Cervantes ' approach changed significantly . Quixote has much wisdom to impart to those he meets , and even Sancho becomes an occasional wise man . And Quixote seems to inadvertantly solve more problems than he creates . The bond between Quixote and Sancho is more fully developed in Part II as well . But for me the most interesting thing is that , by Part II , everyone Quixote meets already knows who he is because they 've read the book of his adventures that had come out -- essentially , everyone in Part II has read Part I . On top of that , during the intervening 10 years another author came out with a `` Don Quixote '' -- referred to as the `` False Quixote '' -- and Cervantes spends time lambasting that book through insulting comments made by his characters in Part II . He even has characters from the False Quixote make appearances in his book to swear that nothing in the False Quixote was true . On top of this , Cervantes ' narrator is actually someone translating the tale of Quixote as written by a Moorish historian . So there are multiple levels of literary `` reality '' going . Added to this is the fact that Quixote 's misadventures in Part II come , not from him inflicting himself on unwitting passersby , but from persons knowingly toying with him because they know he 's insane because they 'd read Part I . It seems very cruel , but then the reader might pause and note that that 's what Cervantes was himself doing with Quixote in Part I , with us going along for the ride . There are multiple layers of literary `` reality '' going on in Part II , and it gets to be like a hall of mirrors where you do n't know which image to believe as being `` real '' .The book can be slow going at times , especially when Cervantes has characters throw in gratuitous , long-winded stories that seemingly have no bearing on the overall narrative . And Quixote does n't speak dialogue , he speaks long , grandiloquent speeches . So it can be trying at times to get through the book ; but the rough humor of Part I and the clever multi-layer writing of Part II are enough to make it worthwhile.I do n't know Spanish so I ca n't vouch for any particular translation , but the Edith Grossman version seemed fine . From what I can tell it 's more formal than the Burton Raffel translation , which I think is a good thing . I ca n't imagine Quixote 's overblown speeches being delivered in casual , colloquial vocabulary .	1
I love the story but have never been able to finish the book . I listened to this on a road trip to California and found it very enjoyable . They did cut a major section , but I guess that is what you contend with in an abridged version .	1
Don Quixote ( abridged ) is a great piece of Spanish literature . It is chok full of comical escapades and satire . It is not a book that will not leave you holding on , trying to survive through the boring parts . It starts out , with a hook , and draws you deeper and deeper into the undefined plot . I defiantly enjoyed it , and laughed at the many stupid predicaments the knight fell into . It is a definite must read in my book !	1
Don Quixote is one of those books that is better listened to than read . It is a great book and it is about many things but at its heart , Don Quixote is a comedy of manners . Narrating a comedy is the most difficult of all jobs for the professional actor . It requires great comedic timing and subtly to pull it off . George Guidall is a mature actor who has narrated countless books . He has that special gift that seperates the best actors from the rest of us . This afternoon , I reached the 35th and final CD and I did not want it to end . It was a really long journey and I felt very fortunate that I had George Guidall as my guide . The highest recommendation .	1
As this story is 400 years old , I expect this book to be dry and dull and written in difficult to understand language . I could not have been more wrong in my life ! This story is totally engrossing and , more than once , will cause the reader to laugh out loud.This is known as the world 's first novel , and while reading it it was difficult to keep in mind that Cervantes did not have a blueprint to follow . Everytime I opened this book to read more , I felt like Cervantes was sitting there , spinning this tale for me . I 've never been a fan of stories of knights and adventure stories , but this book kept me fully interested . I could n't wait to finish it ! What is truly wonderful is this is a story for all ages : young , old , and everyone in between . The size of the book may intimidate some at 1,000 pages , but do n't let that happen . When a reader becomes involved with Don Quioxte and Sancho Panza and all the characters they encounter , the reader simply does n't want the story to come to an end.In all fairness , this book was written in 2 parts . Once writing the 1st part , and seeing its popularity , Cervantes wrote part 2 just before he died . I have to admit that the 1st part is more compelling that the 2nd part , but not by a whole lot . There are adventures brought up in part 2 that one can only guess at in part 1 . If one can only read some of this novel , then read part 1 . But really , do yourself a favor and read the whole book . I doubt anyone would be disappointed.I seldom re-read books , but this is one I plan on re-reading in the future . Thoroughly enjoyable !	1
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra 's `` Don Quixote '' is widely acknowledged to be the first novel . This complete , unabridged edition was translated by Walter Starkie and first or not , the account of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance is without question a singularly sophisticated , complex and entertaining literary accomplishment.There is much debate about the relative merit of the many published translations of `` Don Quixote . '' I downloaded a second translation on my iPod Touch so that I 'd have access to the 1,000-plus page tome anytime , and I find that both translations convey the magic of the Don 's world , albeit with subtle and occasional differences in words and phrases.In any case the richness , humor , adventure , drama and romance of `` Don Quixote '' are masterfully interweaved by Cervantes into a dense world of prose , poetry , sonnets and song that is perfect for anyone who is a lover of words and happens to any degree to be a romantic . `` Don Quixote '' is an astonishing , delightful journey , to be missed only at one 's own cultural and entertainment peril .	1
I spent a good deal of time studying various modern translations of DQ - among them the works of Grossman ( too 'popularized ' ) , Montgomery ( dry , verbose ) , Smollet-Slade ( excellent notes and revisions by Slade but the 18th English tone remains - it 's not Cervantes and it 's not modern either - unsatisfactory ) and Rutherford ( I should try Lathrop as well ... ) and I 've found Rutherford 's to be the most readable , lively and engaging - he explains his approach in his translator 's introduction and I think he accomplished his goal . It 's a pleasure to read - the prose is smooth , concise and clear , Rutherford has a sharp wit which he has put to good use in this translation , and he is also very scholarly as well as steeped in Spanish culture.There are two drawbacks to this edition , but I say go for it nonetheless:1 ) Being British , Rutherford uses many contemporary British expressions what may not be very accessible to an American - and this is important since DQ is highly nuanced and Rutherford has worked had to convey those nuances into English.2 ) There should be more notes - explanatory notes , not just references and citings , and they should be on the page itself as footnotes , not in the back of the book . The Smollet-Slade BN edition is far superior in this respect - if I had time I 'd read them both at once , chapter by chapter , first Smollet/Slade and then Rutherford .	1
I 've read everything published that Valerie W. Wesley has written and I truly enjoy her imagination and the way she portrays her fantasies through her pen . All of the other reviews adequately describe the storyline which , I agree , is not drama filled . The story itself was just plain , simple and quite enjoyable . As usual , I started on a Saturday morning and was done by Monday morning . Very quick and light . The most important lessons of what love is really about are the areas the author has chosen to explore in this novel , as well as how our relationship with our parents determine what type of parents we will become . Quite interesting ! ! ! If you 're on vacation and looking for a nice pleasant short story , you 've got to read this .	1
Her writings are so vivid that one is able to feel the dough in your hands , and smell the freshness of the items that she has baked . Can relate to the area as well , I love the Seattle area . Also purchased her `` Bakers Apprentice '' to follow along with her . Hope she does more on this group of characters . Karen	1
I 'm glad this little book found me , as I was hungry to read something of quality.Wynter Morrison is a woman adrift . She 's been cut loose from her secure mooring by a wayward husband ( a jerk of the first water ) and she 's unsure what comes next . Forced from her home in an upscale LA neighborhood , Wynter finds herself on a plane to Seattle to visit her childhood friend , CM.On her trip , Wynter discovers a small neighborhood bakery complete with an odd cast of characters . When the bottom drops out from her LA world , she relocates to Seattle and starts to work at the bakery . The routine of bread making in the middle of the night soothes her and gives her direction.It 's been a long time since I 've read such a well crafted first novel . I loved the characters ... flaws and all ... and I loved Hendricks ' detailed description of the process of bread making ... This is an author to watch ... Enjoy !	1
In the consulting field , one can get away with corporate casual in most venues . Corporate casual for me is basically slacks , shirt , sport coat , no tie . However , there are times one must go completely dressed and in these instances , books like DRESSING THE MAN are outstanding to teach those of us who are style challenged the art of matching threads . ( I recently read and reviewed CASUAL POWER by Sherry Maysonave . For those in the corporate casual line as I described , this is an outstanding book . ) My biggest downfall is the total lack of sense in putting outfits together . OK , if I have a suit , no problem . But , how about patterned slacks ... what shirt ? What jacket ? Socks ? You get the idea . DRESSING THE MAN solves most of the mysteries and , quite frankly , opened my eyes as well . It seems as though symmetry is not necessarily a mandate as long as the style has precendent . Patterned slacks and patterned socks for instance . Many of our '40s and '50s movie stars were into this scene . Were they ridiculed ? Nope , just copied.Many of the corporate stalwarts of old have moved to a more casual theme in recent years , creating the move toward comfort over dominion . Could the stodgiest be modifying , changing with the times ? By contrast , how many suits do you think were even owned by the Silicon Valley tech generation of the '80s and '90s ? Now , that has changed and the tech crowd , many out of work , are looking for new work ... and buying suits for their interviews to ensure they are being taken seriously . Most of these style barbarians had no clue as to the style , coordination or even expectations of dress . Alan Flusser to the rescue . In '85 , Flusser wrote the critically acclaimed , CLOTHES AND THE MAN , which could be called the predecessor to DRESSING THE MAN . With this offering , no man should have an excuse for being a style freak.DRESSING THE MAN is chock-full of illustrations , pictures , and suggestions . You 'll see vintage photos of Gary Cooper , Errol Flynn , Cary Grant , Fred Astaire and many more . Most of these pics look like they jumped right off the pages of GQ . Flusser offers a variety of suggestions relating to choosing suits , shirts and ties and takes it as far as coordinating your outfits with skin tone , hair color , and body type . Shoes , socks , wristwatches , and even hats are covered.If you 're interested in reading a book on men 's dress and learning the styles , DRESSING THE MAN fits the bill quite nicely . If you are interested in reading a book on men 's styles AND you want to read it in bed or perhaps on a plane ride , this is not your book . At a full 8.5 x 11 inches , 320 pages and at least 5 pounds , this is not a book to lug around.Highly recommended .	1
Edell challenges his readers to think by providing mountains of medical research ( in easily digestible form ) . His genuinely folksy charm pokes at our preconceptions . He offers alternatives and , without preaching , tells us why he belives that the media and the self-help gurus are driving us mad by inevitably trying to sell their own products whilst scaring and belittling us into cycles of depression , another fad , another depression.Here 's what the book recommends : Go out and mow the lawn ( burns 486 calories ) ; dance with partner ( burns 288 ) ; garden ( burns 587 ) . Oh , and sex ! Engage in it often , do what pleases you and your partner . Sex cures headache , raises cardio functioning , relaxes , induces feelings of well-being , and is a drug-free soporific . In short , do what you like , stay active and most of all , enjoy it.One painfully kind chapter covers a group & quot ; unacceptable & quot ; fat women who must sneak off to swim when the pool 's closed to regulars . ( Apparently , they offend & quot ; regular & quot ; people . ) This wonderful hour with the & quot ; chubs & quot ; sums up Edell 's warmth and decency . It also lightens all our burdens by allowing us to enjoy this group 's simple pleasure . They 're sweet and fun ; we see another option.Here 's Edell 's essential truth on staying fit : & quot ; The relative risk occurs between the lowest level of fitness and the next lowest level of fitness. & quot ; Thus , anything beyond moving from a sedentary , really bad diet to moderate exercise and a decent diet is somewhat frivolous -- unles you take great pleaure in hours at the gym and drinking celery shakes . Being neither pushy nor dogmatic , Edell gives many examples -- backing up their veracity with medical data gleaned from credible , longitudinal studies.The point here is that we 've been struggling , emotionally and physically , to live up to various , ever-changing standards . We force ourselves into regimens that hurt , and ultimately , we fail . To Edell then , do n't do it . You 'll pay too heavy a psychological price.Of course I recommend this book . Edell is still fighting for us . One hopes that we as a nation fight back against the neuroses-makers . That said , it 's very tough giving it a five-star rating -- those are precious and to be rarely given . But , this a fine book for its genre , so five stars it is .	1
Reads in many places like an adolescent 's third-period efforts . Much of it is sentimental , obvious , trite , overly narrative , and unschooled . Too many people think that poetry is purely subjective , and Jewel here falls into that trap . ( Also , she has gotten the idea that a lot of high schoolers have about weird line breaks being the defining factor of a poem.. sigh . ) But there 's a lot of genius here , too . With some nuts and bolts techniques under her belt , and some more years behind her , this young lady may become a force to be reckoned with . Her command of imagery is primal ( such as one poem 's longing for a man & quot ; with wild things in his hair & quot ; ) and her choices of analogies and metaphors is , simply , terrific . I can easily put up with the high-school level stuff to get to the good stuff . In her foreward , she admits that she 'd never have been published had she not been a megastar singer , which is , sadly , true ; she also says that she included the fluff poems deliberately , the wisdom of which I question . I am hoping very much that we see more out of Jewel , and this time , I hope she takes it a bit more seriously and includes only quality works.Poetry buffs should not avoid this work just because it is written by the famous rock star Jewel .	1
[ Spoilers ] This book will make you very angry ; that a child could be so maltreated by an `` expert , '' who clearly was in need of help himself , but who was so intent on proving a theory that he disregarded substantial evidence to the contrary . You 'll be angry , too , with other professionals who were reluctant to challenge the `` great '' man even when their own evidence pointed in an opposite direction . But you 'll be astonished and satisfied by the incredible fortitude of a young child who realized that something was wrong and in his own way stood up to the extraordinary pressure that was put on him.David Reimer was the victim of numerous mistakes . The first was a botched circumcision that essentially fried his penis . Then he became subject to the attempts of a famous sex researcher to verify his theories about the nature of gender development . The result was a lot of pain for David and his family.Colapinto got permission from the family to write this book , and all conversations , everything in quotes , is from transcripts or documents . All the scarier.It all began when David ( then called Bruce ) and his identical twin brother Brian were diagnosed with a condition called phimosis that circumcision normally repaired . Bruce was operated on first , but a serious mistake in the voltage levels of the electrical surgical device was made and his genitalia burned beyond salvage . The medical staff suggested that Bruce be raised as a girl . This was at a time when feminist theory , supported by some psychologists , proposed that gender identity had nothing to do with biology : it was all a social construct . Eventually , the parents were referred to Dr. Money at Johns Hopkins University . Money was a world-renowned sex researcher who apparently suffered from a multitude of sex hang-ups himself . Money had staked his reputation on the belief that sexual identity was socially determined , and he had worked with numerous transsexuals . When Bruce 's parents showed up with an identical twin who had no male genitalia , it was an obvious answer to his prayers , for now he could develop data from a twin study to validate Money 's theories . Money and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins had performed numerous sex reassignment surgeries on hermaphrodite children , but no such operation had ever been attempted on a child born with normal genitalia and nervous system , a distinction that the parents , Ron and Janet , never grasped until years later . Money 's conviction was the procedure would be successful ; `` I see no reason why it should n't work , '' he told them . The decision had to be made early , because , according to his theory , there was a gender identity gate at which point the child was locked into a male or female identity . Bruce became Brenda and was raised as a girl . There were problems from the start , but Money insisted he was right and continued to promote the case as an example of the correctness of his theory of psycho sexual neutrality at birth.In the meantime , at the University of Kansas , a young researcher was studying the role of hormones on behavior , and in a paper published in the late fifties , he marshaled considerable evidence from biology , psychology , psychiatry , anthropology , and endocrinology to argue that gender identity is hardwired into the brain virtually from conception . Hermaphrodites had an inborn neurological capability to go both ways , a capability that genetically normal children would not share.The researcher , Milton Diamond , was to become a thorn in Money 's side as he marshaled considerable evidence of the role of prenatal hormones in determining gender identity . Money 's accusation that Diamond 's alliance with unscrupulous media caused the cessation of what would have been the culmination and piece de resistance of his life 's work , the twin study , finally pushed Diamond to a public response in the form of a paper . Money 's work was still being used to support the behaviorist proponents in the psychological community , who were still trying to `` convert '' and `` change '' adult homosexuals back to a heterosexual orientation . In the meantime , Money had been uncharacteristically silent what was occurring with the twins . Diamond managed to track down the psychiatrist , Keith Sigmundson , who had been working with Brenda/David in the intervening years . Having seen firsthand the implementation of Money 's theories , Sigmundson , after reading Diamond 's papers and convincing himself of Diamond 's research integrity , agreed that something needed to be documented publicly as to the outcome of the case.By this time , Brenda had become David , reverting to male , and had married . His parents , after years of therapy for the whole family , had finally broken with Money , and told Brenda of the genital removal . David had married and wanted to put everything behind him , but finally agreed to meet with Diamond . Realizing after their conversations that his case was being used as evidence to support the implementation of Money 's theories in other cases , he decided he had to speak out . The resulting paper warned physicians of the dangers of surgical sexual reassignment , especially for intersexual newborns , since `` physicians have no way of predicting in which direction the infant 's gender identity has differentiated . '' Assigning a sex , i.e . name , hair length , and clothing , was one thing , but irreversible surgical intervention had to be avoided until the child was old enough to determine and articulate . `` To rear the child in a consistent gender , but keep away the knife , '' was the caveat expressed by as Diamond to Colapinto.One of the more interesting side issues I think the book raises is the nature of authority , i.e . what constitutes being an expert . Certainly , being right , correct , and knowledgeable appears not to be criteria .	1
I read this book in its entirety in one night , something I have rarely done before . I felt compelled to turn the next page , to find out the outer boundaries of the horror that Brenda/David suffered -- just how much worse could it get ? Before one finds out , though , one must work through the first third of the book , which consists of a discussion of the psychology and science behind the decision to reassign gender . This part of the book was fascinating , but I found that its length and depth was not entirely necessary for an understanding of David 's situation , and was anxious to get to the rest of the story . The author did make a successful effort to present the science and controversy over Brenda/David 's doctor 's ( Dr. Money ) widely-accepted and also less conventional views in an objective manner , and I appreciate this.The second part of the book focuses on the specifics of Brenda 's condition and her life until her decision to revert to her original gender and become David . This is the most gripping part of the book . The author 's sensitive treatment of the travails that Brenda suffered made me feel as if I was traveling along with her on her collision course with her true gender identity . The author avoids sentimentality , but treats the subject sensitively . He does not rail unduly against the doctors who changed the course of Brenda 's life , but instead acts as a detached narrator laying before the reader the facts.The third part of the book is a look at the issue of the transformation and reassignment of intersexed children in general , and a view of the advocacy now being taken up on their behalf . Mostly silenced by shame and fear , former intersexed children have begun to join forces and argue for a change in the medical protocols established primarily by Brenda/David 's doctors at Johns Hopkins , especially Dr. Money , and widely adopted by the medical establishment , which call for surgical sexual reassignment of intersexed children . This part of the book gives the author the forum to voice what is probably his own view towards these practices , without unduly intruding as an outsider and journalist . Instead , he prefers to speak through the voices of the victims of such practices and implies his skepticism gently and unobtrusively.It is obvious that the author did a thorough and excellent job in reasearching his topic . He does not hammer the reader with sermons or preaching , but rather relies on as much fact-based logic and the irrefutable emotional damage that David suffered at the hands of his tormenters . I respect this author 's work , and above all appreciate the strength and character of David . I highly recommend this book .	1
An accident , an arrogant doctor , and an exploration of how we all have more to our gender than just our genitals . The book weaves a chilling and tragic tale that fortunately ends with a couragous choice by a real person . Before I read this book , I was not convinced that the difference between boys and girls was too much more than socialization and societal role models . Now , I am convinced of just the opposite . It may be easy to mock the premise , but it does n't take more than half a dozen pages to discover the human tale told herein . I could not put this book down . It is well-written , well-reasoned , and very , very moving .	1
I 'd known of this book for years after seeing David Reimer 's appearance on Oprah over a decade ago . But I must say this book gave a lot more amazing insight into the Reimer family 's struggles , as well as the horrendous practices of Dr. John Money.This is the harrowing story of a boy who lost his penis in an accident and was raised as a girl under the direction of psychologist Dr. John Money -- who believed children were a blank slate until age two in terms of gender . However , David ( or `` Brenda '' as he was called as a child ) always knew he was different , and his inherent masculinity was unavoidable to everyone he knew . Luckily , as a teenager his parents told him the truth about his birth and allowed him to live as male again . Despite all the evidence David never adjusted to he reassigned gender , Dr. Money not only continued to advise his parents to raise him as female , but went around the world giving speeches and writing papers touting the success of this case.David himself shows amazing personal strength . His case also proves that gender is often inborn , and the most important gender organ is in fact the brain . The terrifying thing about this story is how Dr. Money 's manipulative , abusive and perverse practices destroyed not only the Reimer family , but countless others . The fact that David 's `` successful '' sex reassignment became the norm/recommended practice for intersexed children and boys with injured genitals for decades is nothing short of terrifying . This book really makes it clear we ca n't just trust `` experts '' and that changing who a person is without consulting them is a dangerous idea .	1
` Vegetables Every Day ' is by Jack Bishop , a very intelligent craftsman of cookbooks similar to James Peterson , Molly Katzen , Rose Levy Beranbaum , and Pam Anderson . Each is skillful at creating very useful reference books on various aspects of cooking . And , it should be no surprise that both Bishop and Pam Anderson are current or past senior staffers at ` Cooks Illustrated ' magazine.It is a great treat to have two of these skillful authors both do excellent books on vegetables , and to have the two books done from two so different points of view that one will feel no pangs of waste by owning both . Bishop 's book is certainly the more accessible of the two , as the material is presented in a very straightforwardly encyclopedic presentation . There are uniform articles on 66 different vegetables , a veritable celebration of the variety of vegetables available through part or all of the year round . Among these 66 , there are the old favorites such as broccoli , carrots , celery , mushrooms , potatoes , tomatoes , and onions . Alongside these there are new favorites brought to our attention by hours of watching Mario Batali , Bobby Flay , and Jaime Oliver such as Artichokes , Broccoli Rabe , Cardoons , Celery Root , Dandelion Greens , Fava Beans , Fennel , Soybeans , Turnips , and Zucchini . At the far end of familiarity are Boniato , Burdock , Calabaza , Chayote , Jerusalem Artichokes , Kohlrabi , Malanga , Sorrel , Taro , and Yuca . These are the veggies which should be approached with one of my favorite Alton Brown ` Good Eats ' moments when he recommends that you walk into your megamart with fresh eyes on the lookout for unfamiliar products and investigate what can be done with these little gems.Bishop is not only intent on providing things to do with newly available produce , he is intent on making cooking all vegetables , especially the old standards with a new set of recipes to make them more interesting and to make cooking them more fun . One excellent case in point is asparagus that everyone either boils or steams and dresses with some creamy sauce . Since everyone already knows how to do this , Bishop does n't bother to give recipes for these . Rather , his nine asparagus recipes include three roasting methods , a grilling recipe , two sautee recipes , a recipe with Chinese noodles , a recipe with a vinaigrette , and an asparagus frittata.Every article , regardless of how many recipes may be given , has the same seven ( 7 ) paragraphs in the introductory article . The first paragraph simply introduces you to the vegetable and gives you a general idea of the appeal and usability of the vegetable . The next paragraph on availability gives the best season for the produce and whether or not the vegetable is currently available year round in American markets . The third paragraph on selection gives us criteria for whether we want to pick up today 's selection of a species or let it alone . The paragraph on storage is especially useful , as there is probably very little wisdom handed down from your Eastern European grandma on storing tomatillos , taro , or jicama or from your Mexican mom on dealing with arugula , bok choy , or burdock . The basic preparation paragraph can be simple for leafy greens or very complicated for artichokes . The very short section on best cooking methods is primarily useful for totally unfamiliar vegetables . A very useful last entry gives recipes on other vegetables in which the titular ingredient appears.One may not think there is anything controversial about vegetables , but you may be surprised , especially if you read Bishop 's and Peterson 's books side by side . On the matter of asparagus , Bishop prefers thin to medium thickness stalks and prefers not to peel them . Peterson prefers medium to thick stalks and strongly recommends peeling the stalks . To a certain extent , this is a matter of personal preference , but much of this difference comes from the fact that Peterson is a former restaurant chef / owner while there is no record in Bishop 's biographical information that he ever worked in a restaurant kitchen . If time is less important than money , then Peterson 's position is definitely the better . If time is at a premium , Bishop 's position may be preferable . On almost all other issues , the two authors agree.One corollary of Bishop 's objective in preparing this book is that this is not a reference for the most commonly prepared recipes . But , this is not universally true . While the traditional steaming or poaching methods for asparagus is absent , classic mashed potatoes and the traditional Greek salad with tomatoes are here . Bishop is certainly on the side of the gourmet when it comes to discussing tomatoes . He is in love with fresh homegrown tomatoes in July and August , but recommends canned ` maters all other times of the year.One of the most enjoyable discoveries in Bishop 's book is to find ways to treat certain vegetables in totally unexpected ways . Two cases are shallots and garlic . Both are most commonly thought of as herbs to enliven dishes where some other vegetable or protein is the main ingredient , but if you are willing to pay the price , shallots make a great main ingredient , not really much different in cost from , for example cippolini or wild mushrooms.In choosing between Bishop and Peterson , I find that Bishop is much better for the average cook who does not spend a lot of time reading cookbooks . The organization is much better for finding a good recipe for the veg that happened to be on special today . Peterson 's book is much more oriented toward the foodie and the professional . It is organized more by method than by ingredient and it is much better at presenting instructions on difficult techniques such as cleaning an artichoke . Peterson has the one thing I miss the most in Bishop 's book , which are good pictures of vegetables . Neither comes with the lyrics of Frank Zappa 's ` Ask Any Vegetable'.Very highly recommended as a vegetarian and general cook 's reference for recipes and buying advice .	1
Lots of good recipes here and probably the best vegetable cookbook I 've got.I am very happy that it deals with side-dishes rather than fiddly intimidating vegetarian tour de forces.If anything I would like to see even simpler preparations included . I know from experience a range of easily prepared yet inspiring vegetables on the table every night is delightful . The ideas for this however are not at all simple to obtain.I am quite happy about the lack of pretty pictures . So much information is needed that there simply is n't room , and this book educates about substance rather than presentation.But why only 4 stars ? Well I do n't think a 5 star vegetable cookbook has been written yet.In the past vegetable recipes have been a haphazard affair with some happy discoveries , but a failure to be really systematic.So what is needed is a systematic re-examination of vegetables from the ground up , yet incorporating the happy discoveries of previous cooks with modern health and creativity added . Jack 's book does n't quite get there and would really need to be doubled in size to achieve this task.The style of the majority of recipes involves the development of flavours with olive oil and browning techniques , but there are many other techniques I would enjoy seeing more fully developed , such as creative variations , hot or cold salads , oil-less recipes , use of a full palette of spices , and health discoveries such as dressings with flax seed oil .	1
After hearing an interview with Jack Bishop on NPR , my wife and I were intrigued enough to order the book . Four of the five recipes we 've tried thus far have been outstanding , to the point where we 're building entire meals based on them . For instance , we both like broccoli , but did n't know the best way to cook it . Now we do . I 've never liked green beans , but we tried Bishop 's recipe for roasting them , and I 'm suddenly hooked ! In short , if you 've been wanting to bring more vegetables into your diet , buy this book !	1
A coworker lent me this book in the hopes that I would find a few recipes that she could get her veggie hating husband to try . Well , I have n't given it back ! Yet.Some of the recipes I thought surely , this is too simple , or those flavors do n't sound too good , but each recipe I have tried I have loved . My favorite so far is the southern Collard Greens and Tomatoes ... delicious . My husband has loved all the recipes as well ( and while I 'm not a Susie Homemaker , and lean more towards if you do n't like it , make your own damn dinner ) I 'm pleased we can enjoy them together.I enjoy the way the book is written with information on selecting and storage coming before each recipe- this can help me plan meals for the week .	1
Charles Murray is a controversy writer , ever since his & quot ; Bell Curve & quot ; it has been obvious that he poses convictions ( or maybe prejudices ) that moves him . Although I approach this book with skepticism , and may not be in total agreement with his conclusions , I have to admit he has done a valid attempt to measure Human Accomplishments ( not an easy task , and certainly an elusive one ) . It 's logical that some relativity has to be involved in such a measure , anyone trying to do so will inevitably have to define a method , which in turn will definitely have to use subjective or indirect indicators . So , even if I 'm not 100 % convinced by his methods or in agreement with all his conclusions , I have to admit he has done a tremendous effort and a great job , Charles Murray deserves credit for this , and for making an otherwise coffe table book an excellent read .	1
What a delightful little cookbook ! First , she gives a great background of Kerala and of her own family . My fiancee is also a Keralite and this book has allowed me to make him many dishes that he has n't had since he was last home . The pictures are bright , colorful , and visually enticing . The instructions are well thought out and the ingredient listings are logically ordered . In particular , I like how she groups spices under the heading & quot ; ground masala & quot ; and then in the instructions simply states & quot ; add ground masala & quot ; . It makes it easy to know when to throw it in the mix because I put the ground masala together before I start cooking . This way , I do n't have to sort through a list of spices that need to be thrown in quickly.My particular favorite recipes are the piralen , meen molee , and the vadala . Actually , the piralen is now a weekly staple for us because it is so quick and simple to make . Since my prior cooking experiences had been primarily Pakistani and North Indian dishes of a heavier nature , I was amazed at how light and refreshing South Indian cuisine can be . I have just purchased Curried Favors and I ca n't wait to dig into it ! I will be using this book for years to come and look forward to cooking these Keralite delights for my own future children.Now , I am just waiting for Maya 's North Indian cuisine cookbook ( hint , hint : - )	1
To many people all Asian food is broadly the same with , if one is lucky , them managing to separate Indian-styled and Chinese-styled food from the `` Asian Food '' tag . Yet the differences are tremendously wide if one only knows and , of course , many dishes have been localised so even if you have identified and eaten a specific national dish in your own country , it is not necessarily an authentic dish.At least this book will set you right and also let you make your own authentic dishes in the comfort of your own home . Vietnamese food , an often forgotten genre of Asian cuisine , naturally shares a broad commonality with other Asiatic cuisines but once you drill down to the core it is clear that there is a variety of regional differences and styles.Through the author , one is transported to Vietnam to enjoy a guided culinary tour of various market kitchens , street cafes and homes and given the opportunity to learn about the distinctive flavours and types of authentic Vietnamese food . First of all one is given an introduction to the basics and history of Vietnamese cuisine such as special ingredients , cooking techniques and traditional cooking utensils . Intwined with the hard facts are a range of reminiscences from the author and her family and stories and folklore from around the country.Many elements are often combined to produce a dish so an element of harmony and complimentary association is required . One gains an insight into the range of various dipping sauces which are commonplace along with accompaniments and herbs . For example not all Soy sauces are the same and one begins to appreciate the often subtle differences that can exist and see how they can affect a particular dish.Separate chapters exist covering the entire gamut of dishes from salads and savouries , sweets , meat dishes , items suitable for vegetarians and even drinks . All recipes are detailed and relatively easy-to-follow once you have mastered the basics and gained confidence . This is much more than just a recipe book as it feels like a hybrid between a journal , travel book and the inner-most secrets of a top chef.The book , despite being published a long time ago , is still highly regarded and remains in demand with a price tag to match . It would be nice to see a more up-to-date version , if only for the useful resource guide at the back being quite of out date and the addition of even more colour pictures to help guide the unwary and boost their confidence . But do n't let those minor points for one second change the highly positive view towards this book .	1
Mai Pham 's & quot ; Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table & quot ; is one of the best international cookbooks that are available today . Of all those cookbooks pertaining to Vietnamese cuisines , this is the most authentic so far . As a Vietnamese American , living within the spitting distance from Little Saigon ( Westminster ) , I want to learn how to cook such delicate dishes as Bun Bo Hue ( Hue spicy noodle ) and Banh Beo ( Rice cakes ) .The recipes are quite easy to follow , contrary to those reviewers who claim that the directions are difficult to comprehend . I did several dishes from this book , such as Pho and Cha Gio ( egg roll ) , they come out all right ( not perfect ) .I truly sympathize those who do not live near a Vietnamese supermarket . All the ingredients are readily available at most Vietnamese supermarkets ( not Chinese , not Japanese , nor Thai , nor Cambodian , and so on ) . Vietnamese cooking is mostly based on improvisation . That means taste as you go . If you have not tasted some of the dishes that you try to cook , I strongly suggest that you should have some knowledge of those dishes . Be patient ! First time never comes out exactly right . As you practice , it will get better.Finally , I love those narratives of Mai 's childhood with Vietnamese foods . Those are precious and rare , especially concerning Vietnamese culture . After all , food is a great part of one 's culture .	1
I 've just finished reading this book , and I am impressed . I was also impressed with Flower Net . I will certainly read Dragon Bones whenever I find a copy . The two matters that stand out most for praise are 1 ) a stunning description of China 's countryside and peasants and 2 ) Liu Hulan , an enigmatic character . She is a strong woman , sometimes too strong for her own good , who has to make her way through a paternalistic culture and one where the Party line can change overnight . One of the most poingant moments is when her old friend , Suchee , forces her to admit that she has always run from love.David Stark , her American lover and father of her foetus , is less well developed . He is intelligent and very much in love with Hulan , but sometimes he acts like a bull in a china shop.Also , there is quite a bit of `` telling '' in this book , especially explaining what is going through David 's and Hulan 's mind at each stage . Some reviewers consider this a fault , but I do n't . Their different , Chinese and American , takes on a piece of fabricated evidence or a person 's reaction add a lot to this book . This `` telling '' does not extend to other characters . The reader only sees what Lisa See `` shows . `` I 've read a few dismal reviews of this book , apparently from people who expected a fast-paced page turner . If you 're not willing to set the book down and think about it from time to time , the book is not for you .	1
This mystery take place deep in the heart of mysterious China , where Europeans and Americans alike have been able to by-pass safety and cost issues in order to make billions of dollars in the manufacturing business . Replete with Chinese customs and traditions , this story meanders between two continents , leaving bodies and destruction in its path.This is a complex mystery with some complex characters . What strikes me about the characters is that the strong character is a Chinese woman , Detective Hulan , while her male counterpart seems too indecisive and weak to react to matters in a timely fashion . Admittedly , he is an attorney and she an investigator , but I still found this unrealistic . The insertion of Chinese sites and traditions made up for this , making the mystery quite fascinating .	1
This is not like any book I 've read before . Most fiction is about higher class people . This is a book about those at the other end of the spectrum . It 's enlightening to see how they think and feel . It 's very sad they have so much difficulty expressing their feelings toward each other .	1
There are several books by the amazing Stephen Mitchell on the `` Tao Te Ching . '' The two that I know -- this one and his Harper Perennial `` Tao Te Ching '' ( 2006 ) -- use his free-flowing and poetic translation from 1988 . This book is also distinguished by the beautiful artwork on Taoist themes selected by Stephen Little.Mitchell is a master at turning religious works into contemporary English poetry while being essentially true to the original . Noteworthy is his graceful translation of the Gita in `` Bhagavad Gita : A New Translation '' ( 2000 ) . However Mitchell does not know Chinese and therefore in effect is interpreting translations augmented by his scholarship and literary experience . Some people find this off-putting but I think it 's okay as long as you are not looking for most faithful to the `` original '' rendering.I have read the Tao in several English translations ( or renderings ) and I can say that Mitchell 's is one of the best . By `` best '' I mean as a work of religious literature that is essentially true to the meaning and spirit of the original . It is interesting in this regard to note that Mitchell wrote that `` ... the most essential preparation for my work was a fourteen-year-long course of Zen training , which brought me face to face with Lao-tzu and his true disciples and heirs , the early Chinese Zen Masters . `` Mitchell adds ( in true Taoist paradoxical style ) `` With great poetry , the freest translation is sometimes the most faithful ... If I have n't always translated Lao-tzu 's words , my intention has always been to translate his mind . '' ( The quotes are from the Foreword he wrote for the Harper Perennial book mentioned above . ) A nearly instant test of a rendering of the `` Tao '' is a quick look at the opening couplet and at one or two of the most famous chapters . Here 's Mitchell 's opening couplet : '' The tao that can be toldis not the eternal TaoThe name that can be namedis not the eternal Name . `` For comparison let 's look at some other translations . Here 's J. Legge 's version ( from `` Sacred Books of the East , '' Volume 39 1891 ) : '' The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao . The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name . `` There 's a clear difference in the first line . Mitchell writes of the tao being told ( small `` t '' indicating not the eternal Tao ) while Legge refers to a `` Tao '' that can be walked upon not being the real unchanging Tao.Since I do n't read Chinese I do n't know which is truer to the original text -- or actually texts since translators who do read the Chinese characters typically rely on several versions . The simple truth is nobody knows what the `` original '' `` Tao Te Ching '' looked like . In fact it almost certainly came down from an earlier oral tradition . Consequently a free translation may indeed be the `` best . `` Okay , let 's now look at another translation of the first two lines , this time by Derek Lin from his book , `` Tao Te Ching : Annotated and Explained '' ( 2006 ) : '' The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal TaoThe name that can be named is not the eternal name '' This is virtually the same as Mitchell 's rendering.One more , this time from Robert G. Henricks ' `` Lao-Tzu Te-Tao Ching : A New Translation Based on the Recently Discovered Ma-Wang-Tui Texts '' ( 1989 ) : As for the Way , the Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way ; As for names the name that can be named is not the constant name . `` This examination of fine points of course is contrary to the Way ( not to mention Zen ) now that I think about it . Still it is fun to do . So let 's do one more . Here are Mitchell 's first few lines of the famous Chapter 41 : '' When a superior man hears of the Tao , he immediately begins to embody it.When an average man hears of the Tao , he half believes it , half doubts it.When a foolish man hears of the Tao , he laughs out loud.If he did n't laugh , it would n't be the Tao . `` Here 's Legge 's version : Scholars of the highest class , when they hear about the Tao , earnestly carry it into practice . Scholars of the middle class , whenthey have heard about it , seem now to keep it and now to lose it.Scholars of the lowest class , when they have heard about it , laughgreatly at it . If it were not ( thus ) laughed at , it would not be fitto be the Tao.And here is Lin 's version : '' Higher people hear of the TaoThey diligently practice itAverage people hear of the TaoThey sometimes keep it and sometimes lose itLower people hear of the TaoThey laugh loudly at itIf they do not laugh , it would not be the Tao '' My vote is for Mitchell 's `` freer '' version.One of the things I do n't like about Mitchell 's translation is his alternative use of the pronouns `` he '' and `` she . '' It 's a shame that English does not have a gender neutral first person singular ; however I think that , since the `` Tao Te Ching '' is the most feminine of all the great religious works of the world added to the fact that the Tao is itself considered feminine , Mitchell should have gone exclusively with `` she . `` Finally what I want to say is that what Mitchell brings to the translation of the `` Tao Te Ching '' is vast poetic and spiritual experience . When he says he was `` face to face '' with Lao-tzu he means that everything he had learned in his life up to that time allowed him to understand the old master in a way that a less experienced person could not. -- Dennis Littrell , author of `` Yoga : Sacred and Profane ( Beyond Hatha Yoga ) ''	1
a quiet book to be pondered , a book to open your mind and heart to find inner peace , ultimately world peace .	1
I think Audrey Hepburn will be eternally remembered not only as one of the kindest and most generous women that has ever volunteered for Unicef , but to us women as a timeless , most graceful role model of style . She 's the perfect embodiment of the adagio that in elegance less is more . Her streamlined , understated style that yet made one of the biggest statements in fashion history continues to be an inspiration to us women of the 21st century despite the forty years that separate us from `` Breakfast at Tiffany 's . '' Clarke Keogh 's book captures Audrey 's spirit like no other . It is beautifully illustrated and there are contributions from Hubert de Givenchy , Ralph Lauren or Gregory Peck , among other people who generously share with us souvenirs of this angel of grace that they had the chance to meet in person . Her wardrobe and makeup are meticulously reviewed and this book will prove an invaluable tool and source of inspiration for all those women who want to bring more elegance and refinement into their lives . One of the best assets in your style bookcase and one that you will gladly pass down to generations of graceful women to come .	1
Yes we hear , and heard , about the starvation and atrocities in Cambodia and elsewhere , but this story of a young child 's horror while living thru it makes it more real than newspapers and TV ... .which tend to make us immune to the suffering . Thank you Ms Ung for sharing your heartbreak and triumph .	1
I knew when I agreed to review this book that it would not be an easy read . I have to admit to an appalling ignorance of the events in and around the events in the book . Hell , I have to admit to an appalling ignorance to the events surrounding the Viet Nam war and I grew up during it and lost an uncle to it.That being said I went into this book very blind and came out with some knowledge . Knowledge I 'm not sure I want or need . I am forever amazed at the capacity of man to kill , maim and destroy for what are proclaimed to be the loftiest of reasons but boil down to power and greed . But back to First They Killed My Father ... .This is the first book of a trilogy of memoirs written by Loung Ung about her experiences . This book details her youth in Cambodia first as a child of privilege , then as a slave soldier to the Khmer regime . It 's not a happy tale and Ms. Ung does not make herself out to be a pleasant child . In fact she is nothing short of a brat . She writes through the eyes of the child she was and this can be trying at times - she is five when the troubles begin and constantly asking for explanations but do five year old children truly understand political situations to this degree ? I do n't know . I fortunately have never been a child of this level of horror.The book details her families travels from village to village trying to avoid discovery as her father was a government official in the former regime . They are forced to work in ways they never had and to endure starvation and beatings as well . Fear was constant and one day they come for her father . Ms. Ung uses imagination at times to fill in what she does not know for sure but so much is not known of the evils of Pol Pot 's reign.The book is well written and quite compelling . This was my first time reading a book of this topic and it has me interested in learning more but also fearful of what I might learn . Dictators do not leave kind legacies and Pol Pot was one of the nastier ones . The book has stayed with me and has made me want to pick up the other two volumes to continue on with Loung Ung 's story .	1
You may have missed the Body For Life fad the first time around , but the book , tapes , supplements , etc . are still with us.You may not realize that it takes 30 days to make a new habit , but using Mr. Phillips 12 week program , you can put a firm foundational habit in place to change your life.It does take work and discipline , but then again so do most things worth working for.I used Body For Life a few months before my wedding to lose the weight , and managed to drop 23 pounds in the 12 weeks . Since then I have gained it back , but the program does work if you stick to it.You can save money by eating high protein foods such as Cottage Cheeze , Buffalo or Ostrich meats . You can also buy protein powders such as whey or soy in bulk to avoid buying the recommended supplements.I give the program four stars because if you travel with work alot or are a road warrior eating in restaurants it can be hard to stick with it.Recommended.Cheers !	1
Bottom line , this works ! I have been on this life change for only three weeks now and I am having dramatic results ( lost 9 lbs so far , my pants fit better and I am getting stronger. ) . The whole concept is 6 meals a day every 2-1/2 hours with exercise 6 days a week . If you think that you wo n't have time for all that exercise remember the weight training days are only 45 minutes and the cardio days are only 20 minutes . I am not spending any money on any of the supplements , I only eat food . It is easy for me to cook one night and eat the leftovers for two of my meals the next day , combined with an egg omelet in the morning after my work out and a bowl of oatmeal at night I only need to find two other meals to complete my day . I am actually saving money cause we are not eating out twice a day . The thing that is keeping me true to this is the cheat day . Once a week I eat whatever I want . I do n't know what this does , but man it sure does help . I would have given this 5 stars , in fact I give the program 5 stars and the book 4 stars . The problem is the same with any other health/diet/fitness book ; it only takes about 5 pages to describe in detail the plan of this diet . Why make it into a [ ... ] book . As for some of the other reviewers that say their weight came back remember this is a life style change , if you go back to eating a pizza every night you are going to gain it back , this , however holds true for any diet and not just this one .	1
I must admit I am a fan of Bill Phillips . He did help me lose 60 pounds . He offers a very practical eating and workout plan for beginners . Phillips is not a fan of carbs ( bread , cookies , etc. ) . I followed his exercises as directed in the book and found they worked well for me . The workout section shows pictures of models doing the exercises as you follow along and it works well . A variety of exercises for each muscle group is provided . Bill breaks them down into upper body and lower body exercises . The tables included were useful to keep track of my progress . If you do the work then this program will surely work for you . Common sense , practical suggestions and a clear roadmap to success.Take what you need and move on if you must . If you listen to Bill you will see results . You can use the supplements you want ( if any ) instead of purchasing his products . Overall his advice is basic but good : eat lots of small meals instead of large meals , avoid bread , and change from cardio to weights every other day to cross-train . Admittedly , fitness types wo n't find much new ( if anything ) here but it is a great introduction to healthy living . Overall , Bill gives good intro advice on what to eat and when , muscle building and cardio exercises.Buy this book .	1
How shall I say this ... .. its is simple to understand , the change in dietary habits is exceptionally easy and the workouts give you a great sense of accomplishment first thing in the day . Sure , Bill Phillips pushes his product EAS , but who cares . It works and it is used by thousands if not millions of people . I do not desire to be some buff body dude , I just want to be healthy and energetic enough to hang with my great grandchildren in 60 years.REad this book if you want to transform your life , your accomplishments and your health .	1
I did this book before my wedding 10 years ago and it worked great and I was a size 4 for my wedding and honeymoon . After having a child and hitting my 30 's weight does n't seem to come off like it did in my 20 's ( even late 20 's ) , so I had to buy his book again . I have to say , it does work , but my busy life does make it hard to fit in his hour long weight sessions 3 days a week .	1
This book has a lot of good information and it is easy to understand . It is a good book for any level you are at . Beginners can easily read this and come up with diverse and safe exersizes to do .	1
By condensing all of the best stuff without forcing you to watch the painful stuff , this book makes the very hit-or-miss & quot ; The Simpsons & quot ; palatable . It also includes stuff that the average viewer would miss . If you think that the series is funny , you 'll like this even more .	1
great for any Simpsons fanit has a lot of things that hardcore fans already know and few new tidbits that may have been looked over when first watching the episodes	1
I was n't sure I would like this book but , I really enjoyed it . It 's full of interesting tidbits and I liked her honesty . The first part is a little boring but , once you get past that her story is interesting .	1
It is very satisfying how honest Cybill Shepherd has been about her complicated life . At times , it seems she must have been at least a bit responsible for her reputation for being difficult , but I do know enough about Hollywood to know it is a place full of narcissists and most of them are men . Women have to fight to be taken seriously and then are chastised when they succeed .	1
I was never interested in rocks until I read this book . What an eye opener . I would love to travel and see this map in person . What a great work .	1
This was a superb book , well-written ( What is it about British authors ? ) and on a topic that is familiar to me . My father was a geologist and I started out to follow in his footsteps before going into engineering and economics . In all that time I had never heard of William Smith and his contributions to Geology although I have been interested in fossils all my life . The first and last thirds of the book read like a novel while the middle portion dragged a bit but was still fascinating and necessary.I am continually amazed that despite ALL the evidence such as presented in this book , Americans ( 40 % according to a recent article , with another 40 % in doubt in the ECONOMIST magazine ) still cling to their disbelief of evolution . The Brits were beginning to see it 200 years ago with this book and many more following Darwin in 1859.The book arrived on time , early , if anything , was in perfect condition , and was inexpensive . Could I have asked for more ? r.b . miller	1
I wish I 'd written this book , because it 's fast-paced and clever and one of those good reads you 're loath to put down . But unlike the seriously writer's-blocked protagonist of John Colapinto 's About the Author , I do n't have a manically productive and unexpectedly talented law student rooming with me . But what if I did ? And what if said law student turned up dead one day ? The author takes this simple premise ( *God* , I wish I 'd written this ) and runs with it . A great read.Reviewed by Debra Hamel , author of Trying Neaira : The True Story of a Courtesan 's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	1
On Hitler 's Niece and writing historical fictionIf you want to know about Hitler 's life , then read Ian Kershaw 's Hitler : A Biography ( W. W. Norton & Company , 2010 ) . If you want to find out as much as possible about the history of the Nazi movement and Hitler 's role in it , then read Hitler and Stalin : Parallel Lives by Alan Bullock ( Knopf , 1992 ) . But if you want to get a sense of who Hitler was a human being , I encourage you to read a very well written historical novel by Ron Hansen called Hitler 's Niece ( Harper Collins , 1999 ) .Hansen traces Hitler 's abnormal psychology from the perspective of Angela Maria ( `` Geli '' ) Raubal ( 1908-1931 ) , his half niece . Geli is intelligent , beautiful , full of joie de vivre and untouched by the political obsessions anti-Semitic hatred of her uncle and his cronies . She maintains an ironic distance from Hitler 's fanatical followers -- Rudolf Hess , Heinrich Himmler , Joseph Goebbels , Hermann G & ouml ; ring , Alfred Rosenberg and others -- who also appear in the novel . Compared to her , however , they 're wooden characters in a farce , much as they were in real life . These vain men are fawning and obsequious , hungry for power and always ready to not merely follow , but also anticipate Hitler 's orders and wishes.By the author 's own admission , however , the novel does n't adhere strictly to historical facts . It is only inspired by them , particularly by Bullock 's book Hitler and Stalin , which Hansen states provoked his fascination with Geli Raubal . ( Author 's Note , 307-308 ) The novel describes Geli 's life , from beginning to end ; from birth to tragic death . We find out that her father died at the young age of 31 , leaving her mother , Angela , to take care of three kids ( Geli , Leo and Elfriede ) with almost no source of income . After seeing that Geli , at seventeen , had bloomed into a lovely young woman , Hitler invited her to be his housekeeper and companion . Her mother gladly accepted this unorthodox arrangement , in the hopes of making possible a better lifestyle for their family.Becoming Hitler 's companion , caretaker , maid and eventually his mistress , Geli catches a glimpse of the inner workings of the Nazi party and its key players ' rise to power . Above all , Hitler 's Niece shows us , up close and personal , how a psychopath capable of genocide `` falls in love . '' Even after her death , Hitler called Geli the love of his life . Neither Eva Braun , his doting life companion , nor any other woman could compete with his obsession with Geli.Geli Raubal spent six years either living with Hitler or being in frequent contact with him . For a period of time , she lived in his Munich apartment while she studied medicine and took music lessons . She also accompanied him to the opera , cinema , and the many other social functions he attended . The plot of the novel hinges on their sexual tension and on Geli 's psychological trauma as she becomes , increasingly against her will , his sexual partner in a sordid , sadomasochistic relationship that sickens her and intoxicates him . The more she tries to escape , the more possessive , dependent and desperate he becomes . As the narrator states , `` She was his escape , his torpor , his surrender to the vacillation and passivity that were increasingly part of his nature '' ( 220 ) .Need and obsessive desire , however , do n't imply love . For love to exist , the lover has to be able to consider , empathize with and fulfill the beloved 's own needs , as a separate individual . Hitler ca n't do that . He `` loves '' his niece like a man who is incapable of real love . His idea of flirtation is bragging incessantly about himself . His idea of `` affection '' is engaging in perverse and demeaning sexual rituals . His idea of respect for women gives way to a fundamental misogyny and traditionalism that require them to serve him , and his idea of passion is possession and control of the object of his desire.Hitler demands to know at all times where Geli is , what she is doing and with whom . He retains the freedom to see other mistresses -- including Eva Braun -- but keeps a tight leash on Geli , discouraging other suitors . Once Emil Maurice , Hitler 's good-looking Corsican chauffeur begins dating Geli , Hitler finds a pretext to dismiss him . `` She is with me , '' Hitler snarls when another man , Schirach , asks his permission to take out Geli on a date . ( 244 ) Caught in the vortex of her uncle 's overpowering addiction to her , Geli can not escape the misery that dominates her life . When she expresses her distress , her friends turn their back on her and even her mother would rather , essentially , prostitute her to `` Uncle Alf , '' `` the patriarch '' of the family , rather than face poverty again . At the end , Hitler 's Niece adds an interesting but largely speculative twist to the story . Although the official version is that Geli committed suicide in 1931 , in the novel , Hitler , realizing that he can no longer master his niece , beats her , breaks her nose , and then shoots her . His entourage quickly covers up the murder and presents it to the police and the press as an act of suicide . This adds an intriguing element of mystery to the plot , turning Hitler 's Niece into a detective story . But the novel 's main strength remains the psychological aspects of the drama . Hansen helps us see that is not much difference between Hitler the public man , who could order the murder of millions of innocent people , and Hitler the private lover who could destroy the object of his desire rather than risk losing her.Given this novel 's many strengths , it 's surprising to me that Hitler 's Niece received some scathing reviews , particularly from The New York Times . In `` Springtime for Hitler , in love with his niece , '' Michiko Kakutani offers a lengthy plot summary and then dismisses the novel as a poor representation of history which takes away from the gruesome reality of Hitler 's `` public crimes , crimes that tragically were not speculative imaginings of a novelist , crimes that have been consigned to the margins of this inept and voyeuristic novel '' ( NYT , September 7 , 1999 ) . [ ... ] I completely disagree with Kakutani 's harsh assessment and standards of evaluation in this case . The role of historical fiction is not to convey history accurately or in great detail . That is what ( nonfiction ) history books do . In my opinion , the role of historical fiction is to do exactly what Hitler 's Niece does so well : namely , find inspiration in real historical events to imagine the mindset , emotions and desires of its key figures . Often only more marginal characters , such as Geli Raubal , or Hitler 's niece , can give us a three-dimensional picture of the monster whose acts have marred the pages of history.Claudia Moscovici , Literature Salon	1
Very good book , well written , you can read it as you would read a novel . It is n't a boring sequence of facts and data , but explains you how the ancient Egyptians were , what did they believed , how did they saw the world , and why they finally declined . It explains very thoroughly the main features of Egyptian art and how it relates to their beliefs about the Afterlife .	1
I really enjoyed this book . He 's as nice a guy as you could ever possibly meet . And after I read this book , I gained an understanding of why that 's so .	1
Howard Zinn is my new favorite historian and I now rise to belatedly mourn his passing and praise his work . This is the best history book I 've ever read , and I read a lot of history and historical fiction . What a radical concept , the history of radicalism.Not just radicalism for the sake of radicalism , as this stuff is often presented in conventional history , but rather with the whole backstory . It 's history from the perspective of the losers , so to speak , although `` the loser now may be later to win . For the times they are a changin ' . `` This is also the best description of history-as-watching-grass-grow that I 've ever come across . Significant historical changes are usually slow and halting in their approach and often Earth shattering in their arrival , and Zinn describes the process brilliantly in this exposition . He focuses more on the process of change than change itself and on those that gave the last full measure of devotion to the cause.This book contains heartwrenching stories of dedicated individuals that helped change history despite the opposition of the wealthy and powerful . Human nature can be ugly at times and Zinn exposes some of the worst excesses of the US government in the exercise of its power . He also explains power as both an end and a means of suppressing the unruly masses . It was particularly interesting to read about the founding fathers as a group with common economic interests in a revolution rather than as a noble collection of political altruists . Sure they were great men , some of them anyways , but they occasionally may have put their personal interests ahead of those of the country as a whole . What a heretical concept ! The rich , powerful and privileged have always had folks available to tell their history and the history of their `` country '' , but there are other perspectives to history and in this book Howard Zinn proves that the stories of the downtrodden and powerless are often much more interesting , and infinitely more thought provoking .	1
finally , someone had the good sense to write a history book about america , that doesnt reek of patriotic pablum ... i read this book three months ago , on the advice of who else , matt damon ... i was watching good will hunting in a hotel room in seattle , when i saw the scene where he tells robin williams , if you want to read a real hisory book read a people 's history of the united states by howard zinn ... it knocked my socks off alright ! here is real history , straight , no chaser ... the white men in this book arent heroes coming along to save the day . The marginalized get their voice and how ... america was a country built on the backs of the disenfranchised and zinn points that out ... columbus is shown for the murdering scavenger he is ... big business built america at the expense of the poor and zinn shows us how they did it ... with high-octane prose that zings from line to line ... the best chapters in the book besides the opening chapter on colombus ' arrival to the new world , are the chapters that focus on the labor movement , and the vietnam war . by letting the voices of the working class speak , zinn shows the real america . conservatives will hate this book to no end , because zinn has taken the mask off the lies history professors have taught students about the Good old U.S.A , as a radical liberal , i encourage all free thinkers to try this book , if they are jaded with the usual banal tomes ' they get in the classroom ... this book was 10 years in the making and it shows . a movie based on the book is coming soon , hopefully matt and his best bud ben affleck will be in it , maybe robin too ? ?	1
Unfettered capitalism manifests in horrendous realities including , among others , typhoid fever , smallpox , polio , cholera , starvation , the madness of organized homocides renamed war as well as the sufferings imagined in the fertile imagination of a creative Rinpoche in a Buddhist Hell . They still argue as though the rapacious had a valid point of view and theirs was the best way . They still give 50 % of the time and the screen and then some to the greedy oppressors in their media events . The ruthless control the media and through relentless agressiveness have always manipulated and exploited the unluckily , ill conceived masses.Professor Zinn has created a master work in the fallaciousness of the American mythology . No fantasy here . The plain , unvarnished truth of the history of Americans as the people lived it . Not the angelic Abraham Lincoln but , rather , the agile politician and practical man of but limited moral outrage is described in but a bit of the bankruptcy that is at a sadly central portion of the American story .	1
I enjoyed reading this book , however , the other seems to try to pass off his opinion as factual information . There main complaint I have about the book is that the author constantly praises unions and gives them full credit for the laying the groundwork for our society . I recommend pairing this book with `` A Patriots History of the United States . '' Read them both , then decide for yourself .	1
Howard Zinn was one of my favorite professors at university . This book presents with unflinching candor events that really happened in our history . And he is never boring !	1
Those who have an interest in such things will find themselves being able to put two and two together in formulating how this country was actually formed , which most times runs counter to official 'historical ' versions as a result of reading this book.This book is destined to be a Great Work , Howard Zinn does an excellent job of piecing together the untold stories and unheard from perspectives to provide a picture that is both realistic and accurate .	1
This review is of the 2000 copyright edition , I have not seen the updated book . `` Volumetrics '' is a well-researched eating plan by a respected professor of nutrition . Dr. Rolls does an excellent job of illustrating the important of energy density as it relates to portion size . I particularly appreciated the visuals comparing the relative portion sizes of similar foods that have different energy densities.The main complaint I have about the plan ( as set forth in the 2000 edition ) is the author 's overemphasis on fat and underemphasis on carbohydrates . She pooh-poohs the Glycemic Index and the effect carbs ( particularly refined ones ) have on insulin levels in the body . Yes , fat has a higher energy density than carbs do , but that does n't mean all fats are bad and all carbs are good . It just means that the individual has to watch portion sizes of good fats like nuts , avocadoes , & olive oil . And dieters should definitely practice moderation in their carb intake and avoid refined carbs .	1
My doctor told me about this book . She highly recommended it to me . I got it to read so that I can find a good way to lose weight and not hurt my body . I am finding this book to be helpful in losing weight for my life . I highly recommend it to others as well . If a doctor recommends a book , then you know that it is worth reading .	1
Douglas Waller has a real talent for immersing you in the world of the present-day American submariner . He deals not just with the technical nuts and bolts of the nuclear powered Trident submarine Nebraska , but he gives you a real feel for the crew , both individually and collectively . I suspect that this is a somewhat sanitized view of life under water ; after all he did live with these men for an extended period of time , undoubtedly shared confidences with them , and almost certainly grew to like and admire them . He probably would n't produce a & quot ; reveal all & quot ; expose as a result . Yet having stated that caveat , to the uninitiated at least the book nonetheless rings true . This a valuable contribution to our understanding of why the American military is usually so successful , and offers an insight into how it maintains the United States as the last remaining superpower . In many respects , Waller 's writing does for the undersea navy what the likes of Anna Simons ( & quot ; The Company They Keep : Life Inside the U.S. Army Special Forces & quot ; ) have done for other branches of the military . Not only is this a good , entertaining read , but it is an excellent study into the sociology of a very unique , small , but surely very important social group !	1
One look at these adorable puppies and your heart will instantly melt . I have an English Cocker Spaniel , Ben , who can be an angel while I am at work during the day and the Tazmanian Devil by night . Could I scold him - it is extremely difficult .

Daughter of Fortune is a fast and pleasant read -- it 's a plot-driven novel in which all things are clearly spelled out for the reader . The two protagonists of the book are likable and well-developed . There 's the young Chilean woman , Eliza , who flees her adoptive home for California to follow her first love , who has been lured there by the promises of riches in the Gold Rush . Then there 's Tao Chi'en , a Chinese man who is part sailor , part doctor , and part sage . The adventures of the two up and down the California coast make for an enjoyable read , and the secondary characters give the novel some meat for its bones -- Eliza 's adoptive mother Miss Rose , Joe Bonecrusher -- the cross-dressing madam of a traveling brothel , and Paulina -- the wife with business savvy who makes a fortune importing fresh produce packed on ice to California 's starved population , all make for an intriguing read . Allende uses the juxtaposition of the Chinese , Chilean , and English cultures to unobtrusively remark on issues such as a woman 's position in the world , and the theme of identity weighs in heavily . Fortune in this case can either be interpreted as fate or simply luck , but in either case , the characters seem to be unable to escape it for better or worse . Good summer reading -- a step up from mass market paperback fodder , but not too heavy and cumbersome .	1
The first time I read this book , at the age of twelve , I really connected to the narrator 's view on the novel 's plotline , although I realize that I did n't particularly appreciate all of the plotline . Now , after having read it several times , it is one of my favorite books that brings the civil rights movement in a different light than one learns about in history classes or other books . The separate point of view , through the eyes of a little girl ( although the language would make you think otherwise ) , demonstrates how unnecessary many of these stereotypes and predjudices were at the time the book was written ( or at the present day ) . Now , years later , the book is still an important one for poeple to read -- the themes are universal , and it is simply good literature that is interesting and a wonderful book all around .	1
My English professor recomended me this book , and I loved it . I have to admit it was a little boring at the beginning , but it catched up towards the end . I do recomend this book , and as many other readers said , it is a must to read it again .	1
Like a lot of people , I originally read this novel in high school . It 's considered a 'classic ' and a book that young people should read before college . It is both of those things , but it is also an excellent novel to read for pleasure.The story takes place in Maycomb , Alabama during the 1930 's . A time and place very alien to most of us in the modern world . At the center of the story is Scout , a fiesty young tomboy , just old enough to go to school . She has an older brother , Jem , and the two of them get into all sorts of scrapes . They enjoy play-acting and spinning scary tales about the spooky town recluse , Boo Radley.The other plot strand involves their father , Atticus Finch , who is the town lawyer . Atticus is called upon to defend an African-American man who has been accused of raping a white woman . The reader can imagine the climate of the town towards African-Americans at that time . The town is rampant with racism , and Atticus has his work cut out for him . Not because the accused is guilty , but because it 's likely that the 12 white men sitting on the jury will convict him even if he 's innocent.Lee 's mastery is shown when the two plot strands come together in a spectacular way , resulting in danger for the Finch family and the man Atticus has sworn to defend.Sadly , this Pulitzer Prize winner was the only novel Lee ever wrote .	1
I suggest everybody read this book . And if you 've read it before read it again because I know you 'll find something that you did n't notice before .	1
I feel that 5 star reviews are given a bit too often on amazon . However , here is a book that deserves every one . This is just a fantastic story . I first read this in Highschool and did not really care for it . I picked it up again and wow ! Harper Lee 's writing is simple , humorous , touching , nostalgic in tone , always bringing you more and more , step by step , into her world . At the end I found myself on the inside , looking out , not wanting to return to the real world .	1
I read this last year in 9th grade and I loved it . I read the entire thing in a week . With most classics it takes me much longer to read . This classic is a must read . It not only is great for conversation , but at my age adults think I am an intelligent person . : ) It is really neat and is pretty great . I liked it a lot and you will too . No wonder it 's a classic .	1
I do n't use those words much to describe a book , but book deserves it with the utmost regard . Based in the small southern town of Maycomb , Alabama in the 1930 's , it chroniciles the life of Scout Finch , a mischevies little girl with a heart of gold . Her brother Jem , is a tough boy who looks after Scout with all his heart . They meet a young boy who blends in well with them named Dill.Based around the rape trial of a black man , Tom Robinson , it drives through emotions that you would n't even believed that you had . One of the greatest scenes in literature is when Atticus , Jem and Scouts father , shoots the wandering dog , left me breathless.If you have a love for anything , read this book , it is really great .	1
What a wonderful story and what a refreshing change to read a story written with such virtue , honesty , and integrity ! Where are the Atticus Finches ' in today 's world ? Simply Wonderful !	1
Lee 's only pulitzer price winning novel is a true classic ! Lots of good characters and a nice plot filled with the issues that we 're all struggling with today ( e.g . racism , flaws in justice , torn relationships , and judgmental people ) ... I liked how all the characters interacted with each other and stuck by each other except at the part where it came to the trial of Tom Robinson . You have people rooting for him and people wanting him to be punished for a crime he never committed , which divides the line of love and coming together in a realistic way as told by Harper Lee ... .do read this novel and I assure you you will like it and consider it a well-written classic .	1
To Kill A Mockingbird is the great American novel . Its characters are solid and believable , moving fluidly through a finely honed tale of love and sorrow . I remember the first time I read `` To Kill A Mockingbird '' . Flying through it in order to get my English paper done , I missed a lot . One summer later I found myself reading it again out of boredom . That boredom did n't last . In the years since I have reread the story three or four times ; once even staying up all night . The power of the story lies in the words for me . The simple descriptions of complicated actions from the perspective of a small girl have incredible power . The final line of the novel regarding the fact that Atticus would be there when Jem `` waked in the morning '' exemplifies this by simply showing the love this man has for his son with out relying on overt emotionalism . In its ' simplicity it avoids sensationalism and therefore comes across stronger and clearer . Yet in my rereading , I have always found a new level of understanding for the words and actions , growing to love the novel more each time.To Kill A Mockingbird is a sensational book to read for yourself and pass to others . Atticus Finch is a wonderful role model for all ages . He stands up for what he believes in without giving into pressures placed upon him during the story . Jean-louise Finch , also known as Scout to most people who know her , is a wonderful role model for all young and old children . She is placed in situations that many of us at one point are . She learned many lessons through out the book along with Dill Harris and her Brother Jeremy Atticus Finch . The children had their own goals set for themselves . They were `` after '' Arthur `` Boo '' Radly , and the story behind him.Harper Lee 's love for people swells from the pages of this book . Her characters are exquisitely drawn , their story is believable and thrilling . Read this book and see the movie ! It 's too bad she went into seclusion after she wrote this book .	1
This great novel is full of lessons . Perhaps it is this that makes To Kill a Mockingbird a revered and beloved classic in the eyes of millions . Or perhaps it is Harper Lee 's narration in the voice of a Southern child that makes it so moving . Or perhaps it is the story 's timeless ability to draw forth sympathy from its readers as much today as it did in 1960 . In a great twist , Lee examines the racist South through the eyes of a young white girl.As the story unfolds , we are introduced to Scout and Jem , sister and brother living in a small , depression-era Alabama town . We follow their everyday life as they grow up and we learn the same lessons they learn . The climax finally comes when their father , Atticus , decides to defend a black man , Tom Robinson , falsely accused of raping a white woman . After news of this spreads around town , the children get a glimpse of the ugliness of racism . They learn from the example set by their father , forgiving even Mrs. Dubose , who was one of the most racism women in town.Being told from the perspective of a innocent Southern gal only makes To Kill a Mockingbird and its message more endearing . Lee 's portrayal of Scout and Jem 's firsthand experience with prejudice is powerful and moving . It makes me wonder : if so innocent and unknowing of a child such as Scout , can realize that racism is wrong , that an innocent man should not be punished , then why ca n't the adults ? This nagging thought is probably what makes this novel so touching.Lee 's writing makes it easy to picture the small Alabama town . Despite its many faults , there are many things and places about the town that makes it easy to love . Especially when people like the Finch 's give the town an inkling of hope.What really captured me about this novel is its incredible ability to teach its readers life lessons . Through Jem 's bout with Mrs. Dubose , Lee teaches us to always forgive other for their faults and look instead for the good in them . Through Tom Robinson and Boo Radley , Lee teaches us about the injustice of the world and subtly encourages us to take a stance against it.To Kill a Mockingbird will leave you breathless . It touches upon so many different values and lessons in life and unfolds in a narration that enhances the impact of the novel 's message . Compassionate , dramatic , and deeply moving , To Kill a Mockingbird most definitely merits a second and even a third read . It is a timeless piece that never fails to impress .	1
This book starts of a little slow when the characters are being developed but gets much better as it gets into the meat of the matter . It is nicely written and the story line is very strong . It really captures racism back in the day and turns it into a compelling tale/reality ...	1
I first checked this book out from the library to see if it was worthwhile owning . I then bought this book because I wanted to work with the checklists and worksheets that are in the last half of the book . I 've found this book to be helpful even if all it does is remind me to take a deep breath and relax ... AND the tips really do help .	1
This is a fantastic peek into the genius mind of Clive Barker . He speaks of his writings and his opinions on them candidly , and provides examples of archetypes , concepts , and his interpretations of archetypes that he uses . He does n't just preach about these , though , he gives examples from a wide selection of his works . Barker was n't just a horror writer , he was so much more . If you want an introduction to the worlds and universes created by him , this is a great start . Be aware it may have spoilers for a few of his books . It does contain the complete story , `` The Forbidden '' , on which the `` Candyman '' movie is based .	1
I used to watch Star Trek , which I believe is an asset when reading this book . But you do n't have to be a true aficionado of Star Trek in all its permutations to benefit from -- and enjoy -- this unusual approach to the fascinating subject of ethics . That 's because , at the start of each chapter , authors Barad and Robertson describe various individual shows in enough ( but never too much ) detail so that you can picture the scenes and participate fully in the lively conversation . What 's right and what 's not ? Whose view of ethics was applied by the makers of the show , and which SHOULD be applied in each convoluted instance , Aristotle 's or Kant 's , Sartre 's or the Christians ? The tone of the writing is always fresh and conversational , without oversimplifying the topic . Is Spock sometimes & quot ; too logical , & quot ; or is Kirk sometimes too swayed by emotion ? How can we tell ? By the final results -- the universe is saved yet again -- or by what they hoped would happen ? I found myself drawn in again and again , able to follow the thread of what is , after all , a high level discussion . Highly recommended for the casual reader interested in how we determine what to do in living a & quot ; good & quot ; life . I 'd love to see this used in high schools and colleges to introduce people to these age-old but always fresh ideas in a compelling way .	1
I bought this book in hopes of gaining some insight into my late father 's baseball allegiances . He was a Dodger fan and a Koufax devotee . Growing up in the suburbs of Washington D.C . I was never sure why that was so.Leavy does a great job in allowing the reader to get a grasp , albeit a loose one , on this enigmatic and utterly unbelievable athlete . As a baseball fan I had always known about Koufax 's legacy as a player.In reading this book I got a better idea about the attitudes in baseball and society during that era . I also discovered what my father could never quite explain to a young boy growing up playing baseball . That there is so much more to this game than the game and Koufax knew that and somehow my dad knew Koufax had that awareness.This book will shed a lot of light on Sandy Koufax for most readers but it will be even more illuminating about an era for those who did not live in it . This should be required reading for every major leaguer today .	1
This well written , well researched book accurately portrays Koufax 's impact on the game and his lasting legacy . It is the best book written to date that bridges the Dodgers ' Brooklyn and Los Angeles eras . For baseball fans of any age , it is a must read .	1
I 'm not a baseball , or even a sports fan , but a good biography is worth reading no matter how the subject spent his or her life . I was drawn to reading this because I happened to see Koufax pitch one of his last games . It was in Chicago , and he lost to the Cubs . I 've seen maybe half a dozen pro baseball games , and that 's the only one I remember at all . Leavy is a fine writer ; her prose is energetic and highly readable . Any really good biography is also history , and she made the historical setting , of the days when Koufax was actively pitching , come alive . Baseball , like the rest of the world , has changed a lot in the last forty years , but if Koufax made an impression on me way back then , he must have been some phenomenon ! A fine read from any angle .	1
I was a big fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers growing up and never knew what Sandy Koufax had to endure during his early years as a Dodger . I was just a little girl during the beginning of his career , but kept a score card for every game that was played during that time.I loved all the Dodgers and can still to this day name everyone of the players and where theyplayed.To think that he was n't respected by his manager is unbelievable . Just because he was Jewish did n't matter to the baseball fans of that era . I am sure that once he was given the chance to show what he could do they should have apologized to him on a national basis . No I never saw him pitch in person , but always had the greatest respect of his desire to be the best he could be . He not only was a great player , but encouraged all his team mates to be their best they could be.Just to look at all the innings pitched and what he suffered throught to do it is amazing . My heart goes out to him and am glad that he finally earned all the respect he deserved . If I ever have a chance to met him I would just be glad to shake his hand and tell him he deserved every trophy he received.He deserves to know that many of his fans still do n't know how hard a time he had coming up as a bonus baby . I recommend this book to all Dodger fans and I am sure they will be as surprised as I was at the way he was treated . Keep writing stories like this , It it is truly amazing what one can learn . It is never to late to know what a great man he still is .	1
Mr. Koufax retired just before I started playing ball , so all I 've had to go on were old reels of his pitching . This book gave me more background on him , including the fact that he was a tremendous athlete to the extent that he was an excellent basketball player as well.What I found fascinating was how he broke down his mechanics to show that he generated so much of his velocity from his stride on the mound . It 's not that that was unknown , but how he broke it down himself was interesting.I think that whatever complaints there may be about this book are overcome by the subject himself and the information this book provides . I recommend it especially to anyone who , like me , never got to see him pitch while he was playing .	1
Once again , Rebecca Wells is back to charm us with another offering in the Ya-Ya chronicle . And to think , we owe it all to a tiny pecan and a little girl 's nose . It all started when four-year-old Teensy Whitman stuck a pecan up her nose , just to see if she could , which warranted a trip to the local doctor in their small Louisiana town of Thornton . And it 's here that young Teensy encountered equally vivacious Vivi Walker . The two girls shared a mutual love of the dramatic and soon sought out Necie and Caro , who also shared a certain flair et viola ! The Ya-Yas were born ! As in the earlier two books , LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE and THE DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD , YA-YAS IN BLOOM is told by multiple narrators , each serving to illuminate the many colorful characters and all their wonderful foibles . We learn about their early days in 1930s Louisiana , their time spent at the Bob Theater ( run by Caro 's parents ) , searching for the elusive Coco Robichaux , and later , the many shows the Ya-Yas mounted at various holiday parties -- - opportunities that provided the foundation for young Sidda 's future career as a playwright/director . Unlike the previous two books , here we get a little more back story on the other Walker children , especially Vivi 's youngest son , Baylor , as he makes his local TV debut as a little singing Buckaroo.Through all their trials and tribulations , Vivi 's constant struggle with Catholicism , the disappearance of Necie 's granddaughter , bouts with alcoholism , simmering family tensions , and all the things that make up a satisfying Southern novel , the Ya-Yas and their children , the Petit Ya-Yas , learn to face adversity with grit , determination and -- - most importantly -- - a sense of style.Though not as narratively strong as Wells 's earlier outings , YA-YAS IN BLOOM still feels like visiting with old friends .

I enjoyed this book just as much as the other ones . Could n't put it down , as with the other books..	1
I was thinking Scheindlin would have elaborated on her theories of & # 34 ; taking responsibility. & # 34 ; Instead this book is about family and criminal matters from court cases , making a tough love stance on punks and losers and NOT bending to liberal , political correctness . I agree with her in 95 % of her examples.I 'm going to send it to my daughter just in case she desperately needs something to read because it 's associated with her work for a lawyer .	1
This book serves as more of a biographical and , in some ways , a psychological profile of Frazier and Ali rather than a blow by blow of their three famous matches . I liked that . The author does a good job of explaining how the rivalry bitterly shaped Frazier 's worldview to his last day while showing that Ali harmed his health by boxing into the early '80s . My only criticism is that the author uses obscure words that had me running to the Kindle dictionary when simpler words would have easily sufficed .	1

Although the founder of Stoicism was Zeno of Citium ( circa 333 B.C . ) , this philosophy had a far reaching influence on the Roman Empire and even Christianity . Marcus Aurelius ( 161-180 A.D. ) , mentoree of the Great Emperor , Hadrian , mentor , was the closest to what Plato refers to in his book , The Republic , as The Philosopher King . When thinking of Stoicism we never think of Zeno , but Marcus Aurelius.Aurelius ' text , Meditations , is just as relevant today as it was at the time the philosopher Emperor sat in his tent in the freezing cold with his soliders battling the encroaching 'Barbarians ' , far from his beloved Rome.What Mark Forstater has compiled is Aurelius ' writings from Meditations in particular catagories , such as `` The Cruelty of Anger , `` Conceptions of Good '' , `` Meeting Challenges '' and my favourite at the moment , as office politics is currently rampant at work , `` Social Unity '' '' Since you are an integral part of a social system , let every act of yours contribute to the harmonization of social life . Any action that is not related directly or remotely to this social aim disturbs your life , and destroys your unity . '' ( P.105 ) Advice that , for me , at least , put the situation ( s ) in there proper perspective . Do not add to the dis-unity but aim for a concensus , a harmony that all or most can live with.As an undergraduate , fumbling around the smorgasbord of humanties courses , reading Meditations helped focus my mind towards finding that 'focus ' and really begin to learn.This is a wonderful book to simply `` flick '' through and discover some relevant advice on life , confrontation , what is the right way to live , love and the soul .	1
The popularity of the historically inaccurate but popular film , GLADIATOR , may ignite a new interest in the writings of the Roman Emperor-Philosopher Marcus Aurelius . This is ironic , since Aurelius wrote that one should emulate the boxer rather than the gladiator , since the boxer need only clench is fists ( self reliance ) , while the gladiator required a sword . Forstater provides a very good introduction to the historic period and Aurelius 's Stoic writings . Marcus Aurelius , of whom one Emperor was quite fond , ruled from 161 to 180 . He died in what is now Vienna , most likely the victim of poisoning in a plot by his son Commodus ( one of the Empires worst rulers ) . Marcus Aurelius , trained in the Stoic tradition by the former Greek slave Epictetus , wrote on themes dealing with death , change , being at one with nature , the control of quick tempers and anger , and about courage , hope , greed , avarice , virtue , justice , and peace . At a time when the Pax Roman collapsed , Aurelius wrote about peace , not power or fame . Spending eight winters on the Danube , fighting off the Eastern hordes and Germans , he used Stoicism for strength and comfort . Stoicism is not gloom and doom . Stoics can enjoy life , just seriously . The writings help the reader to understand how to concern oneself with what one is rather than what one possesses . Based on the teachings of Zeno , the Semitic Cypriot , it counsels you to be free of slavery to passions , to be self-reliant , and to control your goals , aversions , judgements , and desires.Part 1 of the book ( the first third ) explains the life of Aurelius , Roman history , and the history of Greek Philosophy and the Stoics . Forstater also very briefly compares Aurelius ' writing to those of Asian , Newtonian , and Hassidic philosophers . Part 2 , in eight chaptered themes , presents segments of Aurelius 's spiritual exercises ( from his Ta Eis Heauton , which was first published in the 16th Century ) . Unfortunately , Aurelius 's son did not learn any of the lessons . The book is best read like olive oil ; dip into it periodically for sustenance .	1
Anyone who saw the movie & quot ; Gangs of New York & quot ; will recall the scenes of the draft riots taking place . Of course , in the movie the riots were just a small part of the plot , and you really did n't get the full horror of them , or the human toll they took on the City 's inhabitants . This excellent book gives the reader the & quot ; up close and personal & quot ; view of the Draft Roits , by focusing on the lives of several people caught up in them in one way or another . The writing is profoundly moving , and every scene is poignant , particularly the ones that occur in Ireland during the Great Famine . The characters are all finely drawn , and the research that went into this book is clearly evident on every page . It 's a very good way to get your American history lesson about the Riots while absorbing a very human drama of strife and tragedy . This is a book I highly recommend !	1
Welcome to Kevin Baker 's New York . By 1863 the great metropolis had grown into a cruelly concentrated reflection of the greater nation , offering countless lives the tantalizing prospect of a lift from danger to hope , squalor to prosperity , and slavery to freedom . But 1863 was a singular time in the city 's life , as in the country 's , a time when the fragile fabric of civilization fell victim to a reckless , violent drive for freedom and survival.It 's evident that Kevin Baker has a complicated relationship with New York . His main characters , by turns noble , desperate , resourceful , feckless , and downright evil , all share a seminal drive for survival that propel them through impossible traumas and betrayals . From Ruth , the Irish peasant girl who runs from starvation in her homeland and washes up on American shores , to her frightening co-hort and erstwhile mate Dangerous Johnny Dolan , to her great love the ex-slave Billy Dove , her sister-inlaw Deirdre , and the cynical journalist Herbert Willis Robinson , each soul has a relationship with the city that either saves or destroys . And in New York , survival is not always the province of the good.Yet through this scrim of ruthlessness the author 's affection for the city still shines through . His style of writing , though often subdued and painful , somehow gives voice to the intense possibility of the place . The crucible for his characters ' lives , the draft riots of 1863 , crack New York wide open and unleash a torrent of horrific violence . Yet by novel 's end , despite some of the tragic and unresolved circumstances of the main characters , there 's a sense of purging and redemption . The war , the riots , and all the hardships that came before all teach something about the need to strive for good.Historically Baker seems on firm ground with his subject matter , though a lay person might wonder about the author 's take on race and repression . In particular , to an uninformed mind the development of the relationship between Billy Dove , the ex-slave , and Ruth , the Irish refugee with a scary and violent boyfriend , seems florid and far-fetched , a bit like & quot ; Mandingo & quot ; written as Harlequin romance . During these passages Baker loses control , falling back on a style less assured and honest than that displayed througout the rest of the book . It 's an uncomfortable passage to read -- a little embarassing , like a wrong note passed off as a right one in an otherwise flawless concerto.Some of the book 's peripheral stories ( i.e . those outside the city 's vise ) are gripping . Ruth 's almost random flight from her starving family 's home , her journey through the hell of Ireland 's starving countryside , the harrowing journey across the Atlantic in a typhus infested ship with the psychotic , near dead Johnny Dolan -- these are some of the most powerful passages in the whole work . This reader has never come in such intimate contact with the carnage and horror of that time . Billy Dove 's escape up the East Coast on a makeshift sailboat , pursued by slave traders and sharks , also show Baker at his page-turning best.This book is a labor of love , and love is a complicated thing . Baker brings to it effective writerly instincts , a strong sense of character , and an clear desire to make history live . If it 's a long book , it needs to be so . Baker has much to say , and he says it well , leaving the reader enriched , informed , and thoroughly entertained .	1
No , it wo n't be Angela 's Ashes ( though Malachy does tell the story of carrying the ashes back to Limerick in a defective airplane ) . The author is Frank McCourt 's brother and shares with him the Irish ability to tell a good story.I have n't read his earlier book , A Monk Swimming , but this one can stand alone . In it , he wrestles with his alcoholism , finds the love of his life , tries to carve out a career as an actor , confronting his dreadful childhood and gives his opinions on American political failures of the past forty years . Somehow he melds all that together into a biography that holds your attention.Readers might also be interested in A Drinking Life by Pete Hamill .	1
This superb book has a wide variety of easy and delicious Mediterranean recipes ranging from the simple to the extremely complex . All , however , are wonderful !	1
Lisa Scottoline tells an excellent tale , just edgy enough to keep you guessing . I am a new fan of this talented author .	1
I HAD GOT UPSET WHEN , THE BOOK DID N'T COME RIGHT AWAY.-IT CAME TODAY,1/5/13 AND I 'M VERY HAPPY THAT IT GOT HERE-IT WAS PACKAGED VERY GOOD.IT WAS IN A THICK ENVELOPE.SO I 'M VERY HAPPY THAT I GOT IT-NEEDED A BOOK TO READ SO CAME AT RIGHT TIME.THANKS	1
I bought this book for $ 2 at a close-out shop and did n't know what to expect . I know it 's going to make me sound sexist but I usually am leery of women authors for two reasons . 1 ) They tend to lean more toward romance than the actual plot of the book - even if it 's a mystery . 2 ) They tend to rely heavily on what I call `` Oh , Come on ! `` s That is plot lines where just to heighten suspense something so ridiculous happens that would never happen in real life . I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.In MOMENT OF TRUTH , the first book I 've read by Scottoline , she does have an element of romance but it is by no means the driving force of the story . She also does have some seemingly unrealistic actions but these are performed by characters who would n't necessarily know any better.I had thought I had figured it out by about page 20 . I was n't far off but there was more to the story and I was glad for that . I will certainly be looking for more books by Ms. Scottoline.If you like a good mystery/suspense with a heroin who is n't perfect but is n't so stupid you ca n't stand it then give this book a try .	1
As I watched the results from the 1997 General Election from the sidelines of America ( remembering that ten years prior I had been in the thick of things , on the floor of a count and being shown on BBC intently staring at the bank teller drafted to count the box in which I had an interest ) , I was variously amazed , pleased , saddened , and in the end , pleasantly surprised at the good humour of John Major , who said very simply , 'Okay , we lost . 'I met John Major first when he was a rising parliamentary star recruited to come to the constituency of the backbencher for whom I worked . He came to give a pep talk to the local Conservatives on a local radio programme ; this constituency ( Basildon ) was considered a dead loss , so much so that the PM and various other Cabinet names would n't waste their time making a stop -- but John Major came , and , we won.Major has put together an interesting account of his time in office . Thankfully he concentrates on his political career ( not spending hundreds of pages giving us the sort of childhood information that rarely adds value to a political autobiography ) , starting with his first victory coming to the House of Commons in 1979 ( Margaret Thatcher 's first victory as leader ) and culminating with the 1997 electoral defeat , which he took with relatively good grace and rather few recriminations . And , whereas many political figures spend a large part of their memoirs in a 'If I were still there ' mode , Major only devotes a few pages to the follow-up and future ( in a five-page chapter entitled Aftermath ) preferring not to speculate on irrelevant imponderables , and avoiding the problem of which he was most critical in his predecessor -- that being of not wanting to let go.It was no secret that one of the things the press and public eagerly sought in this book was Major 's opinions on the continued attempts by Thatcher to exert an influence in leadership . His rocky relationship with the former prime minister has many examples through the text , some explicit and some subtle ( such as the caption from a photo taken at the 1990 Conservative Party Conference , which reads 'Still on good terms with Margaret following the announcement of our entry into the ERM . ' ) .In general , this is a well-written book , and John Major 's tenure of office is rather more interesting than popular memory or the press would have one believe , perhaps understandable due to following a person of such flash and sparkle as Thatcher -- who could compete with that ? Major did in many ways , and , as his autobiography shows , he won in many ways , and when he lost , he was a gentleman .	1
Richard Bausch has always been better known for his short fiction than for his novels , and this hefty compilation of his stories demonstrates why . Bausch is a master at showing vulnerable moments , the points at which marriages , familial relationships , and psyches break down . He condenses entire lives into a few telling scenes . The awkwardness with which his protagonists approach relationships makes them endearingly fallible , with their missteps costing them in ways they never anticipate . Bausch is so skilled at evoking the reality of interpersonal encounters that one always gets the feeling that these solidly believable characters survive beyond the last line of their individual tales.These forty-two stories are not meant to be read as a marathon , for to do so would be overwhelming . The recurrent motifs of personal blunders , regrets , and foundering relationships can wear on a reader if taken all at once . This collection is best read in chunks separated by other works - a novel , maybe , or stories by other authors . With this kind of space between readings , almost every story is a gem . & quot ; Nobody in Hollywood & quot ; tells of the ruined loves of two brothers and the ironic twist that unites them . & quot ; Someone to Watch Over Me & quot ; details what is perhaps the final night of a marriage , at an outrageously expensive restaurant that reveals the unbridgeable rift between Ted and Marlee . & quot ; Ancient History & quot ; subtly exposes the depth of emotion a teenage boy feels as he , his mother , and his aunt celebrate their first Christmas without his father . & quot ; Contrition & quot ; tells of the obsession an ex-con has with an old photograph of his father and the idyllic moment it captured . In one of the rare stories from a female point-of-view , & quot ; Guatemala , & quot ; Bausch excels at exposing the raw undercurrents that run in a family of women . Bausch is at his best when he delves deeply into family dynamics , especially between protagonists and their parents.This collection is truly a treat for Bausch fans . It makes a great gift for readers of contemporary literature .	1

Russell Banks has the uncanny ability get into the skin of every character he writes , whether a Haitian immigrant , a troubled teenage boy or a 50ish woman . Very few male authors can capture a woman 's essence so believably as Banks has Hannah Musgrave Sundiata's.I loved this book from start to finish . Although Hannah was not a woman who was easy to admire , Banks makes her actions completly understandable . Her many admirable qualities , wanting justice for the world , needing to be a savior to the oppressed were offset by her tragic inability to transfer that passion to those closest to her.Banks takes us back to her earliest childhood memories of a life as the only child of educated and affluent parents and her eventual estrangement from them . Hannah hops from cause to cause , adventure to adventure , in a futile quest to save the world . Hannah finds most fulfillment in the establishment of a Chimpanzee sanctuary in Liberia . Banks ' description of her relationship to her `` Dreamers '' is both touching and heartbreaking.The backdrop provides a closeup look at the history of west Africa and the ugly legacy of colonialism and foreign intervention . Banks masterfully weaves the fictional Hannah into the history of the anti-war movement of the 60 's and eventually to the chaotic and violent events of Liberia in later years.This was truly an outstanding book and one that will stay with me for many yars .	1
This book is a delightful mix of food writing , recipe book , travelogue , Americana , and good literature . It is light , fluffy and fun , and reading it might just change your life , if you let it.Le Draoulec has a love of small-town America that gives this delightful book the flavor of a Charles Kurault essay . She spent several weeks crossing the United States with two simple rules -- stay off the big freeways and look for great pie . To add to the fun , she took a girlfriend , someone who had explored Australia but never small-town America . The two set off into the unknown , and quickly give themselves over to this delightful adventure . ( & quot ; We tossed our running shoes in the trunk , and that 's where they stayed for the next three weeks. & quot ; ) As a lover of pie , a baker of pie , as someone who often takes trips on the small roads and who loves to stop at non-chain restaurants , I loved the idea . Le Draoulec delivers . This book is as sweet , wholesome and gently spicy as a good homemade apple pie.But wait ... did I mention the recipes ? She did n't just find pie , she came back with recipes ! I have tried just a few , and each so far has been great.Underlying all this great material is the fact that Pascale Le Draoulec can write . She has a wonderfully light touch with langauge -- never awkward . Her literary references land as fun , mind-expanding , rather than reminder 's of the author 's education.And , yes , reading a book with this much love in it can change your life . I am more likely now to go ahead and order dessert when I see pie on the menu , and I am more likely to stop in a small , independent restaurant where I might find pie . Just last week , I got to tell an Austin chef how good her pie is . She glowed . My husband just sat back , smiled , and watched the two of us share our passion for pie . As soon as you start talking pie with someone , you 're not strangers anymore .	1

This book , though dated now , chronicles the re-emergence of women 's tennis as one of the world 's most popular , most intriguing and most marketable sports.For the better part of the 1990s , all we heard from tennis aficionados was how the sport was dead in the USA , how the dominance of Steffi Graf & Monica Seles failed to raise the sport 's profile a la Martina & Chris and how the women 's game pailed miserably in comparison to what was a bustling men 's game ( you still had Sampras , Agassi , Becker , Moya , Bruguera , Courier , Chang , Washington , Stich , Henman and Rafter doing wonders for the sport 's popularity ) .BUT , along comes a new , different and exciting generation of young pony-tailed , bleached-blond and beaded wonders who were as eye-catching in appearance as their game 's were revolutionary , aggressive and athletic.This book attempts to capture the essence of what Martina Hingis , the Williams sisters and Anna Kournikova brought to a table that already included notable top players like Lindsay Davenport and Mary Pierce.You 'll get a refreshing behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of the women 's locker room.You 've got the smug , borderline arrogant Hingis , the world No . 1 that everyone respects but nobody really likes off court.You 've got the Hingis-foil Williams sisters who could n't be more different : African-American , large , strong and coming up from the hood to wreck havoc on the lily white , privileged tennis establishment.Then you 've got the sex-kitten , Lolita type in Anna Kournikova -- a celebral player with good hands to match that gets more credit for the skimpy outfits and goldie locks , girly girly appeal that sent pre-pubescent kids & dirty old men into a frenzy a like.All four players were immensely talented and all contributed to the rivalries that gave rise to the pro women 's tennis circuit heading into the new millennium.This book specifically will look at the 2000 women 's tennis season , so it 'll focus on Venus Williams ' ascent to becoming the best player in the world with wins at Wimbledon , the U.S. Open and the Olympics.However , this book easily could 've been used on a broader scale to examine women 's tennis : 1997-2001.That 's what I 'd consider the golden age of the sport 's re-emergence in popularity . Hingis , the Williamses , Kournikova , Capriati , Davenport and Pierce were at their best and you literally did n't know who 'd win a tournament when all were present.In hindsight , this era is definitely in stark contrast to the present : none of the top players are healthy at the same time & you ca n't get all of them into the same tournament to save your life.This book will make you miss the 1997-2001 era ... the Henins , Clijsters , Sharapovas and other Russian `` Ovas '' lack personality if you ask me.But back to the book ... The main criticism , and it 's a small one , you do n't necessarily get the `` head to head '' feeling of why the players disliked each other or for that matter any sense of unifying quality where a Martina , Serena , Venus and Anna can all take credit for raising the game 's profile.Cat fights , sex appeal and power games were what this generation brought to the table , but that 's an inference.The behind the scenes banter among the world 's best players is what this book delivers .	1
I 've read a lot of different history books , and I would say this is my favorite . This book truly brought to life this huge span of American history for me . I learned a lot about the complex relationships between the original immigrants to America , Canada , the French , the native Americans , and Britain . It opened my eyes to the various legal documents that established our country as well as the balancing act between the Republicans and Federalists of early America . It helped me understand what an amazing achievement it was to traverse into the original North American wilderness and tame it .	1

This work by the author of Chocolat , which I thoroughly enjoyed and was my impetus for picking up this book , brings several similar themes here . Among them are life in a small town , family relations , and the role of a good bright woman who is an outsider ( in this story , a local who is returning after time in the big city and so has lost much of her insider status ) . After having lived in Paris with her now deceased mother , Mado returns to the French island of her birth , small enough to harbor two communities that are fierce rivals . The human focus is largely Mado 's relationships with her family and the neighbors as well as the business leader of the rival community , Brismand , who owns its hotel . Also deeply involved is another outsider , Flynn , who is light-hearted and extremely mysterious . When Mado 's community , Les Salants , is threatened by developments in rival La Houssiniere , Flynn leads them in response . Sort of . The citizens of Les Salants rally , but Flynn 's role becomes murky . The relations of the people are foremost here , and nature , personal histories , community rivalry , and religion ( superstition ? ) play roles also in how the characters relate . Harris ' writing is vivid in both the images and feelings she elicits , seemingly effortlessly . Mado is a rich and deep character , complex , real , and enjoyable . The events ring lifelike and make for a very pleasurable read in Harris ' gentle and capable hand . Read it . You 'll be glad you did .	1
This completes my reading of every burglar book I own , so I ca n't wait to get the latest release.Vintage Bernie , he 's charming , the dialogue between him and Carolyn is always witty . The story is fun and twists around enough to keep me guessing . I love how Block uses setting as a character as much as how he develops his characters . I continue to wish these books would be made into a short-run TV series . It would be a hundred times more entertaining than what 's out there now.I love how the bad guys lose in this book !	1
I really enjoy this series . In the fiction market it 's rare to find even 1 book that dares to step outside the usually well-defined boundaries of 'the usual ' and when you do find such a rarity , it almost always misses its mark . The Keller mysteries not only step outside the usual boundaries and hits the mark but it does so with aplomb . They are a delicious telling of what it would probably be like from the hitman 's point of view . Added to this is the fact that Keller simply is n't that bad of a guy . He just has an unusual job that he happens to be very good at .	1
I wo n't review the plot as others already have done so . I 'm not sure why this book got such bad reviews because I really liked it . I picked this one up by mistake and was glad I did . Yes , there were a lot of secondary characters but I found them by and large interesting . I liked the fact that the book was n't all about one hero and one heroine but a variety of others and opens up the possibility of more books in the series .	1
When two abandoned river barges catch fire , killing two squatters , the signs point to arson . Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and sidekick Detective Investigator Annie Cabbot realize that their plans for getting away with their current love interests are shot -- they 'll be working overtime to track down the firebug -- unless the fires were set for a reason more sinister than simply to see things burn . Suspicion first turns to the boyfriend of one of the victims -- conveniently absent during the fire . But the young man does n't feel right to Banks . Could it be the girl 's step-father -- a man suspected of sexually abusing the girl ? A second fire two nights later gives Banks and Cabbot another line to pursue -- one that centers around art forgery . Because it is just possible that someone is cleaning up a mess -- or a criminal network that has turned on him . Fortunately , Cabbot 's boyfriend is an art professional . Unfortunately , Banks does n't like the handsome boyfriend and the result is friction between two cops who have to work together closely.Author Peter Robinson does a fine job developing characters and story simultaneously . Banks , with his recently ended marriage , his unsuccessful affair with Cabbot , and his current go-nowhere relationship with an out-of-town cop , remains sympathetic as he tries to track down the criminal -- and to keep his feelings toward Cabbot 's lover from veering into jealousy . Detours into the point of view of the young man initially suspected of arson add to the story 's atmosphere.I thought that the solution became a bit too obvious a bit too soon -- and some of Banks ' decisions seemed irrational , but overall , PLAYING WITH FIRE was an engrossing and enjoyable read .	1
D C I banks is always worth a read .this time they wander around a bit before they get to the crux of the matter . they do tend to get some amaing characters and the villian is so clever he very nearly gets away with it .A very good read although some of the more recent books i have liked better .	1
I 've been a fan of this series for a long time . Which means I now hold my breath when the newest Inspector Banks novel is published , fearing that this one may mark the start of a decline . The good news is , I was able to release that breath with relief.Robinson just keeps on writing wonderful novels , managing to deliver police procedurals within the meaning of the Act - to borrow a Brit phrase - while pushing the envelope and managing to make us guess about more than whodunit.In this book Banks and his team are investigating some grisly fire deaths - and they are up against a very clever fiend indeed . The villain is well-drawn , as are most of the characters Robinson puts in our path as the story rocks along . I could n't put it down , and I ca n't wait for the next Banks book !	1
The Inspector Banks books by Peter Robinson are really good . I like the continuity of characters , They seem like real people with problems like the real world . I intend to get the whole series . Have most now on my Kindle .	1
Quick and easy read . Will make you smile , chuckle and , if you are a woman of a certain age , you will relate . I believe it is always good to find the humor in every situation . It makes life more enjoyable .	1
Engaging tale set in 1932 with one of the major characters ( Robert ) finding a murdered man in the old ice box . Ms Churchill does a wonderful job of interweaving the history of the time to create a town any of our grandparents or great grandparents might have lived in.While SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME is an entertaining book with interesting characters , well developed plot and an unpredictable ending . I 'm sure after reading this you 'll join me in waiting for the next addition to this refreshing series .	1

Strengths:1 ) `` Amichean bonding '' ( becoming the alpha member of your pack ) seem absolutely right and very valuable.2 ) Fennell advances a few simple-to-implement ideas about the right way to become the aphla member . She also communicates the theory of becoming an alpha that allows you to devise ways yourself.3 ) The book is effective in communicating her points , working on an intellectual level through clarity and repetition and on an emotional level . It 's not a book you will dismiss . Insofar as it teaches a few simple valuable lessons , it 's worth the price and the time.4 ) Fennell takes a humane and ethical approach to our relationship with dogs . The book borders on inspirational.Weaknesses:1 ) Stripped on the andecdotes ( which become a bit repetitive ) the book could be condenses to 25 pages . The 30-day manual repeats some material verbatim from the first part of the book.2 ) I am sceptical that Fennell 's apprach is the key to solving as wide a range of behavior problems as she suggests . Surely there moust be oter types of canine dysfunctionalities than a dog 's thinking it 's the alpha.3 ) Her andectodal approach strikes me as misleading because she never mentions her failures ( which I am sure must sometimes occur ) .4 ) She 's weak on science . As anotrher reviewer mentioned , Fennell seems to have picked up her knowlege of wolves from a few video tapes and some readings . At a minimum , she does not display great breatth or depth of learning.5 ) Some of her methods , for example teaching dogs to stay and heel , seem to me simply a matter of operant conditioning : rewarding with treats good behavior . There 's noting to new here.Finally , I have not read widely in the field . Therefore I can not comment on the book 's originality . My `` Idiot 's Guide , '' for example , contained some of the same core advice , like eating before your dog . So you may already know what she has to say . As a layperson , I vaguely knew it , but still got a good deal out of the book .	1
I enjoyed this book because of the way it was written , explaining the favorite scenes and places and included the farmland and special things about their experiences and how those special memories would pass from one child to the next one that was born . It was very gentle and very sweet , and especially positive for the young child .	1
William Joyce 's books topped the list of family favorites when my boys were smaller . Even as they have passed the & quot ; 4-8 years & quot ; level suggested , this remains a seasonal favorite of my now 10 and 14 year olds . The story is utterly charming and quirky at once . Art and his friend Spaulding discover a mystery box in the back yard one day , which propels them on an adventure that grudgingly includes Art 's little sister Esther.Typical of Joyce 's & quot ; Dali-esque & quot ; illustration , the North Pole takes on a surreal appearance , and the story takes a wild turn , with a neat little surprise in the epilogue . Joyce never fails to delight his readers with his wry view of life . This book is a wonderful foil for the more traditional holiday reads for kids , and one the grown ups can enjoy fully as well .	1
The illustrations are wonderful and draw the reader in to the delightful story/poem about berries . The rhyming is fun and we love exploring the many details in the illustrations.Our son still enjoys it though he is much older now .	1
I read this book when I was in 6th grade ... ..it started my long journey of loving books . The fantasy and imagination is wonderful for children and I would recommend it for parents reading bedtime stories or children ready to read on their own . I still have fond memories of this lovely story and have given it as a gift as an adult to many children who also loved it !	1
At 44 , having read literally thousands of books in my life ( probably 10 's of thousands ) this book still stands out as one of the sweetest , imaginative stories ever . Still love the creativity and the focus on using your imagination - great stuff ! Well done , Julie - Well done !	1
I enjoyed this story about how a young girl begins to find a way to heal when learning about the difficulties other folks overcome in their lives .	1
Insightful and wonderfully crafted , this fine story is not to be missed . I tried a `` sample '' and am so very glad that I did , as it led me to buy and savor this gem . I look forward to reading more by this very talented and deserving Newberry Award winner !	1
Beauty is the type of classic that deserves a permanent place on the bookshelf . Robin McKinley takes the classic fairy tale and really brings it to life . What you get here is a truly enchanting tale , full of magic , drama , and romance.We start with Beauty as a child , with her family in the city , following them from success to ruin , to a new life in a remote village . The land around them is full of magic . The villagers avoid the enchanted wood , and everything from it . Beauty 's father gets called back into the city for some business . It is on the return from this village that he has the fateful encounter with the Beast in that enchanted wood.If fairy tales retold is a genre , this book defines the genre . A must read for anyone that enjoys a simple , classic romance , with a touch of magic .	1
Bubblebathbooks.net ( aka Bubby and Sissy ) review of Beauty by Robin Mckinley . We really enjoyed this lovely retelling of the classic , romantic , magical tale of Beauty and the Beast . Sissy likes the concept of Beauty as a gangly , awkward girl who is more interested in horses and books than boys or embroidery . Bubby says that Robin McKinley has a way with words . It 's almost as if she spins a web around the reader , drawing them right into the world she is creating . Both also like the fact that in this retelling the characters in Beauty 's family are fleshed out a little bit and have their own side stories going on . To read our full review go to bubblebathbooks.net	1
This is my favorite book , hands down . I read it at least once a month , and I get something new every time . Beautiful , classic writing .	1
I have a weak spot for retellings of classic fairytales , and this book is one of the best . It may start slow for some - Beauty does n't even go to the castle until a hundred pages in - but it is well worth the wait . This story is beautifully imagined with enough of the classic elements to remind me why I love this fairytale , and plenty of changes to keep me interested .	1
I thought it was alright - great writing and everything , the story was pretty good BUT The beast was n't a very well'developed charachter , and it was n't something new , no twists nothing.But it kept me interested I guess , so it was pretty good	1
Ever since I first saw the Disney movie `` Beauty and the Beast , '' I fell in love with it . To this day , it is still my favorite Disney movie as well as one of my favorite fairy tales . `` Beauty '' is a well-crafted re-telling , one that made me fall in love with the story all over again.The book follows the original story of `` Beauty and the Beast '' very closely ; so unfortunately , we do n't have our friends Lumiere and Mrs. Potts providing commentary . Beauty and her family are very well to do until her father 's ships are lost at sea , and with it , their fortune . They are forced to move to a small country village and begin a new life on the edge of an enchanted forest . One day , her father gets lost in the woods and encounters the hospitable Beast , whom he angers by picking a rose for Beauty . He is told that he has a month to decide whether he will remain with the Beast and die , or send one of his daughters in his place . Of course , we all know that Beauty talks him into letting her go ... and so on and so forth.While I really enjoyed this book , it was a bit repetitive with the constant message of `` beauty is only skin-deep ... what really matters is what 's on the inside ... '' which is of course the message of the whole story in the first place . However , it is forced down your throat a bit much ; Beauty , in the first place , is not beautiful at all . The Beast is , after all , a beast , and Beauty refuses to wear any of extravagant dresses in her wardrobe , preferring simpler ones instead . The characters are all a little bit flat ; there is no villain or really any troublesome character at all . Even the Beast is a perfect gentleman , one aspect I was a little bit disappointed at . Beauty has no chance to `` tame '' him , as was her mission in the first place , because he is already `` tamer '' than most guys I know . All of her family and friends are sweet and good-natured , and it would 've been nice to have had a little bit more antagonism . The beginning is also quite slow , a lot of `` My family did this , and this , and this ... then I did this , and this , and this ... and here 's a description of a flower , oh why do n't I describe all the flowers ... and this is what the dark , enchanted forest is like , I know I 've already told you about it quite a few times ... '' All in all , though , I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it . ( I definitely prefer it to McKinley 's `` Rose Daughter '' , another adaptation of Beauty and the Beast ) It is an enjoyable re-telling of my favorite fairytale . 4 1/2 stars.KelliFuture Star	1
helped build the anticipation of watching our own caterpillars develop into butterflies ! The author writes the process step by step in a nice little story kids can identify with .	1
This book was good prep for having livecaterpillars in the room . Showed the tages and told what was happening , at an elementary level .	1
This book 's lovely illustrations and cute story has captivated my child . It 's one of the few books she comes to me and asks me to read.It 's the sequel to `` If you give a mouse a cookie '' and it 's full of nonsense and fun . She is three years old and has had a setback in her development but this is something she can understand and enjoy.A good book to read aloud and comes highly recommended by me . : )	1
I like this series because they are easy to read and remember , so it is n't long before the children think they can read it to themselves . The book was in very good condition . You had to look closely to tell it was used .	1
This is our second encounter with Jamie Lee Curtis as an author and like the first ( Where do Balloons Go ? ) they loved it ! In this book we join a little girl as she takes a whirlwind tour of 13 different emotions , each told in that same sing-song rhyme that appears to be a staple of Curtis ' writing . The rhymes are brought to life with the same riot of color illustrations that really seem to appeal to young readers ! The kids especially liked how the colors used changed with the moods while maintaining their vivid shades ( there is nothing gloomy or lackluster about this book ) . At the very end , there is a large picture of the girl in the story with a set of wheels that the kids can turn to see a selection of moods which was quite humorous and led to much discussion between the kids about how they were feeling right then and what types of things that have happened before made them feel angry or silly ... or whatever ... so it was a light , fun read , but also a good way to get more in depth discussion of moods , how they just happen sometimes and what types of activities/events make you feel certain ways ... you know ... like what makes you angry or sad ... what makes you happy or what do you do when you just feeling silly or blue ? I think Today I Feel Silly is best as a read aloud book ... and the larger the group of kids you 're reading to the more interesting the conversation after can get ! I 'd recommend this in a heart beat ! We loved it !	1
My own children love this book , as do my kindergarten students . The pictures are sweet and funny and I love how students make predictions about what is going to happen next . I have several of Laura Numeroff 's books , but this one is my favorite . '	1
My favorite childhood book isGoodnight Moon , and just today I finally read its companion book , My World . I thought it was adorable and I am excited to get it for my son.This book has a different rhythmic scheme than Goodnight Moon , but I feel that it is equally poetic and comforting . It is fun to see the little bunny in settings other than the `` great green room '' and with his parents in different rooms in their house.Like in Goodnight Moon , Clement Hurd 's illustrations alternate between color and black and white , which I think is a great touch.Although not as classic as Goodnight Moon , this book is a wonderful one to share with your children .	1
My favorite childrens poetry book Ingenious and fun drawings . I miss Shel Silverstein but am so grateful he left behind this and other books . The Giving Tree is also one of my favorite books .	1
Good old Shel Silverstein ! Great sense of humor , has silly poems and deep ones as well . Easy for children to read as well	1
The Piggle Wiggle books are timeless and remain absolutely wonderful reading for children . I like them because Mrs. Piggle Wiggle is such a charming character and the books are full of quirky fun but also because these books offer kids the kind of lessons that are no longer available in school and too often neglected at home . These books teach decency , kindness and morality but they do it as such a frolic that the kids do n't know they are learning ... they are simply enjoying a great story . I have given the box set to every parent I know !	1
I bought this book for my grandaughter . I had read these books when I was young and it was very nice to have them all together in one book .	1
I have loved Mrs. Piggle Wiggle since grade school and searched for this book to give as a gift this Christmas . It might seem silly and simplistic to some ; but the entertainment and joy the book brings is worth the read . It can also give some insight into alternate disciplining of children ! Watch out kids ! Mrs . Piggle Wiggle take a different approach to helping parents with children in need of direction ... she let 's the kids realize that what they are doing is wrong and has consequences - all without causing them harm..maybe just a bit of discomfort !	1
I read my copies of Mrs. Piggle Wiggle books to shreds as a child , and I still love to reread the stories today . The books contain valuable lessons for children ; and though some are more magical and fun than others , all are well done with regards to capturing children 's attention in a unique manner and making them want to improve themselves by fixing their own problems . Mrs. Piggle Wiggle is truly a brilliant and clever teacher , using extremely creative teaching techniques in presenting values , morals , and good habits for children to emulate , develop , and strive for . This book , though not particularly subtle as far as the lessons it tries to impart , is fantastic with regards to children learning something from their storybooks.J.H . Sweet , author of The Fairy Chronicles	1
The language and pictures are beautiful and stunning , in typical Sendak style . Sendak almost always takes a reader by surprise . His themes are not comfortable ones , particularly for parents . The story and the way its told can be frightening for some children as scenes conjure images that hit on some primal fears and discomforts . I suspect people will either love or dislike this book , but I 'm one who loves it but can equally understand why others might not . So , if you can , take a look at it prior to buying and certainly before you read it to younger children.That aside , Where the Wild Things Are has become a classic in children 's literature for good reason . It is a story about a boy who acts out , a boy who becomes a `` wild thing '' himself . His transformation from beast to boy and back is a gradual and wonderful part of the picture book , but in no way tries to deny that the `` wild thing '' aspect exists . For some it might not be a comfortable tale , but it is one that highlights feelings that young children may have and discusses them in a format they can identify with.Happy reading !	1
My kids loved this story when they were little . Bought this copy for a family member 's son who is something of a & # 34 ; wild thing. & # 34 ; Hope they like it .	1
I read this book many years ago when I was a child . It 's one of the very few 'childhood ' books I 've kept with me till this day . Being quite a mischevious child who loved to dream and make-believe , I could really relate to this book through my childhood years.Now I 've passed on my copy to my daughter who loves Max and the Wild Things as much as I used to . At times , she would become Max while dad and mom the Wild Things .	1
Everyone I know has either read this book or has heard great things about it . In my opinion it is one of the best books to let your imagination run free . It describes this whole new place and you ca n't help but get lost in it too . You want to join Max on this adventure and you want to make your own . It 's almost like an elaborate twist on the classic fort made out of pillow and blankets .	1
I bought this as we used to look at the technique in art school . When i had to buy few kids books for one room I 'm staging this brought back memories and looks great on the kids table ... Maurice Sendak a great illustrator !	1
My oldest son , now 15 , still knows the words by heart . My four-year-old daughter is learning them . Max is the not-so-bad monster in every little one ; the one who is brave and wild and tender and imaginative all at once . He is the King of all wild things -- and they love him , but not quite as much as his mother ( who could n't bring herself to REALLY send him to bed without anything to eat at all ) .Enough with the PC rants about this book . Another reviewer said he was & quot ; snotty & quot ; and rude . Give me a break-what child is n't just a tiny bit too lippy on some days . It 's life . The thing about the book is that while Max may be a little & quot ; snotty , & quot ; he 's imaginative , alive , and still knows that even after being punished , his mother loves him 'best of all . 'The illustrations are beautiful . The story is terrific . And I 'm glad to say it was the perfect snuggle-at-bedtime book for every one of my children.And I have the words retained in memory forever . I 'll someday chant them to my grandchildren .	1
Although the colors wo n't jump out at you , the illustrations and storyline are captivating . I can read this book the whole way through and discuss the pictures and happenings without my little ones budging for a second . A good buy .	1
What other book can capture a young reader 's mind like this ? Poo poo on the movie ... .share the book with a child and let their imagination run free ! fantastic and imaginative !	1
When Max is sent to bed without any supper because he is acting like a monster , his imagination really takes off . This book shows how an angry child can channel his emotions into imagination . Max magically transforms his room into a jungle , an ocean and an island where he becomes the king of the wild things , and has quite an adventure . Max does realize that at the end of the day , there is no place like home.This is a classic written in 1963 by Maurice Sendak . The New York Times claimed that Maurice Sendak was & quot ; one of the most powerful men in the US & quot ; because he was able to help shape the fantasies of millions of children . The illustrations in this book are startling and amazing . This would be a great book even if it did n't have any words , the pictures alone are great . This book was the winner of the Caladecott Medal for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the year.This is a great story that both adults and children will enjoy alike . But I would recommend it for kids ages 6 and under . My son is always asking to read this book at bed time .	1
You just can hardly beat mad Max 's adventures in the wild . Just scary enough and with the most satisfying ending - Mom loves him after all !	1
Little Kids can appreciate this book just as much for the pictures as they can for the story 's meaning as to how Max can just as much fantasize to make the most of his punishment as he can still learn his lesson as a result of his confinement	1
I loved this for my kids ( who does not like Sendak ? ) & i now I can also get it for my grand nephew	1
I love this story ! ! so i got this for each one of my nieces and nephews . i love that it comes with a cd and that it is hard cover . very durable .	1
I read this book to my two year old son for the first time a few years ago . The obvious metaphor , that of the tree being a mother whose son is destined to leave her someday , struck me right off . I was tearing up about halfway through . What mother of any child -- male or female -- does n't secretly dread that far-off event , even while it signals a positive step in the natural order of things ? That 's a universal theme and part of nearly everybody 's life at one time . So maybe it 's a little manipulative on that level.After I was done reading my boy bounced up and went into our back yard to play . In passing he actually stopped and hugged the big old pepper tree ! At that point I realized a new metaphor for this story , and a deeper level of meaning to it that had touched me as well . You see , the tree also represents God . He loves us from the beginning of our lives and nurtures us with wholesome gifts ( represented here by apples and leaves ) and we accept this with joy that gives His love right back . Children have that universally satisfying relationship with God even while they may have no name for it . They are able to simply enjoy the truly important things in a way adults have trouble with.You 'll notice that when the boy gets a little older he spends less and less time with the Tree . His growing up signals the start of worldliness and materialism . He comes back as a teenager and asks for money . Then he comes back and asks for a house , and later a boat . The things of the world never truly satisfy him the way fellowship with the Tree did earlier , but it takes a while to realize this . In the end , he recognizes the truth and comes back to the only source of true love and peace he ever really had , and can accept the simple pleasure of sitting with the Tree once again . In the same way , we get distracted by worldly concerns and materialism as adults and tend to stray from God , only to realize after the best years of our life are spent that we should have spent more of them with Him.God 's selfless , unconditional love for His children ( and the generally ungrateful attitude we throw right back most of the time ) is so poignantly portrayed by this metaphor of the Giving Tree that I think it 's better than any metaphor I 've found in the bible ! In the deepest sense , my tears were in recognition of my own ingratitude and selfishness as contrasted by the love of God . For one small minute , I was able to see the human condition from His perspective and weep for it . That was precious to me , and something I will always have Silverstein to thank for.I can understand the interpretations of The Giving Tree from an environmental perspective and from a feminist perspective as well , and understand why so many people object to it . Truthfully , we do n't really know which of these many messages Shel Silverstein intended , or if he even believed in God or not . But God does work in mysterious ways , and I truly believe He used Shel 's work to send a message of His own to those of us who can receive it.-Andrea , aka Merribelle	1
Shel Silverstein has done it again . This book has a very special message for all of us . It is a great read aloud and students enjoy reading it by themselves . It is a very engaging book as well .	1
A great and yet simple story of a young boy , a `` giving '' tree and unconditional love . But me thinks this tale was meant more for the parents reading it than the kids since I have a feeling the moral goes over their blessed little self-absorbed heads . But I 'm sure than after numerous readings the beautiful message does sink in . A child 's story that touches all ages . Be prepared to tear up the first couple of times you read it and whatever you do - DO N'T read it when you 're pregnant unless you have plenty of Kleenex on hand .	1
I cried when my mother first read this to me as a child . I cried when I read it to my son last month . The boy , who is always a boy from the tree 's perspective ( from childhood to old age ) , never recognizes or appreciates the tree 's unconditional love . He always asks for more as a force of habit . He is n't a bad person . He just never recognizes what he 's doing . The tree always has something to give him , which he consistently fails to appreciate , to the very end . The tree is never bitter . This is just the way nature is . Time strips everything away from us . We ignorantly make the best of it , never realizing what we 've lost . This is a very important book that changed me forever .	1
This book is so touching . I have taught elementary school for 12 years and it never fails to bring chills to me at the end . It is so endearing . I can not understand how anyone would ever give this one star . Buy this one , you wo n't regret it . I do n't know about the cd , I think the book is better read by a parent ( or adult , in person ) to their child .	1
This book is so sweet and touching . It has always made me cry , but more so now that I am a parent . I 've never met anyone that did n't love this book , but that could just be a testament to the kind of company I keep .	1
We discovered this book at my husband 's grandparen'ts house and my daughter ( then 7 ) loved reading it with me . Now she looks for it everytime we visit great grandma 's house . A few poems into reading it with my daughter the first time , I started to remember reading it as a child ( back in the 70s ) . I 'm not a poetry fan , but I like this book - it is fun and the drawings are imaginative and amusing . I bought a copy to give to my caughter for her 9th birthday..	1
Where the Sidewalk Ends was such a special book to megrowing up . I could read that book and just be lost init . Not thinking of the day ahead or bad times . I wasa part of Shel 's world and what a world to be in . Boy'swho sell their bratty sisters , a girl who eats a whale , thegirl who just WILL NOT TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT ! ! ! This bookbrought so much joy to me . I first read this in school likemost of you at our library and really could not put it down.This will forever be a BIG part of my special place to escape.The 70 's brought so much joy to me like being in school andwatching for the first time the little blond boy who lost thered balloon ( remember that ) Marlo Thomas 's FREE TO BE YOU AND ME ! CAPTAIN KANGAROO and those Ping-Pong Balls . How about The MostImportant Person in the World is YOU ! THE BANANA SPLITS ( one bananatwo banana three banana four , the banana splits are knocking at your door ) and who can forget A YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS . I 'm MR. Heat Mys-erhe is Mr . Snow ! How about being 6yrs.old and seeing KISS for the first time . Like the guy with the trench-coat and Derby hat who painted numberson men 's bald heads from Sesame Street . Where the Sidewalk Ends willALWAYS be a part of me . And recommend to all . I will be readingShel 's wonderful poems to my children and hope you too will read them.It 's funny ? I remember writing these poems to my mom who really is a writer . She would be at her typewriter and I would hand her some paperwith Shel 's poems and say they were mine . She knew I had not writtenthese wonderful poems myself , yet she told me she loved them . Anywaybuy Where the Sidewalk Ends . Also recommend A Light in the Atticand Falling Up !	1
My daughter requested this for my grandson for his birthday . I thought it might be too old for him ( 5 ) but when I saw the short poems and stories , I knew he would like it . Now , she will read it to him . Soon , he will read it to himself .	1
My daughter loves this book . She laughs at the poems and has to read them to us . I hope it inspires her to write poetry of her own !	1
My father read this to me as a child . I begged for it every night . He had voices for many of the characters . I still read them with a hint of his voice and with his rhythm . I share them with my students on a regular basis . I just ca n't wait to share them with my own kids . Even better ... I ca n't wait for them to hear their grandpa read them to them . It really just does n't get better .	1
My son loves this book so much . He had already memorized parts of it when he was only two and frequently quoted the book . It 's a very sweet , simple tale about a character who feels like there 's something missing in his life and spends his time in search of the perfect piece to complete him . Once he finds it , he realizes that sometimes you do n't always want what you think you want , and that sometimes the journey is more enjoyable than the destination . Beautiful lessons .	1
What a pleasing read for both the young and the old these Little House books are beginning with & # 8216 ; Little House in the Big Woods. & # 8217 ; Like many wee ones I was introduced to this story by having it read to me both at school and at home . I read these stories to my children , my grandchildren and soon will get to read them to our first great grandchild ... I can not wait ! This first book in the series takes place in the deep woods of Wisconsin and recall times that are long past . I note that some might feel these are & # 8220 ; girl book , & # 8221 ; but that simply is not so . I have met very few males ; small boys for the most part , that did not enjoy these books just as much as their female counterparts.Reading these books as an adult ( I reread the entire series about once every five years now ) is almost as enjoyable as when I first heard them read to me about 65 years ago . A lot has changed in our country and society since the era where these took place and it is good not to forget it . One thing that strikes me about this work and the others that follow is the sheer amount of physical work that had to be accomplished on a daily basis simply to survive . Again , this is good to be reminded of from time to time in my opinion.Overall these are kind and gentle stories though which emphasis , in this case , the family values that Laura & # 8217 ; s family upheld . Now I grant you that these are not the values of everyone ; each and every family , but we do find a consistency throughout all of the author & # 8217 ; s work and you have to admire it.Now this work has not plot . It is a series of short & # 8220 ; events & # 8221 ; which took place when the author was a very small girl . We so have a time line in that the author hangs her stories on the four seasons as they slowly pass . I personally like this sort of thing . The writing at first glance is simple but as you read more and more you realize that you are in the presence of a master story teller ! Love this little book and all those that follow.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
Little House in the Big Woods has always had a special place in my heart . This was the first book that I ever read on my own . Because of this book I now love to read . You will fall in love with Laura and her family . You should read it .	1
I read this entire series ( more than once or twice ! ) as a young girl and saved every book so that I could pass them on to my children . ( Alas , I have all boys ! ) This would be a wonderful gift for any young girl . I would even read them again as an adult .	1
This is a wonderful , imaginative collection of stories and poems for kids . `` Bad Mousie '' and the story about the girl who lived on the flying city were two of my favorites from this collection . The illustrations are marvelous . This was one of my favorite books as a child , and it is strange that it is no longer available . It is such a timeless classic ...	1
Best book for little boys ( and girls ) ever , my son ( now 21 ) loved this book so much we still purchase it for all new to be readers .	1
Let 's start simply and honestly , the same way these tomes approach their subject matter , and say these are the cat 's meow ! Jean Craighead George has penned two ultra-thin volumes on communicating with our best friends and felines , and each is a howling success . The Newberry Medal-winning author does what someone like Elizabeth Marshall Thomas has tried to do in books tens of thousands words and pages longer and could not . Jean , by George , had found the winning ways to teach pet lovers how to chat with their four-footed pals . Her writing is sparse : `` A lick is not a kiss . It is a statement that says you 're a wonderful leader . '' Her advice is refreshing : `` Growling is aggressivetalk . Do n't growl back . Dogs do n't like that . '' As special as her words is the whimiscal use of arkwork : actual color photos of the animated author interacting with illustrations ( by Sue Truesdell ) of equally animated cartoon cats and dogs . ( We just love the one of George on all fours , rubbing heads with a cat ! ) Four paws up !	1
Seven bells have a lot of work to do in this riveting novel , part one of the Abhorsen Trilogy by master storyteller Garth Nix.The bells are named after seven makers of the Charter ( the force that governs every aspect of the Old Kingdom ) and in this story they are carried by Sabriel , daughter of a necromancer of the line of Abhorsen.Sabriel grows up in a boarding school environment , but with a slightly different curriculum than might be expected . Part of her lessons involve learning her father 's trade , venturing into the river of death , either to rescue trapped souls or grant them eternal rest . Of course danger lurks around every corner , as undead corpses known as Hands and supernatural beings known as Free Magic elementals may pop up at any old time , and as you can guess they 're usually up to no good.When her father is trapped by the dark side of the force , Sabriel is forced to take up the Abhorsen reins , sword , bells and whistles , and set off on the quest that is always an essential part of any good adventure story . Accompanied and advised by a white cat with a red collar , whom of course you will realize is no ordinary feline , but a powerful agent of Free Magic under magical restraint , she finds herself in a Royal graveyard , where she revives a young man from his wooden enchantment.The little group eventually locates her father , who is able to give them some background information on the terrible evil they must now face in order to save the world ( blah blah blah ) , and although he 's not in the best of shape he manages to buy them some time to regroup and get reinforcements . The evil one , Kerrigor by name , is on a rampage , and somewhat like the headless horseman , he 's looking for his head as well as the body still attached to it . Sabriel and her friends , and the army , tanks and all , set up a final showdown - winner takes all.This is an action-packed fantasy novel of the highest caliber , which includes all the swashbuckling and evil spirit vanquishing you 'll ever need , plus of course all the bells and whistles.Amanda Richards , July 15 , 2006	1
Since she was a young child , 18-year-old Sabriel has resided outside the walls of the Old Kingdom , and stayed in a boarding school located in Ancelstierre , where magic is forbidden . Thanks to this , Sabriel has little experience with the strange powers of Free Magic . However , during her last semester at Wyverley College the Abhorsen , also known as her Father , turns up missing , and Sabriel knows that it 's up to her to enter the Old Kingdom in an attempt to find him . Soon , Sabriel meets up with two companions , Touchstone , a young Charter Mage , who has been imprisoned by magic for years , and Mogget , an aloof cat . The three friends set off on their journey , and with each step , they are brought closer and closer to a battle that is ready to pit them against the forces of life , and bring the young Sabriel a close-up view of her very own hidden destiny.In this first novel in the ABHORSEN TRILOGY , Garth Nix has created an intrepid , fast-paced fantasy story , that is quite reminiscent of J.R.R . Tolkien 's LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY . Sabriel is a brave , spirited young girl , who is always ready to experience something new ; Touchstone is kind , yet haunted by painful memories of years past ; and Mogget is filled with tons of spirit that shines right through his aloofness . With witty , fast-paced dialogue , he has created something that will become a much-loved classic , in years to come . An absolute must-read.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper	1
A great book ! I had gotten this book for Christmas and I wasreluctant to read it . It looked like a long boring book . I smiled and said thank you , knowing that it might sit on my shelf for a long time . I decided to take it on a trip up north and I was in for a BIG surprise ! I was by the fire and I started to read it trying to get it out of the way . I started it , and it was a little slow at first but it got faster . It turned out to be a book I could n't put down ! Intriguing characters , that are wonderful and believable ! Also , Sabriel was n't always mastering every challenage high above standards . I finished the book and went straight out to Borders ( sorry Amazon ) to buy the second book in the series , Lirael . The main plot constists of a girl whose father , the Abhorsen ( a necromancer who fights the evils of other necromancers ) , has fallen into Death and needs help getting out . Sabriel has to take her father 's place as the Abhorsen , try to save him , and try to save the kingdom . A great book in all !	1
I do n't normally read too much fantasy/sci-fi books unless I 'm familiar with a series or author . When I got Sabriel , though , I knew right away that it was one of those few sci-fi 's that can actually keep me interested the whole way . The plot is very intriguing , and the characters can be both serious and hillarious at the same time . Somehow , Garth Nix has managed to create a magical , yet realistic world filled with suspence , romance , and action . It was this book that inspired me to become a fan of Nix , making him one of my favorite writers of all time .	1
I love this author as well as the series . Not sure on how to review a book without giving spoilers . If you like action packed books and young adult writing this book is for you . I read this when I was around twenty two and loved it . remember this is part of a trilogy , so if you are willing to go through all there , it is completely worth it .	1
If you 've read the plot description -- which is something like & quot ; Sabriel travels to the Old Kingdom to rescue her necromancer father from the Land of the Dead & quot ; -- you might think that this is a pretty junky horror-fantasy novel . Trust me , it 's not ! Yes , it 's got un-dead monsters and things like that , but when you 're into the story you 're totally believing it and you do n't stop for even one moment and say , & quot ; Wow , this is so trashy. & quot ; Instead , the story is very beautiful and believable . Unlike many books , I could really feel the danger of the situations and I even felt afraid for the characters . This book looks long , but it moves very quickly . The unusual mix of technology and magic reminds me of Philip Pullman 's & quot ; The Golden Compass & quot ; , but other than that I do n't see why everyone compares these two books . They 're not similar in any other ways I can think of , but I would say that if you liked The Golden Compass , read Sabriel , and vice versa . I thought TGC was much better in fact , but Sabriel was still great . I really liked Sabriel as a character , and I loved the idea of the necromancer 's bells -- brilliant ! The cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon is beautiful . I hope Garth Nix is planning to write a sequel , or at least another book set in this world -- something like Tamora Pierce 's Wild Magic series , which are a different story but let you know what happened to Alanna . It could be Sabriel 's daughter , a future Abhorsen ? It seems like some things were left undone . They never went back and saved those children , or helped the fishing village . Did they ? Recommended for ages 13- up , especially girls . I am 15 . PS . No , my e-mail address is not varied from Sabriel 's name . I chose it before I read this book .	1
The Chronicles of Narnia : The Signature Edition ( Narnia ) Fantasy with morals . A read for all ages . These classic stories by C.S . Lewis are captivating with battles , journeys to the different lands of Narnia , dragons , dwarfs , talking animals , and other characters you 'll remember well after you 've read them all . Most intriging of all is the hero who is , '' not tame '' .	1
I have bought this set for all three of my kids . It is such a wonderful story . In my opinion I like to read a book before I see the movie . The movies are a little violent at times . My nine year oaks is reading these now . Since out cat is named Aslan he is really enjoying them . Cant lose with this set for a gift either .	1
This set is hands down both my favorite fantasy series and my favorite children 's book series . I 've read them to myself , for my own enjoyment , and I 've read all seven books out loud to my kids . Reading them out loud is a great experience . At the end of a chapter , when I had intended to quit , the kids would beg me to keep reading ! Every one of the kids , from 5 to 15 , were spellbound.I strongly feel , however , that the books should be read in the order they were written , and as Lewis intended them to be read . That is : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ; Prince Caspian ; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ; The Silver Chair ; The Horse and His Boy ; The Magician 's Nephew ; The Last Battle.Many people are only familiar with the first book because of the just-released movie ( which was good , but not great ) . I also found The Voyage of the `` Dawn Treader '' , The Horse and His Boy , and other books in the series to be just as delightful , with equally enchanting characters . There are excerpts from several of the books that I find simply and profoundly unforgettable . And last , but not least , the Christian symbolism is refreshing , and at times deeply moving.Fantastic set . If you have n't read it , hesitate no longer !	1
I love this collector 's edition box set for the quality paper , the charming , but homey , and now colored ! original illustrations , and of course , the well-remembered stories . But I am disturbed by the numbering of the books in Narnia-chronological order instead of publication order - or whatever the order was that I knew as a kid . How can `` The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe '' not be first ? ! The mind boggles . It is on such small landmarks that we steer our little ships of faith , and ... I regret this shakeup . I 'll never know whether it makes any difference to the first-time Narnia reader , but I feel like it must - the author 's increasing sophistication and changing priorities must come through . Argh ! I hate this theft of history !	1
It was interesting , but a little boring . I would request this to my friend . It was a very nice book .	1
This is a great set of books to have in any home . This set is n't done as nicely as some but well worth the price . They are a great read for children and adults . And at this time with the movies coming out a great time to pick them up and find out what is happening next .	1
I love how C.S . Lewis posits the trilemma of Mere Christianity , perhaps C.S . Lewis 's most famous apologetic work , to also support the idea that Narnia exists.Lucy must either be a liar , mad , or telling the truth that Narnia is real in the same way that in Mere Christianity Lewis posits that Jesus must be Lord , liar or lunatic . Clearly , there are more possibilities than these with regard to Jesus , lest we believe every fantasy our children tell us.This writing is very much secretly evangelistic , but probably not in a way most people would expect . I feel when an evangelist presents me with the Jesus story , and declares something like that Jesus must be Lord , liar or lunatic , it is not Jesus whom I am passing judgment upon , but the witness of a fairytale presented to me . It is thus not Jesus that must be Lord , liar or lunatic , but the person or author that presents Jesus to me that is probably liar , lunatic or telling the truth . But , as I believe happens in the case of the Jesus story , most people that believe in fairy tales are just honestly mistaken about their tale . That is , they are neither telling the truth , lying , or insane , but that they are just plain honestly mistaken . When someone tells me that if I do n't believe in a fairytale , such that my soul depends on it in order to escape eternal punishment , I wo n't sell my soul to believe in Jesus anymore than I would subscribe to the idea that Narnia is a real place . Strangely , C.S . Lewis seems to support that idea as upright , such that entering the fantastic world of Jesus and Christianity , even if it be lies , is still ideal to the alternative of denying Christian religious fantasies.Of course , Jesus was a real person , but anything beyond that is anyone 's guess , and as mysterious as Narnia itself . Three major religions have three stories about Jesus that are very much in conflict . Christianity says that Jesus is Lord . Judaism says that Jesus was the antichrist . And , Islam says that Jesus was the humblest prophet , but not as great as Mohammed . Therefore , what is to be made of this man 's story is anybody 's guess . Absurdly , most Christians say that this decision is central going to either heaven or hell in the afterlife . That much I am unable to accept .	1
My niece loves the Narnia series , and this set made a very nice gift . Attractive packaging for a timeless series .	1
C.S . Lewis ' `` The Chronicles of Narnia '' is an excellent introduction to fantasy realms for children between 10-12 , but older kids and adults will enjoy this series as well . Lewis was a contemporary and colleague of Tolkien , but his series is geared more toward the young and has a strong Christian bent , as well as being much lighter in tone . There are strong themes of faith , honesty , love , giving and friendship in each book . While each book stands alone , there is a clear continuity and many characters reappear in more than one tale.One of the things I really liked was that Lewis was able to introduce new heroes and supporting characters in each story and get the reader to like them as much as the previous set . I also liked that there was often also a lesson for one of the supporting characters , usually an animal or other non-human , to learn to be better , such as the horse Bree overcoming his vanity.Moving through all of these stories is the great Lion Aslan , an enigmatic , spiritual being who helps the various characters discover strengths within themselves and overcome obstacles . Aslan is like a god/creator/deity who leads our heroes to greater wisdom.Book 1 : The Magician 's Nephew features Digory and Polly and tells how they let the White Witch into the world of Narnia and how they met Aslan and witnessed the birth of Narnia.Book 2 : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . One of the most loved of the series , introduces the Pevensie children Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy . Edmund experiences the greatest character arc and Aslan gives the greatest gift . Very strong Christian allegory in this tale.Book 3 : The Horse and His Boy . This is a tale during the Narnian golden age , and features a boy named Shasta and horse named Bree . They journey from Calormen to Archenland , so we see some of the other lands in the world of Narnia , and learn about the King of Archenland and his sons Cor and Corin , as well as a spunky young princess.Book 4 : Prince Caspian . Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia , but centuries after their Golden Age , to aid Prince Caspian claim his rightful throne . There is a particularly moving sequence involving the four children 's faith in Aslan.Book 5 : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader . Edmund , Lucy and their cousin Eustace Scrubb are pulled into Narnia to travel with Caspian as he journeys to the ends of the world in search of his father 's loyal advisors . Eustace undergoes great changes in this story . Lots of strange and inventive realms here.Book 6 : The Silver Chair . This is the darkest of the series , where Eustace and new character Jill travel with the pessimistic Puddleglum ( a Marsh-wiggle ) into the wastelands and encounter the Green Witch and a mysterious prince , plus a Dante-like journey through Underworld.Book 7 : The Last Battle . When a false Aslan is spotted throughout the land , and great changes come to Narnia , Eustace and Jill return to aid King Tirian and the unicorn Jewel . This one is very heavy with Biblical parallels , along with the beginning of the end and the rebirth.Read and enjoy !	1
This was a gift to myself and i love it , its a great book . Brings a map of narnia and some extra content to undersatand more themasterpiefe this is ! Loved it !	1
If a simple children 's book can explain the essence of a uniiversal religion , the Narnia Chronicles , does the job . If you 're looking for something special to read your kids , this is it . But if you 're looking for a simple fable with the meaning of life , this is it as well . Lewis will take you on a wonderful journey through the enchanted land of Narnia , with an exceptional tale about its past , present and future . Meet characters you are sure to fall in love with , and ofcourse , Aslan . Different religions depict God in different ways , all which somehow are contradictory to one another . With Aslan though , whether you 're a Hindu like me , or a Muslim , or a Christian , it will somehow all make sense ! If you think that a children 's book could not possibly hold such a deep symbolic meaning , read it , just to try to prove me wrong . Oh yeah , do not read it in the way mentioned in the boxed set . Read it as Lewis intended you to , in the order they were written .	1
Love the stories , but did n't read the product description closely enough . The books are bound together into one large book , so awkward to carry around . I would prefer separate books . It 's also in the `` new '' order . C.S . Lewis had `` The Lion , the witch and the wardrobe '' as the first book ( when the children first enter Narnia ) . When his nephew took over , the nephew changed the order and put the `` Magician 's nephew '' as the first book ( when the animals first receive the gift of speech ) along with a couple of other changes . I prefer the original order .	1
Like me , if you 've come here looking for this series , you are probably well aware of the quality of the writing . I looked through a lot of different editions here on Amazon trying to find a collection that was well made . The pages have this heavier , smooth feel to them ( I 'm sorry , but I do n't know what this type of paper is called ! ) so they are durable . The illustrations are fantastic . My nine year-old loved the movies when he saw them a couple of years ago but we never did get around to reading the books . He is working his way through them now and loves them . Definitely a keepsake .	1
Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy have been sent to live with a professor in the country during the London air-raids . While exploring the large house , Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia . The country is under the spell of a terrible witch who has made it always winter but never Christmas . At first , her siblings do n't believe her , but soon they , too , find themselves in this new country . With danger around every turn , they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.I read this book for the first time in third grade , and it holds up just as well today . The pace of the writing is a bit slow , but the adventure is sure to hook readers . Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit . This is the first I read and still my favorite . There 's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new , magical world that the other books do n't have.Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults . The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.A brief word about book order . When I read this book , it was considered the first in the series . Now , some people have put the books in chronological order , making it the second . While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach , it really does n't matter that much . Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written , but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.Narnia is one of several classic kids ' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite . It 's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy .	1
*The Chronicles of Narnia* is perhaps the best-loved series of all time . It is loved by not just children , but men and women of all ages . I have grown up since I was eleven years old with these beloved stories , and they , along with CS Lewis ' other writings that I discovered as an adult , have had an immeasurable impact on my life.Indeed , I feel almost shy about writing a review of any of these books , but I will try to do so . We will start with the first review about the first book , *The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe* . I am going to be reviewing these in publishing order , not chronological order.Most everyone knows the base story . Probably many know it better than their own country 's history . Many children are sent into the English countryside to escape the air raids over London by the German *Luftwaffe* during World War II . Among these are four siblings , the Pevensies . They are Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy . They are extremely fortunate to end up in the house of a wealthy Professor.Once at the house , first Lucy , then Edmund , and eventually all four of the children , wind up in the enchanted land of Narnia . Really , ( as shall be revealed in later books ) it is a completely other dimension/universe from our own . The country of Narnia in this other world is ruled by a tyrant , the White Witch Jadis , who is determined to kill the children to thwart a prophecy that states that when four humans , two boys and two girls , sit on the thrones in the castle of Cair Paravel , it will mean the end of her tyranny and her life.Along the way , many adventures are had , and many lessons are learned . Edmund betrays them , and is repentant later on . He is redeemed from his stain of betrayal by Aslan the Lion , Who leads the children and the Narnians to triumph over the Witch and her forces.The novel is not just an example of superb storytelling , but also of wit , description , and wonderful use of the English language . The subtle jokes and historical references are enjoyable , and lead to the audience actually *thinking* about what they are reading . The descriptions and elegant use of language is absolutely captivating . The audience is transported directly into the story , and can almost see and smell what the characters do , and eat the foods along with them . What I mean by the masterful use of the English language is how Lewis was not overly `` high-minded '' in his words and descriptions . He was elegant without seeming snooty . This is not always easy to do , and Lewis did it quite well.All of these ideas are well-known about the book , but there is even more to glean from the work . To be sure , the most important element in the story is the symbolic truth of Christ , and His atoning death on the Cross for our sins via the story of Aslan giving His life in place of Edmund the traitor . Lewis once stated how culture in the West has become too comfortable and familiar with the Scriptures , and thus they have lost much of their impact on us . When we are moved by the story of Aslan dying for Edmund ( and rising in the end ) , or even of any sacrificial character in other stories ( whether they rise like Gandalf , or stay dead ) , it is really the truth of the Scriptures touching our hearts.There are many other areas that I could examine , but I will focus on one more that I think reviewers do not focus on enough . This area deals with heroism and the modern definition and view ( a very *Christian* view ) , that would have been familiar to Lewis given his studies of literature and various periods of history , including the so-called `` Dark Ages '' .I do not know for certain what Lewis thought beyond what he has said , and I heartily disdain putting words in an author 's mouth . I have always hated that people say what an author thinks , especially if they do n't know what the author thinks , or if their statements of the author 's intents actually *contradicts* the author 's beliefs.The above disclaimer is to serve as a notice that I can not guarantee what I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis ' intentions . But I will try to gauge his idea of a hero , because it is important for us to consider how even in this area , the Bible impacted our culture and Lewis ' story . In the history of the West and of America in particular , there is a falsehood that many erroneously believe . This is that the culture we all embrace comes from the Greco-Roman heritage of the West . This is pure bunk . To be sure , the love of learning and the importance of the Law were gleaned from the Greco-Roman history , but the moral and philosophical underpinnings that have made the West more vibrant , and more ready to use knowledge to better ourselves and others , than any other civilization in history are the result of the Christian Faith.What this has to do with the idea of heroism is that the gods and heroes in Greek mythology were vile and cruel creatures . They were murderous and petty , and took obscene delight in hurting and torturing people . The idea of the hero as the strongest one who exerts his will on others is the Greco-Roman idea of the hero . The idea was changed and altered as Christianity became the dominant force in the West.Really , the early concept embraced by the Church is identical , except that the obvious change had started in the morality of the hero . The hero was called on to do good in honor of God . This was due to the Church taking the knightly orders under it 's control , in order to put an end to indiscriminate killings for `` glory '' that many of the supposed `` heroes '' pursued.Eventually , a Reformation and Enlightenment came and went , and the `` hero '' changed . Now the hero was expected to act as the Lord Jesus Christ acted . Sacrifice for the sake of others is what marks a true hero . This is what is special about Aslan the Lion , and even Edmund as well . Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmund , and via the prophecy , *all of Narnia itself* . Edmund sacrifices himself to save his fellow Narnians and his family when he destroys the Witch 's wand , leaving himself open to attack.This sacrificial hero is important to our history , and it is one we are fast losing . Lewis has helped us to revive this great ideal and this great Truth . Indeed , many other concepts and Truths are buried in LWW , as in they are in the rest of the Narnia books . For helping to teach , and ingrain them in the minds of many men and women for nearly sixty years , we owe a massive debt to Lewis.This book inaugurates a series that has many `` hidden '' nuggets of wisdom and moral ideals that we would all do well to notice and embrace . It is also a frollicking good story . Please pick up this book and the others , you will *NOT* regret it.Highly Recommended .	1
These stories are delightful ! C.S . Lewis has written them on several levels , fun for children but with spiritual truth that appeals to adults . I highly recommend this book .	1
Having already seen the movie , I found the book a bit different . The book does n't give a great of detail for some of the creatures whereas the movie does . Otherwise , I really enjoyed the book and ca n't wait to read the next one in the series .	1
My edition of this book is subtitled `` Book 1 in the chronicles of Narnia '' . Interestingly the author wanted this book read after `` The Magician 's Nephew '' where he details how the lion Aslan created Narnia and gave the gift of speech to its animals . I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read `` Nephew '' first . Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books ! In any event `` Wardrobe '' introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy . Who travel to the land of Narnia by entering and exiting a `` magic '' wardrobe in the attic of an old Professor . It is not my intent in these short comments to summarize the entire story , after all discovering the delights therein are one of the prime pleasures in reading . One of the pleasures for this reader was the illustration at the beginning of each chapter by Pauline Baynes .	1
Book 1 : The Magician 's NephewDigory and Polly , who become very fast friends , decide to explore inside Polly 's house . As they are doing this , they stumble upon Polly 's Uncle Andrew who thinks he is a magician . He gives the two young explorers 2 rings . They put the rings on , and as soon as the ring touches their skin , off they go , into Narnia where they meet the great lion , Aslan , who creates the amazing land of Narnia , where animals talk and , hopefully , all of the lands and their people live together in harmony.Book 2 : The Lion , The Witch , and the WardrobeAs Lucy , Edmund , Peter , and Susan are exploring their new home in London , Lucy discovers a wardrobe in an abandoned room . She steps inside and meets Mr. Tumnus , the talking fawn . They go off in an adventure in Narnia . Edmund looks inside of the wardrobe himself and meets the evil White Witch who also drags him off into Narnia . Susan and Peter step inside to look for their brother and sister . They all meet up together and try to come up with a plan for the White Witch to be defeated once and for all and so that in Narnia it will no longer be winter all the time.Book 3 : The Horse and His BoyWhen a boy named Shasta discovers that he is n't the son of Arsheesh , the Calormene fisherman , he decides to run away , for he believes that there is no more use for him . He meets a horse and they take off on a breath-taking adventure together.Book 4 : Prince CaspianPeter , Susan , Lucy , and Edmund are suddenly pulled back into Narnia from a train in England because of a distress call from Prince Caspian , nephew of Miraz , the false king . The four do n't know who Prince Caspian is , so the Dwarf Trumpkin tells them the story of Caspian , and how the young prince escaped .	1
These books as all who love them know , are jewels , they subtly bring love , understanding and confidence to the young people reading them . The new order may have it 's own bean counting logic but it blunts and ignores the powerful magic sense of discovery of the original order . Shame on the cold callous logicians .	1
Very often , when reading any 'New Age ' literature , I come across references to the 'Narnia ' series by C S Lewis . So , to satisfy my curiosity , I purchased the entire set expecting to find something at the level of Winnie the Pooh . Although the series is geared to the younger mind and their fascination with mystical adventures featuring young heroes , there are some real gems of spiritual wisdom here.The character of a creative being , in the form of a Lion , and the evolution of living things which exist at different levels of consciousness can easily be applied to much more complex philosophical concepts . Now that I have become aware of Hollow Earth theories , it might be good to read this series again , this time looking for hints of the connection between the two . It may be that the world of Narnia does not just exist in the imagination.I believe that this series is a good thing to read as a child to facilitate the opening of the consciousness , but then even better to read as an adult to discover the things we have learned about life and its mysteries which connect to this story.In summary : we should never stop learning ; the lessons do not have to be difficult or complex . It is possible for them to be simple and enjoyable .	1
It was AWESOME I loved it so much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I think I 'll get the rest they are great to read AWESOME ! ! ! ! !	1
I first read this book when I was in middle school and LOVED it . The story has adventure , moral , action and a overall great story . This book is a lot like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings and fans of either or both of those will lover this . I would highly recommend this book for kids who like to read and for adults who like fantasy . I have since re-read the whole series and enjoyed it even more . It really does have a wonderful story that is Christian inspired , but not overtly religious so the people who are n't looking for that will certainly not be bothered by it . So , good luck with your shopping , and please vote for my review because I am in a competition with some others to see who can be the best reviewer among us , I want to win.Lastly , if you are a fan of fantasy or have read this review , I do n't mean to write this for you , I mean this review for someone who has stumbled across this book on Amazon , and is perhaps looking for a good book or present for themselves or someone else . Take care !	1
A fantastic world you will never want to leave and one you will want your children to travel to as well . Where life lessons are learned with talking animals and adventures both good and bad , but you will leave with a very full heart .	1
C.S . Lewis rejected and resented the word & quot ; allegory & quot ; being applied to his Narnia series . An allegory , he said , means that abstract principles are brought to life or to concrete form . He felt the entities he was representing in the Narnia books were real enough already , such as Christ and God 's work in the world.There seem to be many ways to interpret the books , one book for each of the seven deadly sins , is an interesting way to look at the volumes of the series , for example . It 's also interesting when one thinks of Lewis 's idea that humans no longer come to God without preconceived notions of what it will feel like to love God . Lewis felt that people lack a freedom to love God in their own ways as there is so much & quot ; baggage & quot ; attached to religious feeling anymore . He wanted to write about these children 's reactions to Aslan in a way that would illustrate a true and unencumbered love of God.But , even beyond these things , and the temptations to identify philosophical tenants such as the Devil 's rights theory , and so on , the stories themselves are truly enjoyable narratives that sweep one up and away . Though other writers , such as Tolkien , criticized the heavy-handedness of the ending of & quot ; Lion , & quot ; the plots are true and engaging . A favorite of mine is the Horse and his Boy , which seems to be a Moses-meets-Oedipus story.For children , these narratives are riveting . For adults they provide a lot of grist for the intellectual mill . They 're timeless , and it 's hard to believe they 'll become anything but a greater and greater part of our cultural identity as the years pass .	1
C S Lewis said `` ..a children 's story which is enjoyed only by children only by children is a bad children 's story . '' I first read The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe in my 20s , and thereafter devoured the other six tales of Narnia . Every time I reread one -- and I have read each of them many times since -- I find something new.I was delighted to be able to read them to my own children who , as they got older , could read the books to themselves . These stories are classics and in my opinion the best children 's books written by a modern writer.They were written by Lewis during a very dark time in history -- World War II -- and the faith and hope they contain must have provided a refuge and a beacon for him during that period.These are tales full of adventure and wonder , populated with unforgettable and very human characters , each working out his or her destiny in a world of witches , goblins , talking animals , tree-nymphs and centaurs . I envy anyone approaching them for the first time .	1
This book was the first of the Narnia series I read as a youngster and the whole series is a favorite of mine . My daughter is eager to start reading them together ! I ca n't wait to share them with her . And do n't forget to look for the parallels between Narnia and Jesus .	1
The only problem I had with this was that there were those annoying `` Now a major motion picture '' emblems on all the books.I know really that 's not a big problem but I could have used so forewarning .	1
The similarities between The Wanderer and Walk Two Moons were striking , as both young female protagonists set out on a lengthy journey and gain significant family- and self-awareness through storytelling . I was completely captivated by Sophie 's spunk and ability to hold her own with a crew of male family members on a sailing voyage across the Atlantic . Creech dedicated the book to her own daughter , Karin , who also made a journey across the sea . The reader was given a glimpse of the concern of Sophie 's mother and the courage it must have taken to allow the thirteen-year-old to set off on such a voyage . The descriptions of the storms encountered at sea ring true and heighten the adventure of the story . These experiences effect changes on the lives of the travelers and on their relationships with one another . Great family and character studies !	1
Sharon Creech has a special ability to touch the hearts of young girls . This is a story in which she uses several writing techniques to tell a poignant and powerful story of one young girl searching for her place in the world , and coming to terms with her difficult past . The story is particularly effective in the use of dual diaries , written by Sophie and her cousin Cody , which give the reader two revealing perspectives on the past and the present . Also delightful was the writing technique of Sophie 's stories - told with a fable-like eloquence - of her 'memories ' of a beloved grandfather . As an adult , I had serious questions aout the wisdom of the decisions made by the adults in the book ( allowing Sophie to undertake the cross-Atlantic sail in the first place , not dealing with Sophie 's inability to understand and accept her history ) but the story is one that speaks well to the imagination and spirit of adventure of young girls . The Wanderer is an excellent choice for Mother/Daughter groups , with many opportunities for discussion on the craft of writing , and the importance of finding one 's place in the spectrum of family and the world .	1
This book was good , starting enough after Sabriel left off to be less of a continuance of that story . Unfortunately , this story ends right as the plot begins to take off . I really enjoyed the descriptions of the characters , though , and there is definitely a twist . Also , Nix brings charter magic more into the story than he did in Sabriel , so that was exciting . The book is n't boring , though it becomes frustrating at times because of the slowness or the fact that you want to read more about Lirael . I could n't put it down , but I desperately wanted to start reading the sequel to it , so if you 're one of those people who get into a story and wo n't rest until the story is done , wait until Nix writes the next one , because this story has no real ending , just a `` Sorry folks , but that 's all we have for today '' type thing . And that was the most frustrating of all .	1
I like the book , as a remembrance , but my mind has a hard time with seeing grown up photos of Laura and her family , modern looking houses , cars , etc. , and how I like to remember their images on & # 34 ; Little House on the Prairie & # 34 ; television series , braids and all ! If you love reading about Laura , though , you will enjoy seeing this & # 34 ; album & # 34 ; .	1
The Harold and the Purple Crayon Series are wonderful . Harold is a little boy with a round head ( around long before Charlie Brown ) with a little purple crayon and a big imagination . In the North Pole book , Harold has set out on Christmas Eve to find a Christmas tree . Along the way , Harold ends up helping Santa but needs to hurry to find a tree to have it ready for Santa 's visit . The simple line drawings are wonderful for younger readers yet there is always a charm to them . Harold inspires kids on so many levels ; he 's great for children who are timid , he 's great for the mighty little explorers and he 's great for kids who like to draw but feel intimidated by other artists .	1
Was the protagonist guilty or not guilty ? That is the question of the novel , and the ambiguity is intriguing . I highly recommend it .	1
Written as a movie script , this book covers the trial of James King and Steve Harmon for the felony murder of a drugstore owner . King is accused of pulling the trigger and Harmon of being the lookout . As the trial proceeds , Steve takes notes in script style , being a keen and talented film club member.Much of the story explores what truth is - who is telling the truth , what are their motivations , how fallible is their memory , what agenda lies behind the truth being told . Great questions . Steve reflects in jail , 'we lie to ourselves here . Maybe we are here because we lie to ourselves . 'The line that really stuck with me , though , was from Mr Sawicki to the film club , about fancy camera shots , 'There are a lot of things you can do with film , but you do n't have an unlimited access to your audience . In other words , keep it simple . You tell the story ; you do n't look for the camera technician to tell the story for you . When you see a film maker getting too fancy , you can bet he 's worried either about his story or his ability to tell it . 'The film script is a clever device - using point of view metaphorically and 'literally ' to position the viewer/reader . The quote above resonates - without wanting to give anything away - especially at the end.I would think that most teenagers would find something fascinating in this book , and it should be a part of the core curriculum ... there are so many things that are clever and thought provoking - especially morally , technically , legally , ethically , creatively , cinematically ... If you loved To Kill a Mockingbird ; The Outsiders ; That Was Then , This is Now ... the list could go onHighly recommended for 14+ . Everyone should read this book .	1
Monster is an interesting book in several ways.First , it is written in the format of a movie screenplay interjected with the main character 's - a 16-year old African-American boy Steve Harmon 's - diary-like entries . I thought I would not like this format , I do not read many plays , but it turned out to be quite the opposite - the format made the story much more dynamic . Steve is on trial for murder ( he is accused of being a lookout during a robbery resulting in the death of the store owner ) , therefore the screenplay unfolds as an intense courtroom drama , where majority of the witnesses are criminals who were at some point cut a deal to testify against Steve and Steve 's alleged partner and killer - James King.Second , the story raises a multitude of questions about guilt , peer pressure , racial stereotyping , and flaws of court system . How can you possibly trust the testimonies of criminals , who do so only to reduce their sentences ? Is Steve guilty or he just happened to be in a wrong place at a wrong time ? If he is innocent , how can a Harlem black boy possibly distance himself from criminals ( who he is only acquainted with ) in the eyes of the jury ? If he is guilty , is his screenplay a way for him to convince himself of his innocence ? If he was in a fact a lookout , does it make him a murderer ? And does it even matter if he is guilty or innocent if in the eyes of people around him he is a MONSTER regardless of the outcome of the trial ? The ending of the book is vague , we all have to decide if Steven is a victim or a criminal . I love that after reading some reviews , I see people have come to conclusions completely opposite to mine . A great story to ponder on and discuss .	1
Ca n't imagine saying something about E.B . White 's children 's classic & quot ; Charlotte 's Web & quot ; that 148 others here ( more around the world ) have not . But experiencing it twice ( having it read to me in fifth grade nearly 30 years ago , and reading it to my daughter recently ) has allowed me to greater appreciate the book 's meaning and accomplishment.Many children will never experience life on a farm or visit a county fair ( the two major book settings ) . White and his illustrators picture that life sensually and beautifully . The story of Wilbur ( pig ) and Charlotte 's ( spider 's ) friendship , what she does to save him , the toll it takes on her , and her eventual legacy , recalls the unconditional love mothers have for their children . ( Fern , the Arables ' daughter who saves Wilbur 's life at the start , retreats from the storyline as her interest shifts from animals to boys . ) All this is told amidst word backgrounds of warm summer days , dank cellars , midways filled with discarded food and paper , cellar barns filled by scents of straw , manure , and slops . ( Who but White could 've described the leftovers fed to Wilbur and actually make them sound delicious ? ) White 's gift for character also shows most interestingly in the rat Templeton , who many may identify with . Tough , clever , self-serving , defensive , but valiant in the end , he adds much needed sour spike to essential scenes that may have otherwise been too sweet ( his negotiation with Wilbur over Charlotte 's egg sac is one example ) Templeton 's self-desciption at book 's end of & quot ; living for the pleasures of the feast , & quot ; summarize in a way what makes life and what we do for each other in it worth the trouble . Essential reading for children and adults .	1
The size of this book is perfect for a child 's hand , and the font is easy on the eye . The illustrations are vivid and well done as pencil drawings and capture the essence of the story as it moves along . Since the hands of children are small , the weight and texture of the stock makes for easing turning of the pages .	1
It was sad when Charlotte died and the pig was lonely . I think people 7 and up should read this book .	1
*Copy provided by Netgalley for an unbiased review . *The copy I received from Netgalley only had the first chapter , plus extras at the back of the book such as information on the author , interesting facts about the book and the illustrations , games regarding characters , a short glossary , a quiz , etc . ; all good ways to get the young reader to keep thinking about the book . The PDF version looked lovely on my iPad . Overall , assuming there 's a full length version out there , it 's a lovely new way to read this classic book - I 'll definitely be on the lookout for the full version for my grandkids ( hopefully I 'll be able to find this Puffin edition in the U.S. ) .	1
Classic ! I read this with my 4 and 6 year old . They enjoyed it , asked lots of questions . It was nice to follow up the book with the movie and compare/contrast the two story lines .	1
dissapointed couple of the books did n't have paper covers on them . do n't remembe which two it was . i gave them as gifts .	1
My grandson asked for this book for Christmas . I was there when he opened it and he was delighted.Thanks for making me look like a wonderful grandmother !	1
My fiver year old son found this at the library , and I 've lost count of how many times I 've read it to him . He never tires of it , and even used the end flap guide to draw his own stick-man strip , and narrated the story to me . It 's very 'matter-of-fact ' , as you 'd expect from a five year old , but it 's also completely from him with no coaching . It might not be for all young kids , but do n't let the '10 and over ' throw you .	1
Still waiting for grandchildren , I saw this and had to purchase it for several gifts . It 's such a sweet read ... ... .to yourself or to your favorite grandchild . I did tuck one away for the 'future ' ... ... just too good to miss ... ... .you should , too !	1
From the moment 16-year-old Eva Mae Hurt laid eyes on Corvallis newcomer Joshua Creffield , she knew things would never be the same again . Before long , this preacher and false prophet has the proper , God-fearing ladies of Corvallis throwing off their corsets , letting down their hair , burning their worldly possessions , and signing over their assets . Eva Mae , her mother , and her sister Maud are just a few of Creffield 's ardent followers , and for a time , his revival meetings are even held in the Hurt home , much to the chagrin of their skeptical father . Not so easily charmed by his good looks and charisma , both Hurt and his fellow menfolk are understandably put off by Creffield 's particular brand of religious fanaticism . They 've lost wives , daughters , girlfriends , and mothers to his way-out ideas . But when it seems things could n't get any worse , the men discover that Creffield has been intimate with nearly everyone of his followers on the flimsy excuse that he was trying to find the `` second mother . '' What ensues is a strange string of events in which many of the once-rational women are declared insane , institutionalized , and cured , only to fall once again under Creffield 's seductive spell . Murder and suicide finally bring the cult down , Creffield and all.Based on actual events , BRIDES OF EDEN is truth imagined . Crew , author of CHILDREN OF THE RIVER , indulged a lifelong fascination in bringing the events surrounding cult-leader Joshua Creffield and his followers to life . From 1903 to 1906 , Creffield and his women were the talk of Corvallis , Oregon . Crew , a Corvallis native , grew up seeped in lore about the preacher and his women and was hooked . Through extensive research conducted in the annals of Corvallis history ( newspaper articles , historical records , and such ) , Crew was able to convincingly recreate this engaging , albeit strange , story. -- - Reviewed by Tammy L.

Georgia 's back again , manic and self-obsessed as ever , but this time , it seems like things are actually going to work for her . She 's caught the eye of Robbie ( aka the Sex God ) , and her parents are n't forcing her to move to New Zealand after all ! Then , out of the blue , Robbie dumps her because `` she 's too young for him , '' and Georgia finds herself back at square one.This is a fine book , and Georgia is certainly a memorable and distinct character , though not always the most likeable one . She 's not particularly the best friend she could be to Jas , whom Georgia likes to enjoy baiting more than anything . And in both this and the first book , there 's some disturbing activities happening in the background with Georgia 's mom and doctors/interior decorators while dear old dad 's out of the country . But hey , how could Georgia concentrate on things like that when she 's got to convince Robbie she 's mature enough to date ? ? ! An easy to read , realistic , funny book .	1
As the Amazon review states , the story plays out in pictures , with only an assist from the words . And what a beautiful tale , simply told . Incredibly touching and joyful . I happened upon this book in a bookstore and had to choke back some honest-to-goodness tears of joy at the end . Crying in Borders would have been a new one for me , but the book really is that good . Sweet and tender and full of life and ... I 'll stop now .	1
My boss just loved it , so i bought it or my son and his girlfriend to read to their daughter as she recovers in the PICU . Beautifully written ...	1
Clive Barker 's personal life freeks me out , but he is a fantastic writer . If you can just overlook the freeky stuff .	1

After being enchanted by `` Ella Enchanted '' , I knew I had to pick up Gail Carson Levin 's `` The Two Princesses of Bamarre '' . And I must say that I found this fairy tale to be quite a fascinating read ! Princess Medryl ca n't wait to be grown up so she can leave the castle , why ? So she can have all sorts of adventures fighting off the evil monsters which roam the land of Bamarre . On the other hand though , her sister Princess Adelina , called Addie , is afraid just of the thought of adventures . She 's afraid of spiders and rats , how can she face down dragons , specters , gryphons , or ogres ? More than anything though , she is afraid to lose her sister to whom she depends on for courage and strength . But in the year Addie turns sixteen , Merlyn is stricken by the fatal Gray Death . It 's up to Princess Addie to save her sister and find a cure . But the quest will be dangerous and she will have to face her deepest fears . Will Addie be able to fidn the cure before time runs out for both her and her sister ? For a Young Adult fairy-tale , this story cotains it tall : an exciting plot , fun characters lots of daring adventures , magic , monsters in the forms of dragons and other creatures , and a sweet romance . Totally worth the read ! Levine 's characters as usual are lovable and fun to read about . Especially the main characters Addie who is sweet and charming . In the typcal writing style of Levine , we are given a first-person view of Addie 's character . And typical for Levine , this view does not get boring not even once because of Levine 's sense of humor which keeps her characters lively and interesting.Mostly for young girls 10 and up , this book can still be read by older teens ( I 'm sixteen and I still enjoy these books for fun ! ) . So if you have a chance , pick up `` The Two Princesses of Bamarre '' . Here are two other books by Gail Carson Levine I also recommend : *ELLA ENCHANTED* ~ If I were to choose between this book and `` The Two Princesses ... '' , I might veer towards liking this book more . A Cinderella like story with a fun twist , this book is a Newberry honor award . 5 stars easily ! *THE WISH* ~ The story of a girl who wishes for popularity and learns an important lesson about what true popularity is . Not really up to par with `` Ella Enchanted '' and `` The Two Princesses ... '' ( not many books are ) , but still is a cute story to read .	1
way different than the movie	1
I love this book I could read it forever I recommend it for all ages it was amazing and smashing .	1
I learn to appreciate this book now that I am an adult compare to when I was a kid . The book is a story of friendship , love , courage , good and evil on their adventure on the magical land of Oz . This classic is a must read !	1
The author can really paint a picture of the story . I would totally recomend this to a friend . Great read .	1

I enjoyed this read especially because it was FREE . Its nice to have inexpensive and free options when you are low on cash .	1
I bought this book and performance because I wanted to read ( listen ) to the original version versus the movie we all know . Although the film is better due to the singing / dancing and some interesting adaptions of the story in plot and dialogue , the book is good as well . In addition , I read ( listen ) to `` Wicked '' and some of the background information for that book / musical are found in this book . I bought this version since it was newest and had the best ratings .	1
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a lot of firsts . The first American fairy-tale ( and the best fairy-tale ever ) The first fairy-tale to have a happy ending.The first piece of merchindice in a phnomenon . The fist fairy-tale to get a lot of sequels . Those sequels were the first to be ghost written after . One of the less celebrated firsts is the format . There are no black and white pictures , all pictures are at least , one color besides white . These pictures are on nearly every page of the 260 page book There are one-sided full color plates , ( this is the first time they have been one-sided in the Books of Wonder hardcover edition ) for each of the 24 chapters . This means the book is less then 260 pages . All of this means the book is more accsessible to children than it appears . The first person to think of this clever format was L. Frank Baum himself . ALL children 's books , INCLUDING all books considered children 's books ( The Hobbit and Harry Potter , for example ) and the books children have to read for school , should have AT LEAST ONE IN-PRINT EDITION IN THIS FORMAT .	1
I loved this book . It catches up again with our favorite teenage princess , Mia Thermopolis . It 's about her life as a princess trying to grow up like any normal teenager , but it 's really hard with the pressures of her mother getting married to Mia 's algebra teacher , being a soon to be big sister , and figuring out who JoCrox is ...	1
This book was good and light and I finished it with happy , warm , fuzzy feelings in my heart . As always , the diary style of the book is well-done and allows a better glimpse into the mind of Mia . With intelligent wit and and an interesting plot , you ca n't go wrong with this book .	1
I 've been a fan of The Princess Diaries ever since I saw the movie that came out way back when . Total chick flick , but it was cute . Just because one is a princess does n't mean life is so much easier . It 's not , according to Mia.In this book , Mia finally has a boyfriend , but she is not happy with him ... she still pines after her best friend 's older brother . Not to give away anything of course , but this book was really cute . Cabot writes as if it really was her diary , so it seemed like I just opened up someone 's diary and started reading . The usage of `` ! ! ! ! ! ! '' cracked me up a lot ... however , the book was just a bit draggy ... but it 's like a soap opera : it 's worth watching ( well , reading , in this case ) to the grand finale . A [ ... ]	1
I bought this book and was quite pleased . Meg cabot is not the best writer , but I think she really hit it on this one . Samantha is a going-goth-trying-to-be-normal girl and she happens to be in the right place at the right time , to jump on the back of the president 's would-be assin ! ! Not your avergage book and I really liked . although , I do n't think Samantha is a chracter that 's easy to relate with , after reading the book and I feel I know about her , but I do n't know her . But , all in all , I liked it and I recommend this book .	1
Samantha has a troubled life . She 's in love with her older sister 's boyfriend . She 's also being forced by her parents to take an art class that restricts her creativity . Things get worse when she saves the President 's life . Now she has to dodge the media and fulfill her duties as the teen ambassador to the U. N. Her romantic life also gets more complicated when the President 's son takes an interest in her.This book is every bit as enjoyable as the Princess Diaries Series and fans of that series should run out and buy it this second ! Sam has a lot in common with Mia but is different enough that you wo n't feel like you are reading the same book twice . I especially like this books because it 's filled with art humor and Gwen Stefani worship which I can identify with . I hope Meg Cabot decides to write a sequel .	1
Samantha Madison is no ordinary teen . With a perfect older sister and a super-smart younger one , she just ca n't seem to find her place . She 's the artsy one ; the rebel-the one no one can seem to understand . She 's made fun of at school , combat boots and all . She can only find her refuge at her down town art class-her favorite place after a while . Even though the parrot does fly around pulling out her hair.Until she leaves the class one day.While she 's walking outside , she sees the President coming out of a store . An assassin sneaks in for the kill . Sam sees it all . She stops the president from comitting the murder , and therefore becomes the new face of the media . She is appointed teen ambassador , goes to dinner with the president-however , who social status only goes down among her school peers.Until she meets David , the presidents son . He 's smart . He 's artistic . He likes her combat boots . He 's perfect.A very good book , but far fetched . I 've lived in Washington DC my entire life . Sam says that if you live in DC , you see the Preside n't motercade every day . I 've never seen him in my life . And believe me , it 's one dangerous city . the president does n't just go around holly jolly around the city . But other than that , very good .	1
Samantha Madison thinks that nothing good is going to happen to her . She is the middle child and her folks think that it would help her to go to a art class to help her from drawing during German class.After Sam finds out that she has to go to art class twice a week she thinks nothing in her life could get worse . Well things do get better well other people seem to think so , but for Sam things are just going down hill.When Sam stops a madman from trying to kill the President she is an instant hero and overnight celebrity . Everyone is talking about Sam and wanting to know more about her . But Sam does n't see saving the President as something that big , it was just something she did and she is n't ready to be overnight sensasion everyone wants her to be.As time goes on and she has more things to do then worry about being the middle child . She has to deal with being the teen advisor to the UN and dealing with all the people wanting to know if she prefers Coke to Pepsi and all the reporters wanting to get interviews . Sam just wants to live a normal life . But is hard for her to do when she spends time with the Presidents son David.As time goes on things in Sam 's life calm and she starts to realize that everything is n't so bad and things will work themselves out.This was a very cute book . I 've enjoyed all the princess diaries books and was happy to say I enjoyed this one just as much . The charactors were great and the story moved along at a good pace . I hope Meg Cabot keeps up the good writing .	1
This book is hilarious . If you have a daughter who can come up to you and say : `` I do n't like books . I have never liked books . I will never like books , '' then this is the book to give her for her birthday.The story takes place in Washington , D.C. One outcast girl happens to be hanging out at `` Capitol Cookies '' when an armed assassin aims at the president who is exiting the restaurant and ... Better read it for yourself .	1
As my first Meg Cabot novel , I say , BRAVO , Cabot ! I loved your creation of this zany redheaded wannabe goth girl . Cabot 's portrayal of teenage drama had me snorting within the first few pages , and made me want to personally write her an e-mail to see if she 'd be MY BFF 4EVA.Despite the over-the-top OMG dramarama moments involving Samantha 's family ( including housekeeper Theresa ) , fight-or-flight emotions , and ridiculously silly concerns about her parents finding out she ditched art class yet saved the PRESIDENT 'S LIFE , Cabot really knows how to write an entertaining novel . I can see why she 's successfully sold approximately 12 zillion books.And the Top Ten lists that are sprinkled throughout this novel ? My WORD , if the lists in this book do n't evoke an LOL , you might indeed be a robot . Speaking of Top Ten lists ... Top Ten Reasons Meg Cabot Writes Awesome Things in All-American Girl Which In Turn Make Me Want To Ask Her To Be My BFF 4EVA:1 ) The protag , Samantha , is pro-girl-role models . ME TOO , SAM.2 ) How hilariously illogical and naive Samantha can be . It is positively comical.3 ) Manet , the dog whose name was switched from Monet because `` Mo '' sounded too much like `` No . `` 4 ) Sam 's obsession with Gwen Stefani.5 ) THE LISTS THAT INSPIRE ME TO MAKE MINE OWN.6 ) She 's an entrepreneur ( case in point : celebrity drawings ) -- `` Really , I was like my own little UN , doling out aid , in the form of highly realistic renderings of Freddie Prinze Jr. , to the underprivileged . `` 7 ) Her UFO-conspiracy-obsessed little sister , Rebecca , and fashionista big sister , Lucy.8 ) Sam 's description of Mr. Uptown Girl , and when she 's questioned by the Men Wearing Earpieces , her re-cap of the story.9 ) FRISSON . Every reference to FRISSON is SHEER GOLD.10 ) Have I mentioned the lists yet ? Especially Top Ten Signs of Proof You Saved the President . Priceless !	1

Well , I 've only just started Grimm Grotto , but Slippery Slope stood out to me as the most interesting stories in the series , introducing important plot development that would go beyond just this book , as well as character development , especially for Sunny .	1
The Slippery Slope ( A Series of Unfortunate Events , Book 10 ) We bought the Audio CD . We listened to 1 thru 8 but missed # 9 for some reason . As we got started on this one which is # 10 we realize we 've missed a bit but decide to listen anyway . In this one we get more of an inside view of the evil Count Olaf and his band of misfits because the youngest Beaudolaire has been kidnapped by Olaf . He makes the baby cook and clean for the group and they all make fun of her because she ca n't do anything very well , not even speak in a way they can understand . Spoiler alert : we discover there are some people even more evil than Olaf . More arson has been done.As usual the children are the ones who figure out how to solve the problems and resolve more of the mystery . Grown ups , even the nice ones are always fooled and can not detect evil when it 's right in front of them . The children have given up completely on Mr Poe who was supposed to find them a good home with relatives , but instead sends them to dangerous places where Olaf easily follows.My eight year old and i like to listen to these stories . At first I was a little concerned about the mean things Olaf and other adults do , and the rather dark imagery of the story.On the positive side , in this story the children have to decide whether they are going to do a `` little bit of evil '' to fight back against evil . They devise a plan they are not comfortable but they justify it because of their desperate situation . In the end they do not go down that `` slippery slope . '' Instead they devise a new plan where they do the right thing and it succeeds . They are relieved that they made the right choices . That is a pretty good lesson to learn from a story , so I highly recommend it .	1
I love this one . Especially the scene with Quigley and Violet . Another beautiful book from the ASOUE by Lemony Snicket . One must start from the beginning to fully understand the entire plot . Or you could , you know , buy all 13 books . ( ;	1
Dear Reader , THE SLIPPERY SLOPE begins immediately after the conclusion of Book # 9 , THE CARNIVOROUS CARNIVAL . The events that happened there were so horrible . When we meet up with the Baudelaires , Violet and Klaus are rushing down the slope of a mountain in a runaway caravan that was accelerating with every passing second . Meanwhile , Sunny is being held captive by Count Olaf and his ever growing troupe . Oh , those poor children ! First Violent and Klaus have to figure out how to slow the caravan and prevent themselves from being smashed into hundreds of little fragments . Only then are they able to climb back up the mountain and rescue Sunny from the clutches of Olaf and crew.Surprisingly as it might seem , Sunny is n't in too much danger . She 's useful around the camp and since Olaf and his troupe do n't think she is able to eavesdrop and learn important information.THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is a very important book in the chronicles of the Baudelaires . New characters are introduced , old characters are re-met , and small mysteries are solved . When I read this story it felt to me like it was the beginning of the end of the saga . With only three books left in the series it very well should be . But , THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is just as exciting and dangerous as the previous books in the series . By the end of the story everyone learns an important lesson : once you fall down a slippery slope , it 's very hard to get back up again and the only place to go is down.Speaking of which , I think I shall retire to rest my bum from the fall I had on the ice yesterday.Sincerely , Uncle TV	1
Beautifully packaged and sent very quickly . I kind of tipped my hand addressed the card from 'A Reader , an Inventor and a Biter ' but other than that my younger daugher loved it .	1
What grabs you first is the prose style . The elaborate introductory letters on the backs of the books , for instance , signed with the somewhat ambiguous closing , `` With all due respect -- - Lemony Snicket . '' The drily witty text of the stories reads rather like Miss Manners has been up all night and drinking entirely too much coffee.The authorial voice intrudes , commenting on events , and providing definitions of words . These are sometimes congruous to those usually found in dictionaries . They are occasionally not -- - in which that incongruity is usually both a plot element , and the subject of further comment by the authorial voice . The introduction to the concept of `` dramatic irony '' in the second book of the package is memorably amusing as well as educational.I suspect that , as children 's books , these will be appreciated mostly by highly verbal and sensitive children , those who have the ability to see behind the text and grasp exactly how their leg is being pulled . For these children , these books will not only be amusing , but valuable : they are written in a literate style , ironically formal , and the author 's intrusions introduce a fair number of interesting words . Appropriate adults will find entertainment here too : the literary allusions , the Baudelaires and Poes , add depth to the stories , and clues to the clued-in as to what is really happening here.Children -- - or adults -- - who ca n't or wo n't follow the ironic premise of the series are less likely to enjoy these .	1
... `` I Stink '' by Kate and Jim McMullan is the book for you . This is a really fun book that follows a trash truck as he makes his rounds . The artwork is really unique and the trash truck is pretty funny . You also get a chance to run down the alphabet by naming some of the yucky stuff in the trash truck . It 's a unique and funky book , but kids really enjoy it . I thought the artwork was particularly unique and well done .	1
Pre-schoolers love this nitty-gritty story of a big-city garbage truck and the work he does for us all night long while we sleep . The trash our truck collects forms a very grungy and hilarious alphabet -- apple cores , banana peels , all the way down to ziti with zucchini shown in an old plastic bag . In between can be found dirty diapers , puppy poo and stinky sneakers . Brightly colored child-friendly illustrations predominate , and the well-chosen words make children laugh out loud : when the truck shows what life would be like without him , we see a mountain of trash with the words , `` It 's trash-o-rama , baby ! '' I have read this book to many pre-school boys , all of whom adored it . I ca n't speak for girls , but I suspect it might present a welcome break from all those princesses .	1
The story of young Christopher Chant and how he grows in to both his magic and his inheritance . To Christopher the landscape beyond his bedroom which leads to multiple worlds seems normal . It takes time for adults to realise he can access these worlds , and longer still for Christopher to understand the barriers to his own magic and the full extent of his powers . This book is conceptually vast , yet is also a fast paced adventure/mystery/fantasy story . I greatly enjoyed this book , which I read in one sitting , and look forward to reading the rest of the series .	1
First , I just want to say that many of you might find this book boring to read . If that turn out to be the case , you can read the commentary ( which uses more relevant and recent examples ) for each chapter by Jason Zweig , which is worth the price of the book alone . I got tempted to read the commentary only but I forced myself to read the entire book and I 'm glad I did it . Warren Buffett is right , this is the best book on investing ever written , by far . This is one of the reasons in my opinion why Warren himself never write an investment book ( plus the fact that it is not easy to explain Warren 's intelligent on a paper . Instead just learn from what he does ) .Now about the content of this book , it tells you everything you need to know about the investing field ( not only stocks , but business in general , bonds , macro economy to some extent , psychological factor of the market , strategy for defensive and speculative investors etc ) .Secondly , Warren Buffett highly recommend this book and his favorites are chapter 20 ( Margin of safety ) and chapter 8 ( Investor and market fulctuation ) . Margin of safety should be the central concept of your investment , and understanding how the market works ( and the mood and inconsistencies of Mr Market ) should be the second thing that you need to know before jumping into the market.I also find the chapter 11 ( security analysis for lay investor ) very educating as it teaches us to value the future of a business ( breaking down into 3 area:1 . Long term prospect2 . Quality and conduct of management3 . Financial strength and capital structureAdditionally the comparison of eight companies ( chapter 18 ) very practical and eye opening . I wo n't spill the content right here but when I read them , it feels like common sense to me , but back ( during the tech bubble ) then I was involved in several similar stocks that I should n't have touched with a ten feet pole.The bonus chapter `` The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville '' by Warren Buffett is a classic reading . This article shows how inefficient the market can be , and argue that most of the time the market is not efficient . I have become a believer that the market is not efficient ( after many years believing that the market is very efficient as the business school has taught me ) This book also cover several useful metrics that we can use to value a company in addition to just looking at EPS or PE ratio , such as the ROIC ( Return on Invested Capital ) etc.In general , Ben Graham focuses a bit more on capital preservation ( shown by focusing on margin of safety , dividend policy , and stocks priced below its tangible book value strategy . ) which I think are really important , but one need to understand that there 's more to investment than just those things ( such as long term groth/the business itself and management ) which are also covered in book.This book would not serve as your investing philosophy , but it should help you create your own investing philosophies . It will help you find what your strength ( defensive or enterprising ) is and find/form your circle of competence . And as a minimum , this book will increase your confident when dealing with the stock market.Last but not least , also read `` Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits '' by Philip A. Fisher and `` One up on Wall Street '' by Peter Lynch to complement this book.Happy Investing ! Sidarta Tanu	1
I really like the 40-30-30 diet . Once I got the formula down -- as to how many grams of protein , fat & carbs per block , and then how many blocks I should eat a day -- It was easy peasy . I am losing weight readily and am never hungry.As for recipes and such ... I do n't like the recipes in this series ( i.e . perfect meals in minutes ) . There are a bunch of nice smoothy recipes that serve FOUR ! Who makes smoothies for four ? Who even has a blender big enough to make smoothies for four ? In anycase , I have found that the 40-30-30 'Formula ' series by Daoust has better meal ideas . But The Zone is best for understanding the 40-30-30 concept , and putting it into action.I do n't understand what the big deal and supposed 'conspiracy ' about the Zone being a lower calorie diet . Except for Atkins , is n't that what people expect of a diet ? I am losing weight more quickly on the zone than on other diets and I 'm not suffering while doing it ; That 's the big deal about the Zone.I am giving Dr. Sears and his Zone book series 4 stars . I would have given him 5 , but the whole Smoothy thing really pissed me off .	1
From time to time a book comes along that grabs you by the lapels and throws you in its pages . While & quot ; I Know This Much Is True & quot ; touts itself as an exploration of the relationship of a twin and his scizophrenic brother , it is so much more . It is a story rich with themes , suprises and real human characters . Lamb effortlessly weaves through time looking at the present , the recent past and the history of a family several generations back . I can not find fault with the book . I found myself racing through its 900+ pages but at the same time regretting finishing it . Sometimes , the ending of such a long novel can be anti-climactic . It was not here . It finishes with few unanswered questions and a lot of closure . This book was much better than Lamb 's earlier novel , & quot ; She 's Come Undone & quot ; and I look forward to his next work .	1
Intense book in its events and the chronology of it all . This book kept my interest the entire time . Although , it is a fiction , it felt so realistic . Amazing how the time lines and perspectives overlapped throughout the novel . Highly recommend to anyone who wants a book that keeps them awake and makes them think .	1
What a wonderful book . The author has you connect with his characters on so many levels . Revealing the life and times of twin boys that grew up in a dysfunctional family . One twin asking why not me ... and trying to find himself , and grappling with what has happened to his twin brother.Definitely a must read book !	1
To put it simply , I read a lot of books - fiction , nonfiction , some best-seller fluff once in a while - and this is my favorite book ever.I had it with me on a trip through Norway , and instead of watching the amazing landscape , the mountains , the fjords , etc ... I was reading this book because I could n't put it down .	1
How does one begin to express in words the emotional satisfaction derrived from reading this book ! Wally Lamb is so very gifted . . . . to be able to capture the human spirit , psyche , and nature so completely is indeed a precious gift.The characters are lively and so very real . I experienced their pain and joy as if it were mine , and was rejoiceful when in the end , what is true for Dominick is a universal truth that we all must come to know . I feel a little more complete having experienced this book !	1
Loved it just as much if not more than the third time . Wally a Lamb is amazing at getting to the core of complex feelings . You must read this book .	1
Excellent story , I was drawn into this from the beginning . It felt like a true story . Such raw emotions and wonderful characters.Thank you Wally Lamb	1
I was a little afraid to read this one , knowing what it was about , so much dysfunction ! But the multitude of wonderful reviews always entices me and pulls me in . The twists and turns left me speechless and it was impossible to put down . The complicated relationships in this book and how the characters related to each another were so convincingly done . The parallels from the past to the present were amazing . The emotional roller coaster was moving , challenging and intriguing and full of raw vulnerability . The 900 pages had me experiencing every range of human emotion . Lamb captured the essence of human nature . There is great use of imagery throughout , amazing perception , introspection , great depth of character and great writing that make up the most memorable reads . Parts of this book were so disturbing that I wanted to quit reading , only to find myself thinking about it when I was n't reading so I was quickly drawn back in . This is a gripping , touching story , full of rage and redemption , courage and relief and is an incredible book that is well worth the long read !	1
I 'm going to try to keep this short and sweet considering all the other really long reviews . In short , this has been the best book I have read . With a newborn baby I hardly have time to squeeze in leasure reading . But when I started this book , I made time . Everytime I forced myself to put it down to either go to sleep or take care of things I was consumed with the characters in the book . As if they were real people . After a while I was connected to them like family and wandered what was going to happen next . There are so many surpises through out the whole book . I enjoyed it so much I went ahead and ordered She 's come undone , just b/c he is the author . This treasure of a book will be passed along to everyone I know as the must read book of the year . Well , crap I did it - rambled on to long ! Scusa..sorry !	1
This is one of the best stories I have read . The book is long , but so glad the author did not take shortcuts . At first , I did not like the story in the middle , but it was blended so well , it felt like it belonged . We are led through growing up with mental illness and the families challenges .	1
I absolutely loved this book . The characters were so real that they continue to live on in my mind weeks after I finished the book . There were times during this book that I laughed and times that I cried . Even though Thomas is the twin in the mental hospital , Dominick , who always felt it was his job to take care of his brother , is having a major meltdown due to all the trauma in his life . This is the story of twin brothers who both deal with the demons in their lives . It is a long but absolutely fantastic book and should is a must-read !	1
When I first heard of Rachel Ashwell , it was through VICTORIA magazine , when I read an article about this book . I fell in love with that & quot ; shabby chic & quot ; style and have been collecting ever since . What I love about this and her other books is that they are so beautiful , calm and serene . Rachel teaches us that old items , either in their found state or painted fresh white , are to be cherished as little pieces of history , and I can tell you that the old linens , silverware , china and furniture that I collect ( and use ! ) are much better made than most of the new items available today . What I most love about her books is that she shows you how to create a calm and serene refuge at the end of each day . Buy this book , you wo n't regret spending the money . It 's my very favorite book and I own a lot of them ! !	1
Michael Johnson , the world class Olympic champion is a `` role model '' not only to be respected for his feats on and off the track , but also one to be emulated because he is a man of few words and many actions . In his classical understated way , in this book he has left us a sparse but detailed , well thought out plan that can assist anyone serious about the pursuit of a goal to become successful -- whether in sports or some other field of human endeavor.Using his own ups and downs in life and his own pursuit of Olympic track records , as `` object examples , '' Mr. Johnson shows us how it is done ; that is , how to slay the dragon of success . His formula is simple : Any success worth having begins with a modicum of talent and a series of well thought out , carefully orchestrated , reasonably achievable , `` written down '' plans ; plans that constitute a step-by-step contract between `` us and our goals . '' Everything else is blood , sweat and tears : that is , hard work , guts , and persistence.However , once the sweat has been turned into a routine , has become habitual and `` a matter of fact , '' the blood and tears can be minimized and the goal can be visualized realistically as the straight line result of a smooth , graduated and predictable `` chipping away '' at a self-devised and regulated timetable . Although mid-course corrections may be necessary here and there , with a plan , we can always see the light at the end of the tunnel . Success no longer remains in doubt ; it is no longer just a random variable operating at the whim of forces entirely beyond our control . The process is the message . In short , when we are in the driver 's seat of our own plan of success , a seat that involves an unbreakable contract we have made with ourselves , confidence and success are the surest collateral benefits . Like the night follows the day , both confidence and success come as unforced byproducts of turning long-term thinking into an organizational tool , which harnesses both our mental and physical abilities , and puts them both to the same grinding wheel of a single purpose.This process works because , as is true in `` track and field , '' the difference between abject failure and incredible success in all areas of human endeavor is just a `` sliver , '' always to be measured in fractions of a second . Planning , organization , guts and perseverance are the only ways of separating `` winners '' from `` losers '' and at the same time the only way of also amplifying meager talents . And as the old adage goes , for sure the race does not always go to the swift , but to those who are organized and can tenaciously stick to a plan over the entire course of several racing seasons . That is the only sure way of slaying the dragon.If there is a better more honest plan for success in existence I am , all ears.Five Stars	1
Most of the recipes in this book are for delicious , easy-to-make , one-dish meals . Some of these will be a challenge to the sort of cook who serves Froot Loops or Pop-Tarts for breakfast and boiled weiners for dinner . Others won't.The recipes in this book are sized accurately . They are measured both in terms of the number of servings and the number of blocks of protein , fat and carbohydrate . Each recipe is designed to have an equal number of blocks of fat , carbohydrate and protein , and the number of blocks of each of these is listed . This is Barry Sears secret for designing meals that do n't cause excessive secretion of insulin.Excessive insulin secretion causes sugar to be withdrawn from the blood stream and converted and stored as body fat . Probably , if you had a big crowd of people , some of them thin and some of them extra fat , you could easily sort them into two groups : the thin ones , who follow the sort of diet outlined in this cookbook , and the fat ones who don't.Most of the recipes here are for dinner . About 50 are for lunch and a couple dozen are for breakfast . Pick your favorites.There are several useful appendices . One lists the number of blocks of protein , fat or carbohydrate in various common foods . Another lists scientific references about various aspects of the Zone diet .	1
I never thought I 'd find such an extensive library on zone food blocks , including ready-made TV dinners and fast food . It does not include everything , but it makes a very good attempt at doing so .	1
There is nothing like a dose of humour to diffuse any situation . Except Stupid White Men , far from diffusing , hangs like an albatross of shame around the neck of the American elite.Very much a read-them-and-weep chronology of US-style deceit , conflict-of-interest and lies , the irreverent Stupid White Men addresses politicians , schools , minorities , Palestinians , Zionists and even -bonus ! - includes a pop quiz for your politicians.Michael Moore has written a well-researched almanac of the dangers threatening America . Indeed , those who dislike this book , or worse have not read it , are the perfect individuals of which enemies of America would love to see more.Stupid White Men is a great antidote to the flood of mud spewing from the belly of the beast .	1
With the success of his latest documentary , Bowling for Columbine , Michael Moore has been in the public eye a lot lately . To many , because of this newfound fame , he may appear to be a newcomer , when , in fact , he has been writing books and creating documentaries for well over a decade now.In his latest piece of literature , & lt ; b > Stupid White Men ... and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation ! & lt ; /b > , Michael looks into the reasons why America has been plagued in the last couple of years with a crumbling economy , job insecurity , and public dissidence . Exploring issues such as America 's new form of stealth racism , criminal government actions , and the apparent shift to the right within the Democratic Party , the author makes many fascinating points , and creates some attention-grabbing theories regarding the state of western society.Although this is a well-researched , and very enlightening book , sometimes it is difficult to take the author seriously . Oftentimes , only one side of an argument is presented , and many facts are taken well out of context . For this reason , Stupid White Men can sometimes feel more like left-wing propaganda rather than the legitimately informative piece that it could very well have been.What these writings do do , however , is present the opposite viewpoint of the right-wing half-truths published by the large media corporations . It gives the reader a counterview to the issues concerning American society , and some alternative ways to solve . The book is basically fighting propagandist fire with propagandist fire , which is , unfortunately , the only way to reach a majority of the population.This is a good book for anybody to at least have a read . Whether they are a socialist dissident looking for more reasons to distrust the American political system , or a hard-core conservative who wants to get an idea of the sentiments of the poorer 90 % of the population , Michael Moore 's book presents a great option to the typical misinformation presented by the media .	1
This book is n't as entertaining or & quot ; light & quot ; as I expected , but is definitely a worthy read . The writer 's & quot ; old english & quot ; style , and the creative story line , provide for some good quality reading . Although the story does pick up in the 2nd half of the book , the interesting ( and dreary ) perspective that this book portrays the Cinderella story too , was fascinating . Confessions of ... also has some suprises and interesting twists , and definitely makes one question the relativity of human beauty , and shallowness of human society .	1
What begins as a very slow start to an unconventional telling of the Cinderella story eventually wins the reader over into a novel that you ca n't wait to pick up . Iris and her sister Ruth are born in England . Their mother yanks them from their homeland in the middle of the night and returns to her hometown in Holland to escape from the evils that purport to haunt their family . The remainder of the novel portrays their arrival in Holland and subsequent stay from Iris 's point of view . The family ultimately winds up in the home of Cornelius and Henrika van den Meers , parents of Clara , the most beautiful child anyone has ever laid eyes on . Thus begins the story of how Iris meets `` Cinderella '' the belle of the ball.Maguire continues his unconventional fairytale storytelling with Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister . This perspective on a beloved story is fascinating and the reader can not help but appreciate his imagination and point of view . This particular novel , however , gets off to a very slow start . Because the entire premise of the book is the unusual spin on the classic tale , the reader spends almost the first half of the book thinking , come on , when do we get to the part of the story that I am familiar with ? However , once we get there we are not disappointed because by then , we are in love with the new characters that have been introduced , and fascinated by the way that Maguire weaves them into a story that we thought we knew . This book is extremely fun and light , and will not leave the reader disappointed .	1
OK , so it 's no masterpiece , but it 's fun , light and extremely imaginative.What I love about this book is that none of the characters are caricatures . Cinderella is not your run-of-the-mill enslaved beauty , the evil step-mother has some redeeming qualities , and the ugly step-sisters may be ugly , but they are rich in personality . Gone too are the fairy god-mothers , mice turned coachmen and magic that fades at midnight of the original fairy tale.The backdrop for the story is Harlem , a Dutch town in the 1630s at the height of the tulip craze . By the way , to find out more about the tulip craze , read the excellent book `` Tulipomania '' , by Mike Dash.Bottom line : this book is a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon . Just do n't expect a Nobel Prize winning novel .	1
I 'd have to admit that regardless of whether you 're a fan of their music or not , this book makes for an excellent read . It 's almost like a memorandum of the blooming 1980 's Los Angeles subculture that harkens back to something out of a Bret Easton Ellis novel only `` The Dirt '' actually works without the aimless drivel . Nikki Sixx & his cohorts infatuation with the hedonistic routine are ferociously direct in their escalation from a hungry local band to recognition as MTV darlings . Commencing grande tales of debauchery & fornication from arena concert after hour antics to glitzy mansion shindig 's to the countless substance abuse outing 's . It 's all the incentives , high 's , low 's , depravity , & demons that come with fame & fortune brought to you by none other than one of hair metal 's surviving leading bands . A truly great book .	1
Amazon , you never cease to amaze me . The book came very quickly ... .especially since it was right before Christmas , this made me very happy . The book itself was in excellent condition . Loved this book , it really depicted the life of the band and Tommy Lee and gave a great glimpse of what it was like .	1
Amazing to read about the band throughout its times of struggle and fame . A total page-turner ; I could n't put it down and ended up reading it in a day and a half . Ca n't wait for part two !	1
THE DIRT gives us the behind the scenes look at the band that we thought we knew almost everything about . MOTLEY CRUE has been one of the top rock bands of the last 20 years and now we know the rest of the story . We get a look at their childhoods upto the present . I can say that there is never a dull moment when reading this book . The tales they tell make all the other rock stories seem tame . We see how drugs nearly destroyed the band , how dysfunctional their relationships with each other are . We get to see who slept with who 's girlfriend , usually it was Vince the sex maniac . All the dirt of the last 20 years of the band is on display here and if you are a fan of the band , you will read this and really get the whole story . If you are just an avid reader , then I think that you will also enjoy this book . This book gets 2 thumbs up	1
Just finished reading the Dirt for the 2nd time ... . Only gets better folks . I know me , and my friends . We have commented on how we know how to party , hit it hard , tear it up , etc ... . But then we have to recoup , and re-energize . Motley 's life style back at their peak would have KILLED the strongest of us.Nikki is a rock god . Tommy is pure energy . Vince is selfish , but the way a lead is supposed to be . Micks guitar made the band go ( in my mind ) .BUY THIS BOOK !	1
This book is a fast paced , well delivered bio of one of the most famous rock bands of recent times.Some of the problems with the book:1 . There is not enough material from Mick Mars and what is there feels more like the ghost writer ( or Neil Straus ) putting it on paper . Each band member should have been obligated to contribute equally.2 . Dates of events would have made more sense in this book rather that assuming that the reader knows when things occurred.Pros:1 . The photos are pretty good , especially the young school shots of everyone.2 . Its funny to realize that Tommy was able to respond to what Nikki wrote earlier in the book and comment on that -- especially regarding women . The book turns out to be a testament confessional of bad deeds and here is the place where the other guys find out about it at the same time we do.3 . Good chapters on John Carobi , the replacement singer . This material was not skimmed thru as what could have happened.4 . Excellent yet depressing stuff about family.I would have liked to have read more of details during recording sessions , not necessarily why they wrote songs , but how the success of certain songs brought them specific fame ( ie GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS was number 1 in japan etc ) .The guys indicate at the end of the book that ther willbe a second book . It should be an interesting read .	1
I believe all she writes about is so true . The book makes a lot of sense but again it 's only doable if you put forth the effort . It 's definitely a good read with a lot of great ideas , just pick what will work for you .	1
Definitely a good book . A very entertaining read , and just as much inspirational as a helping hand , giving us a look inside the crazy and surprising world of Sports . Unfortunately when it comes down to the top of his wrestling-career the style of the book transforms into the style of the Rock , which is very entertaining too ( and funny ) , but I miss the personal insight that I get a lot of at the beginning about `` The most electrifying man of sports entertainment '' , when he was only called Dwayne ... The book gives a couple of insights into the biz as well . All in all a good book , written in Hollywood-style . The only reason it does n't get 5 stars is because I read Mick Foley ... and that 's better . Despite the Rock 's coolness and bombing lines , nothing beats Foley 's honesty and sense of humour . But I do recommend this one to lovers of wrestling and those interested.Not a must , but a worth ...	1
The Rock takes fans on a guided tour of big-time professional wrestling , a highly competitive business in which a handful of gifted and lucky performers dominate , and all others dream of a moment in the spotlight . He provides a breathtaking , minute-by-minute account of WrestleMania , the Super Bowl of the pro wrestling , including an intimate backstage look at rehearsals with his opponent , Stone Cold Steve Austin . And he discusses in heartfelt detail the loss of his friend and coworker , Owen Hart . Filled with genuinely touching stories of love and strife , hilarious anecdotes , inside accounts of an industry whose machinations have long been shrouded in secrecy , and dozens of previously unpublished photgraphs from The Rock 's personal collection , The Rock Says ... is -- as the Rock himself might put it -- & quot ; the coolest thing since the other side of the pillow ... If you smell what The Rock is cookin ' ! & quot ;	1
Before 'Have a Nice Day ! ' , wrestling stars were respected for their athleticism and charisma , but intelligence and personality ? Since Mick demonstrated that a pro-wrestler can compete not only in the ring , but on the NY Times Bestseller list , we have seen a swarm of biographies released on almost every headliner that the business has seen in the last 20 years . From his ability to take a beating , to his love of amusement parks and kids stuff , Mick easily draws you into the glorious mind of Mankind . Foley , Foley ! !	1
I have noticed that a lot of the other reviewers have given this book five stars , and I must admit I almost did too . But five stars is a 'perfect ' mark , and although I enjoyed reading this book a lot , I would not say it was perfect . I feel that reviewers - myself included - give products the full five stars far too easily.This book follows the career of Mick Foley , otherwise known as Mankind , Dude Love and Cactus Jack , from late high school to the point where he first captured the ultimate prize in wrestling , the WWF championship . His journey to superstardom was long and hard , and Mick sustained some horrific injuries , but he overcame all the obstacles and acheived his dream . Mick Foley is Tanacity Personified and this book shows just how much effort it can take to become a professional wrestler . This book is very funny and very well written , I never got bored reading it and would almost certainly read it again.Although this book would be a good read for people not familiar with the world of wrestling , the book is cleary aimed at wrestling fans . You have to have watched a fair ammount wrestling to understand what a 'Tombstone Piledriver ' is or to understand Mick Foley 's relationship with Al Snow.Another minor flaw in my oppinion is the lack of information about Mick 's relationship with the Undertaker , with whom Mick competed in the infamous 'Hell in a cell ' match , or with his tag team partner Glenn Jacobs - a.k.a . Kane.None of these flaws are very big , just enough to reduce my rating to four stars.Initially I thought this book was written a bit too soon because Mick Foley 's career was by no means over when the book was released . Now , however , I think the timescale is pretty much perfect . The point where Mick won the WWF title was the right place to finish . If you write a book about acheiving a goal , continuing after the point where you achive that goal is pointless . This is a book about acheiving every wrestlers ultimate goal , so winning the world title belt is the perfect place to finish.This is an excellent book and I would recommend it to wresling fans . To non-fans I would still recommend this if the concept of the book appeals to you.This is an excellent autobiography , and a great achievement by Mick Foley . Given the courage and tanacity that Mick has shown I almost feel guilty for not giving it five stars .	1
Read this book if you are interested in the REAL behind the scenes story of Professional Wrestling . This book shoots straight . No kayfabe unlike some other books by wrestlers . A treat to read .	1
The WWF decided to publish wrestler autobiographies back in the late 1990s , and Mick Foley was the first to have his published . It not only dominated the wrestling fan 's eyes , but the mainstream as well and was received so well by everyone it went to the top of the New York Times bestseller lists for non-fiction . And he wrote it all himself.Not only is it a classic telling of some truly amazing personal stories , but its organized so well it flows flawlessly . The book is written superbly , and its impossible to forget that it was written by a man who 's undergone serious punishment to his entire body , what with his vivid descriptions of the events within the pages.Bottom line , this book is a must read . I 'm proud to have a first printing hardcover on my shelf to read again and again .	1
This is a great book for the lay reader . It introduces one to a set of difficult concepts without ever talking down to you but not requiring you to get a degree in biochemistry before reading it . There is a wealth of references to studies done by major universities around the world which is really appreciated . I started using the Zone Dietary protocols in 1995 when his first book was published , Enter the Zone . It worked just as he said it would . Over the last two years I 've strayed and gained about 10 lbs of unwanted body fat . Having recently gotten myself reorganized , I 've started again and not only has the fat just melted off , but my BP has lowered . I 've also started taking the Omega3 and can tell a difference . There are other books on Omega3 but Sears has a way of dealing with the subject that gives one the sense of talking to a family member about the stars : he 's right there and present and witty and smart . I only wish I 'd known about Omega3 years ago . It , too , works . And what in this day of endless infomercials is more fascinating than to find something that works just as its promoter says it will ? ? ? My only criticism of the book is in the editing and proof reading . The publishers should be horse whipped .	1
I 've owned this book now for two years and I keep referring to it over and over . I wish that Rachel Ashwell would come out with these types of books more often . This book continues to provide me with decorating inspiration . Also , I very much appreciate the fact that she does n't go on and on for paragraphs at a time . Many other books on decorating have a tendency to become boring with too much wording . Rachel just gets to the point . Rachel 's home is lovely and the pictures are fabulous . It 's too bad that the Shabby Chic stores throughout the country do not follow her advice about home decor articles being inexpensive . I was utterly shocked and completely disappointed that the prices of things in the Shabby Chic stores are way through the roof , and unaffordable for anyone except the wealthy . It is a total contradiction of what Rachel Ashwell advocates in her books .	1
I originally checked Getting Over It out from the library but less than halfway through I had to run out and buy my own copy because I knew this one would be a keeper ! Plus , I knew I would need to have a copy handy to pass around to all my friends.Anna Maxted has created one of the funniest heroines I 've encountered in long time in Helen Bradshaw . Helen is having a very bad year ~ her father has just died , her mother is losing it , one of her closest friends is having serious boyfriend trouble , and she 's just been kicked out of her home by her & quot ; God 's gift to women & quot ; flatmate , Marcus . To top it all off she may have just driven away the true love of her life before they even made it to their second date . Helen muddles her way through it all with a sense of ( wicked ) humor and a little help from her friends.While this is undoubtedly a romantic comedy , there are some serious issues here as well . If you 're looking for a fun read with a little something more than can be found in your typical & quot ; chick-lit & quot ; fare ~ look no further than Getting Over It . It 's a keeper !	1
... but not much else . I liked this book far more than I liked Running in Heels , but I recommend Maxted 's Behaving Like Adults over Getting Over It . I found the character to be somewhat shallow as a bulk of the book was about her sex life with bits of her father 's death thrown in there for pity and reflection.All in all ... the book was okay by chick lit standards but I would definately read Behaving Like Adults or Something Borrowed over this book .	1
I love her books . Each one is not like the typical romantic comedy . She really truly enjoys her characters . A great easy read .	1
Running in Heels : A Novel by Anna Maxted is my personal favorite . Seems like everyone despises this novel but I absolutely adore it . The main character Natalie suffers from anorexia , has lost her best friend and is falling in love with her best friend 's brother , Andy . Natalie has issues with food , her brother , her parents and everyone in between . I love Maxted 's writing , she 's a hoot and breaks your heart at the same time . I highly recommend Running in Heels , it wo n't cure cancer but it will likely heat your summer up . Enjoy !	1
I am surprised by the negative tone of the reviews here . I really enjoyed this book , I found it moving and funny and very believable . Yes , the heroine is somewhat selfish , but we are privy to her innermost thoughts and most of us would appear selfish if the world could hear our inner monologues ! I liked the way the anorexia snuck up on the reader ; since the book is from Natalie 's point of view , that made sense to me . My only criticism - I loved the character of Babs and wanted more of her .	1
This is an awesome book about the fast rising star in the WWF . Kurt has won many amatuer wrestling titles including 1996 Olympics but his short WWF wrestling career European title and Intercontinental titles witin 5-7 months in the business is unheard of.Kurt is a fast rising star that has come through a lot of injuries to be one of the Top Stars in the business.If you love biographies about wrestlers this one is for you . This book is filled with stories about life behind the curtian ( acceptence of other wrestlers ) . Not to mention a lot of good pictures in the book . I reccomend this book to ALL Wrestling fans.God Bless America	1
Sometimes someone who is strong on the outside may have several weaknesses on the inside . From growing up in a dysfunctional home , Chyna was clearly affected . None the less her perserverance paid off in the end as she is a top flight superstar in the WWF . Some people may classify her as a bully but those individuals are only looking at half the story . Her actions toward Matthew Broderick were not so terrible . Sometimes those Hollywood snooty actors think they are bigger than the & quot ; regular & quot ; people in the world.I like the personal approach Chyna uses where she inserts quotes from Chris Jericho , Hunter Hearst Helmsley , and Mick Foley . The style is very down to earth . Yes , maybe she is bitter in spots but from where she 's been , Chyna has gone pretty far . I do n't know waht the issue some people have with spelling mistakes . Truthfully , I think they are reading from the wrong book . I would have liked to hear a little more in depth about her character development within the WWF and how she developed friendships but in general this autobio touches the heart .	1
Okay , I like most readers of this book ( I 'm certain ) first picked it up because the title is catchy . The actual substance of the book is much more modest , and largely centers on hammering the need for campaign finance reform . Along the way , Huffington also trashes pollsters , and emphasizes the need for citizen participation in government and in charitable activities . There really is nothing particularly new or ground breaking here , but Huffington does a nice job of gathering together in one place a lot of anecdotal information about her topics . She bashes politicians of both major parties evenly , and is apparently disappointed that the nominees for the fall elections are Bush and Gore rather than McCain and Bradley . Bottom line : A good read , but do n't expect to learn anything that rocks your world . One of her fundamental points -- that the American people have come to expect their political leaders to be a pack of thieves -- is all too true .	1
Are you basically apolitical , sick and tired of the shrillness of the extreme left and right , and/or do n't trust the media ? Then I strongly encourage you to read this fabulous book by Peggy Noonan , who in a very concise , clear , honest , and dispassionate manner , tells us why it is time for the Clintons to be gone . . . and forever . Whether you are a Democrat , Republican or independent , you will clearly see why this nation deserves better . If you read only one book this year , let it be this one .	1
Wally Lamb has again proved what an excellent writer he is . This book is fantastic . At times it can be slow , almost a burden ... but there are so many layers that it is amazing anyone can write this way . I 've already passed it on to the leader of a book discussion group . I believe it is over 750 pages . A main thread is the killings at Columbine H.S . and the post traumatic effects it has on the school nurse who witnessed the shootings first hand and also her husband who must deal with her aftershocks . But there is so much else to the book , diaries from some of the first involved in the Womens Rights movements , families who survived Katrina have their story interwoven . It 's just so much intertwined into an unforgettable book . The book felt like a cherished friend and I was sorry when it ended . Wonderful Wally Lamb has done it again ! Do n't miss it .	1
I read this book when it first hit the bestsellers list . But I was much younger , single , and childless . Now as a married middle aged mother , I appreciated this book so much more . It was as if I was a different person back then . Although I had a bevy of life experience at the time of the first reading , I had no knowledge of the challenges that would face me over the next two decades . I clearly UNDERSTAND this book now . It 's a beautifully written book that is a source of comfort for me . I have lived on the Connecticut shoreline all my life and had the honor to work at the York Correctional Institution years ago while I was getting my degree . There is so much to this story that it is hard NOT to relate to some of the great characters in the story . It 's a rich beautiful tale that is a constant reminder to me that this state , as much as I might hate it at times , is a place of bountiful history and beauty that I claim as my own . Like the characters in the story , I have made many choices , both good and bad , that led me back to this place in a way to reclaim my soul .	1
As in `` She 's Come Undone '' and `` I Know This Much Is True , '' awful things keep happening until you want to slit your own wrists . But Wally Lamb has a way of making the ending so uplifting that it 's worth the emotional trauma . One of the best books I 've read this year .	1
The Hour I First Believed is a great , big , philosophical saga of a novel , told by one Caelum Quirk , a man who has n't so much as lost his way as never found it in the first place . As the story opens , he 's living in Littleton , CO with his third wife , Maureen , and they both work at Columbine HS . The first third of the book leads up to the Columbine massacre , which changes Caelum 's life forever because of his wife 's close brush with death . Maureen develops post traumatic stress disorder , from which she struggles unsuccessfully to recover . After Columbine , the couple returns to Caelum 's home town , to the house he grew up in . During the next several years , Caelum learns , through adversity , some truths about life and God.The Quirks are decent people , but like everyone , they 've had their problems . Using a technique that flashes between past a present , the reader is shown how Caelum arrived at his state of limbo . The central metaphor here is Hartford 's Park River , forced underground about a century ago . One of Caelum 's friends mentions how family history is like a spring that flows along unnoticed , only to bubble up unexpectedly from time to time . Having lived in CT for most of my life , it was enjoyable to recognize places , people , and attitudes that color the saga.Caelum 's is a compelling story , but Lamb has packed in what seems like dozens of other stories , in the process visiting such celebrities as Mark Twain and Nicola Tesla , such disasters as the Civil War and Hurricane Katrina , and such social problems as the treatment of incarcerated prisoners and the subjugation of women . The biography of Caelum 's pioneering great grandmother could easily be told in a novel of its own.Pushing 800 pages , it requires a patient and motivated reader to reach the `` hour '' Caelum `` first believed '' , because that is n't revealed until the very last chapter . This is a valuable book , packed with truths about the joys and struggles of life , but be prepared for many detours and excursions along the way .	1
Caelum Quirk and his wife , Maureen , are teacher and nurse , respectively , at Columbine High School . On a day that Caelum is arranging the affairs of his late aunt back east , the Columbine massacre occurs . Maureen is unhurt but traumatized ; before she recovers she is hurled into another tragedy . Caelum tries to keep the family afloat , but the circumstances of Maureen 's trials and Caelum 's struggles with his new students and with his aunt 's estate lead to new challenges and mysteries , including new knowledge regarding his own past.Author Wally Lamb develops the characters in The Hour I First Believed fully ; you will feel you understand their pain , their shortcomings , and their motivations . This is what I expect in a novel ... believable characters , an intriguing plot , and a logical story.I might have to take a look at his other books !	1
I applaud Dr. Schwartz ' work with OCD patients and his use of meditation techniques in his practice . The integration of eastern meditation techniques with western science is in a very amorphous state at this time . However , Dr. Schwartz ' book details how they can be used together in this instance with a quantifiable positive result.This book is easy to read , thought provoking and a positive contribution to scientific integration of non-traditional medical techniques . I recommend it to everyone curious about the role of the mind in medical care.I am a practitioner of mindfulness based meditation . I am not a Buddhist . I say this because I have experienced some of the insights that this meditation technique offers and know first hand that it has the potential to be a powerful tool in modern western science . I applaud Dr. Schwartz and other medical researchers ( Jon Kabat-Zinn and James Austin come to mind ) for their pioneering work . I also say this because it skews my perspective on this book . But a skewed perspective is n't necessarily a false one .	1
This is a great cookbook . I was worried that the superstars would give us their protein shake recipes , so thank goodness I was wrong ! I love to cook , and most of the recipes looked like winners right out of the box . I have tried several , and enjoyed them all . Stone Cold 's cinnamon ice cream is sinfully delicious , and Undertaker 's spinach tetrazzini is excellent . J.R. 's recipes are consistently some of the best in the bunch , so it 's fitting that this book was his baby.Some have criticized this book for not being health-minded enough . Yes , it 's full of fat and sugar and beer and other yummy things . What 's wrong with that ? Eaten in moderation , this food wo n't hurt you any more than a restaurant meal . I say , bring out the ribs ! Bring on the beer and ice cream ! And if you do n't want any , well ... more for the rest of us . : )	1
What a great year Gregory Maguire must be having . His novel & quot ; Wicked & quot ; has been adapted into a Broadway musical , and has opened to mostly positive reviews , and his new novel reminds people what he was so good at in the first place . His last book , & quot ; Lost & quot ; a modern ghost story seemed to be written by a competely different person from the man who reinvented both & quot ; The Wizard of Oz & quot ; and & quot ; Cinderella & quot ; . He has now returned to his fairy tale roots and concocted his own spin on the Snow White story . Blending the factual Italian Borgia family with a land owner named Don Vincente and his beautiful young daughter named Bianca , Maguire manages to tread very closely to the story many people are familiar with . The one area he diverges from is the dwarves . Gone are Bashful , Sleepy and Doc , and instead are creatures more of the earth than human.I also thought his & quot ; apple & quot ; was both inventive and clever . A well told retelling .	1
While this has been my least favorite of the Maguire books that I 've read ( although , admittedly I have not read Lost , which I 've understood to be not quite Maguire caliber ) I am still awarding it 5 stars because it was still one of the most amazing reads ! I have said this is in other Maguire reviews , but I love the worlds he creates . The imagery and storytelling is unrivaled . I love that he takes incredible scenarios and makes them totally believable , such as the dwarfs , the apples , etc . All of the magic and fantasy that happens in the worlds Maguire creates seem totally plausible and time and time again I find myself getting wrapped up in his stories . If you 've never read a Gregory Maguire book , I 'd suggest Wicked or Confession of an Ugly Stepsister first , but if you are a fan of Maguires works this will not disappoint at all !	1
Timothy McVeigh was an average child growing up in rural America . An outstanding soldier who fought for his Country with no reservations . Then his mind changed regarding the US Government and the deletion of individual rights . The author did a great job describing the actual bombing event , and the subsequent trial . You could feel nothing but sympathy for Bill McVeigh , Timothy 's father . A great , fast read . If you are interested in how a lot of the militant groups are thinking in this Country , this will give some insight .	1
A very good story with well developed characters . Jess Walter is a heck of a writer in my opinion . Allot more depth than the average mystery police procedural out there .	1
This book was recommended to me and I found it quite enjoyable . I would also like to recommend it . It is a true story of learning to cope with death , but also close-mindedness and people trying to push their values on others . One thing I found rather odd though , was the integration of another of Crutcher 's books and even of Crutcher himself into the plot of this book . The controversy it provoked in the school and community was certainly realistic . I 've never seen the integration of author and other books done this way and I found it intriguing . It truly served a moral purpose within the book in addition to the added benefit of promoting another Chris Crutcher work . Some might find that fact annoying , but it was done well enough that I overlooked that and actually look forward to picking up another Chris Crutcher novel . This one had very good messages , was entertaining enough to keep me up all night reading , and was well written .	1
This book is simple , yet it gets the point across very well ... when Mom is gone , she still loves her little one all day long . My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves it and it has helped her with separation issues . A must have for all mothers that want to reassure their young ones ! ! !	1
In the years since John F Kennedy was elected President two kinds of `` Kennedy Myths '' have developed . The positive one portrays John , Robert and Ted Kennedy as liberal `` saints '' committed to a progressive revolution in America . The negative one shows the Kennedys to be rapacious libertines who throw off all social conventions in their personal and political lives . Leamer 's book transcends these over-simplistic views and covers the lives of patriarch Joseph P Kennedy and his four sons , bringing out the complexity of this unique group of people.Those who hold a negative view of the Kennedys will find much material to confirm their beliefs . In truth , Joe Kennedy seems to be a man with almost no redeeming virtues , a virulent anti-Semite and pro-Nazi , greedy and miserly , manipulative man . The second generation of Kennedys learned not to ask where the family 's money came from . Yet Joe Kennedy went on to implement needed reforms in the Security and Exchange commission to which he was appointed , supported the progressive FDR and became the most powerful Catholic in the US.Similarly , JFK went on to be an incredibly reckless philanderer who possibly compromised the very security of the US with liasons with women involved with organized crime and possibly even East German intelligence , but at the same time , he inspired young people to volunteer for the Peace Corps and set American on course to landing on the Moon . RFK goes to work for family friend Senator Joe McCarthy and works with the Mafia in order to destablize Castro 's regime in Cuba , but then also works vigorously against the same Mafia and institutionalized racial discrimination ( and somehow escapes the taint of his association with McCarthy ) .Leamer show that JFK and RFK were definitely not `` soft liberals '' . JFK was the best friend the `` military-industrial complex '' ever had , pouring unprecedented amounts of money into defense and space projects . They supported a very tough anti-Communist policy in Cuba and Vietnam which almost led to nuclear war and did lead to the quagmire in Southeast Asia . One important point about the book is that Leamer does not demonize various `` bad guys '' from the positive Kennedy Myth , such as General Curtis Lemay and other military men from the Cuban Missile Crisis , FBI Director J Edgar Hoover who was friendly for many years with Joe Kennedy and showed great forebearance with the many indiscretions of his sons and had good reason to be concerned with JFK 's behavior and finally Lyndon Johnson who loyally served the Kennedy Administration and yet was treated with contempt by RFK and many of JFK 's advisors ( although not by JFK himself ) .Finally , the author has come to the same conclusion that other investigators have arrived at regarding JFK 's assassination , namely , that it is very likely that the assassin , Lee Harvey Oswald was motivated , either with or without the knowledge of agents of Fidel Castro , to kill Kennedy in revenge for the Kennedys ' attempt to kill him.It is not easy to cover the lives of five different men in a singel book , and much had to be left out , but as an introduction to this remarkable tribe of American aristocracy , this book is indispensable .	1
Going Postal is by far Pratchett 's best Discworld novel , filled with engaging characters and a gripping story . Absolutely recommended reading .	1
I decided to pick up a Terry Pratchett book after hearing an excerpt read on the Grammar Girl Podcast as part of Audible.com 's plug . I ended up with this one as an almost random pick.This was one of the most enjoyable comic novels I have read in a long time . Pratchett 's dialogue is laugh out loud funny at times -- I had to call up some friends to read excerpts to them . I especially appreciated his razor sharp wit and the alternate world he has created.I did n't give this five stars because I was slightly disappointed with how everything wrapped up at the end . While this is true of most comic novels , I will say that this novel has a more coherent and cohesive story than the vast majority in the genre.This book is one that will rekindle your enjoyment of reading .	1
... scenes EVER is when Stanley has one of his & # 34 ; moments & # 34 ; . I simply love all the wordplay in this book and the intricate ( and not so intricate ) character connections . Another Terry Pratchett winner !	1
One of America 's foremost poets and novelists wrote this beautiful collection of essays post 9/11 to bring a bit of solace and sanity to readers . Kingsolver never fails to move the reader with the effect of her art , whether fiction or not.Particularly pertinent these days when Monsanto 's power seems unstoppable is Kingsolver 's essay explaining the pernicious effects of genetically modified organisms . It was more than clear and persuasive . It celebrated natural processes with great beauty and effect . It is a rare prize to find biologist and poet combined so agreeably in one writer .	1
I liked the intimate connection that developed between the main characters . In my opinion this is a well written book .	1
I love Elizabeth Lowell 's Rarities Unlimited series and this book is no exception . She makes each of the characters come to life so you get to know them .	1
I 'm impressed with the stuff that John Steele Gordon dug up in his research . There are so many little tidbits that really add spice to his narrative . This is one of the best economic history books that I 've read .	1
This personal account of Pascal Khoo Thwe 's life works for me on many levels . I feel as if I understand what it is like to belong to a culture so different from my own . His writing was deeply moving and so descriptive that I do believe I can feel and experience how his culture lived.I wonder at the cruelty of human beings and I ponder this horror , especially in the aftermath of the disclosure of American torture of prisoners.I think about how the author struggled with the ability to make judgements during his time at Cambridge because of living his life under an authoritnarian regime . He had no experience of forming opinions and I understand now how Russians are having difficulty with a democratic constitution and are regressing to authoritariasm . So goes Iraq ? I wonder at a jungle and climate and the paradise he describes.I think that the reader , myself was not up to the job when I skipped quite a bit of the jungle fighting toward the end.I would have liked to know more of how he was able to make friends at Cambridge which he only hinted at.Maybe another book ?	1
Okay , so admittedly I have not yet read MacGregor 's novella , since I have yet to get my hands on the preceding Master of Desire , but a thoroughly enjoyed Kleypas ' Against All Odds and Quinn 's A Tale of Two Sisters.Though I 'm sure some of my emotional response to Odds can be attributed to the fact that I was dead tired while reading it ( I could NOT put it down ! ) the story was incredibly sweet . Kleypas has a way of portraying intense emotion ( longing in particular ) through her words that is unmatched . Plus we get the added bonus of catching up with Jake Linely and the Craven 's , need I say more ? Then of course there is Quinn 's story . She may not elicit the same emotional response that Kleypas does , but her characters are always extremely likeable and easy to relate to , and , of course , her wit and humor make the pages sparkle.Wonderful book to curl up with .	1
I was waiting for this book to come out and my wish finally came true i love the book so much !	1
When I first started reading romance , it was historical romance that got me started . And a great part of my current obsession is due to the brilliant work of two best-selling authors for this genre , Julia Quinn and Lisa Kleypas . I instantly fell in love with their work , the characters they so wonderfully painted on the pages , and the numerous romantic 'sigh ' moments in their stories . I 've read most of both of their books , and because of this , I have n't read anything from either one in a few months , from Quinn it 's been probably a good year . But as soon as I picked up Where 's My Hero ? , all the reasons why I love their work came rushing back to me ! They truly are the ruling queens of the historical romance genre , and I doubt that will ever change.Where 's My Hero ? is a collection of three short stories , one from each of the authors , but even though they were much shorter than their normal books , I did n't feel cheated like I normally do while reading an anthology . Instead , I was left with the same , warm and fuzzy feeling after reading the h/h fall in love and have their HEA -- - no disappointments or feeling like their story had been cut short . That in itself is saying a lot , since if you ask most people , the one downside to an anthology is the rushed feeling you usually get from it . But not with this one -- it was perfect , just like any of the authors ' other books.I laughed , I sighed , and I 'll admit it , I came pretty close to tearing up more than a few times while reading Jake ( Against the Odds ) , Simon ( Midsummer 's Knight ) , and Ned 's ( A Tale of Two Sisters ) books . Only great books do that to me , and this was easily one of the best I 've read in a while from this genre -- it just reminded me yet again that even though it 's fun to find new authors , and enjoy their books , sometimes you have to return to the beginning . And if these three authors are n't some of the great 'beginning ' authors for romance , I do n't know who deserves the title ! 5 STARS ! Touching , charming , and spectacular , Where 's My Hero ? is the perfect book to read any time , especially if you 've been having a bad book lull , unsure of what to read next -- pick up this book , sit down and get comfortable , and be prepared to pull and all-nighter , because once you get started , you wo n't want to put it down until it 's through ! And even then , I 'm sure it will only be long enough to go and find their other books ( whether you 've read them all and they 're shelved nicely on your keeper shelf , or you 're a newbie and you have to rush out to the library ) . After reading WMH ? , I 'm hungry for more LK , JQ , and KM ( or SK as she 's known as in the paranormal section ) .	1
Over the years , there have been many writers ( mostly British for some reason ) who travel the world , writing about what they see and who they meet . They usually sprinkle the story of their travels with bits of trivia , anecdotes of inconveniences they encounter , accounts of recent events from people they meet , and brief historical accounts of the areas they visit . Among the past figures who have written in this vein are Rebecca West ( Black Lamb , Grey Falcon ) and ( more recently ) Paul Theroux . Christina Lamb , a British journalist , apparently aspires to membership in this group : if this book is any indication , she should be a shoo-in.Lamb travelled to Afghanistan in the late 80s and spent a couple of years there as a correspondent . She made friends with various mujaheddin who were fighting against the Soviets and their Communist allies . She spent a good deal of time with a group that she knew as the `` Mullahs on Motorbikes , '' a bunch of religious fanatics who were fearless in their opposition to the Communist regime . These fighters later morphed into the Taliban ( which name merely means religious students in Pashto ) and ran the country . Though she did n't ever meet Mullah Omar , their leader , she was acquainted with several of his important subordinates . She was also rather close to Hamid Karzai , who 's now the President of the country.Fast forward 12 or so years . Lamb has done other things ( she mentions at one point visiting the Amazon rainforest ) , but when 9/11 happens , she decides to return to Afghanistan and see if she can meet her old friends and acquaintances , and catch up on what 's been going on since , and what 's likely to happen in the future . She visits Herat ( where the sewing circles were literature classes for women , banned by the Taliban and so disguised ) and other cities in Afghanistan , and also travels around Pakistan interviewing people who were involved in Afghan politics in the last 15 years or so.The result is a sort of a stew of everything you might expect to read in such a book . From stories of kites being banned , and why , to the fellow trying to wash the blood out of the ground at the Kabul football stadium , to the poet who resisted the Taliban by writing subversive poetry , and the fellow who owns the only convertible car in Kabul , this is a somewhat whimsical tour of a war-ravvaged country full of people who are scarred , wounded , and yet strangely optimistic . It 's illustrated with photos ( some by the author , some by a photographer she took with her on her second trip , and a few by others ) that are throughout the book , and also in an illustration section in the center . It is n't well-organized , and Lamb 's eccentric British prose might be a bit jarring to American ears , but the overall result is quite entertaining , and frankly rather informative at the same time . I highly enjoyed this book , and would recommend it .	1
The Sewing Circles of Herat helps to bring today 's Afghanistan into a clearer perspective . Christina Lamb lets the reader better see the faces and hearts of many who have been , to most westerners , simply names mentioned when Afghanistan was bigger TV pull . Lamb brings to light , through sharing her own experience , the personal and political struggle of the people of Afghanistan . Through her , the reader is able to get closer to the individual stories of strength and sorrow . She introduces warlords and foot soldiers , and through her they become real people . It is too easy to sit back and watch the newscasts , to turn them off and forget . In knowing more about the people involved , it is harder to forget.Lamb does not tell an entertaining tale . She reports her own fascinating experience , and she reports it well . She gives the reader the details . She shares her deep love for a people , culture and county , and through her writing she allows the reader to share some of the sadness and joy with her . Above all the reader learns , of history , heroism , bravery , and caring . Lamb helps the reader see the landscape of Afghanistan in years past and now . And the reader , through Lamb , mourns the loss of what was Afghanistan , and hopes for what its people might have in the future .	1
I think Lorna Sass has got to be the best pressure cooker cookbook author . Every recipe I have made of hers has been delicious . Tonight we tried the lamb shanks with white beans and rosemary , which turned out great . It was hard to decide what to make , with all of the delicious options - Mexican pork stew with posole , old-fashioned beef stew , garlicky sausage with greens and beans , etc . One caveat : if you have one of the newer electric pressure cookers , keep in mind that you will have to do some math to ensure the proper cooking time . Electric pressure cookers mostly cook at 11 psi , while stovetop machines are more powerful .	1
Whether you 're new to pressure cooking or a veteran , this book offers great advice , tips , and fantastic recipes . I recently became vegan , and I find the recipes easy to adapt ; often she gives vegan or vegetarian versions . Like all of her cookbooks , and I have most of them , this is clear and easy to follow and the results are magnificent . Five big stars .	1
This book is very thorough and interesting . I highly recommend it for any first time pressure cooker consumer.It has a great variety of recipes in it and covers quite a broad number of types of pressure cooking.We loved the Pork with mustard and apples , simply delicious !	1
A good fast read full of scary possibilities . As a medical professional myself , it is easy to see the potential reality . Keeps a person glued to the book .	1
Okay ! This is not a NEW topic - but look at the latest cover of Time Magazine . Racism is still an issue in this country and Mrs. Roby reminds us that racism is just not black & amp ; white but also black on black . This story hits home for me as I was subjected to negative actions at my workplace where I was the only Black . I found the writing style of this book to be both capitivating and fast paced . My mother also read my copy and she lived through racism ( she was born in the South ) . My Mom throughly enjoyed the story . My NAACP Card reads : & quot ; If you think the struggle is over is over ... think again & quot ; Until this blemish on American society is cleared , I am thankful to those like Mrs. Roby who keep these issues alive .	1
A Perfect Lover was a book I thoroughly enjoyed . Having read all the previous Cynster novels by Mrs. Laurens , this one did n't let me down in the least . While the overall formula of rake must fight his own fears of love and convince the girl to marry him was there , the characters made it decisively different.Portia Ashford and Simon Cynster , the last available Cynster , have been friends since birth . Both intelligent , prideful and stubborn they have played the games of dueling tongues for a decade . While Simon has a reputation for being , a rake and Portia a woman against marriage , choosing to spend her time on personal endeavors instead of trolling the ton that is until work in an orphanage helps her see the desire of family.Attending Lady O , a character I always loved , a saucy , wise , revered woman of the ton , Portia decides to test her husband assessing abilities at a country party . Simon a family friends just happens to be attending at the same time . As sparks fly , and Simon always the protector , assumes his role only motivated in a different way murder and fear threaten Portia before either can decide what they feel.Portia was different in this one in that she is extremely independent and intelligent to a fault . Over analyzing everything . Simon on the other hand is n't the domineering conqueror of his previous Cynster sires . Oh the instinct is the there , but having been surrounded strong females Simon 's character rightly evolves with those influences and patiently waits for Portia to figure it out.A must read , enjoyed it greatly .	1
All Cynster books are amazing.They offer Love , Mystery and suspense.Ca n't wait to finish one book to see what is going to happen in next book .	1
I totally enjoyed this character after meeting him earlier as Honoria Cynster 's brother . I thought Caro was interesting as Michael had to unravel the secrets she was hiding as to why she said would never marry again . The books starts out in one direction and then takes you in another . What can I say this is a winner .	1
Gave this book to my brother as gift and he enjoyed it very much . A must read ! Great price on the book !	1
This a a great book , highly relevant these days , a classic that everyone should read . History reveals man 's shocking capacity for mass madness and insane cruelty . What is the good , the purpose of pain , suffering , decay and so much abject brutality ? One answer is simply that in a polarity universe the one extreme of purity and goodness can not exist without the other extreme , meaning contamination and evil . In the temporal hologram , everything rots . It is simple physics , or rather metaphysics . A more western oriented explanation of the purpose for such brutal and destructive energies is offered by the plain speaking , down-to-earth American philosopher Eric Hoffer in his classic astute and insightful book , ` The True Believer , Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements ' [ 1951 ] : '' The discarded and rejected [ of any society ] are often the raw material of a nation 's future . The stone builders reject becomes the cornerstone of a new world . A nation without dregs and malcontents is orderly , decent , peaceful and pleasant , but perhaps without the seed of things to come . It was not the irony of history that the undesired in the countries of Europe should have crossed an ocean to build a new world on the [ North American ] continent . Only they could do it . `` From this pragmatic assessment we may approach the idea that those we consider to be the dregs of society , the losers , and the various forms of eroding contamination , chemical or ideological -- are in fact the seed store of new forms . Bacteria and viruses , which destroy weakened living cells , have been with us forever . In a cyclical universe , there must be energies that decay , dissolve , and destroy . Often these are hidden beyond our sight , decomposing matter under rocks , in putrid slime yucky-goo rubbish , or silently lurking inside our human bodies.Sometimes they are found in the malcontent , the alienated , misfits who in blaming others for their `` spoiled lives '' [ Hoffer 's words ] overthrow the existing order . Hoffer counts political and religious fanatics such as Hitler and Lenin among these ` true believers ' who throughout history have murdered thousands in the name of truth.Eric Hoffer worked on the San Francisco docks as a stevedore in the 1940s . He was self-educated and his experiences in the realm of physical labour combined with a lack of ivory tower intellectual conditioning , which so is often removed from any real life , and therefore produced an extraordinary view of the human condition . I first read ` The True Believer ' back in Texas high school , perhaps 1962 , and I admit that I did not and could not have understood it in those days -- but even in my tender green naive teens , I realized that there was something deeply profoundly true in this book . Because of the recent rumours of revolution , I remembered and thus reread this classic , which was reissued in 2010.Hoffer makes it unequivocally clear that what motivates the True Believer into fanaticism is his or her own lack . They are as he says the disaffected , the poor , the unemployed , the misfits , outcasts , minorities , adolescent youth , the ambitious , the obsessed , the impotent in mind or body , the inordinately selfish , the bored and sinners . `` ... they are wholly without reverence toward the present . They see their lives and the present as spoiled beyond remedy and they are ready to waste and wreck both : hence their recklessness and their will to chaos and anarchy ... Thus they are among the early recruits of revolutions , mass migrations , and of religious , racial and chauvinist movements , and they imprint their mark upon these upheavals and movements which shape a nations character and history . `` Hoffer 's keen observations are brilliant , timeless , and yet more relevant than ever .	1
Seldom is the conflict for ideas so succinctly stated ! ! For a view of personal/political freedom without an overlay of national idolatry , this is the book .	1
this is my first sue miller novel and i have now ordered many of her other books . i found 'the good mother ' brilliant , engaging and thought provoking . the author has a beautiful writing style with a spine tingling attention to detail . whether your heart breaks for the mother in this story or whether you believe she deserves everything she gets , this novel will evoke strong feelings and opinions . a very real exploration of motherhood and its complications .	1
Some authors are just too big for short stories . Dan Simmons writes often massive novels , sprawling sagas and layered meditations dense with detail . To try and compress all that into a short story generally means that something has to give despite anyone 's best efforts . Some traits one just ca n't switch off , it seems.This collection winds up being a catch-all of sorts , putting together five not quite short stories that really do n't fit anywhere else except that they were all written by the same man . It 's a tribute to his skill and consistency that such a collection does n't feel disjointed , as stylistically they 're all fairly similar even if the subjects and tone vary wildly . A neat addition to the stories themselves is introductions that Simmons wrote for each entry . Far from simple one paragraph descriptions of what you 're about to read , he goes into great detail and discusses the formation and formulation of the story itself , giving some insight into his process ( as much insight as you can ever get into an author ) . This winds up being a mixed bag in some cases , where he gives away perhaps too much background info ( in the first introduction he discusses how his teaching experiences informed the story you 're about to read , using a description that shows up almost word for word in the story itself . . . ) and goes off on tangents , where a discussion about Hollywood screenplays to introduce the last story winds up veering out of nowhere into a near-rant about the brilliance of Shakespeare and how much he does n't like critics like Michel Foucault . Sure , Dan . The introductions do n't wind up being a soul-bearingly fascinating as Harlan Ellison 's tend to be in his collections ( Simmons comments as much , to be fair ) and despite the fact that he 's both cooler and smarter than you he comes across as fairly likeable for a guy who just happens to hang out with Stephen King and his wife.But what about the stories themselves ? Also a bit of a mixed bag . Out of the five I 'd say maybe only one works from start to finish , with the other having their moments . Some of it is hamstrung by Simmons wanting to show off how much research he 's done for something ( he 's not shy about relaying his influences and references and almost everything he does calls back to some literary or historical figure , including the title of the collection ) , `` The Ninth of Av '' suffers from that to some extent , although in cases like the mountain-climbing story , it works in the tale 's favor , adding a lot of realism to something that most of us will never experience . Some of it is hampered by having a cool idea and little else , with only his style managing to carry him through ( `` Looking for Kelly Dahl '' never seems to reach the emotional heights that he 's clearly attempting to scale , seeming oddly pat instead of intensely jagged ) .There is a return to the Hyperion universe for those people hunting down such things but it winds up being one of the flatter stories in the lot , spending a lot of time on the setup and everyone jawing about the setup being coming to a resolution far too quickly in what feels like two pages , and the science-fiction never quite feels as dazzling as it should . It remains a nice look at the fringes of what was happening in the main books , but it 's far from essential.The key story to me comes toward the end with `` On K2 With Kanakaredes '' , the story of a trio of mountain climbers tasked to reach the summit of a very large mountain with an alien bug who also wants to scale cliffs . It takes what could have been played for laughs and manages to do it completely straight , just toeing the line between utterly strange and utterly normal . It comes near to being a heartwarming story about how adversity brings people together but veers away from cliche-land and just winds up being a solid and well told story , not attempting to impress me with its research or pedigree . `` The End of Gravity '' that closes out the set is another winner , maybe not fully-formed ( it was a screenplay that he appears to have adapted to a short story ) and comes very close to merely proving that he 's read up on the Russian space program , but it winds up being a love-letter to why we go into space , as well as a reflection on mortality and the idea that maybe this earth is n't all we 're bound for , in this life or the next.A very readable set , all told . None of it is going to make you forget `` Hyperion '' or his other triumphs and I 'm not quite convinced that he 's a short story writer rather than a novelist that dabbles in short stories from time to time but if nothing else the stories prove that the man has ideas and is quite capable of wrapping stories around them . The fact that they 're not always compelling stories speaks more to his ambition and less to his skill ( the central idea of `` The Ninth of Av '' minus the attempt to connect it to the doomed Scott Antarctic expedition is something that lesser writers would have spent an entire series trying to develop , here he merely tosses it off and will probably never go back to it again ) and proves that even his failures ( or `` less than successes '' ) are still fascinating in their own right . Fans who have n't been here yet will probably want to dive in right away , newcomers would be well advised to pick up his novels and prepared to be blown away first .	1
I liked this initial offering from Mitchell Graham.This is a story of magic rings and the people they align themselves with ; resulting in the inevitable good vs. evil scenarios.This book is well written and easy to read ; the characters are interesting and show some development throughout the novel . As with any good fantasy , this story has magic , some great battles , a splash of romance , friendship and betrayals , and above all , an interesting tale.The only minor negatives were1 . ) a somewhat slow and tedious midsection . ( the beginning and end were well paced and interesting ) 2 . ) a map of questionable quality ; poorly drawn and of limited use ( more accurate detailing would have be extremely useful ) . Yet , having said that , I 'm grateful for a map ( any map ) , as some fantasy writers do n't include one with their books , making the movements of their heroes so difficult to follow at times.A good first book to this series ; a few minor shortcomings , but I 'm looking forward to book 2.4 Stars	1
I have n't had a chance to do the research to verify or discredit Stahl 's outrageous accusations in this demented thriller ; however , at the very least , if we assume that it is the work of a brilliant madman , the novel is a wicked good read and a fun way to pass the time . If Stahl 's outrageous conspiracy theories are anywhere near the truth , then we are up a creek ! Funny , bizarre , crazy , gritty ... You find the worst of the best in this novel .	1
My first grader loves these books ! ! ! ! A fun fast read for her , it keeps us laughing ! We recommend it ! Great fun	1
This book is a lot of fun . Beautiful pictures and tells a really nice story . Not religious , just an imagined story about how the Easter Bunny started up . A sweet book to read to young children .	1
I really love a good childeren 's book and what I really love is to find out how the author came about creating /telling their story . Well , this story has an interesting background in that the author wrote it because he son wondered about the Easter Bunny , where did he come from and how did he get the job of being the Easter Bunny and with all those questions became this very book ! This is a really cute story of the Easter Bunny 's early years.There is a family of a little round older couple who have a white bunny and during the winter months the couple make baskets , chocolate eggs and dye and decorate eggs for the children in the town . Every year the little bunny watches and begins to help out ... eventually to take over the `` family business '' completely because his parents had grown much older and his secret of where the Easter bunny lived was getting out among the children in his town . So , with great big waves from his family the Easter Bunny leaves home and find a nice hollow tree where he and some of his friends make the baskets , chocolates and eggs.I think this is a very cute book , the illustrations are soft and beautiful . The story is one that once read will become a family tradition to read the night or week before the Easter Bunny comes to visit your home just like the T'was the Night Before Christmas ! Enjoy ! ! !	1
I love the cover . Unfortunately , I do not believe it has arrived as yet , probably due to the amount of snow in the United States . Also , for what age level is it written ? Thank youlElizabeth	1
Good book . I like Pearlman 's writing most of the time . After a while it does get a little repetitive , however . The Mets were good . They did a lot of drugs . They were n't nice to their women . Except Mookie Wilson . He was nice .	1
In his finest work since exposing John Rocker for the dope that he is , Jeff Pearlman helps baseball fans recall one of the most entertaining teams ( both on and off the field ) in baseball history.1986 Mets were World Series Champions and partying champions . They were as much dirtbag as they were lovable and Pearlman does an excellent job of showing us both sides.Doc , Darryl , Keith and Gary `` Ivory Soap '' Carter all comeback to life in this absolutely entertaining stroll down memory lane.5 Stars for Mets fans , 4 stars for baseball fans .	1
Ah yes , my beloved `` Muts . '' I was turned onto this book by a friend that who knew of my undying obession with the orange and blue . Happily I dug into this book with the hopes of recalling nostalgic images and events from my childhood . To my surprise , by about 10 pages into the book , I absoluetly loathed just about every single member of the '86 Mets ! The drinking , the boozing , the sex , the fights , the drama and the personalities all read like they were from an early draft of the `` Major League '' film script . Amazin'ly , this book is all true ! It chronologically details the events that lead up to that championship season and their unbelievable '86 campaign which brought home our first commish trophy since '69 . The book includes wonderful in-game stories as well as the MANY off-field antics which made this team legendary . This is the only book I have ever read , aside from Howard Stern 's `` Private Parts , '' that actually made me laugh out loud . It is the perfect summer read , and it should be on every Mets fans ' bookshelf . Enjoy the stories , the heartbreak , the laughs and the good memories . Then turn on MSG and wonder what went wrong . Let 's Go Mets ! !	1
A highly enjoyable first book , which had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion . Not easy to put down , and readable in one sitting . If you 're in the mood for the type of cruel humor one would expect to see in an indie film , then The Cheese Monkeys is definitely worth a read.Several prior reviewers make good points esp . w.r.t . character development and the ending ( clever but odd ) , but these shortcomings really do n't take away from what is certainly a funny and highly original work .	1
I love cheese , and own several capuchin monkeys , and neither cheese nor monkeys are featured to any real extent . A real letdown . I suppose , however , that if you 're into sadistic teachers and package design this 'd be right up your alley . Worth buying just for the Chris Ware cover design , though .	1
Have you ever had a teacher so obnoxious , so hateful , and such a jerk that you will never forget him\her ? much less forgive for putting you through such hell ? Now , do you remember anything from the class ? If you 're like me , you do ; now you know why that teacher was so crass . Not everyone likes the technique but darn-it it works.This book highlights an experience with such a teacher . It is told from the perspective of a student who gleans the meaning of his instructors ' tirades while still taking the class . Unlike me who just recently figured why a teacher would browbeat students with nearly impossible problems and unreachable expectations.This seems to be on a lot of design lists , and rightfully so . Do n't be fooled though , this is for anyone who was pushed to a higher level of understanding by someone who was a jerk.You are the worm , life is the plow .	1
There are books that without them you would never have a basis for any other to follow . The Valachi Papers is the book that set the Mafia on its heels and allowed the world to see and finally get a look into the `` real '' underworld.By far one the best reads I have had this year and certainly a must read for anyone weho thinks they know what the mafia is all about . This is the book that started it all and gave me my start into a whole world.What this book does is tear down the walls of mystery and open your mind to new ideas about the mob . The book shows how it happened and what took place . Due to some of testimony being somewhat graphic younger reader may want to take caution before they begin the book.The book is far better than the movie and knowing that this was told by someone on the inside makes it all that more exciting to read . Overall if you want to know where it all began , than look no further that this book .	1
I read this book a year ago , and while I enjoyed it I enjoyed it so much more this time because I had read the other Hiatt books about the Saint of the 7 Dials . I am often confused as to why authors and publishers do n't make these series books clearer as to which books come in what order . Wickedly Yours is probably about the 4th book in this series and having an understanding of which other men had been the Saint and the history of how Flute was an important character to Wickedly Yours I felt helped me to enjoy this book so much more in the second reading . It was also helpful understanding what nasty people the Mounteaths were and why Lord Peter was even more concerned about Sarah remaining with that family any longer than necessary . I really enjoyed this book - the love story between Sarah and Peter was a beautiful one and it was a great addition to this series by Brenda Hiatt ! ! Good read but read the others first !	1
cute story line	1
I bought this book because it was cheap but Victor 's & # 34 ; be anybody 's lawyer if they have money & # 34 ; attitude made him annoying . Even though he redeems himself eventually , I just hung on because I ca n't seem to not read the whole thing for any book .	1
A mystery story - a love story - a story of friendship - a story of betrayal . I could n't put it down and must say it brought back memories of my own development . I wish Lashner would write more of the Carl stories . Carl 's character has many deep and complicated tangents .	1
Dysfunctional families is something I know something about . And Traci not only came from a dysfunctional family , but she also had a pretty face and killer body ; her life was trouble waiting to happen . ( How killer a body ? Natural C cups , never augmented . She actually got a modeling contract with L'Eggs pantyhose , till they found out she was a porn star . ) When she walked away from porn and booze/drugs , she did so completely . She stayed clean and sober , and she stayed away from porn , even when she was starving as a legit actress . I could n't have done that.Traci Lords in her forties is strong , confident , and has exorcised her demons . Good for her.She writes the book as if she were a reporter observing her life : This happened , then this happened , then this happened ... . The one-star reviewers are upset that she did n't constantly beat herself up , `` Oh , I was a wicked , wicked little girl . '' But then , the one-star reviewers think that a gorgeous fifteen-year-old who falls into nude modeling after being raped , lied to , and browbeaten should nonetheless be held completely responsible for the agreements she makes .	1
This a great book well worth reading anyone who likes Debbies books will love this one , The angels play a nice role and keep the book interesting . I lve reading Debbies books have n't read a boring one yet . I plan to read them all I am just getting started . Reading Debbis books keeps me awake at noght . I take her books to bed and ca n't stop reading .	1
I really like this book . I 'm a Torey Hayden fan . She always goes out of her way to help those children . I also like the storyline of this particular book . The endings of her books are always good .	1
I had read this book years ago and usually really like his fiction books . Very interesting read about him testing the waters of several different types of para normal activities . It 's not hokey in the least and a great book about expanding your boundaries and always keeping an open mind .	1
This book fascinated me . I 've read most of Crichton 's fiction , and I 've been particularly interested in the way his characterizations of men and women have changed over time . Now I understand the background for those changes in his work , after reading this chronicle of decades of this author 's personal development . `` New Age '' experiences do nothing for me , but I nevertheless found it interesting to read about Crichton 's perception of such experiences - and , especially , about his need to have them . The medical school chapters and the straight travel chapters engaged me best , though , because I could relate to them in a way I could n't hope to relate to his accounts of channeling , exorcism , and so on.Worth reading for Crichton fans , although I 'm not sure how much interest this book might hold for someone unfamiliar with his fiction .	1

ALMOST PERFECT is the delightful debut Regency romp by versatile author , Denise Domning writing as Denise Hampton . Filled with compelling , believable characters and storyline , Ms. Hampton yet again proves herself as a romance author at the top of her game.Fast paced , exciting , intriguing , and original , ALMOST PERFECT is a perfect read . Whether writing Medieval , Elizabethan , or , now , Regency England and Scotland , Ms. Hampton will capture the reader 's attention from first page to last.I highly recommend ALMOST PERFECT as one of the best Regency romance historicals you will read in the genre . A definite keeper !	1
I agree with & quot ; A good novel -- for more than just the sex ! & quot ; . Read that review . The Editorial Review is a little misleading . It does n't mention the fact that Rowena is forced by her step brother in her actions from the beginning . All Lindsey 's books are worth reading and rereading . I have done so many times and will continue to do so .	1
Okay , as you 've no doubt realised from reading the other reviews here , this book is controversial . It has two rape scenes , beginning with a man being raped by a woman ( against both of their wills ) and followed by him exacting revenge by visiting the same treatment upon her . I do n't like rape . I 'm always one of those people who call for tougher penalties in rape cases , and if I were a narrow minded person I might have condemned this book for featuring rapes.However , I must admit , I found this book utterly compelling . Sometimes it shocked me , I 'll grant you , but this gave me a great excuse to explore my own feelings about the subject matter , and also gave me a view into the psyche of both the perpetrators and victims of such crimes . It was an intelligent work of fiction from a skillfull writer , and she did n't gloss over the realities of the situation . There were consequences of actions for the characters , who had both been essentially good people before being forced into a brutal situation not of their choosing , and they were also forced at later times to confront the feelings of guilt and shame that committing such acts brought out in them . They both grew from the experience , and became better people . They proved themselves worthy of forgiveness , and eventually love -- love that they both earned the hard way . I liked that . I like to think that people can redeem themselves , especially when they are not really bad people but rather just victims of tragic circumstance . Another thing , too , is that this book is set in medieval times , and they were harsh times . There was a reason they were called the dark ages -- dark things happened ! To shine the light of modern ethics and standards on the behaviour of medieval characters is unrealistic.I liked this book . It was exceptionally well written for its genre . I liked that it dared to go beyond the normal light and fluffy boundaries of your usual romance books . I liked that it featured a PREGNANT woman as its sexy leading lady , proving that yes , pregnant women can be gorgeous , and men do find them attractive ! And I liked that the story was utterly compelling , to the point where I could n't put it down . I laughed . I cried . I FELT for the characters . I cared what happened to them . It was realistic enough that it made me forget it was a work of fiction.But when it all boils down to it , that 's what this book is -- FICTION . The author clearly does n't condone or encourage rape in any way . She is simply presenting us with a story , to entertain us , to make us think , to let us see the world from a different perspective . That 's what the fantasy of books is all about . It 's not the real world that you 'll find in books . It 's this other place , one where we can go to to see the things that are n't done in real life . And I for one enjoyed this book , and the places it took me to , controversial subject matter or no.I think there will be a few people who will refuse to read or enjoy this book for fear that by liking it they might be showing that they approve of rape . But think about it this way : if you watch a horrifying slasher flick , does that mean you want to go out and murder people ? No ! If you watch a movie about a junkie , does that mean you condone drug use ? No ! This is the same principle . You do n't have to support what the characters are doing to like the book . And just because you may end up liking the characters , does n't mean you have to like everything they do . Intelligent readers will figure that out , and look beyond the controversy to see what this really is -- a good book .	1
This is the story of Mr. Kimball . Told from the stories of his three discarded wives.Three more diverse women you 'll never read . The first was a typical wife of the 60 's who could not find her way once she had been discarded . The second was a career woman of the 70 's who found herself alone and wanting to connect with someone on an intimate level . The third and final wife was a strong yet temporarily-insecure woman who stood the easiest without Mr. Kimball.Ken Kimball gave each of these women something . His first wife he gave two beautiful children and a stable life , while he was there . His second wife he gave the intimate connection she needed , though it was based on a pack of lies . He showed his third wife that she truly was beautiful . All of his actions were demonstrably selfish , yet , in a way , each woman was forced to grow because of his selfish acts.The story starts out with Ken Kimball dying , and no one coming forward to claim his body , no one really even knowing who he was . The story ends with members of all three of Mr. Kimball 's families together , discovering what happened to him.I would n't want to know someone like him , or even like the various Mrs. Kimballs , yet , I enjoyed this well and cleverly written story very much . ( * ) >	1
This book is well written and pulled together with all the characters connected in some interesting way which makes you realize that none of the meetings are by chance . Definitely read ! ! ! Loved IT	1
I read this a few years ago while on vacation in Hawaii . My wife and I rented a house on the North West coast of the big island and the owner had a nice collection of books in one of the bedrooms . Although I had brought my own books , once I started reading this , I could n't put it down.It is an engrossing inside look at a CIA family . It also inadvertantly gives an inside look at someone who is now called a 'third culture kid . ' These are children of parents who are diplomats , missionaries , military brats , global business executives , and in this case a CIA spy . The children in these families have their own unique set of struggles in life since they do not grow up in their home country . So for me , the book worked on many levels . You get an inside look at CIA operations , a look at an important CIA operative as well as a look at what its like to grow up as a kid who does n't fit in anywhere.I have no way of evaluating the historical accuracy of all the details . I do n't think that was the intention of the book . It is just one kid 's reminiscences of growing up in a family where you 're dad is an important CIA operative .	1
Tony Horwitz has had two back-to-back smash hits in his Pulitzer prize-winner Baghdad Without a Map and the critically acclaimed Confederates in the Attic . He now has added another gem to his body of work in Blue Latitudes : Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before.James Cook seems largely to be forgotten to history . Yet , his was probably the most incredible voyage of discovery . Just the story of how Cook came to be a navigator is a fascinating one . In a day where the children of laborers did not receive an education , a mentor took notice of Cook and paid for four years of school . Cook was ambitious and worked hard to fill in the gaps in his education . As a teen , he moved from a store clerk to working on a coal ship to finally joining the Royal Navy , where he rose very rapidly through the ranks.The tales of Cook 's three voyages to the Pacific are an unbelievable story . This man of humble beginnings became one of the world 's greatest explorers . In the course of 10 years , his Pacific travels covered over 200,000 miles at a time when one third of the world was unknown and unmapped . He traveled `` 140 of the earth 's 180 degrees latitude , as well as its entire longitude . '' He probably named more places ( rivers , islands , points , bays , bluffs , etc . ) than any other man , before or since . He was a shrewd handler of men -- both those above and below him in rank . He was a prolific writer of journals and logs , which are still read today . Cook was also a brilliant surveyor and chart maker , and his map of New Zealand was used up until the 1990 's ( when it was finally replaced by satellite images ) . His voyages also led to the discovery of thousands of new plants and animals , and his claiming land for Britain helped to eventually lead Britain in becoming a major empire that spanned 11 thousand miles.But what makes Blue Latitudes a true delight is Horwitz 's travelogue . In his attempt to follow in Cook 's footsteps and see locations as Cook might have seen them , Horwitz travels to Canada , Tahiti , Bora-Bora , New Zealand , Australia , Niue , Tonga , England , Alaska and Hawaii . With his sidekick Roger , his travels are often hysterical . His week spent on a replica of the Endeavour ( complete with 14 inches of hammock space ) is especially a hoot . But it is also depressing to discover that the European explorers ( not just Cook ) changed the way of life on these islands . Many brought with them disease , STD 's , materialism and religion . They also tried to eradicate the native culture and native populations . Horwitz also discovered that while Cook is revered in England , he is pretty much reviled among the Pacific nations he visited . Yet ironically , journals , diaries , logs and sketches from Cook 's travels are in some cases the only record of these native cultures . It was also distressing to Horwitz was to discover that very little actually exists from Cook 's time . Places he lived , worshipped and worked are pretty much gone . The sites he visited are also much changed . Cliff Thornton , president of the Captain Cook Society told Horwitz that `` the best you can do is catch an echo of the man . You can almost never reach out and touch him . `` The only thing lacking from this almost perfect book is pictures . There are plenty of maps and a painting of Cook . It would have been fascinating to see photos of the many places Horwitz traveled . I do n't expect to be traveling to Bora-Bora , Tonga , Niue , Tahiti , or the other locations mentioned any time soon . Still , Blue Latitudes is a wonderful book and even those not much interested in history will find a fascinating story here .	1
In a way , this book comes in two flavors - Captain Cook 's actual voyages , and the author 's visiting the places that the captain had discovered . Of this , the three voyages are well known and have been written up sufficiently . But Horwitz puts an interesting slant on the natives Cook encountered rather than the discoveries themselves . We learn about the Tahitians and their customs , the Maoris of New Zealand , the Aborigines of Australia , and the people of Tonga , of Hawaii , and the Aleuts of Unalaska . He acquaints us with Cook 's main helper , the biologist Joseph Banks , and some of his officers , such as William Bligh of later mutiny fame , and John Ledyard who is still remembered in Connecticut ( ironically , the town bearing his name now sports a gigantic native Indian gambling casino ) .And so the islands were pristine and at peace . It is the author 's aim to show us how this has changed into murder , thievery and disease . There are not many of the natives left and those he found were most anxious to forget about Cook . his discoveries and their aftermath . It would be wrong , of course , to blame all this on Cook . If it had not been for him , somebody else would have discovered the islands of the Pacific - and probably with the same results.The conclusion : One should not supplant an original culture with one 's own imported one . Both will suffer and there will never be a satisfactory result . Yet such action continues into our 21st century .	1
An exploration into the life and career of James Cook . It 's told in an clever fashion with historical narratives of Cook 's voyages intermingled with the author 's visits to many of the locales Cook visited . The theme throughout is the impact the encroachment of western civilization had on the these previously undisturbed societies . Many of these locations , as related by the author , are beset with squalor . But , the true story runs deeper than that when you consider Cook 's motives . He comes off in this account as well meaning , and even sympathetic to the the well-being of the natives he encountered . Was he the bringer of doom or simply a benign first of what would have inevitably been a series of visitors to bring the disease and depravity of western europe to the pacific ? Or , was the cultural impact truly negative ? Despite the many accounts of the degradation suffered by the inhabitants of the islands he explored , this story reveals that the natives are not unanimous in their regret that western culture invaded their lands , merely disappointed it played out the way it did . The present-day narrative which includes the retracing of Cook 's voyages is engaging and humorous , thanks in large part to the author 's keen observations and jovial travel companion .	1
I have read several books by Tony Horwitz , the first was Confederates in the Attic . In all , Tony brings humor to what could be a very dry historical excursion . I especially enjoyed the rants of his mate from Australia , Roger , with this one . What a perspective on the world this one has ! Tony brings a contemporary view of what in Captain Cook 's voyages were such different societies and cultures than currently exist . I enjoyed the contrast and wonder at the causality of why the different islands and cultures changed in ways so different from each other . A fun and enjoyable read . Thanks , Tony .	1
I read this some years ago and found myself laughing out loud at times at the misadventures of the author and his traveling companion . The book 's informative in taking me to places I 'll never visit . Anyone interested in Cook or the Pacific will enjoy this book .	1
The fourth in his series of Abel Jones Civil War mysteries . I love his writing . It is so descriptive and always full of mystery , intrigue and humor . Major Jones is now in Great Britian trying to track down the murderer of three Union agents who have been seeking news of the British building a war ship for the Confederates . As usual , Parry brings in all sorts of interesting characters and sometimes you do not know their relevance until revealed later in the story . Jones works under our great Ambassador to Great Britian , Charles Frances Adams , son of John Quincy Adams and grandson of John Adams , founder of our great nation . It makes me proud to be an American when I read Parry 's work . His portrayal of diplomacy at the international level when Britain was ruler of the seas shows how modern day politicians have no back bone and the American people tolerate weak leaders . Abel Jones shows his dedication to justice for all men . In this story he acquires a ward of a 12 year-old orphan girl and renews his relationship with Col. Tice-Rolley , his colonel who had saved him from hanging in India and who was now , himself , a forceful evangelist to the lost of Glasgow . A wonderful figure to remember . The story also reveals more of Jones ' Indian soldier life and helped me understand how ruthless Britian had to be to rule the world . I loved the whole story , from beginning to end .	1
This was one of the rare Amazon.com recommendations that actually paid off - it popped into my recommendation list after reading Starship Troopers . They share the same genre and begin on a similar premise - in the near future , the main character is passively swept into a large conflict beyond their control . But they are every different books , and I enjoyed The Forever War far more than Starship Troopers.In a way The Forever War is two books in one . In the first you are introduced to the gritty details of a space war in Haldeman 's version of the near future . I enjoyed the descriptions of the perils of battles on other planets , how something as simple as falling over in a space suit could be fatal . If the whole book followed this course it would be interesting but pretty forgettable . But that 's when you get to what I would consider the 'second book ' - coming home.It 's in the coming home that this book becomes a classic and , in my opinion , should be much more widely read . It 's not the only novel to explore the implications of near-lightspeed travel but Haldeman does this masterfully . You watch as the protagonists attempt to cope with a world that has changed enough to become uncomfortable , then changes more and more as time continues to speed by them.This dynamic sets this book very much apart from Heinlein 's Starship Troopers . To some extent Troopers felt like a soapbox upon which Heinlein could lecture the reader about how he thought the world should be run . Not so Haldeman - his versions of the future are crafted to seems slightly more and more alien , rather than something to aspire to or even something to warn against . His characters do not blindly follow the rhetoric the way Heinlein 's do - rather they simply do what they can to cope with the situation they 're continually thrown into , coping with the strangeness.The clear difference between the 'two books ' could have left this novel quite disjointed , but the writing style is fluid and you genuinely feel for the protagonist . You follow him on this journey , experiencing the disjoint with him , and hoping he comes through it in the end.If this book comes up in your recommendations , do read it . It is a gem well worth reading .	1
This is great science fiction , time dilation giving us glimpses of humanity every few hundred years as our race battles against the competing issues of the drive to procreate and the limited resources available to a growing population.In many ways the war just seems like something to throw money at to keep the economy stable . It 's based on a lack of communication . For both of those reasons it seems to resonate with our current political climate.The Forever War asks many questions . One of the biggest : Will there be war as long as there are differences ? And the corollary : Are these differences worth holding on to ? The only real answer that we get is that love still manages to find a place in all the insanity , even when both love and the very concept of individuality border on extinction .	1
The Forever War just may be one of the finest novels ever written about man 's experience as a solider , but it is much more than just a good military sci fi book . Its story encompasses questions like `` How does love transcend time ? '' `` What justifies killing ? '' `` Is change only noticeable from a distance ? '' and `` Can humans survive our own evolution and still remain human ? `` It has action , sex , interesting technology , cool locales and a really interesting premise : If a war was fought in space , then relativity would place some soldiers far from home , both in time as well as place . What would the result be for the survivor of that war ? If you like thoughtful , fast-paced adventure , read this book .	1
The book flowed , things were n't over-explained , and it was an enjoyable read with a very realistic treatment of interstellar war .	1
Interesting and exciting with new and refreshing views of future wars with non earth life . Left an uneasy feeling about what our earth may evolve to . Very good writing with a little excitement for every taste .	1
The Forever War sneaks up on you . When I started to read the Forever War , it seemed like a poor man 's precursor to 'Old Man 's War ' ( by John Scalzi , another great read ) , with a less interesting protagonist , and a slower plot . Boy was I wrong . In a very matter of fact way , Haldeman makes his epic a strong commentary on the plight of veterans of any conflict , and the ceaseless waste of war . While it started off a bit slow , the momentum it picks up after each successive 'campaign ' , ends up propelling it to an extremely satisfying finish . If you are looking for a philosophical action tale that pulls no punches , look no further .	1
This was my first book by Joe Haldeman ... ... ... .and it wo n't be my last . Very imaginative and fun to read . Not predictable .	1
sorry , I do n't like reviews that tell me about the plot.I enjoyed this book . it was a fun and interesting read .	1
This is an excellent novel - hard-hitting , lean , and inventive , while also psychologically deep . A friend gave it to me in high school , before I even knew what the Nebula and Hugo awards were , and not only was I taken right in by it , but it 's remained a favorite.The other reviews cover the story and its worth better than I can , so I 'll just focus on the different editions . I was given the original version , in the 1976 paperback . This is the version that won the awards , and the edition on this page is the third version , the definitive author 's edition . I bought it for my nephew and was surprised at the change.The difference is that the middle section - when Mandella returns to Earth between tours of duty - used to be ten pages . Now it 's forty pages and tells a very different story . The first version worked well as a calm between the space battles , but now Mandella 's blowing away rapists and thieves with shotguns.It 's as if Ender , in Ender 's Game , when he 's taking a break on Earth between sessions at Battle School , did n't lounge out by a lake , but got into a forty-page battle with raiding outlaw gangs . It 'd not only be a long tangent and distraction from the story , but it 'd make it seem as if the Earth was n't even worth saving . That 's the way this section plays out , and perhaps why Haldeman 's editor , Ben Bova , cut it.The earlier , ten-page version presents Mandella 's break from duty as boring and bureaucratic , which is much more accurate for a soldier returning to civilian life . There 's also scenes that are much more meaningful to the story , such as when Mandella 's words are twisted by the media.I admire Haldeman a great deal , and I even admire how he stuck to his guns and put out the version of the story he favors , but in this case I have to agree with Ben Bova 's idea to cut that section out.Still , you can always skip those forty pages and read it later as a short story of the world gone wrong .	1
I enjoyed this book . You can easily look past the 1997 references . Battle sequences were great . This was the first Haldeman book I read and recommend it !	1
This is a great one , and I 've read through it several times already . Haldeman 's exploration of time dilation as a concept in war and human relations is really interesting and ( as far as I know ) one of the only books to really delve into this aspect of space travel.Not only is this some excellent science fiction , but it offers an interesting perspective on war since the author is a vet . I 'd say give this a shot if you 're looking for a quick read that you 'll definitely want to read again !	1
This is such a satisfying , delightful children 's book about Thanksgiving . It has a series of warm illustrations showing a family in their cozy house , while the seasons change and they celebrate their gratitude for each other and the things they love . It does a good job listing things children are grateful for , from school to art to food , and there is a page at the back of the book for children to continue the list of things they are thankful for.Studies have shown that people who express gratitude in their daily lives feel happier , and I think this book does such a nice job of encouraging children to find meaning in Thanksgiving and to find gratitude in general . Very lovely.My three year old likes to hear this story over and over , in part because of how beautiful the illustrations are : the kids look real and slightly messy , the food looks delicious , and the house looks wonderfully cozy , with a fireplace and sleeping pets.This is a great addition to your collection of kids books for fall and Thanksgiving !	1
One of my fondest memories of childhood were the Amelia Bedelia books . The only one I remember was the Baby one , and while it 's been many years since I last read it , I still have very colorful memories of it . I vividly remember a scene with the banana , and the tarts . I also remember something about chocolate salmon ( she dipped salmon into chocolate ) , but I do n't think it 's in this book . I would love to read these books again , but I have n't found them anywhere .	1
I received my Kindle as a birthday gift and the first book I bought was Death is Forever . This is one of my all time favorites by E Lowell and I have read thepaperback more times than can remember . For anyone who likes EL this is great read .	1
This is a very funny book and is especially good to be read to toddlers . When Amelia is asked to stake the beans , she ties steak to them . When she 's asked to make a tea cake , she makes one with tea in it . It offers a very good example of how what we say makes all the difference in the world , and whether or not what we are saying is what is being understood . When Amelia is asked to weed the garden , she thinks she 's supposed to add more weeds , not `` unweed it '' as she states in the story . It 's a little long - about 50 pages in my edition so it 's a little much for a youngster to sit through but if they can do it like mine can , it is a great book to teach . I highly recommend this one .	1
This is a sequel and still holds your interest , started as one book and now is going forward with more books and more suspense.good read	1
My rating means this book is top-notch Leonard . He delivers the smooth dialog that does n't miss a tick ; the characters-Jack , Lucy , Cullen , Leo , Franklin , Roy , etc.-who are so full of their different strains of life ; and the plot that is fiendishly entertaining , exquisitelyreal and firmly rooted in time and place . Extravagantly recommended .	1
Cynthia Kaplan 's & quot ; Why I 'm Like This & quot ; alternates hilarity ( experiences at all-girl camp , being a waitress ) with life 's more sober times ( putting her grandmother in a nursing home , having difficulty getting pregnant ) . Because of the mood swings ( for lack of a better phrase ) the book undergoes , it 's sometimes a bumpy and uneven ride -- but whether she 's being serious or poking a proverbial elbow in your ribs , Kaplan is a talented writer who 's fun to read . Some gems from the book : One of the many pitfalls of working in a restaurant is that eventually you will wait on your peers . Or people who had been your peers before they became successful bankers and you became a waiter . First , there will be the requisite & quot ; Hi ! & quot ; & quot ; Hi ! & quot ; & quot ; How are you ! ? & quot ; & quot ; What are you doing ? ! & quot ; ( What am I DOING ? I think it 's pretty clear : Good evening , my parents spent fifty thousand dollars on my education , would you like some more bread ? ) After the initial pleasantries are dispensed with , you will embarrass everyone with & quot ; Let me tell you about our specials. & quot ; * * *On one of the last true blue days of August , when the oppressive midsummer haze had been blown away by some zippy cumulus clouds , opportunity knocked once more . At the counselors ' pool party , [ my crush ] Jamie Karlin asked me to rub sunblock onto his back . He had the most unbelievable , fair , freckly skin . Had I this moment to live again , I would have offered to apply the sunblock later , in private , with my tongue . * * *Writing about her father 's love of gadgets : He was one of the first people to have a phone in his car . This was the late 1960s , decades before cellular technology , and it was essentially like having a shortwave radio in your car . . . At stoplights , my brother and I used to open the window , hold out the receiver to the driver of the car next to us , say , & quot ; It 's for you , & quot ; and collapse in hysterics . * * *Kaplan covers so many different topics I ca n't begin to cover them all here , but every baby boomer woman I know who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s will love this book . I even had a bathing suit like the one in which Kaplan appears on the cover -- kindred spirits in more ways than one !	1
This is a phenomenal book for science fiction lovers . It is n't an easy read for those who are n't very technologically savvy , but what do you expect given the subject . Many have complained about the length , but I found the story to be fine in length . The character development was well done and really made it easy to get involved . One complaint was the lack of major female characters . I guess I do n't see this as a valid complaint against a book . I would n't make the same comment about something like the Ya-Ya Sisterhood . Its the story the author chose to write . In the WWII part of the book a major female character would have been out of place given the military aspect of the book and the time period . Its just the way things really work.I believe this book does a great job of creating an engrossing and believable world that the reader can really enjoy . It left me wanting more . The ending does cut off , but not too badly . Not all ends were tied up , but that 's not always bad . Leaving a little to the reader 's imagination is always good , and you 're never going to reach a good ending where all ends are tied up . Instead you 'll end up with an ending like Harry Potter , where many people just complain about it .	1
Anyone who has ever worked for or with a start-up can not help but appreciate this book . The plot may border on absurd at times , but the subplots and actions of the protagonists in the modern thread of the story are like something right out of the valley . As someone who works for a dot-com , I had instant sympathy for the characters.Other people who are not familiar with IPOs , start-ups and the nearly surreal world of tech , may not appreciate the modern story line except in how it ties the two threads together.The parallel anachronistic thread having to do with code breaking and intelligence in WWII was a richly absurd plot as well with a definite Catch-22 flavor to it . However , the characters were deeper and more interesting . Stephenson tied the WWII thread to enough historical fact to make the story riveting and believable , and the links to the modern thread were a wonderful literary tool.The Cryptonomicon faded about 80 % of the way through and sputtered to the finish line , which is why I can only give it four stars . I would enthusiastically read another Neal Stephenson book , but I thought the ending to this very enjoyable book left too many questions unanswered and abruptly closed what was an excellent story.As a stylistic note , I believe that the nearly constant chatter about the sexual needs of the male characters was distracting and did not add to the story . It was a useful mechanism within the story to explain some of the actions of the characters , but it was overdone.If you read this book , please follow with Singh 's & quot ; The Code Book. & quot ; It gives the history of cryptography and will fill in the details of both the modern and WWII threads of the book .	1
Stephenson ability to create a believable world with over the top characters is unsurpassed . Definitely thinking about encrypting my email . Where this book could have used a good editor , what it really needs is a great ending . Recommend this book for all the reasons we read Neal , he makes us think and laugh .	1
Here 's a gargantuan meisterwork for ambitious readers who can appreciate ambitious writers . Step aside if you have a short attention span or a lack of patience . Everything about this book is really really really big . In addition to the 918 pages in a rather small typeface , every scene , conversation , subplot , and theme is written by Stephenson to the point of absurd information overload . And that 's the point , turning this into a manifesto of tech-obsessed sarcasm and paranoia , with prose that is ponderous but surprisingly fun to read . Nerdy language is used to great descriptive effect , especially in the way Stephenson describes settings and character developments & # 8211 ; one example among many being `` his net worth is a negative number that can only be expressed using scientific notation . '' Stephenson 's writing takes on the characteristics of the scatter-brained deep thoughts of his various math-nerd characters , and this makes for a bodaciously braindraining read.The narrative goes off on bizarre multi-page tangents like a mathematical theorem about when a character 's bike chain will fall off , or a specific mechanical treatise on another character 's method of eating Cap'n Crunch . You 'll often wonder where Stephenson 's going with this longwindedness and why you 're struggling through so many hundreds of pages of woolgathering , but with patience you 'll find that the prose and style of this novel add immeasurably to an astonishingly intricate and ambitious plotline . With this story , Stephenson has blown the roof off of cyberpunk and modern speculative fiction , seamlessly linking the ultramodern with the past into an incontrovertible whole.Most notably , Stephenson has defined retro-cyberpunk here , as he reconstructs nerdy codebreakers and analog cryptanalysts from WW2 into the original hackers and the geniuses behind the earliest digital computers . The war is transformed into a paranoid web of codes and spying that underlie the everyday horrors of slaughter and destruction , and Stephenson uses this device to analyze the true inhuman futility of war and its effects across generations . Meanwhile , his intricate conspiracy extends from the war to the present realm of super high-tech , with modern hacking and programming descending from the cryptanalysis of the war . After nearly a thousand pages the disparate storylines come together into a profound and wide-ranging conclusion about the human condition , while Stephenson has also ably explored the relationships between people , economics , history , and technology . This novel is not for everybody , but those in the proper frame of mind will find it to be an immense achievement for Stephenson , as is the reading of it . [ ~doomsdayer520~ ]	1
From Neal Stephenson I am used to great futuristic or near-future science fiction . This is more like current fiction mixed with historical fiction , with a bit of science and family history holding the various stories together . You would think that confining himself to more & quot ; real & quot ; circumstances than he usually plays with might stifle Mr. Stephenson , but no . With this novel he proves that he does n't need to step into the fantastical to weave some great stories together and convince us that no matter how intelligent and creative any one of us may be , he can always come up with something wonderful to surprise and please us . I ca n't wait for his next novel , whatever it may be .	1
Neal Stephenson is a very fine author with talent to spare . In many of the other reviews I read here people complained about his ending ... well I will buy that . However : the read was worth it . In fact , I would have been content had there been another 900+ pages ... that is how amazing this man 's writing is , how interesting his characters are and how fascinating the subject material he covers is . It will be hell waiting another two years for him to gift us with another book , whether or not it relates to the current release .	1
This is a very hard book to describe - it is a bit Catch-22 meets Enigma meets the current raft of cyper-punk novels . But unlike so many books that try to be many things and fails , this book pulls it off , and superbly.A multi-threaded book that travels easily through time , it covers WWII , the pacific , cryptography , and modern developments in computing , managing to include engaging characters and a great plot . The ending does sag a little , but this may be because after 915 pages you are so wrapped up in the book you do n't want it to ever end ! While much has been made of the author 's cyber-punk credentials and the book 's appeal to geeks , do n't let this put you off if this is not your usual kind of thing ( it definately is n't mine ) . Away from these comments , this book stands alone as being well written , very humourous , engaging to the point of un-put-downability , and you will probably learn something you did n't know before . Highly , highly recommended !	1
I started reading this when the first chapter was only available on the Internet . I then promptly ordered it , from Amazon , when it was published . Its taken me one year to finish , mostly because I have n't been in a reading mood for quite a few years , and my career has consumed me.Now I am back on track , and reading for pure enjoyment once again , and I have to say that this book is full of pleasure . Stephenson knows how to delight with words . He uses each page to captivate , each paragraph to smother the readier in ideas , and each sentence to tickle the readers enjoyment.Stephenson could have completed this book in a fraction of the pages , but then it would n't have been worth the read . Its length is bathed in talk that only a hacker could deliver , but in such a way that only a true artist of words could deploy.To sum it up in a few words , Cryptonomicon is a feast of insights and ideas for a hacker , wrapped up in an emussing dialog . It may have taken me a year , but I am off looking for the rest of Stephenson 's collection to keep me entertained for another .	1
Prairie School is about a nine year old boy named Noah . He and his family have just moved from Maine to Colorado . He loves being there on the open prairie . He feels free . One day his mother tells his they are going to have a visitor . It 's his Aunt Dora and she is coming to teach him to read . Naoh does n't like the idea at all . Once Aunt Dora shows Noah her way of teaching he catches on and enjoys learning new things.The book is part of the I Can Read series . It 's a level 4 , for grade 2-4 . This is a good introduction to historical fiction.I would recommed this book . It would make a great read aloud while learning about the 1880 's .	1
A friend told me about The Day the World Came to Town a while back . I knew it was about September 11th and I was feeling a bit overloaded on the sad stories that resulted from that tragic day so I put it off.Of course , I knew there had been some amazing demonstrations of community , heroism , and other stories of the unexpected graces that resulted from that horrible day 's events and yet this story was probably the one that made me fully appreciate the paradox of grace in the midst of tragedy all the more.Gander , New Foundland has never been a major tourist spot on anyone 's map in its history . However , many have touched down in Gander over the years as it served as a refueling station for prop planes and jetliners before they had better capacity for transcontinental travel without a fuel stop.Gander is a small town of 10,000 and when 38 jets were ordered out of the skies on September 11th to Gander , some 6500 'new citizens suddenly arrived without notice.What followed the arrival of those jets and the frightened human beings aboard makes for the incredible story of a community that stopped everything it was doing and welcomed their guests as if they were relatives . And , this was n't just a quick stop . Gander provided for the 'plane people ' for three days without any master plan and advance preparation.The Day the World Came to Town is an inspiring story about the strength and goodness to be found in ordinary human beings when they come together in tough times . Author , Jim DeFead does a great job of making this story a personal one . He focuses on the experience of several individuals and families among the local people and the visitors . He tells this amazing story of community through their eyes and hearts.While I recognize so many have had their fill of stories about September 11th , The Day the World Came to Town is a story to be read again and again to remind us all that this world can still be a hopeful place of incredible grace ! A compelling story of goodness . Highly recommended ! Daniel J. MaloneySaint Paul , Minnesota USA	1
This book was very interesting and entertaining . It was amazing to see what wonderful , caring people there in Ganderland . It was a moving story about a very sad event in our history .	1
Was n't sure I wanted to read about 9/11 . It was hard enough living through it . But the focus of this true story is really the kind , loving generous people of Gander , Newfoundland ; and the role they played in the lives of the passengers of the planes that were forced to land in their little airport on that horrible day . Renews your faith in people .	1
I read this years ago in paperback . I 've slowly been replacing my favorites on the Kindle . It 's nice to re-read those books that I got rid of years ago at yard sales !	1
I found this book to be entertaining and fun . I thought it was a great twist in the end , but I do agree with a previous reader that the book seemed to end abruptly . The heroine was quite annoying for leaving twice , but a great hero makes up for it .	1
The synopsis relates the highlights of this story accurately so no need to re-hash it . Gabriel Fairchild , spoiled sophisticate and rakehell of the ton is ravaged by his longing for a life he believes is lost to him and the a debilitating injury that left him blind after serving in the Royal Navy . His family has engaged the services of nurse , Samantha Wickersham , to look after him at his childhood home while they wait for news advising if Gabriel would be able to recover . Samantha comes with her own secrets as she employs unorthodox therapies to help Gabriel , who does his best to resist Samantha 's therapies and her charms.The pacing and serviceable storyline and follow the usual historical romance formula . While the plot has been used previously in other forms of literature it works here quite well . Both the primary and secondary characters are charming enough to make this a fairly interesting and humorous read . Also , I was surprisingly engaged with the sensuousness of the intimate scenes and interaction with the leads.While I found it a bit slow to begin with and guessed the big reveal well before it was announced - so no big surprises for me , I did enjoy my trip to the past .	1
very good book about yogi 's 10 championship seasons . ( he 's the only player with 10 rings . ) great , flowing read for both adult and younger readers .	1

This is the second book of Molly Moon I 've bought for my 9 year old . She loves them ! It is a fairly thick book but she knocks it out in about 3 days . Highly recommend ! !	1
This book is incredible . Pretty much every story has some sort of miracle , so there 's that ... The Events Of September 11th 2001 were traumatizing to us all . I could n't even imagine what it was like to have tons of dust dropped on one 's head , until now . This book takes you there , and as such is a horrific , but ultimately enlightening book.Thanks to the authors and the folks interviewed , an amazing work.Where Did the Towers Go ? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11	1
Liberals are cowering fear because of the rapid rise of Sean Hannity . What can they do when capitalism proves their elitist philosophies wrong ? Why is it that conservativism sells in the thinking man 's media : radio and print publishing ? Confronted with the facts by articulate communicators like Hannity , all they can do is name-call , race-bait , and demonize.This is not a heavy political treatise and Sean never pretends to be a Stephen L. Carter or George Will , but he is a passionate cheerleader for conservative values , American values . What 's more he lack the pomposity of Rush Limbaugh , though he credits Maha Rushdie among others for his success . He is a true Reagan disciple . Hannity stands strong for bedrock American values but speaks his mind without going nuts . He 's a true compassionate conservative.I would urge people of all political stripes to read this book . It 's a light read , but it is a basic primer for conservatives , drawing heavily upon Right media . Pick up this book and add it to your nightstand collection . You wo n't go wrong .	1
i 'm reading the 2004 paperback edition of this book . Sean Hannity hosts a radio show from 3-6pm following Rush in most markets . In this book , Hannity talks about the liberals and Democrats and how hostile they get if any of their viewpoints are questioned . Hannity also tells us about the liberal bias in the media , and why conservatives and Republicans are more successful on talk radio . he offers some statistics that when Rush came along , AM radio only had 300 stations that programmed news/talk . but by 2001 the number had grown to 1,400 . Hannity credits the Clinton years ( 1993-2001 ) as the reason talk-radio became so successful because the people who had a different view were n't given proper spotlight in the national media { the ones with an opposing view to anything Clinton did were branded right-wing radicals , bigoted , chauvenistic , and part of Hillary Clinton 's pet-project of dreaming up the vast right-wing conspiracy } . Hannity calls Rush the Babe Ruth of Talk Radio , which is accurate . on page 51 , Hannity talks about the liberal immigration plan and the name calling from liberals . Pete Wilson in 1995 was called a racist by Democrats because he did n't want to open the borders of California to immigrants because statistics show that a majority of them wo n't become legal and productive and they eventually abuse social programs as a way of living . However , as usual , because Republicans oppose the liberal plan of open borders , we 're collectively called racists because we 're being careful and cautious about who should come into the country . now more than ever , you ca n't apply a pre 9/11 concept to a country post 9/11 because it 's wreckless , which is Hannity 's point in some of the last chapters . Hannity has often said that if the immigration rules were enforced during the '90s , there might 've been a 50-50 chance that the terrorists of 9/11 would n't have been so advanced and superior in their massacre because they would 've been watched until they became legal . i give the book 5 stars because it 's great and it says a lot of things Republicans and new people to the political process MUST know ! Hannity also hosts a show on Fox News Channel with liberal partner Alan Colmes which is # 1 and a stat that most people down-play because of the CNN competition of Larry King , whose own career is a fabulous read but his political views are something close to Ted Kennedy . Sean Hannity 's book is a breath of fresh air and honest , as opposed to Al Franken 's book whose title alone says it all and shows who he 's catering to : a segment of America that simply hates all things Republican and George Bush no matter how right we are . i also suggest the purchase of his newest book , & quot ; Deliver Us From Evil & quot ; , which contains MORE reasons to dis-trust and question liberalism .	1
If you 're looking for a fair and balanced book this book is not it . This book is not meant to be fair and balanced , it is supposed be one sided . If you 're Republican looking for a book bashing democrats , liberalism , and Bill Clinton then this book will do the trick for you . From start to finish this book will cater to a conservative 's point of view and will do a hatchet job on liberalism . This book shows the views of a conservative and how democrats are not doing such a great job with their liberal ideas on everything from education , defence , war on terrorism , and of course Clinton . This book is a complete critque on liberalism and and if you agree with a conservative point of view this is a must read for you.This book goes straight for the throat .	1
I 've read probably dozens of & quot ; reinvent your life & quot ; and/or & quot ; find the perfect career & quot ; books in the past few years , and this book is definitely in my top 10 . If you take the time to complete the exercises , you 'll learn a lot about yourself and what you want out of life , and that alone is worth the price of the book.While Pollan 's method for identifying what you want is n't unique to him , he gives it some interesting twists , such as asking not only & quot ; What do I want ? & quot ; but & quot ; How will I know when I have it ? & quot ; , which forces you to be very specific ! His chapters on & quot ; opening closed doors & quot ; were , I felt , very uneven : some were genuinely helpful ( the money chapter ) , while others ( such as the & quot ; education and training & quot ; chapter ) seemed glib and superficial.I was favorably impressed that he did n't focus solely on career changes : one of his examples is a woman who loves her career but misses having a family , so the solution is not for her to change careers but to adopt a child . I like his attitude : he focuses on the present and the future , on what you can do NOW to achieve what you want ; this is a real upper for those of us who tend to get bogged down in & quot ; I 've wasted my life & quot ; and & quot ; It 's too late to change & quot ; ! He also points out that much of one 's work experience -- learning how to negotiate , get along with people , or manage a project -- is transferable to another field , so changing careers does n't mean starting completely from scratch.On the other hand , as other readers have pointed out , he recounts far too many examples of people who were successful in one career before changing to another . Many people DO N'T succeed because they 're in the wrong job ; but , once they find a career that better suits their interests , abilities , and values , they prosper . It happened to me , and I know I 'm not unique , so I think the book would have been more convincing if it included more examples of this type .	1

AUTHOR BUSTER OLNEY DOES A VERY NICE JOB TELLING THE READER ABOUT THE LAST GAME OF THE 2001 WORLD SERIES . THE YANKEES WERE 3 TIME DEFENDING CHAMPS WHILE THE DBACKS WERE NEW TO IT ALL . THE AUTHOR GIVES SOME GREAT DETAIL AND BACKGROUND INTO MANY OF THE PLAYERS ON BOTH TEAMS . AMONG THEM ARE JETER , O'NEILL , CLEMONS , SCHILLING AND JOHNSON . THE SEASON WAS EXTENDED INTO NOVEMBER BECAUSE OF THE 911 FALLOUT . I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING AND A SLICE OF HISTORY . THIS BOOK IS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS .	1
On impulse , I grabbed a copy of `` Anansi Boys '' at the grocery store while rolling through the magazine aisle ; the cover design was colorful and clever , and I was just drawn to pluck it out . And then , when I saw that it was Gaiman ( who I 've been thinking about reading for some time ) it just seemed like destiny . I felt vaguely ashamed for purchasing a grocery store paperback - pretty certain that I 'd be disappointed and simply put the book aside as quickly as I 'd bought it . Not so , not so at all ! Gaiman turns out to be everything he 's cracked up to be ( and , frankly , even better than that ) , and `` Anansi Boys '' was about as clever and enjoyable a book as I 've come across in years . The wry and informal style of the text gives an effortless feel to the prose - reading it was like riding on greased rails . But do n't let that create an impression of shallow writing - to the contrary , I found nothing shallow about the book at all . The plot was complex , but not contrived , and Gaiman moves seamlessly between wit and sensuality and tender asides.All of the magic and mythology aside , this is a story of brothers , and of sons and fathers - and while not necessarily telling us anything original about such relationships , it affirms them , and affirmation is good and powerful . As I turned the final page ( enjoying every word ) , I was left slightly uneasy - I wanted to go right out and pick up another Gaiman book . But then , could anything compare favorably to what I 'd just finished ? That 's high praise for any novel .	1
This book is rich with mythology and mythos . It is the story of a man who gets pulled into a world he is unfamiliar with and unprepared for . It is about evolution and finding your own place in the world - even when things are going a little crazy around you.. and when are things not a little crazy in a Neil Gaiman book . It is an easy read and I stayed up a little too late a few nights reading this book . Thank goodness I had a paper white so I could just turn it off and pull the covers tight against spiders and birds in the night .	1
Anansi Boys is a fantasy story and yet in so many ways it relates to real life . This is the sort of story your friend tells you when you tell them how terrible your life is ... and they have the sudden urge to top it with a more terrible story.It is witty , funny and intelligently written . Although I am a Neil Gaiman fan I would say this is one of his best offerings to date . Although if he is reading this I challenge him to write a better story and dedicate it to me ( ca n't blame a girl for asking ) . Anansi Boys is a modern day fairy tale with all the twists and turns a fairy tale needs . Yet it is also deeply thought provoking - or maybe that is just because I think too much , but I do feel this book has a deep meaning in weird sort of way.It 's a definite must read for anyone who loves this kind of utter thing .	1
Who can suspend disbelief better than Neil Gaiman ? This book was released in 2005 , and it 's still a bestseller . I 've read all of Neil Gaiman 's Sandman graphic novels , and now I 'm making my way through his other books.I liked Anansi Boys even better than American Gods . This book had more developed characters ( the sons of Anansi ) , and Gaiman seemed to enjoy filling them out . It 's amazing how Gaiman can make a character likeable ( Spider ) , then unlikeable , then likeable again . Who else can create characters that are outlandish , petty , and still endearing ? What a storyteller.I read the book in a single 24 hour period , and even though I was exhausted , it still kept me up until midnight . That 's the sign of a really fantastic book .	1
A great copy for a used book . Very clean even though it has been unused . I was Pleasently surprised . Thank You .	1
This was my favorite leadership book of the nineties . I have referred to and quoted from this profound book many times since reading it in 1994 ( cited in my booksPathways to Performance : A Guide to Transforming Yourself , Your Team , and Your OrganizationandThe Leader 's Digest : Timeless Principles for Team and Organization Success ) . Based on extensive research of 18 `` visionary companies '' and 18 corresponding `` comparison companies , '' the authors explore why visionary companies ( all founded before 1950 ) still lead their industry and surpass their much less successful competitors . Collins and Porras give us deep insight into why `` visionary companies prosper over long periods of time , through multiple product life cycles and multiple generations of active leaders . '' Anyone interested in building a high performance culture must read this powerful book .	1
The authors of 'Built To Last ' has researched 18 highly successful companies and 18 of their respective competitors , who also has done well - but not as good , and come up with some interesting theories that in essence supports the chaos theory . Fascinating ! Not that current management practices is slaughtered , but rather enhanced and evolved . E.g , anyone who has read Dilbert knows to hate vision statements . In comparison , 'Big Hairy Audacious Goals ' are the same but they are i-n-s-p-i-r-i-n-g. And did you know that many of todays market leaders like HP and Sony started off without any & quot ; big idea & quot ; ? They also kill a few other myths along the way , like - it is always interesting to work in a firm which has a vision.After resolving the myths the authors explore some common ground to why these companies are so successful and which should be relevant to most companies : You can have the cake AND the dessert , Ask yourself : why do our company exist ? , find and preserve the core/stimulate progress , build a culture , try a lot of stuff and keep what works , develop your own top management ( who knows the system better ? ) and compete with yourself.Now , these companies are the major players in their respective markets , and how these theories work for smaller companies is an important question . As is the question of how these big firms did things to become successful . Was it a shot of luck in the nick of the time ? Following their examples today might be painful due to the everchanging rules of this game.Nevertheless there are a lot experience to feed upon here and the lessons learned might prove worthwile , even though you just follow some of the guidelines .	1
An instant classic for those of us who consult with organizations that seek to improve performance . Universal principles that have stood the test of time have been presented in a concrete and interesting fashion . Only three notes of caution are advised . First , the selection and head-to-head comparsions of the companies presented represents a relatively small sample from which broad and important generalizaions are drawn . Second , what would the implications be of a & quot ; fall from grace & quot ; of a company honored with the title of & quot ; visionary company ? & quot ; Finally what if your company , ( like a few of my clients ) is short term focused toward becoming an attractive take-over target ? Do these habits have short term value ? This is a book you will refer to again and again .	1
An interesting and fast-paced novel about a boy on the run -- you know from the beginning that there are secrets to uncover , and it 's fascinating to try to figure out what and why this kid is in the situation he 's in . Strong recommend .	1
My husband 's sister-in-law had this book and we work crosswords when we are together . I liked it so much I now have it in print and on my Kindle .	1
This is book 7 in her `` Effington Family '' series . I think this author must love old movies . Her one book kind of had an homage to the film Pillow Talk at the ending . In this book , I am reminded of the Audrey Hepburn/Cary Grant film Charade . At the start of the book when we first meet the heroine ( Delia ) - she is a widow of a few months , but she was only married four days . We also learn right away that , unbeknownst to Delia , her husband was an English spy . Delia was the twin who never had to be watched , always did what people expected of her . When Charles ( her future husband & spy ) met her he swept her off her feet . His mission just involved getting close enough to ferret out info about her powerful family , but he ended up falling in love with her & marrying her . He dies at the opening of the book . Enter Anthony St. Stephens ( also an English spy ) . He is dispatched to find anything Charles may have left behind , what if any was his wife 's involvement , and sort out the murky circumstances of Charles 's death . He and his fellow spies infiltrate Charles 's house ( now Delia 's ) under the disguise and pretense of being household staff . Anthony is in the disguise of an elderly butler . Delia befriends him and they play games and she confides in him . He , of course , falls for her . He begins to court her as himself . Wonderfully funny & wonderfully romantic .	1
This book is best for 2-4 year olds . But maybe for all ages but those are the ages of the children in my room . If you can get ahold of the tape story of this , do it ! My students have to listen to this book at least 2-3 times a week and would love it if I read it over and over again , but the singing of the bird in the tape story is awesome . I wish I had the tape of it ( it was at an old day care ) . It helps children learn about bedtimes , animal sounds , and just a fun book .	1
This book is beyond good . It reads better than most popular mystery novels and is equally as hard to put down . Do n't be surprised if you have several late nights reading it .	1
One of the best Lincoln books I have ever read - and I am a teacher . Swanson did his homework on this one and I wish they would make this into a movie . Forget O'Reilly 's & # 34 ; Killing Lincoln & # 34 ; ; this is the book you want .	1
The basic history I was taught made it look like Booth was a deranged two bit actor , the people hanged were for the most part innocent , and he did n't have any complicit help while on the run . This book goes into great detail based on admissions of people decades later what had really happened and I wish I could find more books like it .	1
I enjoy nonfiction books that read like novels , and James L. Swanson 's Manhunt : The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln 's Killer provides a dose of history in an enjoyable format.Manhunt did n't include much information about the assassination that I did n't already know . But I did learn quite a bit about the 12-day pursuit of John Wilkes Booth and the hunt for his conspirators , as well as some other assassination trivia . It was especially interesting in that my husband and I often travel this same path through Maryland and Virginia when driving south . We pass right by the historic marker near the Garrett house barn ( where Booth was captured and killed ) , although we 've never stopped to see the actual location.Swanson does a commendable job of bringing the complex Booth to life . The author describes him as `` impossibly vain , preening , emotionally flamboyant , possessed of raw talent and splendid elan . '' Yet , this handsome and charismatic actor was willing to sacrifice everything for `` his cause . '' After the assassination , he was stunned and enraged to discover that his acts not only met with outrage , but also , made Lincoln a martyr . I was surprised to learn that on April 16 , 1865 , CSA Lt. General R. S. Ewell sent Secretary of War Stanton a letter that was cosigned by 16 other Confederate generals . In the letter , Ewell wrote of their `` unqualified abhorrence and indignation '' at Lincoln 's killing . He claimed that they were shocked by this appalling crime and that Southern men `` are not assassins '' nor their `` allies . `` Manhunt has a good number of pictures , drawings , maps and photographs related to the assassination . He also includes an excellent Epilogue where he tells the `` story after the story . '' Swanson also provides a poignant description of the events of that time . When Lincoln died at the Peterson house , a `` crude , improvised coffin '' was brought to transport his body back to the White House . The people in the street were upset . `` The box looked like a shipping crate , not a proper coffin for a head of state . Lincoln would not have minded . He was always a man of simple tastes . This was the plain , roughly hewn coffin of a rail-splitter . `` After reading Manhunt , I intend on reading an earlier work that Swanson co-wrote called Lincoln 's Assassins : Their Trail and Execution .	1
Simply put , this book was a joy to read . The research done by the author is clearly immense , so much so that the information contained alone could almost fill a textbook . The author has an obvious passion for the circumstances surrounding this , one of the most tragic events in American history . The story is presented with such vivid imagery and detail that the drama and intensity of this desperate search almost drips from each page . Though the outcome of this hunt is inevitable , the path to this conclusion makes for a very interesting narrative . This book is a real page-turner , and should appeal to anyone with an interest in history .	1
As I read this excellent book I could n't help think that things have n't changed much since 1865 . People still hate the President today , as they did then.Abe Lincoln was a great man who accomplished many wonderful things for our country . He brought our citizens through a devasting and deadly war that would have destroyed many nations . His murder was unfortunate and unecessary.John Wlikes Booth lived in a fantasy world ( like most actors . ) He thought too highly of himself and considered himself to be the savior of the nation . He was a complete failure.This book is difficult to put down . I found myself feeling a little depressed when I read the account of Lincoln being shot and the hours that ensued . It was almost like the events were unfolding now , in 2006 . I felt sorry of Lincoln and his family . Other families suffered too , like the Sewards.I 'm glad Mr. Swanson included the Epilogue . It has many interesting facts of what became of many of the characters in the plot to assassinate Mr. Lincoln	1
James Swanson pursues the tale of the 12 day manhunt for John Wilkes Booth and his accomplices over the course of about 400 pages and 11 chapters . The book is liberally supported with photos and reproductions of new articles and letters of the time , including a transcript of Booth 's journal . Additionally , there is a wealth of references in the back.I was really impressed with this book 's accessibility to readers . The narrative is compelling and the story addictive . There are a lot of `` little details '' that surface , ranging from real trivia to fascinating side topics , all of which are explored without detracting from the ongoing timeline . It 's clear that the author spent a lot of time researching all of the players involved and took the time and care to present it in a way that would be interesting to read.As a history teacher I would strongly recommend this to other teachers as well as to students in the upper grades . I 'd also recommend this to people interested in the Civil War , Lincoln , etc . In many ways , this is also a good book for the casual reader , being interesting and compelling without being too `` dry ''	1
This is the best thing Mark Twain ever wrote . His persepective on the human condition was unique and refreshing . I recomend it to anyone who is looking to understand people .	1
i HAVE READ ALL OF YOUR BOOKS ... AND LOVE THEM , BUT THE SAVANNAH BOOKS ARE BY FAR MY FAVORITE ! ! Please write more of them and continue the story lines ... Adore them .	1
When I was reading this book I have to day it reminded me so much of what the true south is like . This book is roll in the floor funny ! ! ! Yet it is also a mystery . I love Mary Kay Andrews .	1
Usually I can guess fairly early on what the secret is in a book . I could not with this one . There are five people in this small town with unusual abilities . Apparently , all five were born at midnight and all five can enter this surreal blue world for one hour at midnight every night while the rest of the world is frozen in time . Only they are not alone . The basis of all nightmares is awake and moving around with them . These nightmare creatures usually leave the humans alone , but when the fifth person ( new in town ) arrives , they come out of the shadows after her and they definitely mean harm . The other four do their best in protecting her until they can figure out what her special powers are and why the creatures see her as a threat.Great suspense and action . I 'm looking forward to see where Westerfeld will take this plot line .	1
I find that I became more interested in this series as I actually got further into the story line of the book . The main character initially caught my attention and the dealings with her high school friends brought back memories . As the drama progressed I found myself intrigued by the situation and location . By the book I found myself wanting to move onto the second part of the trilogy .	1
Love these books fourth favorite typeIn ok condition but had stickers on itI recommend this to all people	1
This book is meant for kids , but I 've learned things from it that I have n't seen in any courses or books about creative writing for adults.I love that there are plenty of exercises inside the book.This is great for resurrecting your imagination .	1
His work has been fun to read as a former church secretary . I know many of those people he writes about !	1
This is a wonderful book to get you in touch with yourself and understand where your self-defeating messages come from and how to power around them .	1
I am a new Marian Keyes fan , but have been plowing through her books left and right , and I have to say , this one is one of my favorites . You ca n't help but root for the main character , everyone loves an underdog . Great feel-good , happy ending romance .	1
I like Keyes ' writing style , she 's witty and intellegent . But I felt like this book had about 100 pages of stuff that was superflous.Lisa - yes she 's got some likeable traits but at the same time , she 's cruel and that 's not likeable and it is hard to get past that . Keyes puts in stuff that makes her sad , a scene with her shaving off chocolate with her teeth to make it last longer , her constant hunger , her envy . And yet , I found it impossible to get past the way she treated others in the office . Maybe it 's because I 've worked for people who find it hilarious to be cruel and nasty to their subordinates out of a desperate need to feel superior , but there it is.Ashling - likeable , funny . The only character in the book I could enjoy for the most part , except for the storyline about depression , which seemed contrived . I wo n't give spoilers but her not dealing with a major issue was frustrating.Clodagh - uh , are we ever supposed to find her likeable ? It made Ashling less likeable because a shallow woman like this was supposed to be her best friend . I found myself wanting to smack her into reality every time she came into the book . What an utterly unredeemable character.Generally , I liked the big picture stuff . Women struggling with their professional selves versus their personal lives . Dealing with insecurities and self esteem problems , marriages and divorce . I just did n't find the individual women that Keyes chose to do it with very convincing and she took an awful circuituous route to get there .	1
Marian NEVER disappoints . She 's awesome . Lovely to re-read this one after about a decade , still as good now as then .	1
I do n't know how , but Marian Keyes always manages to write something that is at at once funny , wise , insightful , and fun to read . Her books look like that favorite sterotype of reviewers , `` Chicklit , '' but they 're about much more ( and they 're much better ! ) than the skinny cartoon girls on their covers suggest . Keyes 's characters are real , her stories inventive , and even when the ending wraps up in far *too* happy a manner , it does n't make the book any less of a good experience.THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY has all the winning ingredients , and I 'm happy to say it mixes them up well and combines them into yet another great read . The inside look at publishing is hilarious , and very enlightening for anyone who has ever wondered what it would take to get their work in the local bookstore ! The Lily-Gemma-Anton triangle is well done and the resolution -- though it seems lacking at first -- is very realistic . Jojo is a superbly written character , and her relationship with her married boss ( and his relationship to his wife ) is explored with great sensitivity to all the complex issues it creates.Since the first 100+ pages were about Gemma , and the next Jojo , and the next Lily , I did n't understand at first how they would all fit together in one story ; the relationships between them did n't seem strong enough for that sort of split style . I should have known , though : Marian Keyes pulls it off every time . Read it and see for yourself .	1
The Other Side of the Story is written from three different women 's points of view . Gemma Hogan is living the high life when she is suddenly summoned home to find that her father has walked out on her mother . Now Gemma is trying frantically to help her mother and figure out what to do about her father.All the while she 's forced to write Emails about the whole fiasco to her best friend Susan who ends up finding Gemma 's Emails so clever and humorous that she sends them off to London 's top literary agent JoJo Harvey.JoJo is fighting to make partner and competing fiercely against a co-worker for the position . She 's also having an affair with her boss who is married and trying to convince herself that it 's a healthy relationship.JoJo is representing bestselling author Lily Wright who is trying to balance being a new mother with a bad financial situation - and the guilt of stealing her husband away from her best friend Gemma who used to date Lily 's husband Anton.Gemma 's always dreamed of writing a novel and getting a book deal that her boyfriend-stealing ex-best friend Lily now has . JoJo may be headed for heartbreak looking for love in all the wrong places trying to convince herself that she can handle a relationship that must be kept secret . But at the same time she 's hoping to get caught and finally have her man all to herself . Lily is struggling to juggle the good with the bad and with a heart full of guilt . Marian Keyes ' intertwines these women 's lives and their connection to each other making for a fantastic read that fans will enjoy.The Other Side of the Story is like having three books in one . The three stories smoothly transition back and forth between the three women and will keep the reader turning pages to see what drama awaits on the next page .	1
It was a very good book . It opened my eyes to the things I was n't doing in my relationship . I would read it again just for a refresher from time to time .	1
I got this one for my wife and am still waiting for her to do all the things suggested . It seems to be a good book and is for the ladies !	1
Good book with great advise . Must know and love Dr. Laura to appreciate some of this . I would definately recommend this to adults that are ready for truth	1
It seems as though there are a lot of excuses for men 's behavior & women at the ones that must change in order for a relationship to succeed . If a man is not willing to compromise & takes advantage of his wife 's willingness to change , then what ? When is enough enough ?	1
This was eye-opening for me . Although I do n't agree with DL 100 % on everything she touched on in this book , I am very glad I read this book and think a lot of women could benefit from the content.I feel as though a lot of wives -- especially new mothers like me -- end up putting husbands on the back burner when their kids are young . In my case , I am the mother of twin two-year-olds . . . one of which has severe heart defects . . . and I 'm constantly running around , caring for them , the house , my full-time work , etc. , so at the end of the day I am wiped out -- and have very little interest in doing anything but going to sleep.Since reading this book , though , I 've tried out some of her suggestions and I know without a doubt that they were very appreciated . In fact , I ca n't tell you how many times my husband has thanked me in the last week for making him feel more appreciated and special.What 's more , he 's also done more around the house than he typically does . Some of it without me asking . 5 stars , easily . ; )	1
Like Isaac 's Storm ( Erik Larson ) before it , The Children 's Blizzard takes us into a nearly forgotton place in American history and slaps us with the almost casual brutality of life before modern meteorology . David Laskin has researched the subject of the blizzard of 1888 in meticulous fashion and we ca n't help but be impressed with his scholarship . Laskin has previously written on meteorology and he has a way of making the capricious nature of the atmosphere highly accessible.Readers should be warned that Laskin is unsparing in his depiction of the death by exposure of children trapped in the storm . If you 've read `` To Build a Fire '' by Jack London ( whom he credits ) you 'll have a small idea of what these children go through . Images will haunt you : Parents dragging their frozen children into the house to thaw by the fire so their contorted bodies will fit into tiny coffins . Even those who survive must endure gruesome injuries . This is history and it must be told . But one wonders what ever made these settlers think such a life was worth the hardships . It was a rare family that had not lost children , even before the great blizzard.A minor criticism of The Children 's Blizzard is its tendency , especially early , to focus on historical minutiae . Emphasis on the life of plains settlers before they left Europe drags down the early narrative.Recommended , but not for the easily disturbed reader .	1
This nonfiction account of a tragic event is an absorbing tale . The author delves into the social , political and economic factors which led to this tragedy with an interesting and informative style . He also makes the people involved seem real and one finds themself caring what happens next . This allows the reader to appreciate the reading experience at several levels . The Children 's Blizzard , is one I have never regretted buying and have sent to others as a gift .	1
Ever think the news appears to be slanted ? After moving to Boston , I noticed more infiltration of opinions ( and not during the editorial segment ! ) in the news than actual straight-shooting reporting of the news than I had ever recalled observing before ! Bernard Goldberg has blown the whistle on the media establishment and their overwhelming tendency to have their own personal biases penetrate the reporting of the news in this excellent must-read book !	1
Mr. Goldberg has told it like it is , to the chagrin of most of the left leaning media . From the universities to the major media empires , they have been like an airplane with no left wings and flopping around in their efforts to deny it . I find everything written here to be most probably absoutly true and even forgiving for the transgressors .	1
While an honest expose into the world of broadcast media , _Bias_ is at times vitriolic and inflammatory . It is ironic that Bernard Goldberg expouses objective representation of events , yet his own judgment should be questioned by his own biases . He should take some of the medicine he prescribes.Nonetheless , it is a fine book that media skeptics would enjoy and the naive media-ne'er-do-wrong should be compelled to read .	1
If you are like me , you have noticed that the nightly news broadcasts on the three oldest networks favor politically correct terminology , lofty liberal ideals , and the faces of diversity in front of the cameras . You may also have read the many news reports that a very high percentage of all national correspondents of the major media are Democrats and consider themselves to be liberals . So what can be the benefit of a book that states the obvious ? I found myself chewing on that thought , long after reading the book . But I did enjoy it.My conclusion is that Mr. Goldberg 's position as a former CBS correspondent makes the charges more credible . Also , Mr. Goldberg is clearly not making these points because of his political beliefs , but rather due to his interest in responsible journalism . If he was willing to place his career on the line at CBS to make these points , I found that it was important to me that I honor him by reading the book.Next , I found Mr. Goldberg 's dry wit absolutely a lot of fun ! Where most of us ( including me all of the time ) groan when we hear a newscaster slam a conservative or put down an opinion the newscaster does agree with , Mr. Goldberg has the ability to imagine what a conservative newscaster might have said that would have aroused maximum liberal wrath . Whether you agree with the examples or not , they are very funny ! Finally , Mr. Goldberg tells us that Mr. Dan Rather is n't quite the man he portrays when reading the news at night.Having said all of those nice things , let me comment that I think Mr. Goldberg is a little unfair in his portrayal of the reaction at CBS to his Wall Street Journal op-ed piece . More than half way through the book , you will learn for the first time that Mr. Goldberg had a written contract that prohibited him from writing for any publication without advance permission . It did n't look to me like Mr. Goldberg tried to get that permission , although he did call a few people to warn them the piece was going to appear . Then , Mr. Goldberg reports being surprised that many people at CBS viewed what he did as disloyal . If an organization makes you sign an agreement like that to get paid , they are sending a message that they want you to be a team player . If you do n't want to do that , you should go elsewhere . Mr. Goldberg seemed to have been be trying to have his cake and eat it too.Say what needs to be said , be clear and witty if you can , and be sure of the moral ground you are standing on when you do !	1
That someone wrote a book about the media 's liberal bias is not surprising . That Bernard Goldberg did so is remarkable.Goldberg -- himself a liberal with nearly thirty years of experience at CBS News -- had often voiced his concern about liberal bias to network executives . After _CBS Evening News_ aired a blatantly slanted `` Reality Check '' report on February 8 , 1996 , Goldberg decided to take stronger measures . He submitted to the _Wall Street Journal_ an op-ed piece detailing the report 's bias . The piece was published five days later._Bias : A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News_ analyzes the bias that has developed in the news over the past several decades . In addition , the book reveals the personality of some media celebrities and executives . It seems impossible to completely extricate `` the news '' from the people who report it.Goldberg traces the problem of bias in the news back to _60 Minutes_ , the pioneer of news magazines . In the early days of television , the networks viewed comedy , drama , and variety shows as their moneymakers . The news , however , was different . Once network executives discovered that even the news could be profitable , news programs began competing for ratings . Rather than simply reporting the news objectively , networks tried to ensure that the news would have entertainment value , that people would like what they saw and would tune in regularly.As Goldberg points out , many journalists selected that career in order to improve the world . Eventually , however , their compassion began to interfere with their objective reporting . They took on the work of activists . In order to motivate people to support causes -- perhaps financially -- they made the people who would benefit from that support look like the prospective donors . Thus , homelessness and AIDS were portrayed as problems of mainstream America . Facts were distorted ; numbers were exaggerated.The ratings and the causes are only part of the problem , however . Goldberg is most alarmed that reporters and executives are not even aware of much of the bias in the news . No one at CBS News , for example , had seen any problem with the report that had sparked Goldberg 's initial op-ed piece for the _Wall Street Journal_ -- even though a reporter had in the guise of a `` Reality Check '' ridiculed Presidential candidate Steve Forbes and his flat-tax proposal , using such words as `` scheme , '' `` elixir , '' and `` wacky . `` In network newsrooms the middle of the road between liberals and conservatives is off center . Virtually everyone in the newsroom is a liberal . People are so insulated that they do n't even know anyone whose opinions are different from theirs ; they genuinely believe they represent the middle of the road . Goldberg cites the example of film critic Pauline Kael , who was astounded when Nixon was elected President in 1972 . `` I do n't know a single person who voted for him ! '' she said . Yet Nixon carried forty-nine states . Is it healthy for those who report our news to be so out of touch with the populace ? Freedom of speech and of the press are among the highest ideals in our democracy . Even Thomas Jefferson , author of the Declaration of Independence , valued newspapers ( the principal news medium of his day ) above government . If we are to be responsible citizens , we must be able to gauge the accuracy of news reports . _Bias_ provides information that will help us to raise necessary questions about the news -- what is reported and what is not -- in order to discern the truth .	1
Bernard Goldberg does a thorough job examining the liberal bias in mainstream media . However & quot ; folksy & quot ; and anectdote-riddled his writing may be , the point of this text comes across very well . He is adept at spotting subtle & quot ; bias & quot ; in news ( and entertainment , though to a lesser extent ) and manages to introduce the reader to what , exactly , makes a news report biased.Unfortunately , my biggest problem with this book was also one of its strongest points . As it is written from Goldberg 's own experience in the media ( 28 years at CBS ) , this book also becomes a forum for Goldberg to speak personally about those who has encountered in the news media . While this serves to essentially present the reader with a first-hand account of the perceived bias , it also tends to bias this text itself , as well.Another drawback to this book was the manner in which it is written . Rather than citing ( perhaps in a more dry , scholarly manner ) instances of evident & quot ; bias & quot ; in the media ( though you do n't have to look much further than your own local television station ) , Goldberg writes the same as he would hold a conversation . It makes for light reading . The lack of intellectual stimuli from this book , however , can be overcome : This book is meant to fuel contemplation , not to think *for* you . In this arena , it accomplishes its task quite well.However rudimentary this introduction is , it still does make some very strong points . Goldberg is able to articulate many different points about bias in the news - ie , there obviously should n't be a left-leaning bias , but , of course , there also should n't be a right-leaning bias evident in the news , either . He speaks without any clear alliance to the & quot ; right & quot ; or & quot ; left , & quot ; however & quot ; right & quot ; he may be .	1
I long ago gave up on prime time network news for , in my opinion , the more substantive Jim Lehrer Report on PBS . So I was intrigued by a recent Lehrer segment on network bias featuring Bernard Goldberg and Marvin Kalb . During the segment Kalb was apoplectic , accusing Goldberg of nearly every sin known to man short of having sexual relations with `` that woman . '' I thought , `` Maybe there 's something to this . '' I bought the book and read it ( it only takes a few hours ) . My first conclusion was that Goldberg writes like he 's on a screed , with lots of hyperbolic accusations and little research . My second conclusion was that this guy probably has an axe to grind , having been shunned by CBS as if he had awakened one morning to a New York revival of `` Friendly Persuasion . '' I pretty much dismissed him myself . Then I happened to watch ( inadvertently ) the NBC Evening News last weekend . In it there was a segment on the Senate battle over Charles Pickering , a conservative , Southern , friend of Trent Lott and Bush 's appointee to the Federal bench , whom Democrats accuse of being racially insensitive . ( An interesting article ran recently in the New York Times , in which African Americans in Pickering 's Mississippi home town attested to his good character , racial sensitivity and many pro-African American deeds . ) The NBC segment had a Democrat ( saying that Pickering was unqualified ) and a Republican ( saying that this was just a sacrificial prelude to the Supreme Court battle ) . Nice balance . Then they put on a sound bite from one of the home town African Americans , saying that Pickering should n't be held accountable for things he did 20 years ago -- neatly implying that he did something terrible 20 years ago . And the kicker was a very negative sound bite from a spokesperson for NOW . What on earth does NOW have to do with issues of racial insensitivity ? The clear implication was that not only should African Americans hate Pickering , so should women . Suddenly , it became so clear . Goldberg has made a point . The networks ARE biased , and it shows . Do n't shoot the messenger . Read the book .	1
Bernard Goldberg 's `` Bias '' has a reason for spending so much time in the NY Times Bestseller list 's # 1 spot : It is an important and culturally-relevant work . No one but Goldberg could have written this book : His three decades at CBS gave him unique ethos and first-hand experience with media biases , and *that* is what makes this expose compelling.At the same time , though , readers may be taken aback by the scathing anger that fills many of the pages of this book . It 's somewhat ironic that in his report on bias , Goldberg takes on such a clearly biased tone . Yes , he 's writing an expose ; yes , he had terrible experiences at the hands of those in charge of CBS ; but unfortunately , his anger often detracts from his credibility , damaging the overall impression that his book makes on its readers.My recommendation : Read this book and pay attention -- this man clearly knows what he 's talking about . Just brace yourself for 232 pages of writing that is sarcastic , vitriolic , and virtually humor-free . Once you 've read it , though , you 'll be grateful to Goldberg for sharing his experiences , which are of relevance to *anyone* who watches the news . Pick up a copy today !	1
John McWhorter is probably best known for his several books on African-American culture . However , he is also a trained linguist . Although my own area of specialization is philosophy , I have been fascinated with the various aspects of language ever since I read Noam Chomsky 's `` Review of B.F. Skinner 's 'Verbal Behavior ' '' more than forty years ago when I was in grad school and was hunting around for a dissertation topic . ( I actually considered the philosophy of language as a possibility before deciding on a topic in the philosophy of psychology . ) When I came across a copy of `` The Power of Babel '' in a bookstore I immediately began reading it . I could n't put it down , and so I wound up buying it.Written in a way that is accessible to the layperson with no background in linguistics , `` The Power of Babel '' describes in an easy-to-understand manner ( aided by the use of many concrete examples ) the fluidity of language , how and why it radically changes over time , how it becomes simpler rather than more complex , and how literacy retards the rapidity with which language changes . ( Compare , for example , the relatively minor changes in English from the time of Shakespeare and the King James Bible until the present versus the significant change from the time of Chaucer until the beginning of the seventeenth century . ) Although McWhorter does n't specifically mention this , the simplification of the grammar and pronunciation of a language over time is an example of the `` Principle of Least Effort . '' This principle was originally formulated in the early days of information theory , but it is certainly applicable to language as well ( which is not surprising , since the purpose of language is to communicate information ) .Although professional linguists are likely to find certain oversimplifications in `` The Power of Babel , '' it is an excellent introduction to the subject , one which I highly recommend .	1
This is a wonderful book ! I thought that after Steven Pinker 's The Language Instinct nothing could give me the `` REALLY ? '' feeling . I was wrong . This book gives a fascinating broad view of languages . What kinds of languages exist ? How does a language start ? How does it develop ? How and why it may die ? How simple can a language be and still convey ideas efficiently ? How complicated can a language be and still can be mastered by every healthy individual ? Those questions and more are discussed in The Power of Babel . John McWhorter uses personal anecdotes and sense of humor , much of it is self humor which makes it even more fun.I did experience some of the dissatisfaction other reviewers reported , though . There were many moments of feeling bored , mainly since it has been a while since I was able to understand a full sentence . Going back and trying to slow down did n't always help , but then English is my second language , it may be less of a problem for other readers . As many other things in life , though this book is not perfect , it certainly worth going through .	1
another spill binding novel for me , I have just received another novel from the same author so that should tell u what i think of his writing	1
When I picked this up , I was expecting some kids to think drugs were cool , then run with a fast sex , drugs , and rock n ' roll crowd , have a huge tragedy strike , and then get the propaganda message that DRUGS ARE BAD ( think `` Go Ask Alice '' ) . Boy , was I in for a surprise . This book is an easy read , but a much more complex tale than a simple parable about how drugs are bad.The two main characters , Tar and Gemma , leave home for things that every teenager in the world has felt in some way . Tar is abused , and leaves the hell of homelife for peace on the streets . Gemma represents every teenager who is smarter than her parents and resents their control over her life . She leaves for less justifiable reasons than Tar , but her emotions are ones anyone can identify with.There are a lot of people on the streets and in the squats -- anarchists , straight-edge vegans , punks , pot smokers , and heroin users . Tar and Gemma find friends and their own form of a family , and it is very easy to see how they slipped into the world of drugs , namely heroin.This book has shocking events in it , but the characters are so numb to it all that they describe it in a subtle and offhand manner . Girls who sell the bodies for drug money in no way consider themselves prostitutes , because they have standards and they do it `` on their terms , '' and on and on . The reader gets sucked up in this life and I found myself wanting to smack these characters and say , NO , what you are doing is not justifiable.This book has a beautiful ending that took me by surprise . No , the world is not covered in roses in the end , but neither has everyone succumbed to hell.I 'd like to make a comment about the appropriate age for this book . My sister is a voracious reader . She 's now 17 and was able to appreciate this book when we both read and discussed it , but she had tried to read it at age 9 or 10 , and it was too much for her to handle at that age . This is a book for early high school , not for middle school readers .	1
What a great debut book - and the start , I hope , of a great series ! Navy SEAL Steve ( Stash ) McMillan is on loan to TIARA to help find an assasin . He and agent Marlena Maxwell will have to work deep undercover to find the bad guy . But neither of them realizes just how deep they 'll get - into the mission and into each other.I ca n't rave enough about this book . If you like sexy Navy SEALS and strong , intelligent heroines , you are sure to love this novel.More , Ms. Low , More ! !	1
Every time I read this book I am emailing , making long distance and local telephones , going to parties , political meetings , musicperformances and other gatherings that I would prefer to miss fora quiet night at home reading and practicing my many instrument . I am calling and talking to , running out to meet with , scholars of the blues and African American music , performers of blues , jazz , and folk music , people who study culture , ideology , race , and class , crusading that they buy this book.This book follows the reality of the invention of the blues and how it really spread and what it really is . This book tells the truth and not the ignoramus stereotype of the state of blues culture in the world that Robert Johnson , and for that matter , his parents grew up in . This book tells a story the moldy fig people the Johnson met the devil at the crossroads idiots , etc wo n't recognize , but if you are African American , you will recognize you grandparents and parents and great grands depending on how old you are and how musical the memory is , whether you come from Mississippi or Los Angeles.This is a serious serious serious book clean and well written , a book that belongs in every home . This book is marketed as a book about Robert Johnson . However , the central thesis of the book is that blues is a creation of a black public that loved and desired the blues and that defined the reality of the blues and then seeks to find this music 's history and how the conflict between it and the nature and business of commercial recording transpired , and how this is totally contrary to the folklorists image of the dustry field hand by day , and blues virtuoso of sad existential songs at night.To the many researchers and divers into our past this book is sourced enough that if you are quick enough you can get to the primary sources he mentions that will help you be in the next generation of rational thinking papers , books , music collections , and discoveries will come from , at least if you share my hope that real scholarship and knowledge can pierce through the garbage oceans of stereotypes and thinking that serves dominant culture and the place of Blacks in its fantasies and nightmares.For those who are into the blues as practiced by those on the earth as Blues People as Imamu would have said , this brings things wherethey are for you and where they should be.As I have said in various places , this book is marketed as abiography of Robert Johnson , but what this actually is is a condensed criticisms of the views of the blues foisted on blues people by the folk and post folk white blues industry , a concise and factual criticism of previous histories of the blues , and a lot of practical learning in a short readable book.Not only if you are interested in blues , African American music , butif you are interested in the deformities of the culture by dominance in this society , you need to own this book and know what it teaches.For those who see the blues as being ultimately represented byisolated nearly African , primitive delta bluesmen , pouring out theirdeep Negroid souls about the existential nature of black suffering and founding the blues , this will show you that you are a complete fool or at least a victim misled by pervayors of ignorance.Nice jobClick on the about me blurb above my name and then procede to my comments on the complete Robert Johnson set to see description of the realities of Bob Johnson that this book reflects even though I wrote it before this book came out . Then buy this book because it says so much more than I could have imagined along the same lines .	1
Prior to reading this book , my knowledge of the Underground Railroad came mainly from a few slave narratives , snippets of it mentioned in history books , and from a few biographies that captured the essences of those who gave their lives for the cause . Never have I read a book that was so richly researched on the Underground Railroad the way Fergus M. Bordewich has done in BOUND FOR CANAAN . Without a doubt , this book puts in perspective how the Underground , a racially integrated network shrouded in secrecy , sets the stage for America 's first civil rights movement towards social change . This book is an extraordinary achievement and brings enlightenment to a little known topic in American History .	1
From its beginnings in the Quaker communities of Philadelphia and North Carolina , the history of the Underground Railroad is told in wonderful style and with detailed information . There were many interesting facets to this book as it gave both a sweeping picture of the story and detailed the lives of many involved , both black and white . The deep south , for example , did not provide much opportunity for escape except-and rarely-by sea . Rather , it was mainly the border states . Tubman , for example , was from Maryland . It was interesting to read about the legal as well as religious situation of African Americans-e.g. , Frederick Douglas removed his membership from an integrated Boston church to an all Black church because they refused to serve the Lord 's Supper as seated but mandated that Whites eat/drink first , and how civil rights were denied to free blacks in the north ( e.g. , denial of the vote , inability to testify in court , etc. ) . Bordewich clearly demonstrates how the Abolitionist movement in its origins and national prominence was clearly a Christian movement ... though opposed not only by Christians in the south but also by almost all Christians in the north at first until after Uncle Tom 's Cabin was published and popularized . The Abolitionist movement was itself primarily fueled by the revivalists of the burned over districts of New York . This was an extremely interesting book .	1
I have read all of Elinor Burkett 's books - which are on such diverse subjects as AIDS , and the state of our school system . Elinor would probably be the first to admit that she is a pushy , opinionated liberal jew - and these traits show up in this book . However , one gets the feeling that this is exactly what is needed when she battles with the school and her students in Kyrgyzstan to teach them about freedom of the press and how to be an investigative reporter . This area of the world has a history of censorship and I do n't care what your political leanings are , I think we can all agree this is wrong . I could not put this book down as Elinor describes her exciting journey to Afghanistan as well as her daily battles with everyday living in Kyrgyzstan . The one fault I have with the book is in the Epilogue . She goes to China and all she can do is say how wonderful everything is there - everything seems so luxurious compared to Kyrgyzstan . Since the rest of her book seemed so balanced , I was waiting for her to critcize China for its censorship practices or the atrocities committed in Tibet . But all she could say was how great it was to be able to go to Starbucks . All in all , I would recommend this book , as well as her others , to anybody who wants to learn more about the world .	1
I liked this book . I think that too many people who review this book are looking for the magic pill that will not just fix their thyroid , but magically make it easy to lose weight . Let 's get one thing straight - even with your thyroid meds optimized , weight loss is still something that you have to work at , just like everyone else on the earth . And if your meds are n't optimized it is even harder.So yes , Ms. Shamon does `` rehash '' the diet and exercise advice - these are necessary to everyone who wants to lose weight . She has compassion for those who are n't optimized and struggling with issues that make it harder for thyroid patients to lose weight - pain and fatigue that make exercise hard , a lower metabolism than the average person no matter what you do , etc.She does address many issues that often appear in those weight thyroid disease , such as gluten sensitivity , yeast overgrowth , and adrenal issues . She addresses facts and myths about thyroid disease , and gives a little diet test to help you decide which way of eating is going to work best for you . I scored high on the carbohydrate section which means I need to eat lower carb.The book mostly focused on people who are hypothyroid , mostly because most people who are hyperthyroid eventually become hyper through either removal of their thyroid or radiation to kill their thyroid , plus weight gain is more common in hypothyroidism than hyper.For those who are hyperthyroid , you would be better off with Ms. Shamon 's book Living Well with Graves ' Disease and Hyperthyroidism.She starts off with basic information on what hypothyroidism is and gives a quick self-test . The more items you check , the more chance it is that you have thyroid disease ( either hypo or hyper ) .The next chapter includes a short ( too short I think ) discussion on optimal TSH levels . She does not address optimal Free T3 or Free T4 levels , but does discuss these as blood tests you might want to have done.She gives advice of supplements and herbs that might aid with weight loss ( again , there is no magic pill ) , including prescription pills , how to get in exercise even with pain and fatigue , and an eye opening calorie worksheet that estimates your base metabolic rate . Mine is incredibly low - around just 1200 calories a day ! There is a large recipe section for those who like to cook . Each recipe includes calories , and grams of fat , carbohydrates , and protein.At the back of the book is a huge section of resources . It has everything from helpful books and magazines , diet tools , allergy testing labs , cookbooks , fitness and exercise , help finding a good doctor , and help finding a personal trainer .	1
It 's not often that you 'll read historical non-fiction that grabs you and pulls you along , but this is one of those rare such books that would make great beach reading . There were a few times when I actually wished for a bit more technical detail , but Gordon does a wonderful job of telling his story without resorting to hyperbole .	1
`` The Monster Trap '' is an adorable book that deserves to be read by more kids . The artwork is so cute and the 'monsters ' positively sweet ; just the sort of thing that might convince a small child that they want to meet 'monsters ' instead of avoiding them.The story begins when a young boy named Paddy visits his Grandfather , who lives over a shop which looks like an antique store . Together they listen to a radio show called `` Monster Radio Theater '' . This gets Paddy 's imagination working overtime and in response to his fears , his grandfather creates a trap . When the first trap fails , he builds another . And low and behold -- and much to Grandfather 's surprise -- they catch some monsters . Well ... not exactly catch . For you see , the contraption they built is more like a monster playground.This book is a Good Read-aloud , and just the thing to take the edge off of nighttime fear . Do check it out.a Pam T mini review ( booksforkids-reviews )	1
Judging this book by it 's title and cover ( bad me i know ) I thought it to be one of those oh do n't feel bad about your size this person looks like that and is totally happy , wrongo ! I read the back one day and the summary made it sound interesting and more then entertaining and it turned out way more better then that , this book is for any female ( or boy i guess ) in high school or up no matter what size !	1
Heather Wells was once a teen singing sensation . But after a string of bad luck events ( her mother ran off with Heather 's money and her manager , her recording contract was canceled , and she discovered her fianc & eacute ; , Jordan , with another woman ) , she has taken a job as assistant dorm manager at a New York City college . At Fischer Hall , she 's responsible for a variety of jobs , such as helping when the soda machine malfunctions and taking drunk students to the hospital.Heather lives close to the college , in the top floor apartment of a building owned by her ex-fianc & eacute ; 's hunky detective brother , Cooper . Jordan is still after Heather to get back together , which is never going to happen . Probably . In fact , Heather nurses a secret passion for nice guy Cooper , who unfortunately does n't appear to consider Heather to be girlfriend material in any way.Elizabeth Kellogg , a freshman who dies in Fischer Hall , is found at the bottom of the elevator shaft . Heather is troubled . Sure , students have been known to indulge in the deadly game of elevator surfing -- - but only the ( usually drunk ) males . And only in packs . If the dead girl was n't alone when she was supposedly elevator surfing , where were her friends ? Elizabeth was a preppie ; as a group , preppies are n't likely to elevator surf . The more Heather thinks about Elizabeth 's death , the less it adds up . In fact , Heather ca n't help but wonder ( although she tries not to ) if Elizabeth was pushed . Is Fischer Hall an unsafe place , with a murderer running rampant ? Or , just as disturbing , did someone see the girl fall and not report it ? Then , incredibly , another dead female freshman is found at the bottom of the elevator shaft . When Heather discovers that the desk elevator key is missing , she contacts Cooper and insists he help her solve the mystery . Cooper though believes that Heather is pursuing the mystery angle because she misses the adrenaline rush of her singing career . That ticks Heather off because it 's so untrue . Or is it ? The already fast-paced plot quickens when Heather discovers that the two dead girls had things in common : they were both virgins and had interfering mothers , according to the dorm records . It 's not too long before she stumbles across a certain individual , but she seems to be the only one who suspects this person . Next thing she knows , her life is in danger . Or is it ? Anyone who has read Meg Cabot 's teen books knows that the author dishes out one delightful read after another -- - and she does n't disappoint with SIZE 12 IS NOT FAT . As always , her characters are real and truly hilarious , the plot is lively , and the romance plays well . Heather is an endearing sleuth with believable motivations . This book is pure entertainment , laugh-out-loud fun with an intriguing mystery woven through -- - perfect for a long winter 's read in front of a roaring fire.My only complaint : WHY must we wait until January 2007 for the next Heather Wells book ? I ca n't wait that long ! -- - Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon	1
I sat on my couch one Sunday and read this whole book before dinnertime , and it was a very refreshing and relaxing read . Heather Wells had me on the edge of my seat at some times , and laughing out loud the rest of the time.Unfortunately I do n't think that this book would be for everyone . Many of my friends who would probably find it too light and silly . And really not much of a mystery . I do n't always agree with the label chick lit , but when I think of it , even in abstract terms , I think of Meg Cabot . This book is a fun read , but it does not really challenge a reader or provoke deep thought.The only downside to the book is that Cabot 's writing is sometimes too obvious . She spells absolutely everything out for the reader , from the sarcastic self depricating POV of the protagonist . That annoyed me a bit , but did n't keep me from enjoying the story !	1
Scotland Yard Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and his lover and partner , Detective Inspector Gemma James , return for the tenth time in Deborah Crombie 's award-winning police procedural series . Since the ongoing relationships between the detectives are not a factor in solving the mystery , this book can be read as a stand-alone.The book has many separate plot lines which eventually become connected . An abandoned warehouse owned by a prominent MP , Michael Harwood , has been burned down in a suspicious fire . Inside the police find the charred body of an unidentified woman . Meanwhile , Winifred Montfort , the wife of Duncan 's cousin , asks Gemma to help locate Elaine Holland , a hospital administrator who has disappeared . While this is going on , Dr. Tony Kovak has kidnapped his daughter , Harriet , because of a marital dispute with his estranged wife , Laura . Tony has left Harriet with Beth , a woman who he hardly knows , but now both Beth and Harriet have disappeared and Laura is also missing . Finally , across the street from the burned warehouse is a women 's shelter where another woman has gone missing . Obviously , one of the four missing women is the one who was killed in the fire , but which one ? And what has happened to Tony 's daughter , Harriet ? If you enjoy British police procedurals , then put Deborah Crombie , who is , amazingly , American , on your must-read list . Her plots are well-crafted , her characters are vivid , and her British settings are completely realistic . Highly recommended .	1
Beautifully tells the stories of Boromini and Bernini and their relationship and how it affected the building of Baroque masterpieces . Very highly recommended	1

What are you doing here ! oh oops hi im echomist let me tell you the story of a house cat like you ... ... ... ... ... ... . ... ... .	1
I love this books . I have the first six of them , and Im going to buy the rest of them as well . I loved this books from the start . I have cats , and I had to admitt that I have been looking a little bit different on my cats after I have read this books . Not that I think they would leave me.I recommend this series by Erin Hunter . One of the best series I have read !	1
I came upon this book when I was in the 5th grade ( 10 years old ) and have loved it since , I still read it now ( 19 years old ) . I suggest this book for any reader who loves cats ! The plot and characters in this series is just great . You can relate to the protagonist in some of his situations ( not going to spoil them ) and you can understand how he feels as he deals with these conflicts . While I found this in the 'young readers ' section at B & N , the vocabulary is still wide enough for teenagers to get into and even some adults .	1
The first in the many-faceted saga of Warrior Cats kicks off with exactly the right tone - mystery , intrigue , and a compelling main character . Firepaw begins life as the housecat Rusty , renamed when he is accepted into the wild cat group called Thunderclan . Firepaw is an excellent protagonist - he 's courageous and has a big heart , but he also makes mistakes and he learns from them . The Thunderclan cats react with varying degrees of emotion to an outsider joining their clan - welcome from Graypaw and Ravenpaw , to suspicion from some of the elders , to outright hostility from Tigerclaw , Lontail and Darkstripe . Firepaw has to proove himself again and again in a world filled with danger from predators , rival clans , Twolegs ( humans ) - and perhaps even his own clanmates.It 's hard to resist cheering Firepaw on during his training , and it 's easy to see what a warrior he 'll make in the end .	1
Hi I am totally loving this story ! ! I am Dovestar of Birchclan . I am a queen , with four young kits . But despite that , I lead Birchclan quite well . This is a good story . The elders told me it . That elder was Silverfire . But then Lizardpelt started yakking about the old days . Uh oh , my kits are crying . Bye ! !	1
I have read this book and I was stuck to it like glue . I think it 's very interesting . Please buy .	1
Really good book not as good as the Journey which was wonderful but certainly a worthwhile read . A wonderful writer very impressed	1
I started reading these back in high school and just recently started 're reading them . Talk about an excellent 're read . This series blows me away with the writing , plot complexity , character profiles , THE WHOLE NINE . Such an inspired series . I will always have this on my 're-reading list	1
This is a fantastic book i could not put it down till i was finishes and Erin Hunter is a great writer	1
I loved the book so much sadness evil and I cried over and over again ca n't wait till I get the next oneFrom hawkheart	1
It really surprised me that Sandstorm had a thing for Fireheart . After all they were enemies at first . I tell you , I almost cried when Graystripe left Thunderclan to be with his motherless kits . Him and Fireheart were best of friends in the very beginning , and I knew Fireheart would never be able to cope with his friend . I just hope Graystripe will come back from Riverclan .	1
THE ENDING ! SO SURPRISING ! DEAD SERIOUS ! THIS BOOK HAS A GREAT STRUCTURE ! BEST SERIES OF BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ !	1
A Masterful peace of art ! I would pick this book over How to Train your dragon any day ! ! ! ! ( I do n't like how to train your dragon anyway )	1
This book is incredible ! There is so much suspense I ca n't put it down . This book was so good I literally started crying the end .	1
This book is well researched.It is written in a good language.It is rather objective.It has nothing to do with who Bob Dylan is.Here you will find every single detail the author has ever found out about Bob Dylan . It does n't matter whether it 's important or not . This makes this book something akin to an encyclopedia - and , for me , there is a big difference between a biography and an encyclopedia . I read the former to get at least a bit closer to the essence of a fascinating personality . I 've never read one of the latter from cover to cover.If you want information , and lots of dry , even though well-presented , facts , you will find them here . All of them . A year-by-year , day-by-day account of Dylan 's life.I think Dylan is something more .	1
This is , page by page , the best Dylan biography out there . If you 're looking for a shocking exposition of debauchery , i.e. , & quot ; National Enquirer & quot ; -style , then you should look elsewhere . However , if you are more interested in the man 's art , as any true Dylan fan would be , then this is the book for you . Although he throws in a couple of questionable interjections ( a complete rejection of the Grateful Dead having any importance in Dylan 's career , a lack of sensitivity for when Dylan 's muse is not there , and a slightly more expose-styled chapter towards the end of the book ) , Heylin does a generally good job throughout of keeping his personal opinions out of the book and telling us what we want to know . All of the albums are gone into in detail ( as in , what was going on in Dylan 's life when they were being made , inside details on the recording sessions , how and when the songs came about , etc . ) , and the good thing is that Heylin talks about the entire sessions ( stuff that did n't make it , material that was never released ) , giving them as much credence as the official canon , which is very important . This gives the book a much more well-rounded scope , and shows the full wealth of Dylan 's art , not just what he has chosen to release . All the tours are given full coverage as well . This is not to say that his personal life is not covered - it is . We get a fascinating glimpse into Dylan 's early childhood , his teenage years when he first started playing in bands , and his subsequent moves to college and New York . All this stuff is , of course , detailed very thoroughly . We also get a look into his relationships ( without stooping to voyeurism . ) It would be foolish to ignore such an important part of Dylan 's life , and it also interesting to look at his various relationships in relation to his muse - it 's interesting to see what women inspired what certain songs . Also , the other major strength that this book has over others is that it adequately ( for the most part ) covers his & quot ; lost & quot ; years of the 80 's and 90 's . The chapters on the 80 's are useful to fans for giving reasons for ( though not excusing ) why Dylan so often in that decade left his best songs off his albums . The Never Ending Tour is also gone into in detail . We also get a look into Dylan 's & quot ; born again & quot ; phase , which had always been a mystery to me . The only thing about this book that really disappointed me is that his excellent 1997 Album of the Year , Time Out of Mind , is not given extensive coverage ( nor the subsequent events in his career . ) Although this book was published in 2001 , it stops chronologically at about the point of the Grammy Awards where Dylan won his three awards for Time Out of Mind ( Things Have Changed is mentioned , barely , but not its accolades . ) Still , this is far and away the best Dylan biography that is now available . It will give you a better understanding of Dylan the man ( always seemingly such an enigma ) , while also giving you a greater appreciation of his art . This book does not destroy Dylan the Legend , but enriches your appreciation of him . That is what a good biography should do .	1

This is a wonderful inspiration for anyone who works with or for children . Teachers and educators sometimes forget that we have a lasting and concrete effect on the children we serve . Do they remember us ? ROXABOXEN answers with an emphatic YES ! The memories of childhood are forever and the impact is widespread .	1
Roxaboxen is a lovely story about a childhood playground created by the author 's mother , her mother 's siblings and her mother 's friends.While children will enjoy the pictures and may get some great ideas for building their own Roxaboxen `` town '' , adult readers are the ones who will truly treasure this story . Its sweet nostalgic look at childhood is a catalyst for our own stories and memories to return . Cooney 's pictures are appropriate and enjoyable but subdued.Overall , a nice memorial to the real Roxaboxen and its residents .	1
This book was purchased as part of a children 's museum exhibit on fort-building and children 's special places . It was a perfect addition to the exhibit that was enjoyed by caregivers and kids alike . Very highly recommended .	1
I read the book on my way home from a literary retreat . I had relaxed all weekend and shared good times with other readers , and so having this mild story to top off the weekend was a treat . The story flowed well . It was not filled with 'big time ' drama . It was a nice 'cute ' story , a book I could hand over to my daughter sitting next to me on the plane , and not feel the need to flip pages for her ( smile ) . Having met Ms. Fox during the retreat , I was tickled that she is as shy as she is , and it comes through in her writing , however , I do think her book Marrying Up shows growth ( she did a reading ) it was sold out before I could buy my copy , so I 'll be ordering one soon .	1
In 1881 at the urging of her mother nouveau riche American heiress Sophia Wilson comes to London to marry a title . Sophia hates shopping for a spouse as she has rejected proposals back home because she wants to marry for love . She believes she may have found her love when she meets the `` unacceptable Duke '' James Langdon.Needing money , James is also attracted to Sophia , so he courts her . However , he vows to himself to never fall in love with her for fear he would become as out of control and abusive as his father was . James and Sophia marry and share a wonderful honeymoon . However when they reach his estate , James turns into a prim and proper aristocrat , who deserts his wife when he is not mistreating her with cold scorn . Still Sophia thinks she can reach her spouse that she loves.When the tale focuses on the lead characters ' relationship , even with James ' incredulous alteration from avoidance to near worship , fans obtain a strong late Victorian romance . When the story line switches to continental suspense , it loses some of its `` American invasion '' momentum . In her debut , Julianne MacLean keeps her plot fresh due to the antics of the dysfunctional Langdon family that bewilder the heroine.Harriet Klausner	1
Love these books . not only do i get to try to guess who-dun-it & # 34 ; but I get to try great recipes as well .	1
I read all of Diane Mott Davidson 's books . This is a great series . Every book has some good recipes too .	1
I have enjoyed every one of the Gold Bear mysteries . They 're light and just fun with plenty of plot twists and surprises to keep me going . AND good recipes !	1
A caterer who helps her husband , the detective , solve murderers/crimes , all the while thinking about the Jerk and her cooking . She has to race around , getting in the way but , yet , solving the crime . This has definitely never been done before . You do n't have to love cooking to love these books . Still , every book series or TV series has a character reappear after their death or their crime or something . Sandee coming back ? ! It was almost obvious , we just had to wait for her . But I 'm definitely looking forward Fatally Flaky ! : - )	1
The female-sleuth here is Colorado caterer Goldy Schulz . The premise of this book is that Goldy is investigating the murder of Drew Wellington , the former district attorney . She was setting up for a breakfast she was to cater in the city library when she and the head librarian find the dead body of Mr. Wellington . Of course Goldy has to try to figure out what happened , even though her police detective-husband Tom reminds her to stay out of the case and let the police handle it.And there is another mystery to be solved : Goldy also thinks she sees a woman who is supposed to be dead named Sandee Brisbane . Sandee murdered Goldy 's ex-husband and then committed suicide . Now Goldy wonders if Sandee really did commit suicide ? Did they ever find her body ? Why was Sandee , or someone who looked just like her , in the library right before they find Mr. Wellington 's body ? This book is well written and I would recommend it . The ending is a real page-turner and is quite clever . We discover , along with Goldy , just 'who done it ' .	1
enjoyed this books . totally love the story like . thank you very very very very very very very very very much	1
Very cute classic of the boy 's sweet stuffed animal come to life . Would have been better with updated illustrations , I do n't think kids will get the originals , very sketchy and old fashioned compared with today 's standards .	1
This book is uplifting . It 's a wonderful book to have available if you 're waiting in a doctors office or on your lunch break , anytime that you 're bored or somewhat bothered with life . Within this short period of time it takes to read the book your mood will be altered . It just makes you happy . You 'll find yourself thinking about the book long after you read it -- believe me , you will read this book more than once . It 's light but serious and will make you smile .	1
... a classic ...	1
The message that can be found in this classic children 's book is that love makes you real . The title character learns this simple truth in this touching story .	1
This is one of my all-time favorite stories . I still cry every time I read it and the quote about what is real is permanently etched .	1
Powerful collection of advice and insight that does n't follow any single line of religious dogma , but instead borrows from all of them to create a universal code of higher wisdom . This is one of those books ( likeNapoleon Hill 's Positive Action Plan : 365 Meditations For Making Each Day a Success ) that I will never finish reading -- I 'll read it for the rest of my life .	1
The biracial daughter of a Korean woman who was forced into prostitution on a segregated Army base tries to repair her fragile relationship with her mother , and find her own sense of self . A very moving story told in alternating chapters between past and present . I look forward to more from this new author .	1
The characters were opened , raw and bleeding , stark under a bright light , much like the diseased and dying birds.I was drawn to this book , but unsure exactly why . Maybe hope kept me going , but I was on some level grabbed by the understated power & intensitiy of this book .	1
This is a satisfactory entry -- but no more than that -- in a long-running and entertaining series . Fat Andy Dalziel of the outrageous name is always worth the price of admission . ( In some future outing he should become involved with an American southerner named Taliaferro , thus affording opportunity for 400-plus pages of trans-Atlantic mispronunciations . ) At this stage of his career , Hill has taken to mixing genres . In this book , without digging too hard , we find comedy of manners , international thriller , police procedural , locked room puzzle , English country house mystery , multi-generational epic and literary navel-gazer . Unfortunately , none of these elements has quite enough freedom to soar , nor do they manage to blend together into a satisfactory whole . The locked room story , for example , shoots itself in the foot ( so to speak ) right at the beginning of the book . At the end of the book [ SPOILER ALERT ! ] the Emily Dickinsonian literary thread turns out to be ... irrelevant , a mere McGuffin.I suspect that Reginald Hill 's long-term triumphs have been enough to ensure that his publishers apply little save the most mechanical sort of editing to his hefty manuscripts . It is hard , of course , to argue with success , but `` Good Morning , Midnight '' would be a better book if an editor with blue pencil poised had asked some hard questions of Hill . There are really too many narrative strands to form much more than an unsightly tangle . The final answer to a big `` WHY ? '' question just is n't massive enough to bear the accumulated weight of the hundreds of pages we have traversed to get to it . The backstory of the series is becoming unwieldy . The character of Hat Bowler , another preposterous name ( there are more ) , simply does not make any sense at all in terms of THIS book , except as an annoying weakling . Sergeant Wield , on the other hand , is strong enough but he is given nothing to do . He is a player listed on the program who is given the opportunity to stride on stage , bow to the audience , collect a polite round of recognition applause and then obliged to depart before affecting the shape of the drama in any degree.Then there is the matter of language . British editors should have a stick bearing the motto `` You write in American at your peril '' with which to beat English authors over the head . As an American long-ago transplanted to Canada , I still occasionally stumble over the very much more subtle differences between 'Murrican and Western Canajan . Hill 's Americans sometimes sound almost as hilariously wrong as dear old Agatha Christie 's , not so much in their vocabulary but in rhythm of speech and sentence structure . ( Come to think of it , Hill 's Yank does say `` reckon . '' In all my life , I have heard just two Americans say `` I reckon '' : Gary Cooper and John Wayne , and then only in movie westerns . ) '' Good Morning , Midnight '' does have one estimable advantage over several other outings of the series . DCI Pascoe 's wife , the egregious Ellie , makes only perfunctory appearances . True to form , as other Amazon reviewers have noted , even in her brief turn on stage she manages to sound a profoundly wrong note on one of her many false fiddles . It is a measure of Hill 's talent that with Ellie Pascoe he has managed to create the complete Anti-Nora Charles , the most distasteful cow in all of contemporary mystery ( and perhaps any ) fiction .	1
A new Dalziel and Pascoe novel is always a cause for celebration but `` Dialogues of the Dead '' is a special treat for puzzle and word-game lovers . Hill 's books are celebrated for sly and clever wordplay but this novel takes it further , making a word-puzzle central to the plot.Two accidental deaths are proved murder by `` Dialogues '' submitted to a local Yorkshire literary contest . The pieces contain clues , but the local police , including fat , crude , razor-sharp Supt . Andy Dalziel , and the refined and dependable Inspector Peter Pascoe , as well as several academic consultants , are baffled . Meanwhile young constable `` Hat '' Bowler begins to romance the attractive librarian Rye Pomona while finding numerous suspects among the sniping literati , except for one problem - they keep getting murdered.Word mavens might follow clues to the solution , but Hill leaves the key hidden until the end . Intricately constructed , with well-drawn characters and diabolical murder scenes , this novel will dazzle puzzle fans . Those less in the know , like myself , may feel many of the sophisticated clues flying right over their heads .	1
Hill never ceases to amaze me with his clever plots and his well-drawn characters . Andy Dalziel is one of my favourite detectives out there . He comes across as crude and a little thick , but that is a part that he plays to hide his razor-sharp intelligence . But even Andy gets frustrated with this case . Unlike most Hill books , this one has a lot of corpses , and the CID team is on the trail of a serial killer they call the Wordman . As the bodies pile up , the list of suspects gets smaller and smaller . Finally there are eight bodies , and Andy 's team finally closes in on the killer . Are they right ? Is the one they 've honed in on the infamous Wordman ? With this book though , `` It ai n't over until the fat lady sings '' , and she is n't singing at the end of the book . Ca n't wait to read Part 2 ! My only regret is that I 'm getting close to the end of this truly wonderful series .	1
I recently decided to brush up on my American history and knew Zinn 's book was one I wanted to read . I found it in a Guatemalan used books store and it turned out to be the first of my 'brushing up ' series . Zinn is entertaining . Zinn is easy to read . Zinn is full of facts . I wish every American would read this book ( as an adult , preferably ) . But most of us will need to read a 'real ' history of the United States as an antidote to Zinn 's attempt to convince us that for 500 years America has been no more than a sulfurous cauldron of evil . I chose Paul Johnson 's 'A History of the American People ' for my antidote . At the end of both books , I was exhilarated . Zinn points out the problems and Johnson , by providing historical context , points out the solutions . Johnson is also by far the better historian , as reading the two books back to back makes clear . I am anxious to read more of Johnson 's work , but will probably not read any more of Zinn 's , as I already have a general sense of what Zinn writes - a laundry list of problems , with no hope in sight . Let me repeat , however , this is a book I wish every American would read , even though it is not really a 'history ' of the United States . Not even a 'people 's history , ' because the people of the United States , fortunately , are far better people , and far better at solving their country 's problems , than Zinn would have us believe .	1
This book was read as a book club reading . It was a real look at some of the thoughts women may have as mothers .	1
The often lauded Wapshot Chronicle is an episodic and , frankly , uneven look at a New England family . The Wapshots consist of parents Sarah and Leander and their two sons Moses and Coverly , who live in the seaside town of St. Botolph 's , though the boys move away early in the book to seek their fortunes . The first of five novels published by master short story writer John Cheever , it finds the author struggling a bit with the longer form . Reading Wapshot , one can tell that the writer honed his craft with short stories . There are bursts of wonderful description and human drama that could easily stand alone but they do n't hang together very well and the transitions are awkward . There are also a few clunkers : the brief & # 34 ; I 'm looking for a lei & # 34 ; scene is especially worthy of a loud rimshot & # 8230 ; Wapshot reminded me of the much longer and much more wordy debut novel The Town and the City by another New Englander , Jack Kerouac , which preceded Wapshot by about five years and also focused on a family from a small Northeastern town ( Kerouac would of course develop a whole new approach to writing that he debuted with the celebrated On the Road , published only a few months after Wapshot ) . Kerouac 's cast is much larger , which is not an advantage as he has a lot of trouble keeping up with them all.Cheever pares his cast down to a more manageable number but the narrative still meanders . For example , while I appreciated the backstory of the Wapshot family provided through Leander 's attempt at family chronicle , its stylistic idiosyncrasy ( lots of very short phrases masquerading as sentences ) grates when juxtaposed with the eloquent third-person narrative in the rest of the book . This would frankly have been a better book if it were a short story cycle with common characters.If Wapshot is notable for anything , it 's the book 's venture into homosexuality , catnip for readers taken with the idea of a major author broaching such a taboo subject in the Eisenhower years . Perhaps this makes them overestimate the book as a whole . For me , the ( fairly brief and tame ) gay relationship was interesting and certainly brave on Cheever 's part ( though the much more explicit Giovanni 's Room had already been published by James Baldwin the year before ) but it does n't make up for the stylistic weaknesses I mentioned earlier.While listing Wapshot Chronicle as one of the Modern Library 's 100 Best English Language Novels of the 20th Century is going a bit far , as is the National Book Award it received ( the competition that year included Vladimir Nabokov 's Pnin , William Faulkner 's The Town , Bernard Malamud 's The Assistant and Jack Kerouac 's On the Road ) , I 'm giving this book four stars because there are a lot of wonderfully described incidents in it that deserve to be read . I just wish it was tighter .	1
This is highly enjoyable and interesting for the way in which Cheever constructs this New England world . The plot is only so-so , but as a vehicle for understanding the characters it pays dividends . Cheever 's best work remains his body of short stories .	1
Epiphanies are good things . They are psychological wake-up calls to clarity and truth . They cut through years of mental and societal conditioning to expose common sense like a bright copper penny at the bottom of a swimming pool.ABC consumer reporter ( and co-anchor of the news show `` 20/20 '' ) John Stossel shares his epiphany through the pages of his entertaining and informative book , GIVE ME A BREAK . For years , Stossel developed a reputation as a fearless and relentless crusader by exposing rip-off artists , scams , boondoggles , and other unspeakable corruption -- all in the interest of protecting the public at large from greedy and selfish corporations . For this , Stossel was an award-winning media darling , a welcome addition to the leftist culture that permeates and controls network news.But a funny thing happened on the way to liberal nirvana : Stossel began taking a look not only at the warts of the private sector , but at those who regulate the warts as well . And he found some troubling wart hairs -- from a $ 330,000 outhouse paid by tax dollars , to a town in Missouri essentially bulldozed because dioxin found in the soil `` might '' be harmful to its inhabitants , to corporate `` welfare queens '' who grow even richer on the backs of hardworking taxpayers . Thus , after 15 years of reporting , Stossel 's epiphany was born : government is n't the solution , it 's the problem . We do n't need more government to interfere and obstruct , we need less.And this revelation really hit below the belt : capitalism actually works.Accordingly , Stossel began broadcasting this heresy ( giving credit to several people at ABC for having the backbone to air his opinions ) ; he instantly went from media darling to pariah . The `` totalitarian left , '' as Stossel phrases it , was incensed . Countless efforts were made to get him off the air , get him fired , yet Stossel persevered , and now shares his trials and tribulations in this delightful book.GIVE ME A BREAK is a quick , energetic read that will get you pumped up , regardless of your political persuasion . Stossel 's writing style is identical to his broadcast narrative , making the reader feel comfortable and casual . Finally , this is anything but a conservative tome ; it is a libertarian manifesto , as sacred cows on both sides of the spectrum are gored . Give me a break ? No , give me an epiphany , instead . Highly recommended. -- D . Mikels	1
Many do not understand the phenomenon that is Libertarianism , a political philosophy which is greatly like that that of the Democratic-Republicans of our nation 's Founding Fathers , the thought of John Stuart Mill , and - to a lesser and slightly more conservative degree - that of Edmund Burke . Too infrequently do Americans even breach the subject of political philosophy with any depth , primarily thanks to our general tendency for pragmatism ( if we are being positive ) and superficiality ( in a more negative sense ) . Stossel 's light-hearted text does not aim to be a treatise on Libertarian thought but does function - in a wholly American style - to broach the subject of this political philosophy through concrete examples in his exodus from `` social liberalism '' ( which is often just called liberalism today ) to classical liberalism , that of the Libertarian.Stossel begins with his common , gut-level misperceptions of what the direction and aim of consumer reporting is . Though a series of stories , he came to realize that much of the sensationalizing which the media was doing ( and the people were consuming ) was nothing more than fear-mongering which actually diverted a great deal of attention from more important matters . In addition , this fear-mongering takes on a character of duplicity by both excoriating large entities ( business and government ) while calling for the same entities to take action ( particularly government ) . From a series of such realizations , he came to realize that much common sense is found in the political philosophy of Libertarianism , in its dual pillars of laissez-faire capitalism and individual liberty . He proceeds in a non-comprehensive way to show that such freedom has been beneficial , particularly in the elimination of material poverty.Peppered with other light considerations of the meaning of liberty , Stossel 's book serves as an excellent , albeit very , very light , introduction into Libertarian thought for American readers . It is engaging and enjoyable , therefore coming with my high recommendations in an age which has lost much zeal for liberty .	1
My little grand-niece will start Preschool this summer and I thought the book would serve as an introduction . It met all of my expectations and she loved it .	1
Loved the movie , most times the books are even better so I bought the book , fast shipping , good transaction , book perfect condition , just was dissapointed in the story . Movie much better .	1
My grandmother owned this book in the early 60 's , and my sisters and I read it with awe . We lived in KY and loved the book especially because of that . I never forgot the down-to-earth , unapologetic story , but it was n't easy to find a copy before there were on-line services . Now I can have it on Kindle ! The dollmaker is a powerful protagonist , and her life is hard . Options are limited . She makes choices and continues to live with them . Great book .	1
Am so enjoying the Englishmen and their stories . This was very interesting and you could tell from the beginning they would eventually get together	1
I found this story utterly romantic . Archie is a hero that is a pleasure to read about as he melts his ice princess ... .	1
Anyone familiar with Lorraine Heath 's novels will recognize a big difference in `` As an Earl Desires '' -- neither our hero nor heroine is Texan . They 're both English.Archie is a great hero . I loved him from the start . Having recently been informed that he is the new earl , he goes to London and does NOT have the best time of his life . He 's a schoolteacher from a small town in northern England , not a wealthy carefree rake . To help ease him into the aristocratic circles in which he now finds himself , Lady Sachse -- his predecessor 's widow -- comes forward . They develop a friendship that -- yes , of course -- leads to romance . But the journey from this point to the inevitable end is a very satisfying one , and I recommend it . No -- this is n't `` war and peace '' , but who wants to read `` war and peace '' ? If you want to immerse yourself in the lives of two people -- one wounded and the other sensitive , loving , and willing to help -- then read `` As an Earl Desires . '' There 's a twist or two for you to smile at , and also sets up perfectly the next book in the series , `` Promise me Forever . '' Two thumbs up to Lorraine Heath !	1
Jonathan definitely has talent , there 's no doubt about it . Certain sections of the book are stronger than others but overall this is a very , very well written book . And when you consider the fact that this is the author 's first novel , you appreciate it even more so .	1
When I read a piece of this book in The New Yorker some months back , I found myself laughing out loud with delight . ( At the time I had a Ukrainian boyfriend struggling with his English , so I found Alex 's mixed-up language both incredibly accurate and very close to home . ) But I was n't delighted merely because the writing is so clever . There is also something refreshingly innocent about Foer 's writing , something that feels very pure , very new , and , well , BIG . I thought , & quot ; Thank God ... a real talent arrives ! & quot ; And the book bears that out . I look forward to the career of Jonathan Safran Foer ... my new literary crush .	1
I saw the movie from the book , before I actually read it , so my opinion my not be so objective . I liked that the book viewed both Alex and Jonathon differently . After having seen the movie , I never would have thought that Jonathon would have said so many sexually related topics about his grandfather . I was n't really wild about the 18th century section of Trachembrod , but I really enjoyed the 20th century descriptions . He said that the Trachembrodians knew that their village was in danger , yet nobody fled . They just sat there , waiting.I preferred the movie 's ending better than the book 's ending . However , that last letter ( in the book ) is really emotional.I guess that I 've said enough !	1
I put off reading this book for the longest time , because everyone at the bookstore I was working at was talking about how great it was , and it was going to be made into a mainstream movie ... I usually do n't like those types of books.I was still a little skeptical as I read the beginning - was n't sure if I was going to like it . But upon finishing the book , I have to say it is one of the best books I have read . I 'm so glad I finally came around !	1
As with all of Mr. Hurwitz 's books , this book never allows you to let your mind wander . It gave me a new understanding of how these cults work and how they are able to take over peoples minds . Excellent read .	1
Marisol another of those one name personalities like Cher , Prince and Madonna . She has been a model , a banker , a belly dancer and various other professions in her life . A native of Venezuela , she has penned a wonderful tribute to her female heritage.According to the Latin American proverb , for a woman to succeed in life and please her man , she needs to be a lady in the living room , a chef in the kitchen and the courtesan in the bedroom . This philosophy is played out in the tale of Pilar . She goes home for her grandmother 's funeral , and finds she is left a legacy she did not expect : bound in black silk are her nana 's journals . The writings carry the secrets of her grandmother 's life she carried to the grave . The journals detail the beauty rituals women of South America for centuries have learned to master , stressing the social etiquette , delicious recipes to seduce men , including the most important recipe of all : how to blend a strong-willed woman into lady , wife and lover.This is very sensual , compelling novel that contrast the glory of being feminine through the eyes of a modern woman against discovering the time honoured traditions of her grandmother.A truly wonderful book that empowers being a woman on all levels .	1
This is one of the books on the series regarding Richard Sharpe by Bernard Cornwell . This takes place during the British campaign in Portugal . Like all the books in this series I found it to be informative and also an enjoyable read .	1
This is actually my first Bernard Cornwell novel . It is amazingly , and sometimes gruesome , detailed . His thorough research on historical issues are indeed extremely well . That is why , after finishing reading this novel , I became one of Cornwell 's huge fan.Heretic is actually the last novel of the Grail Quest series , with a total of three installments . I have never actually read the first two installments , which did not make a big differrence , since parts of the previous plots were being told sporadically in Heretic.Thomas Hookton , the main protagonist , met a heretic girl who is bound for burning for being claimed heretic . The story revolves around Thomas ' search for the holy grail , the cup , to be more precise . His adventures with the other competing knight , being a paid mercenary for several kings , his love interests , etc . All of these interesting stories were woven into a nice fictional novel.The outcome of this book is astonishing . If I wrote the ending in this review , it will shatter the element of excitement prepared by Bernard Cornwell.Get this book , a five-star read .	1
KRAKATOA is an appealing and reader-friendly piece of history and science . The populist approach by author Simon Winchester reminds me of Carl Sagan.It is n't until page 233 of this 390-page hardback that the narrative arrives at 10:02 AM on August 27 , 1883 , when the volcanic island of Krakatoa , situated in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra , blew up . The explosion was heard 2,968 miles away - roughly the distance between Philadelphia and San Francisco , ejected enough dust into the upper atmosphere to color sunsets worldwide for the next three years , and generated waves strong enough to register on tide gauges on England 's south coast . Of the Earth 's volcanic blasts known to history , this was the fifth largest.In the preceding 232 pages , Winchester skims a fascinating array of relevant subjects that should appeal to any reader of eclectic interests : the evolution of the Dutch East India Company and its spice trade , Darwinism , the Wallace Line , continental drift , convection currents inside the Earth 's mantle , plate tectonics , paleomagnetism , subduction zones , the development of underwater telegraph cables , evidence for Krakatoan eruptions in earlier centuries , and the observed paroxysms of the doomed island in the months , days , and hours before the final cataclysm . While many of the subjects may sound dry , the author 's treatment of them isn't.10:02 AM on August 27 went by in an instant . The pages following describe the series of ocean waves , the last over 100 feet high by the time it hit nearby coasts , that killed all but 1,000 of the 36,000+ who died in the calamity . After the waters subside and the ashes settle , Winchester closes with a discussion of the art inspired by years of glorious , dust-mediated , sunsets . And the re-emergence of a new volcanic island , Anak Krakatoa , on the site of the old , including the establishment of plant , insect and animal life on its barren , steaming surface.The author bases his story on a multitude of scientific and historical sources , many of which involve eyewitness accounts of events . These , plus Winchester 's dry humor , make for an engaging read . There 's one chapter , however , which the book 's editor should 've advised tossing , i.e . the one unconvincingly postulating that the 1883 disaster sparked the revolt of the Islamic native population against their Christian Dutch overlords , which resulted in the latter being sent packing from Indonesia in 1949 . Hmm . Perhaps it was just because the Dutch colonial administration was n't warm and cuddly . You think ? Also , though the volume is interspersed with useful photos and drawings , Winchester 's own visit to Ana Krakatoa is visually unrepresented - a sorry lapse.Ana Krakatoa translates as & quot ; Son of Krakatoa & quot ; . The history of the island suggests it may also mean , & quot ; I 'm back , and you 'll be sorry ! & quot ; Surfers at some future time may have another opportunity to catch a Monster Wave .	1
My son LOVES this book ! He also loves finding our dog 's poop in the yard and exclaiming & # 34 ; There 's the poop ! & # 34 ; Great first steps for potty training !	1
The Graveyard Book is my first Neil Gaiman book , and I 'm definitely planning on reading more . I 'd heard a lot of praise of this book , but it still did n't prepare me for the elegance of his style.Though I liked the drawings , the real charm of this book is the writing . Gaiman has woven a really beautiful coming-of-age tale in which Nobody Owens , the main character , learns some harsh lessons about the nature of life and love . As most people are probably aware by now , there is some violence in the book and it may not be for the younger audience . However , I am not one of those parents who thinks that children need to be protected from everything scary in life . In fact , I 'm willing to wager that the average Wii game has more graphic violence than what is portrayed in this book . Some of it is quite scary , that is true , but children need to learn how to control fear and how to recognize when fear is real and important and when it 's something they just need to overlook.One of the things I liked best about the book is that Gaiman never really comes out and tells the reader exactly what the other characters are , leaving you to piece together the clues he drops and figure this out for yourself . This is particularly true of Silas , and I was probably around a third of the way into the book before I realized what his character was . I really admire this as it demands that the reader pay attention to what he or she is reading . It 's also a perfect example of an author showing rather than telling . Lastly , it lends to the idea of the book that what people are on the outside is n't really as important on the inside . Is it really that vital that the reader know what Silas is , or is it more significant that the reader sees just how Silas helps Bod learn and grow , and how seriously Silas takes his role as guardian and protector of Bod.As for Bod , I found him to be an excellent character . He is a very typical boy , with a boy 's characteristic curiosity . He occasionally acts out of sheer pettiness and must suffer the consequences . Through Bod , Gaiman also teaches children some important lessons . Sometimes , even though we do what is right , it does not earn us the admiration of those about whose opinions we care the most . This is a painful lesson , but a very valuable lesson -- especially in a society such as ours , that emphasizes instant gratification . Bod is a very moral character , but the things he does do n't always end well for him and sometimes cause him more trouble than anticipated . Is n't this true of life in general ? Sometimes our actions do set many unintended consequences into motion.Another strong aspect of the book is the unconventional relationships within it . While they are certainly fantastical , this book has a lot to say about the true meaning of the word `` family '' , and how families can form amongst the unlikeliest groups of people . As The Graveyard Book shows , families take responsibility for one another , and care for one another without asking for something in return . Just as his guardian does , Bod learns that he ultimately must make sacrifices for his family , that he must place their needs above those of his own at times . It is a responsibility that he does not shirk , and I think that 's an excellent message for anyone.I highly recommend this book . It is a subtle , sometimes funny , and sometimes sad read . It is a book that will make children think , just as all great literature makes a reader think .	1
What an amazing book . No wonder it won the Newbery Award . It was completely deserving . And it only took Gaiman 20 years to write ! Now my spending a year on my own manuscript does n't make me feel so guilty.I tend to not make connections from one book to another all that easily and it was n't until Gaiman mentioned the Jungle Book reference that it all clicked for me . Of course ! Same concept , different landscape . Granted it 's been quite a while since I 've read Kipling , I still remember enough to draw the post-parallels.Bod is such a magical character , and this is above and beyond the Freedom of the Graveyard that he has . There was something special about him right from the very beginning . There was something calling to him to get him out of harm 's way and into the safety of , of all places , a graveyard . The man Jack never stood a chance.And how I loved the Jacks of All Trade ! How awesome of a group . I really wish the book went into a little more detail about just what they were because , really , the little worm on a hook we got about them so was n't enough for me . I wanted more ! And I just might get it in Gaiman 's supposed sequel ! The book is written in such a simplistic way that it would be simple for a child of really any age to understand but the older you are , the greater you 're capable of understanding all of the underlying elements it holds . This book is literally something for people of all ages to read . There 's nothing in here that someone 10 or 30 would n't like.All of the characters are living and breathing as soon as they come onto the page . Maybe it 's the bias that I have towards Gaiman because I love most of his work so much , but I honestly think the man could create an infinitely dynamic character from a couple of words , he 's that good . But everyone from Bod to Scarlett to Silas ( how awesome Silas was ! ) to the Owenses and Liza and the Jacks , even the Sleer had a rich depth about them that only magnificent storytelling could weave.What pulled at me the most was the relationship between Scarlett and Bod . I found myself in Bod 's shoes asking why ? towards the end because there were other ways , there could have been other ways but Silas knew what he was doing . And that pain of Bod being without another living person to exist around really permeated the pages . Of course he loved where he was and he loved his ghost family , but at the end of the day Bod was human and as a human he required like companionship.The ending opened up all sorts of possibilities for Bod but even then it was a sad send-off for him . I did n't want him to leave the people that have cared for him all those years . And he was so young ! But all times must come and it was Bod 's turn to play that fiddle . It did n't keep the tears from prickling my eyes , though , that much I can tell you.The writing is , without a doubt , fantastic . The characters are as real as if they were breathing at your neck and every emotion Bod feels , every sense of fear or pain or sadness or happiness , pulls at your heart just like it does to him . You 'll look up to the parental figures of the graveyard , you 'll sneer at the foes and you 'll love the life just like Bod does . So be sure to read this book because this is one you certainly do n't want to miss .	1
As a fan ofCoraline , I knew that I would be entertained by Gaiman 's 2009 Newbery Medal winner but I did n't know I would n't be able to put it down . He had me at page 1 with the combination of but a few sentences and a 2-page spread illustration - wow ! Following a man all too well known in adult literature up a set of stairs to the attic ... .To say Gaiman is the Stephen King of children 's literature is not quite correct - rather I would say he is a contemporary of Tim Burton . If you or your child likedCorpse Bridethen you 'll love Bod 's many adventures growing up in the graveyard . Sleeping in a cozy crypt , learning the alphabet from gravestones , wearing a winding sheet for clothes ... .I would say that this book can be enjoyed by adventuresome 3rd graders and above . Those few negative reviews seem to stem from parents and teachers who fail to grasp the simple facts that many/most children enjoy a little shiver now and then and that books with challenging subject matter provide a safe haven for the reader to experience and learn from situations outside of their safe environment . I have met far too many parents , librarians and teachers who wish to curtail any reading outside of what they deem to be sunny and appealing subjects . It 's a loosing battle , thankfully . The simple fact of the matter is we LIKE to be scared [ just a little ] and Gaiman delivers .	1
The prologue to this book put me off a little , containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence , but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me . Two more very ugly , explicit and disgusting sexualized `` scenes '' in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further . I 'm told this has been made into a movie , which not only beggars belief , but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching .	-1
Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane ; I will always view it differently ! The 90 year old man telling the story reacted the same way I would have ... stomach distress . Should be rated R for sexual and other graphic language . I do not reccommend it for sensitive , caring women .	-1
I never found a book that so accurately portrayed growing old and how you are treated . The story begins with life in the circus ,	-1
Dreadful . Judging from the first paragraph , this novel had the potential for being absorbing and a good holiday read . I was soon only making my way through it because I had nothing else to read and I kept thinking it must get better since it came highly recommended . If only I had had something better than this time waster : lazy plot that never seemed to go anywhere because it went in too many irrelevant directions , little firsthand knowledge of the circus , low-level vocabulary . A waste of time on a good topic .	-1
I did n't like it -- too depressing -- killings , , blood , war -- who needs it , even if t was Hemmingway . The main character in the book , Robert , may have been a self study of Hemmingway himself ! !	-1
I 'll make this as short as possible ... ... ... ..like I wish the book would have been . This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be . I got halfway through , and quit . It was so boring . I wanted , ( as always ) , a good story , not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet . I ca n't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work . He can , in no way , be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field .	-1
Red Mars started off just dandy , with a variety of characters ( a bit too one-dimensional , but hey ) struggling with how to best colonize Mars . No one was a 'good ' guy or a 'bad ' guy - just good hard sci-fi mixed with honest ideological differences.Halfway through the book , however , it all changed . All of a sudden , Trans-national corporations are launching nukes , after buying out the United Nations . Christian fundamentalists try to dominate the colonies . A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies , while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos , primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end . I 'll only read the sequels because I want to read all the Hugo and Nebula award winners - not because I have any hope for the rest of the series .	-1
This is not one of his best , but considering what manure or tree wasters he has written , this is almost good . I have stopped reading this author , he seems to get paid by the word and in later books puts in subplots that have nothing to do with the book so he can make political or religious statements.Buy this book second hand , and keep it handy for a camping trip . It will give you something to read on rainy days and will give you a nice supply of toilet paper .	-1
This is a fantasy book for teens . Yep ! There really are evil monsters that follow the biddings of satanic witches . Our trucker hero , Josh , is caught up in a small , isolated Virginia town 's nightmare when he accidentally runs over a newborn in a stroller.When he refuses to recant his story that an evil woman pushed the stroller purposefully into the truck 's path , the bad guys have got to silence him.This was written in an average writing style with silly , unbelievable characters . Gray , I 'm sure , will have lots of followers -- those who like books about witches , dragons , zombies , and anything else teenager-ish . Please do n't waste your time with this !	-1
Language and imagery continue to get more illicit.The only characters that I still liked in the series keep getting killed .	-1
In my opinion , the writing of DwD almost seemed to say , `` These people will take whatever crumbs I toss at them and love it ; I am GRRM ! '' To which *I* say , `` Look , you ingrate , for YEARS I practically shoved your dang books down the throats of friends , family , and complete strangers . I defended you whenever anyone complained about the ridiculous length of time between books . I lauded your Seven Kingdoms in all the different kingdoms to which we traveled . I started a SoIaF group , that we might discuss this series that we loved . I spent oodles of cash on your books for myself and as gifts for others . I supported your website and listened to your interviews . I convinced people who could n't stand the fantasy genre to read your words . I did all of this , and THIS is how you repay me ? By writing a book from which you seemed too far away ? By worshiping at the altar of HBO , as your books took a back burner to the series ? By complaining that we who do n't LOVE every word written by your royal hand are sock puppets ? By making it seem like your own importance now outweighs the love of your earliest fans ? '' Remember us ? We are your earliest fans ... the people who read your first book , then your second , etc , and it is we who ultimately helped you to this throne on which you currently sit.Like many other reviewers , I have read the first four books of the ASoIaF series many times over ( starting in the late '90 's ) as I waited for the next book to come out , then the next book , etc . I happily reread those first three books ( again ! ) as I awaited FfC , re-living each profound event of the series as if I were discovering it for the first time , which speaks to the phenomenal writing of those First Three.When FfC was finally published , I was there first thing in the morning , waiting impatiently to grab the goods , rush home , and then to devour the book with glee ! Then , when I was finished reading ... It was okay ... But that was acceptable to me ; the next book was BOUND to be better . It was BOUND to recapture the magic and continue the legacy that GRRM had created . So , as MORE YEARS went by , I waited impatiently yet again , checking his web page for updates like a maniac , asking everyone at my local bookstore if they 'd heard anything yet , participating in online forums to help pass the time . Until , finally , finally , DwD was released . Once again I was first in line to get the next book of my beloved series . I carted it home and immediately began to read.Two months later I was finished . To be clear : I am a very fast reader , depending on how much I 'm enjoying the book that I 'm holding . In other words , I was so disappointed in DwD that it was almost painful to force myself to finish reading it . I barely recognized many of the characters that I loved , and I kept waiting for the story to progress enough to recapture my attention , but it was as though GRRM was writing from a far off tower constructed from his overabundance of hubris . I promised myself that I would only write my review after reading it a second time , but my bookmark sits idle somewhere around page 400 . I just ca n't finish it this time.So , sadly , I not only ca n't recommend A Dance with Dragons , I also can no longer defend my once-favorite author . I can only hope that he hears us , and goes on a legitimate quest for the magic of the First Three .	-1
After making it to the end of book 5 , I refuse to waste another dollar or minute of my time on this meandering miasma of meaninglessness.Book 1 was of course a pretty good read . By books 2 and 3 , I started reading just one sentence per page in some chapters to get through the endless and excessive descriptions . By books 4 and 5 , in many chapters I was reading perhaps one sentence every five or ten pages because the story literally moves that slowly.I really do n't know what GRRM hoped to accomplish with the awful books 4 and 5 . As countless other reviewers have pointed out , despite their 1,700 pages of text , pretty much nothing happens except that a character or two that might have been developed in some meaningful way was killed off.There is so much that could have been done but was n't . Sansa and Tyrion could actually have learned something from each other , and their marriage might have developed with a little time . Arya was on a roll for the first three books then hit the tar pits of books 4 and 5 . And Jon ... what a waste.My biggest gripe is GRRM 's proclivity for doing lengthy character developments , then abruptly killing the character . I found almost as bad his undeviating use of cliffhanger chapter endings . Obviously , it is a pretty standard practice in popular entertainment novels , but he manages to make the trite device excruciatingly painful time after time by waiting five or ten chapters , or even an entire book , to again pick up the story for that character.In short , GRRM has squandered in countless ways what could have been an exciting three or four books . Instead , he supersized it , filled it with bloat , and destroyed nearly all forward momentum with hundreds and hundreds of pages of meaningless writing.So I 'm done . I refuse to read any more .	-1
No need for the 12 paragraph reviews I 've been reading . The review is simple : After the third book this guy just ran out of gas but was making so much dough he kept going . Sort of . But not very well .	-1
Very disappointing . A huge let down from previous books in the series . Not sure I will buy the next book ... .	-1
I wo n't go into detail since many others have done a far better job than I can . I 'm only about 1/3 through this book so far . I was very disappointed in Feast for Crows and this book will join that one in the disappointment category . Storm of Swords was sooooo good ! I did n't expect the 4th and 5th books in the series to be as good , especially since I had read the reviews , but my gosh . I 'd say it 's a fast read because you can skip a lot except in places it 's so boring that I tend to fall asleep ( I only have time to read at night ) . I wanted to read Dance with Dragons right away since I have been reading the entire series this year after getting hooked on the HBO show . All I can say is , I hope Winds of Winter is better and does n't take Mr. Martin 5 years to publish because in 5 years , not only will I have forgotten everything I 've read , but I may not care . I guess if you 're a fan of the Song of Fire and Ice as I am , this is a must read , as I considered it , but be prepared to slog through it and be prepared for the characters to act differently than they did in Storm of Swords . 'Nuff said .	-1
I loved the first three books of the series but the fourth seemed half a book and went nowhere ( not surprisingly since Martin claimed that it was half of a book and the other half would be out in no time ) . After five years we get this absolutely worthless excuse for a book . Chapter after chapter introduces one or two characters , moves the plot forward infinitesimally and then skips onto the next . Half way through I realised that even if I finished the book there would still be TWO MORE to come ( by 2023 given his present pace ) . I think that he has written himself into a corner , he has no idea of how the plot will end , if it ever will .	-1
I was really looking forward to this book , wow was I disappointed . Absolutely nothing was accomplished and the story remained stalled . At this pace the rest of the story will fill another 5 books ... ..at least .	-1
I was an avid fan of the first 3 George R R Martin books in this series and I anxiously awaited this last one to come out , especially since it took around 6 years to write . I was horribly disappointed by this book and I honestly could not finish it.The sad truth is is that this book could have been about 300 pages and still accomplished the amount of story told in this book . Nothing actually happens . Although a large amount of time passes in this book it seems like none of the main characters actually get anywhere or accomplish anything . In fact , most of the book is about people just sitting around and talking , their is a chapter were a character is sitting in a room talking and only 1 sentence said in the course of 15 pages is relevant and actually forwards the plot any at all . At times I would start a chapter and wonder if I should just skim it because I wondered if it would be relevant or another character simply walking around and talking about his or her day . Their is also very little action in this book , maybe 1 fight that lasts half a chapter , which also hurts this book tremendously as the previous once were a non stop thrill ride.I wanted to like this book , I truly did . The fact that nothing happens and that I do n't feel like I have enriched myself or the story ANY makes me realize what a tremendous waste of time it was to read this book . I pray that his last 2 books liven up the story , I would hate to have this book end on such a horrendous note .	-1
I 'm not investing anymore time or money in this series . 5 years between books and the author coughs up this Hairball . George needs to get over himself .	-1
I wish I could say it took me two weeks to finish this book because I was savoring it . After all I had been so excited that I pre-ordered this book the first day I could . Heck , I almost ordered it via the UK Amazon just so I could get it sooner , but after the bad taste `` A Feast ... '' left in my mouth I was n't quite willing to shell out the big bucks that would have required.I was giddy with anticipation , and having been reminded how good the series is by HBO , I felt like a kid at Christmas when the UPS man dropped off my copy of `` A Dance ... '' Two weeks and a thousand pages later , George RR Martin has lost me as a reader . Never mind the five years , the nine other books he published or edited between `` A Feast ... '' and `` A Dance ... '' , or the slow paced unsatisfying novel that `` A Feast ... '' was . It would have been worth it had this book delivered . I would have gladly gone back to being the GRRM fanboy I was , preaching the wonders that is his Song of Ice and Fire , but no . I can't.Much has already been said about how long the book is . Its long and you feel every page . The words crawl by , the plot and stories advance sluggishly at best , and new characters are introduced to replace characters that have been killed off , brought back , and killed off again . The existing characters , exist only as a backdrop to the history and turtles that GRRM wants to talk about . Only rather than telling those stories , through characters , plot lines , and differing points of view , he reduces characters , such as Tyrion , to disinterested third party narrators.Gone is the suspense , missing is the magic , and lost is the laser like focus of the first three books . It should say a lot that the most interesting plots in `` A Dance ... '' seem almost tacked on , after thoughts to the story GRRM wanted to tell . Though rougher , and less polished than the main storylines in the novel , these `` other '' stories show flashes of brilliance and a return to storytelling that made GRRM great in the first place . Sadly though , these stories are few and separated by hundreds of pages , and dozens of chapters about nothing.More tragically its seems that GRRM has found his `` Wesley Crusher '' , something he had managed to avoid doing ( or at least managed to avoid being eye stabbingly obvious ) about in his prior books . This is perhaps the biggest disappointment for me , authors need to keep themselves and their Mary Sue 's out of their books.One last note and only because I have n't seen it mentioned in the other reviews . GRRM interjected quite a bit of his personal views and politics in both `` A Feast ... '' and `` A Dance ... '' . There is nothing wrong with this as such , most authors do this , without even realizing it . They project their world view upon a fictional world of their own making and its impossible for it not to happen . `` A Dance ... '' very much became a heavy handed and preachy vehicle for his politics .	-1
I hate these books as much as I love them . They go on and on and say nothing An interesting , well loved character to me equals great reading , a character I do n't like means pushing my way through many tedious pages of boredom . Martin is an OK writer but if he was a good writer the books could be half as long and say much more . I do n't understand why people think these books are great as they are simply tedious and at times very boring . Do n't waste your time trying to read this sluggish mess of words	-1
A long wait and so disappointing . The book was wordy and overly descriptive . How much detail do we really need when a person is eating ... I do n't really care about what the people are eating , I want a progressive plot . Unless the food is somehow moving the plot along , I just do n't care . This goes as well for the lengthy deep thinking done by many of the characters , which actually come out as a lot of woe is me . The book could have been cut by 400 words . I found myself drifting off a lot , or skimming quickly through pages to get back to the plot . Some of the characters , such as Davos , were so boring that I almost skipped their chapters . The past books have been so good , this left me numb .	-1
Ok , so I have now read all five of the `` Ice and Fire '' series and can say that I will not be picking up the sixth when/if it ever comes out . The first three books are some of my favorite titles of all time . A Clash of Kings is just all around a great story with great character . And the next was good , but you could tell it was beginning to fall off . And then you get to A Feast for Crows where the whole series falls apart . You read about a bunch of character you do n't care about and wonder `` Where the hell is Jon and Tyrion ! '' Well you finally get them back in this book , but you will be very disappointed with these characters . The book in whole just never catches steam . You read about people walking , and thinking about doing something , and sitting in rooms with each other talking about doing something and then by the end , none of it happens.I know no review will make someone who has read all the books stop them from reading this one I read a ton saying do not read this and look at me ) but i figured I 'd spare you the 15 bucks and tell you you are not missing anything .	-1
I 've always been a huge Agatha Christie fan , but this book is a complete departure from her usual work and I hate to say it , but it falls short . I always finish reading a book if I start it , but there were times when I was really tempted to just put this one down . If you 're looking for classic Christie , this is probably not the book for you . I found the beginning quite good , but ended up plodding through the rest of it .	-1
Ever hear the phrase `` suspension of disbelief '' ? You 'll need a truckload of it for this book . The story is entertaining enough ; I can see why it was made into a movie . But you 'll need to turn off the logical part of your brain as the invincible , superhuman Dirk Pitt achieves one utterly implausible escape after another.Cussler finally lost me when Dirk and his pal , after wandering in the Sahara Desert for days with no food or water , discover a crashed airplane and manage to rebuild it into a `` land yacht . '' They ride it to safety and are restored to perfect health in moments after guzzling some water . Oh , please ... This was my first Clive Cussler novel , and I suspect it will be my last .	-1
Here we have another highly-rated book which I could not finish.As others noted , it begins very strong . But it never progresses nor develops into a story which becomes involving . The characters are uni-dimensional . They generate neither sympathy nor joy and they are stuck in a storytelling style which is framed in the act of `` recounting '' a multi-year adventure where the same things keep happening : The Vikings go ashore in strange places to pillage . They then high-tail it on the sea before they are caught . Sometimes they escape , sometimes they are captured and enslaved . Rinse , repeat.Drama , complications , character development : Nonexistent . Humor : Rare , regardless of what the other reviews promise . Nevertheless , it 's the non-dynamic style which truly kills it.I usually give up on boring books if they do n't become very promising by the 25 % mark . I stuck with this one until I 'd finished 30 % because it was unusual and intermittently interesting at the beginning . But there are too many good books to discover rather than stick with something tediously written , delivering diminishing returns.While thick , it is a very shallow book which might make a good adventure movie for kids or the extremely undemanding .	-1
I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book , so it pains me to be so negative , but her age really does show . The story is n't interesting , the mystery is n't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self . The exception is Ariadne Oliver , who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character . This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery , and she gets an excellent send-off . The same can not be said for Poirot . This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote , though not the final one that was published , since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death . I have n't read it yet because I can not bear to , so I 'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read . I just hope it 's superior to this one ! In this one , Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver 's god children . They were found shot to death in the woods , but what happened ? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa ? Was it a suicide pact ? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon , then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she has n't seen in many years , to ask questions about what was happening in the family , to try and put the pieces together with Poirot , who is busy talking to the police . It 's quite similar toFive Little Pigs ( Also published as Murder In Retrospect ) , another Poirot murder in retrospect . The difference is that you 'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off , as I was . I can now say that about only three of her books ( Peril at End House : A Hercule Poirot Mystery ( Agatha Christie Collection ) andThe Mirror Crack 'd ( Miss Marple Mysteries ) being the other two ) and sadly , it does n't make for a very interesting read . More annoying still is that in this book , a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery , he should find and interview person X , because she might be able to help them with the truth . And so after pages and pages of wasted time , Poirot finds and interviews X , and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY . She is flown to England , she tells her story and then the mystery is solved . So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed ? ! That guy could 've talked to this character himself anytime he liked ! Christie also employs a method I 've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot , the master detective . . . hire a detective ! In lieu of actually writing plot development , she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character . And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever , so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time . Normally I 'd decry this as a lazy author 's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action , but in Christie 's case I 'm charitable enough to substitute the word `` lazy '' with the word `` elderly , '' which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole , I have to admit that I would n't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan . But if you 're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote , then go for it . I am too , so I can sympathize . Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one . It 's just not up to Christie 's usual standards . Luckily , she wrote enough phenomenal , classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published , and all Christie newbies can rest assured : it gets a heck of a lot better than this .	-1
The best part of this book is probably unintentional on Clancy 's part . Jack Ryan succumbs to the seduction of power and turns into a sleazy politician.Throughout the seven Jack Ryan books , Jack has developed into a one dimensional superhero . By this book , his character is as thin and flat as a piece of cardboard . Throughout this book , he is the perfect , honest polictical outsider , single handedly cleaning up the American political system . The whole time he insists he does n't want the job . But , at the end of the book , once Ryan feels the power of kicking the butts of the liberal opposition and of the Iraqis , he changes his mind and says he will stay in office . Ryan turns into the lying , two-faced politician he said he hated.Besides the ending , this is mostly a miserable book . The first 400 pages are boring and repetitive . There some really good parts in the middle where all these intricate subplots get going . But most of these subplots go nowhere or are left dangling . There 's an exciting little war at the end , but it not enough to make up for the 1100 other pages that go nowhere.There are some minor problems with most of Clancy 's other books , but for the most part they are very good , exciting and entertaining . This book is a complete shock . It will be interesting to see if he can recover with the next book in the series , which was just released .	-1
This is the first X-Files novel I have read . I did n't expect deathless prose , but neither did I expect the writing to be quite so poor nor the plot to be so mediocre . This would make for a very average episode were it to be filmed for television . When I read a novel based on a television series , I want to see a story that puts the characters in situations that we ca n't see on the tube , be it for budget considerations , mature story content , or whatever . I have n't read anything alse by Charles Grant , but I understand that he has a reputation as a horror writer of some quality . If so , he must have cranked this one out in a hurry for the paycheck .	-1
It was interesting in a many worded way . The author had too many unconnected threads of plots that eventually wove together but it was a struggle to get to that spot .	-1
I would not recommend Phillipa Gregory 's much-hyped The Other Boleyn Girl . I 'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that does n't make a good first impression , hoping it 'll improve . Some six-hundred pages later , I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good . Please do n't waste your time ! Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as `` He was executed the next day . '' Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader ! It 's extraordinary . It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course , it 's a matter of opinion . I simply found it to be void of anything of substance . I was n't made to care about the characters or how the events played out . And only sex carried the plot along ! Also , I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory 's imagination , not historical facts . I 'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she did n't have a sister or anything of the sort . And I know in this genre much is left to the author 's imagination and interpretation ; it has to be . It 's not as though there 's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history . But Gregory herself , when asked how she researches for her books , said she first goes to secondary sources . She never mentioned using primary sources . Yes , they can be biased ( if they 're from someone 's perspective they 're going to be ) , but they 're first-hand accounts . Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it , witnessing it ? In addition , her dialogue is inconsistent . It 's ridiculously modern at some points , then flowery at others . I know it ca n't be written Shakespeare-style ; it has to be readable and understandable . But I think we could be a little more sophisticated ! No one said `` stuff '' back then , for example , as in , `` All this stuff is making me mad . '' She could n't work a little harder than that ? ? If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses , sex , and scandal , this soap-opera mimic is perfect . If you 're like me and want to learn something in the process , however ... As I 've made obvious , I was sorely disappointed . Just thought I 'd pass my warning along . I do n't want anyone else wasting his time !	-1
I really like the Sean Dillon character , but the books are getting worse and worse . There is no suspense . There is total casualness in every character because they know they wo n't die . They could face the Red Army single handed , any one of them , and come out unscathed . So what is their motivation ? None . What is mine to buy the next book ? None.Also , I am not what one would call a liberal , but the way Ferguson and Blake Johnson run around like judge , jury , and executioner offends even me . If they think you are a mobster or terrorist they kill you , and apparently the PM and President trust them so much that they would never reign them in . I 'd really like it in the next book if Blake Johnson would find dirt on some guy who gave a couple of million to the presidents campaign , and plan to indiscriminately kill him . It would at least show something that I could beleive when then President told him to just cover it up .	-1
Had I not been trapped in a car for hours with nothing better to do I would never have finished this horrid mess of a book . Eventually I decided to enjoy it as camp and parody , as if SNL had done a spoof of spy novels , and that made it a bit more fun . The book proper probably only deserves 2 stars . The characters are charicatures , the plotting vacillates between predictable and inconsistent , and there really is n't anyone to root for in the whole story once we get past the first couple of chapters . The most interesting characters are either killed off or just disappear from the story for no good reason . But this version gets a single star because this has to be one of the worst narrations in the history of recorded books . The breathy , melodramatic reading by Patrick Macnee almost drove me crazy until I decided to shift to parody mode . Then it fit . Maybe Macnee had to go there himself to get through this disaster.I have great admiration for anyone who makes a living writing , and for Mr. Higgins other successful books , but not every word put to paper has to see print . This one should have been left in a drawer somewhere .	-1
The Day of Reckoning is an exemplar of a novel at its worst . Sean Dillon and his all-star cast of superhuman vigilantes hardly inspire , and infact tend to irritate.My advice : This book is worse than the plague , so run away from it .	-1
will read when i get the time to go through all her books one right after the other . heard great reviews from a friend	-1
This novel took a long time for me to finish . I know this may be unfair of me to say , since I 'm not sure if Tan went through a lot of work for this novel , but I think it is just plain boring overall . I do n't know whether it is the raw subject matter about a Chinese woman trying to take care of her mother who is going through dementia , or whether it 's me . Maybe it is the subject matter -- a bit too depressing and I did n't want more things bringing me down in life unless it reveals something noble or lends an insightful slant on the depressing subject ( dementia , care for elderly parents , senior residential living places ) .Tan gives realistic details about growing up Chinese-American , such as the protagonist , Ruth , being the English spokeswoman for her mother , the accents , which , by the way , the author always does a great job in all her books , and the funny ways the daughter deals with the mother ( telling half-truths so that she does n't have to deal with her mother 's wishes or when she wants to do something simple like hire a housekeeper for the mother ) . The author included a subplot that went nowhere , the Dottie and Lance bit when Ruth was growing up . I guess that was just written as a taste of Ruth 's childhood ( ? ) .The part of the book that sort of picks up is whenever we read about the past life of the mother , LuLing , in China . This is a common thread in all the novels that I 've read by Tan . When the story goes back in time , it gets interesting . When it flashes to the present , the story is dull . LuLing 's history as the granddaughter of a bonesetter plays well , as do the parts about Precious Auntie and the tragedy behind her facial disfigurement and the American-run orphanage to which LuLing was left.The element that could have `` saved '' this book in my eyes was the dragon bones hidden by Precious Auntie that may belong to the Peking man 's bones . This thread in the story was just dropped , and nothing memorable came of it . I believe , if memory serves me correctly , the excavation work for these bones and the cave where the Precious Anutie hid the bones ( Monkey 's Jaw ) were destroyed when the Japanese came in and after that no other mention of the bones . If the author wrote something to tie in the bones and how it fits with the story , I think I could have liked this novel more . For instance , Tan could 've written that LuLing or Ruth went back at a later time to search out Monkey 's Jaw and found a remnant of these bones that she has kept to this day . I would pass on this novel and read Tan 's better works like The Kitchen God 's Wife , The Hundred Secret Senses , or The Joy Luck Club .	-1
Maybe this book should have been half as long . By the end of the book , I really had no interest in what Gogol was thinking or doing . The initial descriptions of the Ganguli family 's struggles to adapt to life in the United States was interesting both between generations and genders . I particularly liked the food adaptions . I felt more sympathy for Gogol 's parents and their struggles than for him.For those readers interested in a book for young people about a young girl and her family from India and her cultural adaption to Iowa , I recommend Blue Jasmine by Kashmira Sheth .	-1
The Sky is Falling , the latest of Sidney Sheldon 's books , is one of his worst . Sheldon found his formula for writing a best seller some books ago and ... he 's consistent . Sex , drama , wealth , power ... and the shallowist of characters and most fantastic of motives . Then add some travel , an exotic place or two , and a heroine with enough money and a dearth of brainpower . Bingo ! Another best seller.Do n't fall for it . It 's not a very good book .	-1
The first 75 % of this book was slow reading and boring in most parts . The end of the book finally became interesting . I found too much detailed information in housing construction .	-1
Meandering , amateurish writing with no conflict . Please save yourself the time of reading this unsatisfying book . I kept hoping that all the ideas that were introduced would be developed and paid off , but they never were . as I got later and later in the book , I thought perhaps there was a big surprise ending , but it never arrives ! Lots of interesting storylines are started - is there intelligent life on the new planet ? Will the starship stay and come into conflict with the native population ? Will the legions of sleeping crew awaken ? Will any of the crew abandon their mission , or natives stow away on the ship ? Will either betrayed lover freak and do something ? Will the VOLCANO go off for christ 's sake ? ? ? Nothing happens ! ! ! The book stomps all over Chekhov 's cardinal rule of drama - if you put a shotgun on the wall in the first act , it damn well better go off in the third . There are shotguns everywhere in this book but they remain dusty relics that add nothing but frustration to the experience of the reader.The love story is laughably dry , even though it should be a tension-filled shifting love triangle . You do n't read about any of it happening as it develops . You just get boring , lifeless updates after the fact . I did n't care about any of the characters - none of them have any goals , they are n't developed beyond the most rudimentary descriptors , and you do n't see them make any compelling choices , again we 're just told about their actions after the fact in the most boring , lifeless terms.The discussions of religion are amusing in moments , but on the whole pretty uncontroversial . Although the way it 's written , you can tell Clarke THINKS he 's blowing your mind . Maybe for some people it 's earth-shattering ( ha-ha ) , but again , even if they 're good ideas , there 's no reason to care about the ideas , because there 's nothing at stake , i.e . no story.seriously , there 's no story . for a moment mutiny is threatened , but it goes away after a polite meeting and one slightly interesting but totally perfunctory interrogation . i mean it , that 's IT . the love triangle goes nowhere . one character dies in a tidal wave and even THAT is completely undramatic , and he 's brought back to life in a completely routine way on the next page . yawn ! seriously . do n't read it.instead , if you have n't already , check out Childhood 's End , another Clarke novel , which is completely brilliant . It has good ideas AND a story , complete with conflict , tension and characters you actually care about . it 's still very cerebral , but in a way that works , unlike Songs of Distant Earth.Even the title never pays off in the way you want it to . The starship brings with it all the artwork , literature and music of obliterated earth , and there 's concern over how this influx of information will impact the young civilization . but then you never see any impact . there 's one very mundane concert at the very end with no aftermath , good or bad ! although the setup is there for some fascinating conflicts it just never pays off . kind of like the rest of the book . very disappointing .	-1
I love Paulo Coelho 's books but I must admit this is not one of my favorites . It 's a decent book but it lacks in many ways . The characters , thought process , and even originality.If you like the premise of this book , then I suggest you read `` The man that corrupted Hadleyburg . '' by Mark Twain . It 's much shorter than Coelho 's version and the idea is better developed . You can read it here for free : [ ... ] Or just google it , amazon will more than likely edit this post .	-1
Pages and pages of description of the landscape . Northwards this , downwards that , a tree here a hole there . I was basically losing my mind . I usually think the book is a better deal than the movie , but there is no point to spend so much time imagining so many different scenarios and nothing going on . I just didnt like it.Example : & quot ; The Company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the deeper woods , westwardalong the mountain stream away from Silverlode . Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees , somo of which overhung the stream & quot ; & quot ; The hills now began to shut them in . The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen , but both were now hidden from view . The travelers came into a long valley ; narrow , deeply cloven dark and silent . Trees with old twisted roots hung over cliffs , and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-woods & quot ; And the whole thing is like that.GO WATCH THE MOVIE	-1
I know a lot of people love this story but i learned that its not for everybody.To much description about everything makes it hard to read because everything is slow and nothing much happens in a lot of time , the dialogs are ok .	-1
So you 've just seen the film and you absolutely ca n't wait for the next cinematic installment so you buy the book in the hope of quenching your curiosity . Naive consumer I blame you not . But before you purchase the book consider this . Obviously theres lots and lots of pages to this work so first ask yourself- is this something I 'm really interested in persuing ? Am I ready for this level of commitment in my life ? Secondly theres literally hundreds of charcters in this work which in itself requires a superlative mnemonic feat on part of the reader . Then there 's those numerous prolonged descrpitive passages which do very little to move the story along and are such a tremendous bore . And those maps ? All rather silly and contrived really . Their inclusion in the novel , far from enhancing the story , is quite distracting and only makes the reader self conscious of the fact that they 're reading a work of fiction . Kudos to old Tolky though for writing what is basically a sound storyline even if his ambition ultimately exceeded his ability to realize it . Person who will enevitably click & quot ; not helpful & quot ; button I have but two words for you- Mervyn Peake ( he did the whole fantasy schtick soooo much better ) .	-1
its hard to understand and you have to watch the movie before reading the book and i would recomend this one to maybe above 12	-1
This is the radio version of the the Lord of the Rings trilogy . It is not the unabridged reading of the three books : Fellowship , Two Towers , & amp ; Return . It is a 12 cassette dramatization . I was very disappointed when I realized what I 'd bought as I was looking for an unabridged reading of the three books .	-1
I studied under Iyengar teachers for over a decade including a teacher training and all sorts of workshops with `` senior '' teachers . While they know more than most on details of the physical body and pranayama practices , that is about the extent of a lot of Iyengar teachers knowledge in the west at least . Iyengar admits that he has proficiency in these limbs but not essential things like meditation and samadhi . Why he is writing a book on this subject without these qualifications is beyond me , yet people eat it up because of his popularity.What you get here is semantics and a bunch of confusing text that will not help your practice . Many people think this material is over their head after reading this translation , just because it is so badly written . His lack of subtle knowledge shows profusely when he ca n't even define a simple term like the Antahkarana ( inner organ ) properly . In this case he calls it a `` moral sense '' and that it is all . I 've read many versions of the sutras , most written by people with some degree of actual realization in the subtle realms , and he is the only one that completely gets these topics off . This concept is key for understanding how the mind functions and works in the yogic system and enough to put the book in the closet . To the best of my knowledge this book was ghost written along with the help of some of his students which might explain why it is so bad , and perhaps why he felt the need to write another book on the sutras ... Perhaps he realized a few more things in his old age . I do n't know . I 'd highly recommend Swami Hariharananda Aranya 's translation which is terribly in depth and from someone who has mastered the higher limbs of yoga . There is also `` Science of Soul '' by Shri Yogeshwaranand Parmahans which is not so much a commentary on the sutras , but sheds a lot of light about it 's philosophy in a practical and detailed manner from someone who spent many years in deep samadhi 's in the himalayas .	-1
I like giving good reviews , but I 'm sorry . This book was just too much hype and too simplistic . I had expected more . I think the best way to learn this program is to just dive in and start playing with it . The book was tossed ages ago .	-1
I have just reread this book . Perhaps it was my youth , or relative ignorance of history at that time , but I can not figure out why I was not as befuddled when I first read it as I am now . This book is completely illogical . An author may be forgiven for skewed character portrayals of historical figures ( see The Other Boleyn Girl for more , though that was actually a good novel despite all that horrible caricature of Anne Boleyn . ) But when these portrayals stretch credulity , when they all but fly in the face of history and common sense , and when the main fictional character 's actions cease to make sense because of this , then something has gone horribly wrong and the book needs to be rewritten.Our main character here is a fictional girl named Hannah Green , who has escaped Spain after the burning of her mother by the Spanish Inquisition . The Greens -- their real name is Verde -- are Jews , recently converted to Christianity , yet who still manage to secretly practice some Jewish tradition from time to time . She has a God-given Sight , and can predict the future . Soon she is discovered by Robert Dudley and begged as a holy fool to King Edward and then Queen Mary , whom history remembers as Bloody Mary for her burnings of heretics.Not only does Hannah stay in Mary 's service , but she absolutely ADORES the very queen who brings the Spanish Inquisition to England ! This queen who would probably send Hannah to the stake in a heartbeat if she found she was a Jew is portrayed as a overall nice woman , who only has to sacrifice heretics to the fire once in a while to feed her fragile conscience . I found this appalling . You may portray Mary as a pitiable figure , and I do consent that her life was a hard one , but to say that Mary is a good person with a loving heart who has simply been wronged is completely ridiculous . No one else can take blame for those burnings but Mary and Hannah 's love for her is totally unbelievable and unrealistic . Any self-respecting Jew ( or indeed , any self-respecting person ) would , if not hate her , have no respect for her . As another review said , she inherited the worst traits from both her parents . She has all Katherine of Aragon 's weakness coupled with Henry 's ruthlessness . I could n't understand Hannah 's feelings towards her . They made no sense.This following passage is from page 322 of The Queen 's Fool . It is characteristic of the portrayals in this novel . Will Somers is speaking of the queen 's plan to burn the Bishops Cranmer , Latimer and Ridley , and is concerned that the queen 's place in history will be ruled by this : '' History will remember nothing but that she was the queen who burned bishops ... she will be despised and forgotten and they will remember -- God knows who ! Elizabeth ! Mary Stuart ! -- some wanton girl instead of this true-hearted queen . `` I say , if you 're planning on burning bishops in the first place , you 're not so true-hearted . And all the Elizabeth-bashing ! It was just a little too much for Gregory to portray Elizabeth as a silly , selfish wanton , when she was a much better queen than Mary in all respects . However , my problem is not that I disagree with Gregory 's opinions on Mary and Elizabeth , because that should n't be a factor , but that it makes no sense for Hannah to love Mary and sometimes scorn Elizabeth . This makes not only an unlikable , idiotic character out of Hannah , but a generally unrealistic book with flat characterization . With Gregory , it 's largely hit and miss , and this was a miss . I would recommend anything else by her ( with the exception of The Constant Princess ) to anyone who likes fun , historical fiction , but this one 's joining TCP and The Wise Woman in the `` bad Gregory '' bin .	-1
I should have liked this a lot -- nicely noir , alluringly alternative history , etc . etc . But I made it about halfway through and abandoned the effort . Maybe it was the general bleakness of the whole mise en scene , or maybe it 's just a bad fit for me . My husband , for example , loved it . But after this and `` Final Solution '' , I sha n't feel obliged to try Chabon again soon .	-1
I usually adore Michael Chabon 's work , whether it be a quick read like `` Mysteries of Pittsburg '' or a hearty , slow-burn page-turner like `` The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay '' . Like other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating , I simply could n't get past the first few hundred pages of `` Yiddish Policemen 's '' . Initially , I felt dense , perhaps as if I was missing something crucial Chabon was trying to get across to me the reader . However , what really WAS missing were two of Chabon 's strengths : engaging language and characters the readers actually care about , even if they have a hard time liking them . If you ask the question `` I wonder what happens to this guy at the end of the book ? '' and the answer is `` Who cares ? `` , it 's time to put the book down , and move on to the next tome .	-1
I wanted to like this book , based on the wonderful reviews . I did enjoy the first few chapters , but the story kept getting bogged down and after several attempts to finish the book , I gave up . Another reviewer said that this was not a typical mystery , so maybe that is what I was looking for .	-1
I must really have misunderstood something here . In the first part of the book our hero runs into a bad guy . Although at first fearing a physical attack our hero finds himself in a battle of words with the bad guy . But it goes badly for the hero who simply can not say a thing right . In fact , the more our hero says the worse his position gets.So our hero walks away to think about this . During a moment of spiritual clarity he realises that he has no chance in a rational discussion with his enemy so our hero decides to kill the enemy . I was rather taken back by this and suspected that our hero would at a latter point in the story be punished for taking this course of action.But it never happens . Instead , we latter see the hero vindicated for his actions . I 'm a little surprised by this considering that this book contains so many Christian themes . I 'm not sure I can reconcile Christian ideals with this book 's message of killing people that you have problems talking with.However this is me making a mountain out of a molehill from something that happens early on . The majority of the book continues from the first book in the trilogy and is very dull . There 's little of anything to grab the attention .	-1
With the exception of an interesting theory on the difference between ghosts and spirits , this book was n't very helpful , informative nor interesting . There is a definite commercial slant as all of her `` answers '' are set-ups for her to refer you to her other books , etc . Glad I checked it out from the local library instead of paying for it .	-1
The cover tells it all . You only see the horse 's rump . If the book is called Seabuscuit , put the horse 's FACE on the cover . And no race stats either ! ?	-1
If you 're a writer/painter/musician yourself , how could you help but bridle at the assertion that Vermeer 's greatest successes were due to the suggestions of his cleaning lady ? The ultimate & quot ; I do n't know much about art , but I know what I like & quot ; book . Dully written and offensive in the extreme .	-1
I gave this book 2 stars because of the pictures in the book . If your eyes are 20/20 good for you . You can probably read the book , however if you wear bifocals do n't buy this book . The size of the book is about 3 '' by maybe a bit over 4 1/2 '' . Hazel gives good tips on mixing oolors etc.There are a lot of nice pictures to look at if you can see them . This is not the type of book you can lay out on your work table and refer to , it is way too small and anoying.If the book is published in a normal size work book it would be worth buying , however it is very small and I would not recommend to anyone for purchase .	-1
After waiting for the 3rd book in Dean Koontz 's Frankenstein Trilogy I was very disappointed in how over the top the story was . I love Dean 's books but once in awhile he takes the weirdest just a little too far.You can tell at the end he 's going to continue with this series . I hope the story gets back on track to the page turner the 1st and 2nd books were .	-1
Well here we are , the final part Book 3 is here . Was it worth the wait - NOT REALLY . I went back and re-read the first two in order to do Part 3 justice . I spent the first few chapters of Part 3 with explainations concerning things from the first two books , this would not have been necessary if the trilogy had been completed in a timely manner . Result - Boring . I kept skipping parts - to me a sudden death for a book . Parts seemed familiar to me , I kept thinking I had already read the story , knowing that I could n't have - I have read a lot of Koontz 's books . Whatever his two collaborators on the first two books brought to the story was definitely missed on Part 3 , its reminds me of `` lets get it over with '' and it did not complement Parts 1 & 2 . To me the trilogy is still unfinished and now never will be .	-1
I was carrying Wolf Hall under my arm in a grocery store when a rather nice woman came over to me and said , `` I gave up at page 300 . '' I thought , `` After all the awards this novel has garnered , I wo n't be having a similar experience . '' I was wrong . I quite at around page 270 . Clearly , Ms. Mantel know how to research an exhilarating era . Sadly , she does n't know much about transferring that excitement to the page . And I 'm not alone . I have two other friends , both readaholics , who gave up , and only one who fought to the finish . Her choice of verb was `` slog '' to the finish . I ca n't comprehend how this effort has won all of these awards . Please someone explain . Was it a slow year for literature ?	-1
I could n't wait to get to the end of this book . It was very hard to understand who `` he '' was throughout the book . Cromwell , or someone else ? In Vanity Fair Christpher H. described it as a great read ; I bought it on this advice and was so disappointed , not only reading it but realizing I had also bought it and tried to read it several years earlier .	-1
About 1/3 of the way through this book , I deleted it from my Kindle . I have read many books on the Tudors but this one I simply could n't get through . It was boring , confusing and not even a little entertaining . So disappointing ...	-1
I found it difficult to follow . Did n't like the characters . I had heard such wonderful things about this book and I really was not impressed . I struggled halfway through and then gave up .	-1
After attempting to read this book and others that have been awarded the Booker award , I can just say that this award has absolutely no credibility with me anymore .	-1
Although seen from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell , a villain made a protagonist by authoress Hillary Mantel , we find here the same tedious antics of the Tudor court and city of London in the years between the mid 1520 's and mid 1530 's , when Anne Boleyn attracted the fancy of Henry VIII who was slowly willing to destroy Catholic and noble England to satisfy his misplaced sexual needs and more importantly his misunderstood dynastic needs . It is a novel but accurate enough to be a history , neither of which is currently in short supply . Heaven only knows why the book was written and why it is being read.The best line in the story is by someone who has spent time in Italy . He says that were Queen Katherine of Aragon , Henry 's unsuited wife , in Italy she would long since have lain in her cold grave . The English do things differently from the Italians but the result is the same .	-1
instead of exploring the motivation to move to the remote region and describing the impact of her move on her life and her writing Bird Cloud reads like a disjointed extended whine about cost over runs wandering cows and the frustrations of picking paint colors . It is about as interesting as watching paint dry . Shame o Ms Proulx for her self indulgent rant .	-1
I was unable to read this book . Within the first twenty pages , it had become such a waste of time that I gave up . Boring accounts of clothes upon clothes and not at all well-written . Characters were as dull as the clothes .	-1
not really crazy about the way it was writtenand to think of what was happening it was sadshe most of the time felt very alone	-1
I 've been enjoying Dean Koontz since the 60 's when he , along with Steven King , burst onto the Science Fiction - Fantasy scene . So innovative , such skillful young writers , and so productive under their own names and several pen names were they , that some critics postulated that they were in fact a single pseudonymous wunderkind ! Over the years , we 've learned to recognize their differences , and despite career highs and lows we all have our favorite . Mine has always been Koontz - but with gradually growing reservations.Koontz greatest weakness has been the inability to end a book book with a real , slam-bang climax . We 've become used to completing 400 pages of high speed , high energy story telling with half a dozen tepid paragraphs of : `` but it all got better , and everyone went home '' . `` Breathless '' definitely exhibits that failure , in aces ! Whether alien encounter or divine intervention - and that is not clearly resolved - this story ends with total wet blanket.Over the years , Koontz 's stories have started to include greater and greater intrusions of his own right wing philosophies . From boringly repetitive descriptions of both protagonists and villains military-style arsenals , and GlennBeckian rants on societal decline , he has moved on to government tyranny , weird fundamentalist biblical `` science '' , and conspiracy theory explanations of the most innocuous groups and institutions ( see his fevered `` history '' of that most harmless rural social organization The Grange , in `` The Dead Town '' ) . Again , all of these elements are present in `` Breathless '' , but by now they have ceased to by boring , but easily skipped , asides and have become an essential , unavoidable part of the story . In addition , while Koontz has commonly been noted for strong female characters , active in the story line , in `` Breathless '' the main female character is weak and compliant . There is also a new strain of misogyny which , while usually placed in the mouth , or the mind , of a villain is expressed with a kind of glee that leaves the reader repelled.Despite all of this , I have continued to read Koontz and derive enough pleasure from his inventive story telling , and stylish writing - until `` Breathless '' . This book is summed up in my review title - a tragic mess . All of his faults come to a combinatorial climax , in the service of a totally silly premise , a disordered presentation , and some of the worst writing he has ever published . It is hard to decide whether to liken the writing in this book to a cruel lampoon of Koontz , or to the plagiaristic effort of a sad , teenage fanboy . Take you choice , either way it 's that bad.In `` Breathless '' , one can see Dean Koontz , not as a rival of Steven King , but instead as King-created character , a tragi-comic loser , condemned by his own hubris .	-1
I LOVE Koontz , and absolutely hate giving him a bad review , but this book just is n't worth 5 stars . What happened to the ending ? I agree with the reviewers that said the ending seemed chopped or incomplete . A whole lot of buildup of supense , and then ... ... ... ... .nothing ! !	-1
I have read everthing this author has written . His early works were teriffic , his last efforts have fallen short . Instead of releasing 2 books per year , perhaps one well written novel would be an idea . Breathless , was a such a disappointment . I read this book in a aftrenoon ! The double spacing in the recent books , has not gone unnoticed . I am thinking perhaps Dean should leave the Horror story genre and just write books about dogs . This seems to be were his passion has gone . I will have to seriously consider whether or not to purchase his next book .	-1
`` The Ice Princess '' was just barely entertaining enough to hold my interest . The plot is okay , but the writing is uninspired and amateurish . Maybe it 's just the English translation that seems heavyhanded and sophomoric , almost as if it were written for the YA crowd . More than likely , however , the translator did n't have all that much to work with . Lackberg 's bio indicates she embarked on novels after taking a writing course , and her lack of natural talent is obvious . Perhaps it is n't all that hard to get published in Sweden.On the upside , the peek into everyday Swedish life and culture is interesting if sometimes a little weird -- as in sitting on one 's mittens to avoid getting a UTI from a park bench , even though presumably fully dressed in winter clothing . ( But then , maybe I missed some sort of inside joke with that one . ) Lackberg 's writing and characters are n't in the same class with Larssen and his fascinatingly psychotic hacker , Lisbeth Salander . Savvy American readers are likely to find her stuff a little too juvenile .	-1
This kindle version of One , Two , Buckle My Shoe does not have the last chapter . It could be that the book ends where this version stops , but in fact the book does not end there . If you want the ENTIRE book , this is not the product for you.Also , however this version was created there are wrong word usages sprinkled throughout , so it is n't very well edited.Otherwise , you ca n't go wrong with Agatha Christie !	-1
When my daughter was 8 she and I loved the Goosebumps books . They were appropriately juvenile and fun . `` Fragment '' reads like a 500 page Goosebumps title . Other reviewers have commented on the terrible characterization , high school level writing and awful plot . Like the `` Harry and the Hendersons '' ending , all of which make the book laughable . Or pathetic . Take your pick.I 'll concentrate here on the ridiculous errors in basic science in the book . Now , I know that books of fiction are not to be judged on the same basis as a term paper . But authors have a basic responsibility to get the facts right . So , here we go.Page 74 . `` clots on contact with dangerous endotoxins , like E. coli . WRONG . E. coli is a bacteria . It 's not a toxin.Page 75 . Injecting tap water or distilled water would kill someone . Utter nonsense.Page 77 . `` reddish-green trilobite fossils '' . The color of the rock one finds fossils in has nothing to do with the color of the original creature.Page 135 . The creature has both a cloaca AND an anus ? I do n't think so . A cloca is defined as a common opening for urine , feces and reproductive processes . So you ca n't have both.Page 188 . Earthworm life span is about a year , not a decade.Page 189 . Queen termites do n't live 100 years . Maybe several years.Page 191 . `` Bullfrogs frequently get isolated in ponds ... '' No they do n't . When water levels drop , they just hop away to other ponds.Page 218 . `` The sophistication of the nervous system is just staggering for an animal of this size . '' How could Dr. Cato know this ? They have no instruments that would allow them to make such a judgment . In fact , such a conclusion would require a sophisticated neuroscience laboratory and months , if not years , of study.Page 218 . Jumping spiders do NOT , repeat NOT , have the largest brain to body ratio of any animal . They DO have the largest ratio among spiders.Page 334 . A fatal dose of anethesia does NOT cause a build up of magnesium in the blood.These are only the blunders that were most obvious . They show the author 's contempt for the facts and thus for his readers.I should mention that there is one really terrifying sentence in the book . On the inside back cover we read that the author is `` at work on a sequel to Fragment '' . Please , noooooooooooooooooooo	-1
This is not a good book to read . It just is n't interesting and does n't keep you going on to read more .	-1
Sad to say , I ca n't finish this book . I had a hard enough time getting through his last Odd book , Odd Apocalypse . I started this one with high hopes , but when I began to skimm pages just to get to a place where SOMETHING was happening , I knew the end was near . I think Mr. Koontz needs to put this character away and go back to the way he wrote before this series started . I will say that I loved Odd Thomas in the first four books , but the last two - well , I think I 've covered that .	-1

Have read many of her books and was very disappointed in this book only finished it as I wanted to see the ending but it reminded me of a mills and boons book	-1
I 'm sure Louie is an amazing man , and I commend him for his accomplishments . I found this book immature and almost like watching one of those tv shows that give you narrated little snippets with & # 34 ; amusing & # 34 ; tag lines and over the top music and laugh tracks .	-1
While the story of this man 's ordeal is heartbreaking , the book itself is just boring . Way too much time spent on useless details about airplane minutiae and similar items .	-1
Extraordinarily disappointing book . I did n't realize it was a commercial for Billy Graham until I was about two-thirds through the book . I certainly would n't have bought it or read it had I known it was a touchy-feely Christian tract . Parts were interesting , but only because I was stationed in Japan during the Korean war . I would n't waste my time on this one ... .I did n't finish the book . If Louie turns out to be a flaming atheist , someone please tell me .	-1
This is a story for the ages . Of hard work , hope , faith in the face of evil and the indominitability of the human spirit . Yet Hillenbrand lards it with pointless detail , zigs across time in confusing fashion and makes it hard follow . Were I not reading this book to connect with a troubled employee who enjoyed it , I 'd have bailed .	-1
Gad ! Slogging through so many disagreeable people in the first 50 pages was a chore . I tried , really tried to find why so many gave this good reviews . How could one small town have so many annoying , slightly insane people ? The author has five chidren . Did she experience any of the dreadful constantly screaming chidren and how is it that none of the mothers in the book able to cope with any of them . There is no threat to Nesbo and/or Mankell with this tedious style overloaded with subplots and moronic characters .	-1
So , I had seen this at the local bookstore and decided to purchase this on my kindle . For me , this book ended up being a waste . What we have here is a 14 year old prince that narrates what 's going on as if he 's a man of 25 , and to be honest it just does n't feel believable . Something about the way it 's written , not sure exactly what but I could n't get into it . Mostly it 's just that we are supposed to believe all this stuff the prince does at the age of 14 , and I also was n't a fan of the transitions to `` four years ago '' . These time period shifts were jarring and most of the times took me out of the story . I would not recommend this book , but that 's just my opinion	-1
What a steaming pile of dog doo this turned out to be . It was tolerable until it got near the end . I still do n't get why they dispatched the ex-street hood , to tie up the `` loose ends '' of the female protagonist . Let 's see , she was a crime desk reporter for years , and they think the only people who will notice she is gone are her boss , and the people she was writing her last story about . Oh , and torching her apartment is supposed to erase her . Just seems like that would have the police looking for her . What was up with that ? I 'm still shaking my head at that bit of idiocy . And then they were supposedly killing the last people she spoke with on the phone . BUT they leave out the professor , she had contacted by phone , who knows the most about these `` monks . '' AND she had just been with this professor minutes before they find her abandoned phone . GIVE . ME . A . BREAK . I do n't see the comparison with this and the Da Vinci Code . At least Dan Brown had the courtesy to rip off a book that had extensive research . I sincerely doubt the author did any research on Turkey . Or if he did , it was the turkey that is served at dinner . Unfortunately , this came off more like burnt toast . And to think this is a trilogy and there will be two more installments . Although , there were enough gaping holes to fill two books , I doubt they will be remedied in the future books . About the only good thing I can say about this book , is I caught it when it was free . Count me out on the next two , as I do n't care to waste any more time on this hot mess .	-1
How this pile of steaming drek got to be an `` International Best Seller '' is the real mystery here . It was arduous work just trying to overlook the incongruity of a story set in `` ancient '' Turkey where all the characters spoke perfect English and used American idioms.Especially off-putting was the flitting back and forth between locations , which challenged the reader to remember just who the hell he was being talked about in each new chapter . Characters came and left in the space of a few sentences . Descriptions did n't lend to the imagery one was supposed to imagine because they were trying to be too cute . A great discontinuity existed between the `` hi tech '' lighting system and the torches monks carried to light their way in various tunnels . Never mind the ventilation needed to keep from asphyxiating themselves.I could go on , but why bother ? I struggled to finish it -- I wanted to see if it got better towards the end . It did n't .	-1
I do n't know about the rest of the readers but I had another answer for the question posed in the final chapter ( i.e. , can a book about a boy never having the girl be enough for a good novel , in this case no ) .The errors in Northwest geography ( e.g . where Whitman is , the relationship of Portland to the coast , the difference between clams and oysters ) were not offset by the author 's ill-disguised rants about Lithium treatment ( Disclaimer : I worked with the physican that introduced Li treatment of Manic-Depressive Illnesses to North America ) . Does this guy have a thing with chemical control of mood or what ? Anyway , I thought the characters were shallow and the book only got off the ground when it was putting the boots to deconstructionism ( what did they think would come out of letting a lot of bright but uninsructed young people educate themselves but a bunch of adolescent nihlism ) .Otherwise temptingly well written but like Stephen King & John Cheever 's books not much substance.djc	-1
This book was awful . You keep reading and it goes nowhere . His other book Middlesex was great . Skip this one . Tries too hard and does n't deliver .	-1
i kept reading this book even when i knew i just was n't getting into it - i hate to put a book down and not finish it - i always think there is something i 'm missing - the best part is the next chapter - but i could n't find it in the marriage plot . though i very much liked mitchell 's character , i could n't warm to the others and by the end i was just skimming through it . i 'm not saying it was a bad book , or badly written . just did n't gel with me .	-1
This book was sadly a serious let down . I really expected a lot more based on the reviews I read . In addition to the reviews , this author won a Pulitzer , which contributed to my high expectation . I do n't enjoy giving bad reviews , so I wo n't come down too hard on this book , but I must admit I actually fell to sleep twice while trying to read this book ! And trust me , this never happens ! ! ! The boring cover art is a good representation of what you are going to be reading . In my personal opinion , none of the characters in the book are remotely likable . They are all really pathetic . Madeline is a sorry , sappy needy young woman . Mitchell is a lovelorn man who does n't get the woman of his dreams and he spends the entire book wishing that he and Madeline would somehow be together . Leonard , clinically , manically depressed Leonard . That description sums up his character . All in all , the characters are full of teenage angst . Too much of it . There is no light at the end of the tunnel for any of them . Leonard is the only one who even has a `` pass '' on how sad his character is and that 's only because he is genuinely sick . In my personal opinion , there is no real character growth for any of these unfortunate characters . How the characters are in the beginning is how they are at the end of the book ...

I read the first book , Divergent , and thought it was entertaining and interesting . But the second one became very tiresome and tedious very quicky . I got so tired of hearing the main character lament this and lament that . I just wanted to shout at her , `` GET OVER YOURSELF ! '' She always goes against what everyone else is doing , and LO AND BEHOLD she is always right . This theme repeats itself over and over and over and over ... ( just like I am repeating myself over and over and over and over ... . Can you see why this book gets tedious ? ? ? ) I wo n't even look for the third book . Unless I need some kindling for my fireplace.Save you youself some time and avoid this book . And there really is n't a cliff hanger . It just ends .	-1
Oh , Insurgent . How you 've disappointed me . While I did n't much care for Dauntless in the first book , I did like how it examined the idea of a society divided into factions based on a person 's nature . It was an intriguing concept and it really allowed for a lot of room for Roth to explore and make some insightful commentary on human nature . Which she did do . Four 's stance on the Dauntless made me want to cheer . He was clearly someone who got it , and the ending of Divergent made me eager to find out what would happen when the insight spread . Alas , it did not spread . Spoilers to follow.First off , I just want to rant about Dauntless . Though I thought all of the factions in this book exhibited very questionable judgement , Dauntless fails on all counts . I can buy that some of them were loyal to Eric and thought the Erudite plan was nifty . Fine . But , people , they used mind control on you ! I simply can not buy the idea that more of the Dauntless would n't have defected , especially since it seems to me that this kind of control should be contrary to their very nature . Yet , no matter what happens to them throughout the course of Insurgent , the Dauntless insist on being impractical to the point of lacking a sense of self-preservation . This really drove me straight up the wall . They came across as exactly what Four/Tobias more or less said they were : a bunch of adrenaline junkies who ca n't manage to squeeze two brain cells together in order to have a rational thought . And Tris is really no exception.As for Tris , I really liked her and really sympathized with her in Divergent . I could understand wanting to break free of a constrictive role , wanting to embrace a more exciting way of life . In this book , she simply seems to have a death wish . For all the Tris is supposed to be Divergent , she is blindly Dauntless for the vast majority of this book . She never really stops to question her actions and decide if the choices she 's making are really good ones . What 's more , she keeps things from Tobias and then gets angry when he has a problem with it . I get that you 're afraid he 'll judge you and cast you aside , I get that you 're angry that he 's keeping things from you , but how can you expect him to be up front when you refuse to be honest ? I 'm not excusing Tobias 's actions , because I really thought he treated Tris like an infant for a good portion of the book , but it 's like she expected him to adhere to a higher standard than she adhered to herself . That 's not cool . Why , then , is she surprised when he wo n't really listen to what she has to say , and when he questions her judgement ? The whole nature of their relationship in this book was annoying to me . What do these two people like about one another ? The attraction was clear and made sense in Divergent , here it does n't . It almost feels like they 're together because that 's where they plot left them , not because they really want to be together . This is not an equitable relationship : neither party is honest with the other and they both adamantly refuse to talk through their problems . As much as I liked Tobias in Divergent , I did n't much like him here , though I was more sympathetic to him than I was to Tris . By the end of the book , Tris just seemed like a self-destructing idiot.I also really disliked the characterizations of the other factions . Amity 's passivity is totally inexplicable , as is Candor 's . We 're talking about a situation where two factions teamed up and slaughtered all but a handful of people from another faction and Candor and Amity do n't see any reason to be concerned ? I get that Roth was maybe making a statement about human nature here and , while I do get people tend to sink into denial rather than face danger , people also have a sense of self-preservation that is remarkably lacking here . The other thing I could not get past was the question of what good is Candor ? The other factions all had a purpose , but Candor seemed completely superfluous , which ruined me belief in the world Roth has created.Lastly , I was extremely uncomfortable with the treatment of the factionless , and I hope this is something that 's going to be further developed in the last book . It made me shake my head to think that the factions could n't grasp the fact that the people they exploited and condemned to a life of mere subsistence might choose to rise up against them . Gee , how unexpected ! All in all , this book felt like so much filler . I had the sense that I was on a world tour of the Divergent/Insurgent universe , and that did n't do the book any favors . Tris and Tobias bounce from one place to another with no real purpose , and it is n't until the end of the book that a key plot point is revealed . I do want to finish the series because of that plot point , but it was too late in Insurgent for it to save the book for me . Honestly , I suspect that , when all is said and done , Insurgent could be cut out completely and the real meat of the story could be told solely in Divergent and the third book .	-1
After reading the first book of the series I was stoked to read Insurgent . Needless to say , this book was frustrating to read . I spent half the book pissed off at the main character , causing me to take forever to finish this book . It ended well and it makes me curious to read the third installment of the series . But I 'm skeptical..	-1
I have to agree with many other reviewers that the final , 3rd book of the series is a great disappointment . I think Roth was finished with the second book but pushed by the money mongers to write a third . The voices of Tris and Tobias are indistiguishable . The ending disappointing to be kind . Here 's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again .	-1
This is what you get . Unfortunately this series of novels took the worst of both and came up with this teenage drivel . I 'm the type of reader that once I pick up a book , I read it to the conclusion no matter how awful . I kept hoping the main characters would be killed off so the pain would end , but no , it continued to the bitter end . Curse my bad habit .	-1
The first book had something new in introducing factions while the last one will have ( hopefully ) some climax and twist while this one is almost a senseless wandering.The author has some fascination for & # 34 ; eavesdropping & # 34 ; - used at least three times for the smart Tris to learn things of importance . At another instance , she is guided in her dream . Such highly juvenile tricks turn worse when the author tries to use or fight against technology : if it was hard disk in the first book , it is death serums and simulations that fail in the most idiotic ways possible . The way the leads escape tricky situations would not have worked even in the movies of the fifties.The worst part is that the much awaited big twist never appears and remains reserved for the next book .	-1
I loved Divergent , but absolutely hated this book . How much torture , battering , and damage can a persons body take and never give up . Every few pages there was some new drug being shot into Tris neck and she was being battered in some way.No real story , just a lot of torture and thinking up new ways to inflict more . And the most lame ending after wbat bappened I have ever hear . I hate a book where you feel like it is all being thought up only as it goes along and when they feel that it has gone on long enough the wind it up and a nice little bow on the last two pages . Even though it got tied up , it was a stupid ending thst was really no ending at all . I will not make the mistake of thinking that the next book will be any good either . I will not buy another one of her bookd .	-1
When I first discovered Divergent in summer 2013 , I absolutely devoured it in under 24 hours . Thanks to Kindle magic , I grabbed Insurgent minutes later , likewise consuming it in two marathon reading sessions . I was hooked , and pre-ordered Allegiant on the spot . Several months later on release day , I downloaded Allegiant not long past midnight . It put me to sleep . Every time I 'd start to read it , I just could n't get into it . I was baffled that an author whose work I could n't put down I had become so meh about.And then it occurred to me -- I was continually going back and forth to the chapter beginning to see who 's POV I was reading again . Tris and Tobais are essentially characterized the same , and moreover , Tobias in Allegiant is nothing whatsoever like Four . The characters are just ... flat.Add to that staid prose and a dull plot that employs Insane Troll Logic . It leaves you with a book where you ca n't really empathize with the cardboard characters , and a plot that leaves you saying , & # 34 ; Yeah , whatever. & # 34 ; I can forgive crappy plots when I am engaged emotionally with the characters . Sadly , I was not.I 've seen a lot of other reviewers complain about the ending . I feel that was actually the strongest writing of the book . The middle just felt like a lot of filler to get to that end point . I suspect even Roth was bored for most of the book . It was when she let go of the convention of Chapter 1 Tris , Chapter 2 Tobias , Chapter 3 Tris ... and just let the narrative flow from a single viewpoint for a while , that the prose was more compelling . It begs the question , is this a story that Roth WANTED to tell , or was it a novel Roth 's publisher PUSHED her to tell because Trilogy=Box Office Capital ? God forbid somebody in Hollywood tries to turn Allegiant into Parts 1 and 2 because there 's barely enough compelling content there for a single story .	-1
I found the POV too hard to follow in this book . They were written in the same voice , so I found myself flipping back to remember who I was supposed to be listening to . The end ... where to begin ? I 've never closed a book and thought , `` no , that is n't how it ended . '' If a Gladiator type ending was wanted , it just was n't written with enough poignancy or feeling . But I also think someone has to go through these type of things ( i.e . complicated sacrifice and loss ) to be able to effectively communicate them . It would be interesting to see how Ms. Roth would write the end as she gets older ( and has children - understanding the true goal of a parents sacrifices for their children a bit more ) . But that 's not really something she can control right now . It just is n't something I liked , agreed with or felt satisfied in reading . Sorry .	-1
If you 've read the first two books and loved them , be satisfied with that . Do n't pick this one up.The book started out okay , but I was immediately thrown off by the change in viewpoint . In this book each chapter switches between the two main characters . I 've read books written like this before and they were great . Unfortunately , with Allegiant , I often had to flip back a few pages to remember which character is telling the story . It was hard to follow . By the time I was a few chapters into the book , it started to drag . I read each of the first two books in 2 days . When I got into the third book , I kept setting it down . It just did n't hold my attention.The worst part was the end . I wo n't spoil the ending for you by telling more . I 'm sure the right internet search would tell you . I 'll just say it was a horrible ending .	-1
Such a disappointing end to the otherwise excellent trilogy . I wish I had n't read this book . I would have been better off using my imagination to decide how it all ended . I wo n't be buying the Four series now as a result of this book . I 'm done giving money for something so ridiculous .	-1
Worst end to a trilogy -- EVER . Divergent was pretty good ; Insurgent was OK ; Allegiant was terrible . Not just the ending ( I guess everyone knows that Tris dies ) , but because the story made absolutely no sense . I read a ton of fantasy books . I know you have to suspend belief to immerse yourself in the 'world ' the author creates . But the storyline still has make some sense . There are lengthy reviews already written in detail about this book , so I wo n't go through it all again . Really really do n't understand the hype around this series . I thought it was one of the worst of the bunch out there . The Legend series is much much better -- well written and interesting .	-1
Ok. Just to start off , I am a HUGE Veronica Roth fan . My friend and I have tried relentlessly to get our other friends to read Divergent . Reading this book , I REALLY wish that I did n't even START reading the series , but , boredom in Taos when your family is on a ski trip miles away from your friends who have `` other plans '' ca n't be helped.So , I have been amazingly excited for this book.The plot ( at the beginning ) was the same sort of thing as the other books in the series . The `` perfect '' faction system is being disrupted by something/one , and it needs to be fixed . In the first book , it was Jeanine Matthews who was the criminal . In the second , it was the huge number of Dauntless traitors and the Erudite . In this one , well , I 'm not saying anything.I was fascinated with the idea of telling some of the story from Tobias 's point of view at the beginning , but when I got to the end of the book , I can see why it was necessary . Another thing that I was intrigued by was Tris 's mother 's backstory . I thought that it was well- written , and it had some things in it that I did n't even expect . I mean , yeah , just before it was revealed , I saw it coming , but it answered questions that I do n't think that ANYONE would think of asking.The main attraction for me , as a 14 year-old girl , was the love story . My best friend in the entire universe ( a.k.a the girl who introduced me to this series ) would just call me crazy . She really does n't like love stories . Anyway , the love story was really good in this book , but it does get a little bit mature at one point . There was n't much detail put in it ( thank goodness ) , but , I definitely would not recommend that children 11 and younger should read that scene . There was also a LOT more kissing in this book than in the others ( *giggling because I am NOT telling my best friend about that , and I 'm going to be evil and make her find out on her own* ) , which I was glad about , considering the end of the book.And now , for the last ( and definitely most least that you can get ) point I 'm going to make . *clears throat and drinks some water* All right , here goes : WHY THE HECK DID YOU DO THAT , VERONICA ROTH ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! OHMYGOD , WHY DID I WAIT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME JUST TO HAVE A HUGE FREAKING DISAPPOINTMENT ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I GET THAT YOU DID N'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR BOOK END LIKE EVERY OTHER YA ROMANCE OUT THERE , BUT STILL , WHY COULD N'T YOU END IT WITH A BREAKUP ? ? ? ? DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS DIE ? ? ? DID YOU HAVE TO ? ? ? BECAUSE I DO N'T SEE THE FREAKING POINT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Meltdown complete.The ONLY reason that I gave this book a 2 star rating was because the love story was interesting .	-1
This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read . The first two books in the series were n't lighting the world on fire as far as plot , or sense , but this book makes the first two look like well thought out tomes of glory.I had to skip 3/4 of the book . The middle was so much drudgery . I ca n't even express the overwhelming desire I had to put it down . I have never been one to read the last few chapters of a book just to get through it , but I had to do that with this story.Then I got to the ending and was glad I skipped most of the book . This book is truly a waste of time . Seriously . Even if you enjoyed the first two and were willing to suspend disbelief enough to admit that you found them entertaining , this book was not worth picking up . Just finish the plot line in your head using your imagination . I guarantee you will have a much better ending than what Roth presented here.I read the books because I saw the previews for the upcoming movie and it looked like something I would be interested in . Well , I hope Hollywood changes the ending drastically or the movies will be stinkers too . I do n't think I want to watch them if they stay true to the books.I ca n't believe I just wasted hours of my life on this series . What a dud .	-1
I do n't even know where to start . The ending to this series is so ridiculously unrealistic . So many things do not make sense , there are major holes in the plot and even the characters were unlikeable . I understand that this is a YA book , but I honestly ca n't get behind how these teenagers can outsmart the adults unless they are in cohorts with Scooby Do.I was bugged by the unnecessary `` kissing '' scenes that I do not want my daughter reading . Why ca n't these YA authors put in light kissing without putting hands in people 's clothing and insinuate heavy petting ! Major bug when it comes to these YA books that I have to tell my daughter she ca n't read . Still debating if ill let her read this one . ( Btw-she is all but 12 ) I loved the first 2 books in this series and ca n't say how disappointed I am by this one . Bah ! !	-1
I feel like many others do about this ending book of the series . I did n't like it at all . The first two books were great , deserving of 5 stars , but this was a huge disappointment.I did n't like the switching of narrative from Four to Tris ! It was very difficult to get into the characters switch and I found myself confused several times and had to re-read many pages . I have never seen this type of narrative switch and if I find that it is in any book , I will definitely pass on the book . It has no redeeming value.The narrative was boring most of the time , with a weak story line that did n't fit the first two books . The answer to what was outside the borders of the first two books was , in itself , a disappointing twist . I started to say that it was n't believable , but that is an oxymoron in fantasy fiction . It just did n't seem to suit the story line.The way it ended was extremely disappointing ! ! ! ! To come that far being a champion of Tris to see it ended in that manner made me want to stop reading immediately . I kept on , thinking that Roth would come up with some twist that would negate this egregious turn of the plot . That left EVERYTHING in seeming limbo with absolutely no good feelings about how the book ends.A very big disappointment overall .	-1
There a better YA dystopia books out there with better main characters and a less lazy writer . A little slower paced than the second book , but everything else just was worse . Honestly , I would n't have bothered to finish the series if I had n't already bought it for cheap in a flash sale with the first book .	-1
What a bummer ending . Slow and boring . There was no creative element to the writing . Just bland dialog and basic descriptions .	-1
Ruined the entire series for me . All the character development from the first two books was ignored as if it had never happened . The pace was excruciating . & # 34 ; Death serum & # 34 ; is a nonsensical concept . Why create a serum that convinces the brain to shut down , when poison effectively does the same thing , reliably , no matter your genetic status ? The ending was repellent because it was unnecessary . If the event had not happened , the overall plot would have concluded in the same way , only somewhat more satisfying . WHY ? ? ?	-1
Wanted my happily ever after but I got a rushed ending instead . It 's like the author was tired of the story ( you can tell by the rushed ending and repetitious story line ) and decided to kill off any hope if another book . Still was an ok read , just hope Hollywood does better	-1
It 's a rarity , I know , nearly impossible even . But there was a mistake at the printers with my copy of this book . You see some pages from a completely different story , got accidentaly inserted randomly into Allegiant . So the story I read was incomplete , with some stuff that was n't even part of the story . It was a printing issue . Very uncommon . Oh , wait , I read an ebook . Well then it 's digital . Anything can happen in the digital world . Really , it happened . It 's the only explanation .	-1
This was the worst planned out series I have ever read . While I loved Divergent with it 's rich characters and interesting plot , its apparent there was no foresight into the entire series until the end . I realize this is a young adult series , but really ? ? I ca n't believe a publisher would actually print this ... other than to keep the money machine going.Spoilers : First of all , the idea that they are living in Chicago and have no idea what lies so close to them outside the fence should be explained . Its so ridiculous that with a faction that values facts and knowledge , no one would never attempt to go outside the fence ... and just miles past the fence is a whole city/compound that flies planes for goodness sake . Even in fiction , this is ludicrous and draws the reader ( at least me ) so far out of the story I ca n't buy into any of it . A well thought out plot would have weaved these answers in from the beginning.The POV writing style DOES NOT WORK if both characters have the exact same voice , attitude , style . And who are these characters ? Tobias and Tris are written so completely differently than the last books it was like reading a whole new series . I hated them in Allegiant , but only because I was already bought into the original characters the author sold me on in the last 2 books.Furthermore , the plot also slowed down with little to no suspense once they were 'outside the fence ' . Instead you get chapters of information dump so the author can try to fill in gaps and throw this plot together . YAWN ! I had to put the book down 2/3 of the way through because I just could n't take it anymore . I heard the ending was no better than the beginning as all the bad guys win and the good guys for some reason get killed off . What a shame~ No wonder so many authors try to self publish when this is what the big publishing companies spend their money on .	-1
This author seems to be he 'll bent for destruction and misery . The few `` good '' moments are even clouded in fear or death . She writes well but way to dark and depressing . If your looking for a book with mostly violence , destruction , and misery this is your book .	-1
I debated how many stars to give this but decided that I felt strongly enough to give it just one . It 's not because of the ending . I had read about one-third of the way through when I decided to stop and put the book away . Part of it was reading the two alternating perspectives got a little confusing . Tris and Four never really had different voices so I sometimes had to check to see whose point of view I was reading . I decided to finish the book because I LOVED the first two so much . I now wish I had n't wasted my time . Once it 's read , it can never be unread ! I wondered as I read Allegiant if an editor ever came to Roth and said , `` You know , maybe you should think about going in a different direction . '' If that had happened , she should 've listened . But it 's apparent that for reasons I 'll never understand , she decided to write this mess . The dialog is stilted , Roth is n't good writing from different perspectives other than Tris ' , the characters never really developed and it seems like Roth did n't know what to do with some of the supporting characters so she either kills them off or they just sort of faded away and became irrelevant.And what happened to Four between the time she wrote Insurgent and Allegiant ? ? ? Did she suddenly start to hate him ? I never liked that his daddy and mommy issues were n't resolved during the first two books but they really make a difference in his thinking in Allegiant . Four used to be badass but in Allegiant , he became this whiney , angst filled , insecure boy/man whose parents did n't hug him enough . Sadly , his character devolved over time.I love Tris . I 'll always love Tris . I think Roth knows her best so if this is what she wanted to do to her beloved character , then it 's her choice . But I think Tris ' relationship with Four , despite the fact that she thinks she 's in love with him , just seemed too contrived and maybe Roth could n't write it any other way . The whole plot , the relationships that had been built over the first two books , just collapsed in this one.And frankly , with that ending , Roth pretty much guaranteed that I will never read this series again .	-1
I loved the first 2 books . I could n't put them down . I could barely get through this one . The story was repetitive and boring . I do n't know why Roth decided to take the book the way she did . All I can think is that the up coming movies swayed her decisions.My advice would be to read the first 2 and make up your own ending . This one will only disappoint you .	-1
Tris ' world has crumbled for various reasons . Now she has the opportunity to go outside the city 's boundaries to discover what 's beyond . However , what Tris and her friends discover may be something that is totally unexpected.My straightforward opinion of the final book was that it was the worst in the series . This series seemed to go downhill as the story went on . I only read this book because I really wanted to know how the trilogy ends . First of all I did not like the alternating point of views . Sometimes it makes the story better and sometimes it makes it more confusing . In this case it made the story more confusing . Second , I did not like Tobias in this book at all . He is a totally different person . In the first and second book there is great character development and then in the final book he is really different . Third , Tris and Tobias ' relationship seems to be one of the main problems in the book . They do n't seem to trust each other about anything and most of the time they are arguing . Lastly , it was very depressing . *SPOILER* I was crying while reading the last few chapters that were from Tobias ' POV . I have NEVER read a book in which the author has the main character killed . I mean seriously . The last few chapters were basically about how much Tobias missed Tris and how he was dealing with the situation.So my message to all of you who are reading this review is ... DO NOT READ ALLEGIANT ! You will be greatly disappointed .	-1
I really loved Divergent and Insurgent kept the series going for me . This book started out okay but once they got on the outside it just lost the tone of the series for me . It seems like it focused too much on Tris and Tobias fighting and making up and then rushed through the action , the parts that actual added to the story . Aside from the annoying back and forth between Know-it-all Tris and Stubborn-little-boy Tobias , you had the conflict of the situation in Chicago and then the new GP vs GD conflict . Neither of which really had a satisfying resolution . I mean Tris died to do the memory wipe but David as still in charge after that and what everyone was just magically living together in perfect GP/GD harmony ? I was disappointed that Tris died but I was more disappointed that she did n't die for a good enough reason . If Amar could get Tobias and Christina could get into the city so easily and inoculate certain people against the memory serum why did n't they just do that . And it seems like Nita and Matthew could have figured out long ago to use the memory serum on everyone . Nita had planned to use the death serum , Matthew was against that why would n't he have suggested the memory serum as a compromise . And if David was so suspicious of Tris hanging out with GD people why would he make her part of his council ? She came into the compound with her GD brother , best friend and boyfriend , she lived in the dorm with the same GD people the entire time and in the end her give away was she was spending too much time with GD people ? And then Tobias is able to end the entire conflict with the factionless by appealing to Evelyn 's motherly side . A mother who abandoned him , used him , spent most of her life planning this rebellion and just went okay I will give up ? And all the factionless who had been spit on their whole lives just went okay cool you have your son back let just forgive and forget . And the same thing with Marcus he starts to disagree with the compromise Evelyn sets up and the Joanna is just like no and he backs down . She threatens that she will expose him for refusing peaceful terms but why should that matter ? I mean why did n't everyone reject him when they found out about his abuse and Tobias . It does n't even make sense that Joanna would have accepted him as a leader for the Allegiant in the first place . It felt like it was all forced for the end when Tobias has to `` choose between his parents . '' And then Marcus just disappears . And I did n't really feel clear on the whole experiment . So when there was a large population of Divergent they were supposed to come out and do what exactly ? If they are trying to keep them in a controlled area until future generations are genetically repaired why leave so many GD on the outside , just to discriminate against them . The GP supposedly hated them and punished them to harshly while the GP got away with stuff . But when Tobias tried to help the rebels get ahold of the death serum they did n't really do anything to him . I did n't care for both perspectives . After the first two books it really messed with the flow of the series . Now I see the whole point was so Tris could be killed but it did n't feel like a natural progression of the series and aside from mentioning each others names it was easy to forget which person you were reading . Tobias 's perspective did n't add to the story it distracted from it . It felt like you were getting half a story from him and half a story from her , but since they were both doing such different things all the time you were never getting the full story . This whole book felt incomplete and forced . The resolutions were n't satisfying nor did they make sense for the series as a whole . The book was called Allegiant and so was the group that wanted factions back but the book did n't really have anything to with that . I would have called it Tangent because she started out telling the Divergent story but then got caught up in this other thing with genetic testing , and it got convoluted like she lost a clear vision for the story . The characters felt like pawns , like Roth had forgotten the passion with which she built these strong characters in the first two books . She was just having them do whatever she wanted whether it was fitting to their character or not . If you are going to kill such a strong character like Tris then the death should feel impactful and meaningful , hers did not . Peter could have died long ago , he did n't need to be in this book . Who cares if he gets to start over and try to be a good person ? So if you want to know what happens to the Chi town gang check it out at your library or borrow it from someone but do n't spend your money . It is n't worth it . I do n't even feel like it was worth the time I spent reading it .	-1
**Warning- spoiler alert**I stayed up until midnight finishing this book and ended up having the worst nights sleep I 've had in a long time . I feel like my best friend has just died . Which in fact she kind of did . I have been reading other reviews and there are two that I keep thinking of ... one that says something like , `` if you devoured the first two books of the trilogy and loved them as I did , stop there ! Do n't read the third one . Just make up your own ending . '' And the other is , `` does the author want to end her career ? '' I can honestly say that I feel pretty certain that I wo n't be following or supporting this author anymore.I think I would 've been able to accept the ending better if Tobias had been killed instead . As Tris is the main character of the book , I came to love and admire her . I identified with her . What will this book say to all the other girls who also identified with her ? Will they feel like they should sacrifice themselves also ? I hope not ! I was barely able to finish the last chapters and epilogue . Who wants to watch the man you loves trying to move on ? And to imagine who he might end up with ? Who will take Tris spot ? It was heart wrenching.Seriously , what a huge disappointment . Tris did deserve better and so did we . I reserved this book months ago , not caring how much I paid . And now I find myself thinking what a waste of money and I 'm so glad I only paid $ 7 .	-1
so disappointed that I had to wait a year for thisthere 's just so many things I did n't like about this book I do n't even know where to begin , first of all this book is told from Tobias and Tris points of view but I honestly did n't feel any difference , the main plot of the book which is that they get out of the city to find out they were just a governmentexperiment hugely disappointed me and kind of made me feel that the first two books were for nothing , and Tris dying was the final drop that made me lost my love for this trilogyI would have preferred the story to end on the second book : (	-1
It 's a shame this book ever made to the assembly line . Such a waste of good paper and storage space if you chose the digital version .	-1
I 'm completely shocked that this was the ending to this series . I loved the first two especially the love between four and tris it was exciting to see how they were so different but still loved one another thru it all . I can not believe tris died and it was just like well that 's it . All the bad people got off for all they done while in my opinion the best character who done as much as she could for the people dies . And a stupid death at that . She was finally happy to live and stopped going on suicide missions for the life and love she wanted . But guess what nope did n't happen all the bad people got the life she help create but she got nothing . I love romance stories but I also love action.. if your going to bring a romance into a book so strongly than do n't disappoint . Just really feel like blah over the ending just horrible ! ! ! !	-1
They tried to take two separate story lines and combine it into one story , and it did not work . Although it explained the reasoning behind the first two books , it still had a poor and weak ending , a poor and aimless story line . I felt the book was only written to fulfill a contract allowing the author to collect a pay check .	-1
1st if you have read the reviews I gave the other 2 books , this will come as no surprise . In my thoughts the second and third books could have been cut down and combined . In the authors attempts to be cutting edge and daring with this book , it fell flat and lets say the last few chapters served no purpose . The fate of the couple through out the books was not served in this final one and the out come was poorly put together . The author in the attempt to make a & # 34 ; super/hero cutting edge root for them couple & # 34 ; made Tris even more useless/whinny and Tobias boardline a waste . I had hopes that the author would bounce this book back into a more reader friendly realm ... . I was wrong ... I just got more and more confused on who was the good guys and who was the bad guys and to be honest I just wanted the book to end and be over . If you want a kick in the seat pants & # 34 ; super/hero cutting edge root for them couple & # 34 ; read The Hunger Games books ... .. I would never read this author again	-1
I was expecting to be regaled with stories of pregnancies and births . Instead Ms Fairley writes about her schooling and her marriage . Yes , to be fair there are some incidents of midwifery , but the few there are leave you wanting more , and the author does not deliver ( pun intended ) .	-1
Finally , the fairly readable , but unrealistic plots from this series is wrapped up once and for all . I got the feeling that Dean Koontz was never really into this series and was happy to wrap it up . I do n't blame him.Victor Immaculate 's desire to end all of life did n't seem realistic and his arrogance made it clear from the beginning that he was going to fail . Even though the readers will know that Dean Koontz wo n't have the bad guy win , there should be some kind of suspense . I would have also liked if there was some kind of plausibility , but I 've given up at that possibility since book 1 .	-1
I love Arya , I love Tyrion , I love Jon , I love Dany . They are my friends and my heroes , I want to know what happens with them and I want to see them have a fate that is unlike all the other main characters that have died so far.Instead of finding out about my friends , I get this steaming pile of paper which is about none of them . This book is misery tourism : a bunch of miserable characters with screwed up minds riding through a ravaged miserable land filled with miserable people . There are no real redeeming features here other than finding out how wretched all the supporting characters from the previous three books were . There is so little plot advancement that this book should never have been written . Just like the movie Signs , this is a perfect example as to why so few successful stories are based around secondary characters who have no real role to play in the events unfolding around them : it 's BORING.I 'm good at sticking with books , but I could n't even bring myself to finish this thing . And after the little research I 've done to see what it is I 'm still missing , I wo n't .	-1
I 'll keep it short ... while you will wade through it , waiting for ANYthing , book 4 pretty much sucked . Did n't stop me from buying book 5 . Even with the apologia at the end of 4 , it was still not a very good book . Book 5 is getting back to speed ... we 'll see ... it 's getting back to the characters I want to know about ( tho , C1 totally baffled me ) . Oh . I 'm a Tyrion fan .	-1
Reading this book was a vast disappointment after book 3 . It seems Martin may have peaked early in this series . I found that I had to force myself to continue reading to finish this book . Not very much action and the continuity is totally absent due to the changing perspectives of unsympathetic characters . Book 4 offers all the excitement of watching a bag of popcorn in the microwave , with the caveat that all the corn has popped in volume 3 . You keep waiting and waiting for something to catch fire , but alas there is not even any smoke .	-1
I have read the three books prior to this one and found them all quite compelling . I love the HBO series and find the books even better , very difficult to put down . The 4th however I have put down so many times I am finding it arduous to read on . Hopefully HBO will continue with the series and just skip over this book entirely.Also , the Kindle version is horrid ! ! ! There are SO many misspellings at times it is difficult to figure out what the word is even supposed to be . They ca n't even spell the author 's name correctly let alone the name of the book ! `` A Fr.Asi i OR CROWS '' is how it 's written at one point . Spell check would be an asset to whoever transcribed this . Buyer beware , just go to the library for this one or borrow it from a friend . DO NOT get the Kindle version . It makes it even more difficult to get through the book.I am looking forward to `` Dancing With Dragons '' and praying Mr. Martin has gone back to his original way of writing . If not it would do well if someone else finished the series .	-1
I was disappointed in this book after another reviewer compared the author to Dan Brown and Steig Larson . The author is not even close to having the skill of either of those writers.This author was heavy handed and crude when it came to the budding romance between the two main characters . ( I use the term romance tongue in cheek . ) The author created a female character , Kate , who was a man 's version of how they would like to see woman behave . Kate was crude and overtly sexual one minute and whinny and simpering , the next . She was more than ready to dump her son and jump the hero despite knowing that an ex-husband with a explosive temper was probably close on her heels and would do anything to retrieve the boy as a matter of pride rather than attachment . The Hero was flawed ... to say the least . He was created with a little too much clich & eacute ; paint . As for the bad guys they were all overdone and way too bad . Please , force a youth to eat a cell phone because you hate his ring tone ... .hmmm.Now what was good , there were few typos in the book itself and the author had a good story that was well written as far as logic of the overall sequence of events . This author has a good grasp of language and is skilled in developing the suspense sequences . I think when the author learns to temper his characters with subtlety he will be a writer worth reading .	-1
I found this book to be very difficult to read , and more about the literature than about the lives of the women involved . The overblown prose and flowery language were difficult to decipher , and I fought to stay awake more than once . I had trouble finishing it , and never reached the point where the effort paid off in lessons learned or insights gained .	-1
I originally selected this book because it was on the bestseller list . However , I quickly learned that every book on the bestseller list is not a good book . Despite a compulsion to give each book that I choose to read a fair chance and to make a serious attempt to complete each one ( even non-fiction books , which I believe are often very dense ) , I found it extremely difficult to work my way through this book . In addition to the author 's repetitiveness , poor and/or irrelevant use of imagery , and under-development of the books `` characters '' , the book seemed to be more of a homage to Nabokov than a memoir of exploring the liberating powers of literature in a hostile environment . Unfortunately , I was able to realize this by page 48 , which is where I stopped reading .	-1
I was expecting details about the authors life in post revolutionary Iran and insight into women 's lives there . This is not a memoir its really more of a very long essay comparing disjointed aspects of life to a few books.It only made me want to find a copy of Lolita . It got very boring and I am sad to say I put it down and did n't want to go near it again.I agree with the other one and two star reviews that the book is short on insight into the personal relationships ( which I craved ) and gets repetitive . I only need to read the same comparison once or twice in the same chapter ! She also keeps repeating that she is n't comparing Humbert with Iran ... but is n't she ? I suspect in our post 9/11 zeal to embrace insight into from Muslim culture this book was placed on a high pedestal it honestly did not deserve . Sad , as I am sure there are other more deserving authors out there .	-1
The `` hen '' looks like a rooster . I think that would be confusing to three or four year old children who have seen animal pictures in other books .	-1
SPOILER ALERT : you tell me i 'm gon na read a story about a drunk american soldier ( who for some reason fights w/ the italian army ) who shoots a guy in the back , knocks up a british nurse , who goes AWOL and ends up losing his preg girl AND the kid - and 99 out of 100 people will say `` no thanks '' . tell them its hemingway , all of a sudden it 's a `` classic '' . EXACTLY what happened to me - this was terrible , and you know what , some times 80 year old works that were great when written just do n't hold up , put this one in that category . pass .	-1
He does a good job of complicating the obvious . I could n't hold my attention span on this book , I mean the way he fluffs out even the simplist of common knowledge . It would of been a good book or guide if Harry could of simplified his explanations instead of taking what could be explained in one paragraph and making it half a chapter to a chapter long . I want my money back .	-1
THis is one of the worst books I have ever read . Not sure if I will ever read any other of her books .	-1
Okay , first off , I think that Ayn Rand is probably the most overrated writer in history . While this may be her best novel , ( Atlas is one of the most boring piece of trash ever , Anthem is just unmoving , and We the Living is the worst thing I 've ever read ) that is n't saying much . Howard Roarke is , like every other Rand character , a poorly characterized superman who is never wrong and has no flaws at all . This is Rand 's biggest flaw in all of her work , her hero 's have no flaws and her antagonists have no good qualities . She tries very hard to make a romance out of this work but fails miserably . None of her characters have the depth required to make a believable romance , it 's like two cardboard cutouts meeting and falling in love for some reason . Perhaps the only good thing about this giantic failure that is somehow considered to be a classic by certain people , is that it stresses the importance of individuality ( a quality many Objectivists lack as they cling to Rand 's image like little leeches ) but other than that there is nothing to this novel . It struggles very hard to be great , you can almost hear it 's little flippers slapping the cement floor of greatness , but it never quite makes it to the pool . It 's boring , overlong with stretches of scenes that have no importance , and there are basically three characters : her supermen , the lovestruck woman , and everyone else . It 's not as important as people want you to believe , go against the grain and do n't read it . Get some Kafka instead .	-1
Shorter Ayn Rand : A combination of greed and cruelty will get you more power , sex and money than either greed or cruelty alone.It 's a crummy novel , too . When I was in college , long ago , the architecture students used to arrange a showing of the movie version once a year , at which they would jeer and hoot and holler not unlike the way a later generation behaved at 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show . '	-1
Such a boring cookbook ! ! I like color and pictures to give a hint as to what to expect from a cookbook . This one has sparse skethings of a shallot or some other food . Although it has good info describing the numerous fruits and veggies out there , it was n't worth the money . And all the recipes I have tried so far have been bland ! Stick with a Betty Crocker for a basic cookbook .	-1
Though interested in MM I did n't realize how deeply I was going to be taken by this book . If I had , I probably would n't have bought it .	-1
This book tried to be politically correct , but fails because the whole premise was seen from Iggie 's perspective . I would have loved to see the point of view from the Garbers ; what were they thinking and feeling , and even if they wanted help or not from the so called `` caring '' neighbors .	-1
California Pizza Kitchen is known as a good restaurant that makes bad pizza . They have essentially removed the pizza flavor from pizza , which makes the product a tasteless dough and cheese platform for toppings . The result can be a nice meal if the toppings are good , but it does not taste even remotely like pizza . It 's extremely misleading and disappointing that they use `` pizza '' in the name . It 's nice that we live in an era where you can find good pizza in most major metropolitan areas these days , so you are not stuck with this stuff when you want real pizza .	-1
If you are looking for traditional tamale recipes DO NOT BUY this book .	-1
For all the time and energy the authors expended on this silly book , you would think it would have been better , and surely there are other subjects out there that are more worthy of an in-depth investigation like this is purported to be . There is no riddle to this story . Simpson 's guilt is obvious . And how does one know this ? The answer is simple , and it 's a little word called DNA . It proved Simpson 's guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt , but for some incomprehensible reason those who stubbornly cling to the ridiculous notion of Simpson 's innocence continue to ignore this fact . DNA and other forensic evidence does n't lie , exaggerate , or embellish . But people can and do .	-1
Way too little information for such thick book ! ( but good info on sewing knitted piece though.. even though it 's only on 2-3 pages of the book . )	-1
I have tried a half dozen recipes from this book so far and I 've liked only one of them ( Sally Lunn ) . The pictures are beautiful , the spiral binding is great but the recipes I 've tried are mediocre . Maybe it 's just me or my machine ( Breadman ) , but recipes from my other cookbooks tend to taste better .	-1
I bought this book years ago and finally got around to reading it about six months ago . Even with as little as I knew about the Catholic faith , I knew something was off . Finally I saw so many contradictions between what I was learning from it and what I was learning from real Catholic sources that I tired of it and the simplistic way it talked down to the reader and put it down . It now holds up a wobbly end of a table , that 's how little I think of it . I 'm just glad to find some practical use of it.Do yourself a Big favor and get Catholicism for Dummies by Father John Trigilio and Father Kenneth Brighenti instead of this , it was extremely well written and very , very useful , I 'm way ahead of the game in my RCIA classes now .	-1
I think that one problem with this book is that it forces outcomes on people and reduces choice . For instance , the entire discussion of drinking . Yes , there are some people who will need to never drink again , because they are `` true alcoholics '' . But for a majority of problem drinkers , total abstinence is not required ( unlike hard drugs or smoking , where no real reason to continue , for example , based on health could be made , with drinking alcohol , especially red wine , real health benefits can be seen , and people in my view should have the option of having a beer or two or wine or two in a social setting , rather than being forced into lifelong , total abstinence from a drink that can save you from a heart attack ) .She thus forces this outcome of total abstinence on everyone . I dislike this because it reduces choice . For instance , if you go to a hynotherapist in Britain , Canada , or Europe or Australia , moderation will be one potential outcome that you are given . The author falls into the trap typical of U.S. therapists , of thinking that only 12-step programs can work for people with alcohol problems . Whereas , even in the U.S. , this view is being rejected . I think that the book is ok , but I would like to see this dogma removed in future .	-1
Ideological certitude and its bastard cousin `` the true believer '' have taken this country to places it should not have gone in the last decade . We have fallen far from the Greek ethos of `` white pebble , black pebble '' on true democratic principles . When western democracies are goaded , bullied , beguiled and cajoled into wars that are still reverberating to this day , we are allowing elected officials the decisions of kings.Until we can vote on consensual bloodletting there is no liberal democracy . We have not come very far in the last 1000 years at all.This book and its central tenet are fraudulent .	-1
Perhaps the author contributes to the view that the economists are not serious scientists . For example , he mentions that unemployment is good for the society . I 'm sure that the people who were unemployed in the midst of the Great Depression would tell you otherwise , and many millions who are currently unemployed now . The only point that I could possibly agree on was that recycling paper might reduce demand for trees and we may have less trees planted as a result . Other than that , I could n't find much economic insight in this book . The author seems to be more frustrated by the fact that economics is not a science on par with physics and chemistry , but that 's the nature of economics . One can not predict the economic future as one would predict physical motion using Newton mechanics . That does not mean that law of economics does not work . It is a rough science and you would have to make intelligent guesses based on common sense and clear evidence . Either way , disappointing book .	-1
Reeves certainly has the background to write a Kennedy book . In fact , Paul Johnson quoted Reeves extensively in his American history book to help slam JFK . However , I 've read enough books about the 35th President to spot numerous half-truths , distortions and pure guessing passed off as reliable sources . Shame on you , Reeves . Although I read the entire book , and did give it a chance , it 's an anti-JFK book from the start . If you want a well-done , fair critique on JFK , read Richard Reeves ' Profile of Power . Much more objective ...	-1
Very wordy ! ! The examples provided are weak ( and not many ) . The problems at the end of each section does n't always match what he 's taught in that section . Endless frustration .	-1
It 's old and does n't explain much of anything .	-1
Whenever I get this impression of a book 1/3 of the way through it I check others reviews and find quite a few with similar feelings . I thought I was reading Danielle Steele , who I have given up on because of her repetitious driving of her point across . So they are living with a lot of angst , get on with it . Should she try to save Beth , cause she could n't save Glenda ? Will Nick turn out to be another guy to do her wrong even if she feels such a strong attraction to him ? Can he ever forgive himself for not making Alyssa wear her helmet . Stay tuned for the next chapter in this soap saga .

The Cynster series started strongly , and I look forward to each new book . But this book is the end of the line for me , and hopefully for the author as well.The novel just was n't very interesting , and while the sex scenes are certainly sexy - they 're also very repetitive . After the first couple I just skimmed them to see if they ever advanced the plot , which they didn't.I think that Stephanie Laurens has fallen into the trap of liking her own characters so much that she thinks her readers will want to keep reading to see what happens to them . She does n't seem to put the same effort into actually making the books good , as though we 'll be content to just know that now both the twins are happy . ( She 's not the only one who falls into this trap as witnessed by the latest Kleypas novel , Lady Sophia 's Lover . ) In short , I 'd skip this book if you 're a longtime fan , and buy some of her earlier novels if you are n't .	-1
From one of the greatest writers in Boston ... Dennis , I 'm not too happy about this one . Can you write another for the men in the boiler rooms ?	-1
Started out great , but fizzled into a typical 3rd rate suspense yarn . I think this book has put me over the edge . I 'm giving up reading books of this kind and will do more research on who is writing better stories that do n't let me down at the end .	-1
A friend , knowing my interest in America 's Presidents , brought me a copy of page 64 , thinking I would be interested in it . I was . . . in all of the errors ! I found at least 7 errors of fact on that one page about Vice-President Wheeler . I know nothing of the rest of the book , and hope this is definitely advertised as fiction . Even so , I would think a little more attention to historical facts would be worth the author 's time.Del Hambley	-1
Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors . Unfortunately , he has a little problem ; he 's got a successful career in multiple mediums , winning awards and selling millions of copies of his novels , comics , and now films . This has led to the translation of EVERY work of his having a planned adaptation into other mediums . Neverwhere was a nice little low-budget BBC miniseries , and it worked well as that . It was basically Sandman-lite , but it had its charm . Now , since Gaiman has proved himself as a competent author of comics , novels , and scripts , it also HAS to be a book and a comic series . Similarly , Stardust was a nice novel , and it got a great movie . Now , there is a comic adaptation on the way , even though it was already an illustrated novel . WHY ? Encouraging his behavior by buying it in multiple forms is going to kill Gaiman artistically : rather than coming up with new material , we will be flooded with translations of the same old work over and over again . Case-in-point : his failed script for a children 's cartoon series , Interworld , was published as a half-baked 180-page children 's novel , with poor grammar and poor editing , in hardback for $ 14 . Luckily , I borrowed it from a friend , because had I bought it , I would be infuriated.Do n't humor Gaiman in his artistic constipation ; he 's a GREAT author . Sandman , Mirrormask , Good Omens , these are TRUE CLASSICS of their genres , and the man has the potential to change film , comics and literature , if he only continues to create original content . If we allow him to coast in his career by simply cashing in on his already made franchises , he will fail to make an impact . True fans of Gaiman , stay away from this , and all other remakes of his work .	-1
Dr Atkins spends entirely too much time telling the reader how great and wonderful he is . That is n't really why we purchased his book . He could have gotten his message across with far fewer words if he was n't so terribly proud of himself ! We , both my wife and myself feel cheated by him .	-1
I have never understood why Norman Cantor seems to think the public only wants the `` movie version '' of history instead of the real thing . But the movie version -- including outdated ideas , sensational assertions and gross misunderstandings -- is what this is . After reading this book -- which , fortunately , I did n't pay full price for -- I am happy to see from the reviews posted here that others have spotted its many flaws.Quite a few people who come to this book WITHOUT much background in medieval history or medicine find it fascinating , and feel they have learned a lot about history from it -- though admittedly it 's also rambling , repetitious , VERY poorly edited and sometimes difficult to keep track of . ( I 'll second all those criticisms but wo n't address them here . ) On the other hand , people who actually KNOW something about biology , anthropology , genetics , epidemiology , demographics or material culture will be brought up short by Cantor 's sloppy thinking and downright inexcusable ignorance.One reviewer comments , `` Cantor 's research for this tome must have been incredibly extensive , since he provides excruciating details for every topic ... '' But in fact , it 's those very fascinating details that are often wrong . Just about any time I found myself saying `` Wow , I never knew THAT , '' it turned out later that Cantor was wrong . For instance , he clearly did n't even bother to verify his facts on the old `` Ring Around the Rosy '' legend -- check it out on the Urban Legends Reference Pages ; the song seems to hve come into existence in the 1880s.As for demographics , he confuses the statistics on life expectancy badly , saying that a modern actuary would have given the 15-year-old Princess Joan `` just about ten years to live '' , based on an *average* life expectancy of 25 . This is highly misleading , because the highest death rates were among children under 5 -- if you made it to age 20 ( only about two-thirds of the children born actually did ) , you could expect to live at least into your 50s , even under the appalling sanitary conditions of the time . And Joan was a princess . relatively well cared for and well nourished , and might have lived even longer . King Edward I lived to be 68 ; Eleanor of Aquitaine ( 1122-1204 ) lived to be 82.He also asserts that men might be on their third or fourth marriage by age 45 , ignoring the fact that women of that age might almost equally well be on their third or fourth husband . The tendency for women to die in childbirth is nearly balanced by men 's tendency to die in wars , brawls , or hunting accidents.His carelessness about material culture is at least as great . He perpetuates the myth of the Great Unwashed by asserting that people did n't `` bathe '' -- they may well not have immersed themselves completely in water , but at least the upper and middle classes washed their bodies regularly ( a sponge bath and a good rinse ) , changed their underwear frequently , and swept their floors daily . He regularly gets clothes wrong : women did not wear `` corsets '' in the 1300s , and also a velvet altar frontal is not a `` vestment , '' nor would it be used ON the altar . ( Vestments are clothing , cloths ON the altar are always linen . ) The real problem , though , is that Cantor apparently has n't figured out how to write competently for a lay audience . He seems to think the public only wants the `` movie version '' of history . I 've read several of his other books , and his textbooks -- where he 's not trying to be breezy or topical , or to air his sometimes crochety opinions of modern life -- are fine . His _Medieval Lives_ , on the other hand , is terrible : it 's at least as sloppy and filled with errors as this is . The worst parts are where he 's trying to be funny.I read William Manchester 's _A World Lit Only by Fire_ perhaps seven or eight years ago , when I knew less than I do now , and found I think nine errors of fact in its first dozen pages . And I do n't have a PhD , just a good liberal arts college degree . In a morbid way , it 's amusing to hear THAT book praised as better than this one . Perhaps that IS an accurate assessment .	-1
I have had a lot of problems with the audio in this book . It has n't recognized what page you are on or when you turn pages .	-1
1 . The title `` Sea Hunter '' is weak and misleading.2 . The cover picture is also weak and misleading.3 . The story idea is creative.4 . The majority of the book ( sans the last 18 pages ; the ending ) is interestingly detailed and well written , so as to make the story captivating . The story builds up well to an interesting climax.5 . The ending ( i.e. , 18 pages ) is largely disappointing , rushed , and weak . It 's as though the writer suddenly reached a maximum page length or deadline and rushed to write the ending . The story details drop noticeably to a substantive low , leaving readers with many loose ends , particularly as relating to the creature and the villains . Essentially , the ending is poorly contrived and written.In summary , its a fun read until the ending , which rapidly deflates to a weak ending.Two stars because the writer wrote well until the ending and then wasted his and my time with a weak ending .	-1
As a designer myself ( in metro LA ) , I bought this book as I buy many decorating books to share with my clients . I look at the books with some of my clients as a way of learning their likes and dislikes . It 's interesting for me to observe that the people I 've been working with almost immediately set this book aside after they begin to go through it and they grab for other books that may fit their likes more closely . Maybe the feel of the rooms in this book reflect a regional or city preference . I can not help but agree with my customers who think these rooms are n't relaxed enough for modern life .	-1
What were they thinking ? Whoever put this book together does n't have a clue about creating luxurious , livable spaces . This book is a turnoff . I 'd call this funeral home or hotel lobby design or designing to impress the ladies who lunch crowd . This book is obviously about how to spend a fortune in the process , too . Real luxury is about comfort and unpretentious ease , not necessarily money . Unfortunately , this designer does not seem to get that .	-1
This was one of those books that fizzled out causing me to feel I wasted my time . By the end , I could not care less what happened to whom or why .	-1
The only reason I finished this book is that it was the only reading material i had while on vacation . It was awful . The repetitive `` they hated eachother but there was such chemistry '' thing got old by the end of the first chapter -- and was repeated , ad nauseum , throughout the rest of the book ( and quite nearly on every single insufferable page ) . Skip this and instead read ANYTHING by Marian Keyes ; all of her books are the perfect Chick Lit -- especially `` Watermelon . ''	-1
I have to be honest - I really wanted to like this book after reading the reviews , but her use of appositive phrases is extremely overdone and very annoying . Maybe it 's just a personal pet peeve since I am an English teacher , but she interrupts almost every sentence with a thought interjected into the middle - ugh ... .a good technique but not for almost every line ! It makes her sentences jilted and slows the flow of the reading ... I had to abandon it . I 'm sure the plot is solid , but to be considered a sophisticated writer , you need to have more than one trick in your bag concerning style .	-1
The only reason I gave this book one star was because it is the lowest rating available . Amazon should permit negative ratings , especially for a Patrick Robinson book.This absurd story begins with the sudden `` flipping '' of an experienced British commando during a firefight who suddenly `` sees the light '' and is now an anglo-hating terrorist . More ridiculous is that England , the commando 's own country can not seem to locate him but the U.S. quickly starts following his trail ; one of many overt political statements from Mr. Robinson.The author adds an even `` more realistic '' scenario . A maximum-security Israeli prison housing some of the world 's most dangerous terrorists manned by a few poorly trained guards is easily overrun.Next a Russian submarine sitting in drydock for several years is suddenly thrust into service and manned by foreign nationals not exactly known for their naval ability . The sub , manned by a skeleton crew , evades all detection by the most technologically advanced country in the world . Quite realistic . Even better , after sitting in drydock for lack of money for so long , this submarine never ever has one mechanical breakdown ? This is just the beginning of the book 's many insults to the readers ' intelligence.Throughout this ridiculous story are constant overt political opinions by Mr. Robinson who uses his books as his own political soapbox from which to preach his ultra-conservative `` Might makes Right '' declaration . The story 's liberal characters are inserted merely as punching bags for the author 's infallible conservativism.Mr . Robinson 's political tirades are at best ... juvenile.I had found Mr. Robinson 's earlier works- Kilo Class , Nimitz Class , HMS Unseen and The Shark Mutiny more researched and less implausible but his works deteriorated with each subsequent novel.Root canal is less painful than reading this book.If you want to read good submarine techno-thrillers try Joe Buff or Michael Dimercurio	-1
What a dissapointment , coming after his great debut , THE PERFECT STORM . THis is a loose collection of magazine articles published previously by the author , without even new research ... Maybe his editor wanted to cash in as fas as possible in the wake of PERFECT STORM 's success , adn JUnger had not the time to come up with something new and really good . So , he got his scrap book , and thcam tcham ! ! This book was born !	-1
THE STORIES IN THIS AUDIO VERSION ARE GREAT . I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU `` READ '' THE BOOK AND NOT LISTEN TO THE AUDIO.MS . ROBERTS HAS A VOICE THAT IS AKIN TO CHALK ON A BLACKBOARD . IT IS SO GRATING AND DISTRACTING THAT IT RUINS THE STORIES.I GOT RID OF THE AUDIO AND CHECKED OUT THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY.I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY ANYTHING THAT SHE MIGHT NARRATE .	-1
After having read `` The other side of the story '' , which was complex and multidimensional , I assumed all the other books by this author would be similar . Unfortunately , this one was the opposite - very predictable and boring . And the main character was too neurotic for my taste . I still liked the writing style , that 's the only reason I finished the book .	-1
I am shocked . I went to the bookstore to find some books in sign language for my preschool students who were deaf . I was thrilled to find the titles , then livid with rage at what I found between the covers . These are not true signs . These are n't even invented signs , these are gestures and body language . I am iffy about teaching hearing babies sign anyway , does n't seem to be a need for it . But if you are going to write a book about using signs with infants , at least have the decency to use actual true signs that are used by the Deaf community . What you have here is an insult to them , as well as a lie to the customers who buy your book thinking they are teaching their children sign . Instead , they are teaching pantomime .	-1
Madelaine de Lacy , Duchess of Magnus has swapped places with her cousin Eleanor to be a lady 's companion so that she can attend the Game of the Century to stop her father from gambling away the family 's heirloom , the Queen 's tiara . On arrival at Chalice Hall , she meets Gabriel Ansell , Lord Campion , the fiance that she deserted 4 years ago . Will Madelaine resist the charms of Gabriel and will they trust each other enough to stop the scam that is the Game of the Century ? This is my second book by Christina Dodd and will probably be my last . I had trouble finishing the book and alsmost gave up half way through . The danger lurking in the background did n't really get off to a start and you could predict the ending . There was no chemistry between Gabriel and Madelaine except for one sex scene which was quite hot . Apart from this scene give the book a miss and read a book by other historical romantic authors who do a much better job.Lealing	-1
this kind of story line ( us vs russia ) and charachter development ( the main charachters are the weapons and weapons systems ) went out of fashion 15 years ago . this book is boring , the plot ridiculous , the authenticity incredulous - in short , I might read this book if the cable was out , it was raining , i had run out of wine , the cd player was broken , and it was the only book on the shelf .	-1
After attending my first NASCAR race ( Talladega ) , I wanted to learn more about the entire NASCAR experience -- the race and RV'ing extravaganza . However , this book drags on forever.If you 've never been to a NASCAR race , go . If you 've been to one , you certainly do not need to read this book .	-1
Stories of the rich and famous ( mostly the rich ) who were hit during their richness with a disease , usually a serious disease.Cavuto speaks lovingly of them , hard to say whether it was because they were rich and successful or because they did n't go into a tailspin when bad news hit . No great insight , however , comes from his reviews , or interviews , or analysis . The possibilities were there but the book fell short . Sadly , so many people do good things AFTER they are hit by MS or their child is hit by a drunk . Not to minimize their good deeds , but motivation is easier than it would be for Joe Schmoe who simply feels the need to aid the Lepers or feed the hungry or get rapists off the street . While these people took action , it took personal loss to get them off their seats , and as I said , admirable , but motivated by self . Some of what I read between Cavuto 's lines is the shock that this could happen to rich people- duh- it happens to all of us and most of us do n't have the means to do things about it .	-1
I really love chick lit , and found this to be one of the most boring , going nowhere stories I have read in a long time ... I never enjoyed the story , it was too long with pointless details and I found it real easy to put down . Definitely would NOT recommend ! !	-1
For Hannah Lovekin , life 's been going fairly well , when her boyfriend of 5 years , Jason , goes and ruins everything by proposing . Hannah , embittered by her first marriage , says no , only to change her mind after Jason promptly becomes engaged to someone else . Jason agrees to take her back , but only after she fulfills a list of requirements including confronting her ex-husband , Jack . Eventually , the we find that Hannah 's true issues with commitment ( hence the title ) lay not with her first husband , but with her relationship with her parents.As you can tell from the stars , this book did n't impress me much . While Hannah , the commitment phobic main character , did score a few points with her sardonic wit , overall , I did n't find her particularly likable . And I never understood why Jason , initally drawn as a nice , down-to-earth kind of guy , would have so quickly begun to see someone else after the inital break up . Also , as has happened before with Anna Maxted 's books , ( particularly Running In Heels ) the whole plot is tied up a little too neatly in the end . Maxted would like me to believe that Hannah 's issues , which have been generating for 30 years , took , oh , about a month to resolve so that Hannah could be happy ever after . Sorry , did n't buy it.You know it 's a problem when books from this genre ( generally designed to be quick , fun reads to make you smile in recognition and/or laugh out loud ) take weeks to read because , although you 're a fast reader , you 're just not that engrossed in the novel.Right after I finished this book , I started reading another chic book , `` Something Borrowed '' by Emily Giffin . I read it quickly , only putting it down when I had to go to work or sleep ( damn this needing-to-earn-a-living thing ! ) . Which makes `` Being Committed '' that much more disappointing .	-1
the author obviously did extensive research into this true story of murder in Tonga in 1976 , but he appeared to have felt compelled to include every detail anyone ever told him , including hundreds of details that are completely and totally irrelevant to the story . it is difficult to imagine that this book had an editor of any skill . the author 's `` style '' was extremely annoying , and i finished the book wishing that a better journalist had undertaken this effort .	-1
Decent sci-fi escapist fiction by Garth Nix . Familiar enough futuristic world , predictable story but well-written and entertaining . Might be worth a look for fans of Nix or the genre.Full review here : [ ... ]	-1
I used to enjoy reading a Jill Churchill book . This one is just awful . The plot is weak , the characters boring , writing stilted ... and the mystery was n't very mysterious . The touches that were probably meant to add reality felt more like bizarre twists being forced in.Mel , the dapper and intelligent detective , is much too worldly to be saddled with this : '' Mel was glad it was dark in the car . He was desperately afraid he might -- heaven forfend - be blushing. '' Seriously ? Forfend ? Blushing ? Who are you and what have you done with the funny , bright author we used to like ?	-1
I only read this book because the movie is coming out & I had n't read it in school . I really hated it ... ..it was impossible to understand most of the time & really boring . I hope the movie is better or it will be a total flop ... ..mad I spent $ 8 on it .	-1
If you 're thinking of buying the Great Gatsby ( a classic example of the literature elite trying to cram a book down the people 's mouths as a & quot ; classic & quot ; ) , read the yellow pages instead . It is that moving.With so many truly great books out there ( anything by Vonnegut , Catcher in the Rye , anything by Voltaire , etc . ) , why waste your time on this ?	-1
I always can find something good about a book , no matter how bad it is . The Great Gatsby , however , is probably one of the only books I 've read that I hate.It is the story of a man who , basically , talks about nothing . The plot is nonexistent , just the ramblings of a man who 's confused about society . The characters are either boring or not developed enough . The worst part about the book is that you get the feeling that F. Scott Fitzgerald is going to hit you with a great , dramatic , thought-provoking ending , and nothing happens at the end . When I finished , I was left with the feeling of & quot ; Okay , what was that all about ? & quot ; I can understand that it is a reflection of the 1920s , but certainly not a very good reflection.This is a book you should read when there is absolutely nothing else to read . If there is anything else at all , read that instead .	-1
I have had both rewarding and unrewarding experiences with classic literature . The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.My basic response to this book : It lacks depth of any significance . The descriptions are minimally imaginative , and never spark excitement . And the characters ? The characterizations , the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions , are all simple and do n't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling . Supposedly , for example , the several main characters in the book , most notably Gatsby , have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips , but are afraid to grasp it . But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.In short , this book , while having a decent plot and overall structure , was boring , because the writing is boring . If The Great Gatsby was a serious attempt at good writing , then it is evident to me that Scott Fitzgerald had never in his his life experienced any significant passion or the thrill and thunderburst excitement that is the reward of spirited creativity .	-1
The following is a cut-up of other one-star reviews of this product.Exciting needs to stretch the mind . Mass-produced tickertape parade of sleeping pills . It needs to use sci-fi interest . Imagination murder is what makes the mind . A man spliced together out of old newsreels . 1920s self pity is a wonderful thing . View love in a distant manner .	-1
I heard this book was a classic , a must read , so I read it.It was a bad book ! I do n't think anyone would have published it today.I am not so young as to not understand a & quot ; great & quot ; novel , so I must say & quot ; this is one of the most boring and shallow books ever written & quot ; .I 'll give him one thing-this boredom is beautifuly written.His language is beautiful and captures the mood of the time and place , but it does n't make up for the complete lack of plot.I read , and read , and read and nothing happened.He had a good idea , Scott Fitzgerald but he did n't do much with it.I have noticed that readers do n't like the bad reviews.I suspect they think such reviews are not serious , but please listen to me-IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS BOOK PLEASE DO ! There are too many great and good books , there is too little time to read them , so do n't waste your time !	-1
I wanted to like this book.The main problem for me was that this book had no discernible plot . It was just Carkeet moving from one quirky player 's problems to another quirky player 's problems . I only read until page 50 , and the book 's plot had not start moving at that point . Not a good sign.I also did n't like the tone of the writing . Carkeet seems very taken by his quirky style and cleverness . It overwhelms the book , and is ultimately what keeps the plot bogged down in minutiae.Perhaps his existing fans will like this book , but I found it boring and unenjoyable .	-1
I do n't mind authors telling similar stories if each is entertaining in its own way . But this book troubled me . It had too many parts directly copied from LM Montgomery 's book The Blue Castle ( TBC ) . TBC was published in 1926 . This book was published in 1987 . I gave TBC 4 stars.PLOT PROBLEMS : Missy is 33 , wimpy , mousy , downtrodden , a spinster , and lives with her mother . In TBC a doctor sends her a letter by mistake saying she will die within the year . Therefore , she no longer cares what people think , she speaks the truth even when it 's rude , and she makes major changes in her life . In this book , there is no doctor 's letter to her . She just all of a sudden makes changes in her life . Supposedly she met someone who encouraged her to do new things . I do n't think that person was enough to justify Missy 's changes.At the end of the book one character who had a significant part disappears - because she is really just a ghost . That came from nowhere . The ghost element did not connect in any logical way.CAUTION SPOILERS : In both books Missy proposes marriage to a stranger and tells him it is temporary because she will die within the year . In TBC Missy believes it . In this book she lies to him on purpose . At the end of this book she intends to continue the lie . That did n't feel right . It left the story unfinished.I was also disappointed in the lack of relationship development . In TBC there was a lengthy period of the couple interacting and getting to know each other . Here there is nothing like that . For some unknown reason he accepts her proposal . He discovers he likes sex with her . Then the book is over ( as far as their relationship goes ) .DATA : Narrative mode : 3rd person . Story length : 177 pages . Swearing language : none , other than occasional use of religious swear words . Sexual language : none . One sex scene referred to , no details . Setting : around 1918 Byron , Australia . Copyright : 1987 . Genre : historical romance .	-1

I have to say that I have great respect for Alice Waters because she has people thinking and cooking . But , this is how most of us over forty grew up . Not all of us are city dwellers , who unless they attended a culinary school , ca n't boil water.It amazes me that the young people in America ca n't do anything unless they have an authority giving some impramatur to validate ? ... their choices . They 're afraid of cooking , raising children , reading the wrong book , dressing themselves , voting for the right candidate , and now they 're being told to know vegetables intimately.It 's now in fashion to be a farmer . Growing up , who knew ? But most people had a garden of some sort all over America in years past and it probably was n't a business.I lived in one amall city where garden land was rented and became a daily ritual to pick fresh products and weeds . Do n't get me wrong , I love big city living where you can pick and choose the best eateries daily as well . But I am nonplussed by young people telling me how important it is to subscribe to sustainable farming , farm to table food prep . I mean geez , these poor things did n't know this already ? And that 's the point , do n't live like sheep , you did n't discover eating , cooking and picking food . Also do n't be smug and live this movement with a vengence , you 'll be missing a lot . Remember the people who came before , they were probably healthier than you . Use your imagination and do n't be so lazy , find out for yourself . You do n't know it all and neither does Alice or Oprah !	-1
I 've been reading all of Lisa See 's stuff , so have finally settled on the Red Princess works . Flower Net is my first . It is n't the same kind of work that Gold Mountain , or Shanghai Girls and the other novels of Lisa 's ancestors or general ancestry.This story is about people who are n't related to Lisa and it 's in a genre that does n't quite fit an historical novelist 's finest skill . I felt that she got lost in the mystery novel that is n't her native skill . Maybe she outlined the concept and filled it in afterward ? What happened was there were shocking things that happened , but there were few entwined twists that lead to each catharsis . They just `` happened . '' No teeny-tiny hints , no itty-bitty clues that a great mystery writer embeds in the early part of the story to tease people along to when things erupt . Then , at the end , she just explains the whole thing to satisfy the reader . I appreciated that , but I find mystery stories that are crafted to allow the reader to build their own mental evidence to be more intriguing.This story was more of a tome ( a slice of a news story ) . The relationship between David and Hulan was more interesting that what they did in the mystery , so for the romance folks this should be satisfying . The mystery folks were left kinda cold .	-1
I wo n't take your time with jargon as I 'll assure you that you will want to quickly move on reading descriptions about another book . I agree 100 % with the reviewer roxie52 . This book should have ended halfway through and not waste our time reading more . Maybe there was a word quota ? Who knows.Do not recommend . Actually I do n't recommend any of Oprah 's book club books .	-1
I disliked this book so much that every time I see it on the library shelves , I 'm tempted to hide it behind the stacks so no one else will have to suffer through it.The problem for me was not the writing -- it was that I did n't care for a single character in the entire book . The murder was almost incidental , the trip to Disney World seemed so incongruous that it came across as an attempt by the author to justify her family 's vacation as `` research , '' and therefore a tax write-off.The thing the author should realize is that when someone as unlikeable as this victim gets killed , no one really CARES who did it . They just shout `` Hurray ! '' and move on .	-1
I think the biggest problem for me was Bitsy , I found her extremely irritating and dull . Most people in the book were so taken with her , but there was no justification for the constant adoration showered upon her . This book was also too darn long ! I just wanted it to end already ! Dorothy was funny , but the letters really got to be a bit much . I would n't say not to read it because it seems that all the other reviewers loved it . BUT , I would n't have too high of expectations and just check it out at the library -- no need to buy this one .	-1
This book says it 's a fast paced suspense novel . I have 10 pages to go and theres nothing fast about this book . I am still waiting for the suspense and I 'm so bored it 's ridiculous . I would n't reccomend this book to anyone . And ... if I hear the words `` Mental Note '' in this book one more time I think I 'll burn this book .	-1
very strange stories . well written but not my style . Just did n't seem like there was much of a plot to them	-1
In a few words : Boring . Overblown . Pretentious and unrealistic . Poorly written . Clumsy , clunky sentences.Give me a break ! A few wonderful visual images do not redeem hundreds of underdeveloped characters , unfinished story lines , and poor editing , and chalking it up to & quot ; circular Indian thinking & quot ; is ridiculous.I give two , as opposed to one , stars due to the potential of a great story -- -ie , the author has imagination . Beyond that , I do n't get the hype .	-1
This is my first and last Stuart Woods book . I wanted to try a new author so , unfortunately , I went out and purchased this book . It was so unbalanced where the political characters are concerned ( all the good guys are Democrats and all the bad guys are Republicans or conservatives ) that I almost gave up in the first quarter of the book . However , I am a disciplined reader so I finished the book . I suggest that the next time Mr. Woods wants to write a book with a one-sided political viewpoint he just write a white paper for all good liberals to read and spare the rest of us from his preaching .

I recently heard an hour-long interview with Murray on this book and was troubled by the tone of his conversation . He described the book in fairly innocuous terms as an attempt by a quantitiative social scientist to document & quot ; creative explosions. & quot ; However , whenever the interviewer would ask him about other grand non-Western achievements such as the Egyptian civilization , the Umayyad 's and Moors in Iberia , the Central Asian artists and poets , the Aztec and the Incas -- he would dismiss them as great but not of the same & quot ; magnitude & quot ; as Europe . Murray completely neglects the borrowing of traditions that went on in Europe as a reason for the increased & quot ; magnitude. & quot ; He also neglects the influence of colonialism in artificially augmenting Europe 's accomplishments . If you are interested in the question of why certain societies have & quot ; accomplished & quot ; more , I would suggest Jared Diamond 's pulitzer prize-winning book Guns Germs and Steel . Murray should also be more forthright in discussing the negative consequences of presenting data of this kind without constructive commentary . This was the same problem with The Bell Curve . While the analysis may be internally consistent and statistically impeccable , the role of the social scientist is also to discern what the research could be used for and how it can potentially reinforce negative stereotypes about societies and cultures . If you are going to present such highly charged data , that is fine , but then spend the extra time in contextualizing it and preventing its misuse by prejudicial circles .	-1
If your into conspiracy theories , be my guest and read the book , I read the book at my local library , and Thought it was fun , entertaining , however amusing , it is NOT FACTUAL . and caters to people who believe we did not land on the moon , or that oswald did not act alone ( oliver commie stone ) etc . It 's a book to pass the time , but not a serious book , read before you buy and see if it fits your mold ?	-1
I expect that individuals who write history to have a political point of view , but this book is entirely beyond having a slant . The reader can not get past the author 's political views to try to understand what happened , rather it a collection of events viewed through jaded eyes with the goal of convincing the reader of Zinn 's political agenda . I have a master 's in history and I am not sure I have ever read garbage quite like this book.A good example at how his politics overshadow and jade everything is his viewpoints on World War 2 . He seems to say that Nazi Germany , the Soviet Union , and the United States are actually much more similar to each other than the popular history suggests . While I am ashamed of the some of the ways that our country has treated other countries and the U.S. history of slavery and racial inequality - to say we are so similar to Nazi Germany shows a complete lack of understanding of the depths of Nazi atrocities and a political agenda/view that seems to overshadow basic facts and understanding of past events.There are plenty of very good surveys of American history out there that are much better than this one - skip this book and get another book on American history .	-1
This was a difficult read . I 've never read Allende before so I assumed that maybe the problem was in a translation or something . And then I read the other customer reviews which says that this is simply not her best book . On that , I ca n't comment . But this was not my favorite either . I was tempted to abandon the book at several points . It got mildly intriguing when the & quot ; California gold rush & quot ; got underway , and I found this book to take so many bizarre turns , I stuck with it . I think Allende was trying to make too many statements about disjointed social issues and ultimately , her point got lost entirely . There 's social class issues , gender issues , race issues , moral issues ( the prostitutes were memorable ) , ethnic issues and on and on . What was her point ? ... Do n't know if I can recommend this one .	-1
The title . To put a mockingbird or any other singing bird above all others is counter-intuitive . All living beings have the same value , all life is inherently unique . The author posits that the mockingbird does no harm , but the insects it eats would say otherwise . The mockingbird is just as base , just as feral as a tiger.The novel . `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' is certainly a regional tale and yet it is entirely transposed and made unique . The fundamental flaw of the work is patriarch , Atticus Finch . Behold the savior of the down trodden race , raise him high and everlasting , let his name be known across the dark land.The land is dark because Atticus overshadows it , his skills as a lawyer of more import than the man he defends . His family , friends and town are props conspicuously used to frame the towering moral height of the man . Summed up : `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' is an exaggerated Norman Rockwell painting.Chris Roberts , Killer of Mockingbirds .	-1
This is Louisiana native , Rebecca Wells ' third installment into the Ya-Ya Sisterhood Saga . Wells , who is also an actor and playwright , has been riding high on the success of the bestseller Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood which has been translated into 23 languages since its release in 1996.If you are not familiar with the Ya-Yas , they are four Louisiana women who 've been friends since childhood ( as young as 4 ) in the 1930s . Once a Ya-Ya , always a Ya-Ya . It even gets passed down through lineage producing Petite Ya-Yas ( their children ) and Tres Petites Ya-Yas ( their grandchildren ) . Ya-Yas hold friendship and family at the top of their list of values along with `` unconditional loyalty , high-style and southern sass '' .Ya-Yas in Bloom starts off with family tree diagrams for each Ya-Ya , Vivi , Caro , Teensy and Necie . As I continued to read I found them to be a definite asset , having to refer to them numerous times . The following chapters are divided into four sections titled : Sowing Sisterhood Seeds , Tending Young Buds , Bruised Plantings , and A Bountiful Garden.Ya-Yas in Bloom continues to languish on the emotional ties present amongst women and the bond of `` true sister-friends '' . At page three I decided I was going to like this book because of the voice . The opening story was narrated by Vivi who 's 68 going on 49 . Unfortunately this feeling did n't hold until the end . More than half way through it began to feel like a bunch of leftover vignettes thrown together . There are just too many narrators : Vivi , Sidda , Baylor and even the occasional omnipresent voice take the reins . Ya-Yas in Bloom reads like the special features on a DVD giving some background on the well-loved characters.What I enjoyed most about Bloom is the loyalty of the characters to one another and to one another 's family . I enjoyed reading about Ya-Ya parties and how everyone prepared for the events ; even the children who often hid watching in awe of their Ya-Ya parents . And comical moments which I could relate to , like the chapter on snow in the South when Little Shep was so excited about seeing snow for the first time he ran into the glass pane of a patio door and knocked himself unconscious.While individually , some of these stories are heart warming as a whole they do n't connect into a cohesive novel . If you 're an obsessive Ya-Ya fan who just ca n't get enough or want more background then this book is for you . Otherwise , it 's too flat for popular consumption . Reviewed by M. E. Wood .	-1
This was my for Johanna Lindsey and will be my last . It was sooooooooo boring ! I made myself finish it because I 'd foolishly spent 8 bucks on it . What a waste . I wish I had n't bought it or at least finished it . The characters were blah and just annoying . The `` romance '' was even more boring , with the characters feeling nothing more than luke-warm sentiments for one another . YAWN .	-1
The first time I read this book ( YEARS AGO ) I thought it 's tips and suggestions might be helpful . I applied many of the tips in my communicating with men I worked with and the man I was involved with . I found myself coddling these men . I found that I was walking on pins and needles around these men , because I was trying to be empathetic towards their needs and less about mine . I then read many of Patricia Evans ' books ( e.g . The Verbally Abusive Relationship , etc . ) and found out that I worked for and was involved with verbally abusive men . John Gray 's tips and suggestions just made the verbal abuser 's behavior towards me even worse . I picked up the audio book at the library just recently and listened to it . It made me cringe listening to it . I had flashbacks to the abusers I was involved with at the time I first read this book . I would not suggest this book to anyone , especially someone who is involved with verbally abusive men/women .	-1
Some parts of this book are really interesting and a great read while others you are fighting not to fall asleep as they are so boring . When Keller is actually on the job as a hit man it is fascinating and must turn the next page to find out what will happen next reading , but when he is not on the job his life is very boring . Stamp collecting , visiting an astrologer , jury duty and things like this just are n't interesting.Basically this book is about a professional killer named Keller who has some competition . Only problem is that his competition does n't want any , and it soon becomes apparent to Keller that if he does n't work out who his rival is and kill him first he will be killed himself . If Lawrence Block had maybe concentrated a little more on this aspect rather than the boring chapters he wrote then this book could have been five stars . Without the editing it barely makes two and a half .	-1
My son is in the fourth grade and loves to write so this seemed like a natural purchase for him . Sadly , I 'm not even going to bother passing it along.I should mention that I loved Sarah Plain and Tall . The author 's slow , poetic voice suited that era very well , it just is n't working here . The characters do n't sound like real children at all . For example , at one point , in the course of normal conversation with his friends , a nine-year-old boy character says , `` And soon words will float out of his mouth like clouds . '' They write and speak like this throughout.It was almost like she was writing kids as she wishes they were rather than as they actually are . I suppose this book might appeal to a thoughtful adult writer , but I think it would be a rare child who would be interested .	-1
My wife bought it for our kids and brought it home . Before she got halfway into it , she returned it . I personally would n't bother reading anything by Dr. Lala , the homophobe .

I came across this nasty bit of dated tripe last weekend and decided to try to read it . I made it some 30 pages and had to stop . `` Vile '' is the only word I can think of to describe this book and its author . Well , `` phony '' is another word.Moore makes a point of telling us how he lives as a wealthy white man in the whitest , wealthiest section of Manhattan . He then spends a chapter telling us how much he cares about black people . Well , a move some 40 blocks north and Moore could actually LIVE amongst the people that he so loves , but like most liberals , Moore is all talk when it comes to race . Moore also laments the fact that his publishing company is all white . Again , Moore had the option of publishing with a black-owned company but then he would have to give up the huge advance . Phony from end to end.We do n't hear much from Moore these days . I guess a rotting sandwich gets thrown out sooner or later .	-1
It is truly sad when a person hates oneself so much . The self-hatred Moore has is really a shame . Under achievers such as Mike are naturally drawn to this masochistic behavior . The amount of meletonin in one 's skin is a meaningless determinant of good or evil . In fact , it is the very same ugly racism that Moore claims to abhor that he uses in the title of his book . Why , Mike ? I know that belonging to labor unions would tend to give one the feeling that , apart from group identification , one has little inherent value . Individual responsibility and rights tend to get swept away in favor of group rights with no accountability . But again , this has nothing to do with race . The idea that one race is just more virtuous than another is repugnant to good people of all races . Moore 's arguments and even his humor would be more effective if he did not engage in such self-loathing . No person has anything to feel guilty about if that guilt is based on the actions of another . Save your money , readers . There are much better political , social , and comedic commentaries out there . This is a sorry excuse for a book .	-1
Michael Moore heaps scorn and ridicule on America , especially our inept , dishonest , and `` stupid '' political leaders , and does so with considerable rancor , while trying for a tone of folksy humor . He calls George Bush the `` Thief-in-Chief , '' and also harshly criticizes Bill Clinton . If Michael is correct , we live in an extremely corrupt nation , led by incompetent white men who are both dishonest and stupid . He offers his ultimate solution to these problems in a chapter called `` Kill Whitey . '' Is n't THAT a hoot ? ! Michael has frequently been asked by interviewers about gross factual inaccuracies in this book , which he tries to deflect by saying it 's `` political humor . '' Where he cites data or facts , he often provides backnotes to identify the source . A check of a few of his sources consistently shows that his sources do NOT support his assertions -- -- -that he has consistently misrepresented the factual information he uses to demonstrate the `` stupidity '' of his targets.This kind of `` art '' and extremely harsh rhetoric continues to make it more and more difficult for liberals and conservatives to LISTEN to each other about their LEGITIMATE concerns . It does terrible disservice to the quality of our political dialogue , and I do n't recommend this book .	-1
I was a fan of Mr. Lamb 's first book , but this was not a winner , rather 700+ pages of meandering concepts with characters who can not be believed . I read the entire length of the novel hoping to find some redeeming value , but at the end was left with a quasi-spiritual flop undeserving of the hours I lost and should have spent on chores around our home . I found the one-sided political jabs annoying and repetative . The protagonist is a black hole into which human decency seems to have been swallowed , and to have been led to sympathize with some of the most morally depraved individuals ( Lolly and Velvet ) was disturbing at best . On the bright side , this book was lent to me , and I did n't waste $ 20 ...	-1
Overstuffed with WAY to much information ; historical and fictional , confused , convoluted , this book was boring and exhausting to read . I had to take a break from it for a while . The characters and events had tenuous connections to each other and it seemed like Lamb was just stuffing them in to document Columbine , Hurricane Katrina , etc even though the connections did not make realistic sense . I stopped caring about Caelum , his family , his cheating wife , everyone . No one in the book seemed to love each other , except maybe Velvet Hoon ( does that even sound like a real name ? ) to Caelum and his wife . Also , Velvet is supposed to be related to an Italian master stone carver from the past , but Velvet does n't have an Italian last name . Ok , so maybe her dad or someone in her family was not Italian , ( I have heard of `` Shannon Hoon '' from Blind Melon , so maybe it is real , maybe ... .. ) but to me , it would have been more believable if she did have an Italian last name . The other character that showed love was Mr. Mpipi , an African immigrant who worked as a janitor at Caelum 's school when Caelum was a boy . He shares his African culture with the kids and does `` the dance of great hunger and the dance of great love . '' ( Because we hunger for love , he says . As I did when I was reading this book . ) He is a delightful character , but he is only mentioned once in the beginning and then just seems be forgotten . I was hoping he would appear later in the book , as an elderly man , and maybe the adult Caelum talks to and learns something from him , but he never did . I was disappointed about that . It seems like Lamb just kept getting new ideas and forgetting about old ones , instead of developing the old ones and bringing them back , and tying up loose ends like a novel writer should . It was maddening to me and it seemed like the book itself had ADHD . Fortunately , Velvet 's story was tied up at the end in a happy ending , and Caelum finds peace with his relatives ( whoever they may be and whatever the heck they did ) . A relief when it finally ended .	-1
After waiting 10 years for Wally Lamb to write another great book , I was sorely disappointed in this one . I did finish it but there were several times when I almost gave up . The main character irritated me so much I wanted to reach into the pages and slap him . And I never quite figured out what the book 's theme was : teenage violence , women 's prisons , dysfunctional marriages , weird teenage girls , Hurricane Katrina , dairy farming , yellow Mustangs , the butterfly affect , Mark Twain ... .it was such a mixed-up bag of messages , enough to frustrate any Wally Lamb fan . And , as another reviewer noted , all the characters that might have been truly interesting were dead and we never get to meet them except through writings or Caelum 's self-centered mind . One of the greatest living American writer 's , Joyce Carol Oates wrote a novel based on the Jon Benet Ramsey murder and did a far , far better job of incorporating a violent true-life event into a brilliant tour de force about a young man 's trauma in the aftermath of disaster . Mr. Lamb 's latest does not seem like 10 years worth of work but it did seem like it took 10 years to read it .	-1
The only nice thing I can say about The Hour I First Believed is that it is ambitious about a difficult subject matter - the Columbine Massacre and PTSD . However , the weaving of additional sub-plots of addiction , broken relationships , painful childhoods , forgiveness , and the forging of new romantic interests just kills any meaningful discourse on PTSD or the shooting . Broken into three parts the first and most compelling portion of the book covers the Columbine shooting itself with actual passages taken from the shooters own words . That was a strange sentence to write . The other two parts are suppose to be about the difficulties dealing with and the recovery from survivors guilt/PTSD . But here the book goes off the rails and manders from sub-plot to the next rendering the first part and the main plot as backdrop for Lamb 's other musings . I ca n't escape the feeling that the Japanese authors have read have done just as much as Lamb has here but managed to do it about a fifth of the length.I also think that there needs to be a dreaded , slightly decretory tone saying for literary fiction about unnecessary but detailed biographical stories of characters like there is for the & # 34 ; info dump & # 34 ; in science fiction . Complex biographical back stories that adds nothing to the plot , does n't add complexity to the characters , it just bores the readers and shows how shallow the characterization is in the first place . The weird thing is that this biographical detail was n't needed at all , the characters were already fully fleshed out with sides to their lives that were n't directly tied to moving the plot forward . Not one of the better reads of the year .	-1
Before this book , I was an admirer of Wally Lamb 's novels . They have a lot in common : long , first-person picaresque and rambling , Lamb 's books tap into large , philosophical themes like the meaning of life , the value of family , the role of faith . These are big novels with big , showy titles.So , Lamb sets himself major challenges as a writer . That 's good . This time , though , he is n't able to meet those challenges successfully . The angry , self-indulgent , graceless narrator , Caelum Quirk , is not engaging enough for the reader to care about his various ancestors and friends . The letters from Caelum 's civil war era great-grandmother , which ramble on for pages and pages , are dull and self-justifying . Too much of the book is just plain put-downable . A lot of it borders on glib . Finally , the story is harnessed to an allegorical framework ( the quest , the minotaur , the maze ) that tries too hard to bring together too many disparate stories and overburdens the fiction with historical background . The resulting novel is labored , mechanical , and pretentious . Especially pretentious is the matter at the back of the book , which includes everything from a musical playlist of tunes that inspired Lamb to a list of charities to which a reader affected by the story might wish to donate.One of the biggest risks Lamb takes is setting part of the book in the center of the real Columbine tragedy . He explains in an afterword why he thought that this choice was the right one , why to do otherwise would be to shirk the true implications of his story -- and he shows some humility and sympathy for the people who actually experienced this terrible day . But it would take a writer more brilliant than Lamb ( at least as he performs in this novel ) to do true justice to that real experience . I found his use of this event , with its shock value , more prurient than illuminating . I know this was n't his intention , but his use of Columbine seemed manipulative and exploitative to me . I felt he was trading on real pain for a fictional pay off .	-1
Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and Wicked being two of my favorite books , I was excited to dig in to Mirror Mirror . However , after only about two dozen pages I found myself losing interest because I was profoundly confused about who was telling the story.In a nutshell , that was the main problem I had with Mirror Mirror : though Maguire 's descriptions were as textured as ever , the fragmented narration made it difficult to fully relate to the characters . The characterization in his other books was so layered that I cared about the major and minor characters alike ( even in Son of a Witch , which while good was not quite as dazzling as its predecessor ) . This story focuses on Bianca and her father , Vicente , but I did not feel particularly connected to either of them - they seemed to function more as symbolic placeholders than as actual people . The one real exception to this problem was Lucrezia Borgia : Mirror Mirror was really her tale , and she was by far the most engaging character to me . But her voice is only peppered throughout the narrative ; Bianca , Vicente , and the dwarves also speak at different times , and I found the structure too fragile to be effective.The magical elements in this story did not gel for me , either . The magical elements in Wicked were inherent to the story and Confessions used folk superstition to create an air of the supernatural , but I did not feel I had to totally suspend disbelief to read either one . With Mirror Mirror , though , the branch from the Tree of Knowledge was a hard pill to swallow ( what the heck was up with the final chapter ? ) , as was the dwarves ' characterization . The dwarves are first described as primitive creatures born of the earth , more mineral than human , yet simply by Bianca speaking to them are they able to speak the languages of men with complete fluency . While I realized that Maguire was asking the reader to explore the idea of imagining something into your own reality , that whole concept seemed out of place in this setting.I managed to finish this book because I do adore Maguire 's descriptive prowess and the sly wit he incorporates into the dialogue , but Mirror Mirror is definitely not his best showing - which is sad , because he had some fantastic ideas to work with . If you 're a fist-time Maguire reader , start with Wicked or Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister .	-1
I read Gregory Maguire 's Wicked and absolutely loved it . I adore the idea of taking a common story and putting a twist on it . I was excited about this new book , so I reserved it at the library before it had even been published.I was sorely disappointed and that is being kind . I felt like I missed something important in the story telling process that would explain what was happening . The basic plot of the story is easy enough to follow.Bianca de Nevada 's name literally translates into White from Snow ( Nevada being a snowy region ) . Bianca is the daughter of a landowner , Vicente , who 's mother died during childbirth . She lives with the cook , Primavera who acts as her nanny and Fra Ludovico , a priest . While draining a lake for irrigation purposes , they find a mirror laying at the bottom and put it up on a wall in their home.One day a campaign comes through and the Borgia siblings , Cesare and Lucrezia pay Bianca and her father a visit . The Borgia 's are historical people , known for their wicked ways . Cesare sends Vicente out on a quest to find the lost limb of the Tree of Knowledge.The quest spans a decade and while Vicente is gone , Lucrezia drops in from time to time under the pretense of making sure Bianca is safe . She does n't like the girl , but is never malicious toward her until her brother , Cesare comes along and is aroused by Bianca 's beauty . Lucrezia is jealous of the attention Cesare gives to her and is bent on killing her.She employs Primavera 's grandson , a hunter , to take her out into the forest and kill her , bringing back her heart . The hunter takes her out to the forest and tells her to run away , which she does.This is the part where I get a little sketchy because somehow Bianca falls into a deep sleep that spans several years . While she is sleeping , dwarves look after her . The dwarves are not those that appear in the Disney cartoon , they are completely separate and odd creatures . They are not really aware of themselves as unique individuals until Bianca comes to them . They are stone shape-shifters , obviously not human . There 's nothing really interesting or endearing about the dwarves.When Bianca wakes up , there is an odd scene where her menstrual fluid comes out in one big spurt , as if it was being held back all those years . I 'm still not exactly sure what that is supposed to symbolize.Bianca is quick to & quot ; befriend & quot ; the dwarves , although that is n't really the correct terminology because they are not her friends . They name themselves for her with names like Heartless , Gimpy and MuteMuteMute . They speak of an eighth , their brother . He has followed Vicente on his journey . The goal was to get their mirror back . Yes , of course , the mirror that was found at the bottom of the lake belongs to the dwarves . They created it in order to study humans so that they , themselves , might become more human.Vicente comes back from his journey with the limb . The limb contained three apples . One was left in another place for safe keeping . When he comes back , he learns his daughter is dead and Primavera has lost her tongue . Although it never states why , it is evident that Lucrezia had it cut out so Primavera would n't speak the truth she knew about Bianca . Lucrezia takes one of the apples and offers a slice to the stone dwarf that is following Vicente . The creature eats the slice and then takes the rest of the apple when it is offered to him by Lucrezia.The dwarf then leaves and returns to his brothers . They all eat from the apple . It seems to make them more human . It makes them age and change like a human would.Lucrezia learns that Bianca is still alive from the gooseboy who saw her in the forest . The gooseboy is supposedly Lucrezia 's son , but that is another detail I missed the explanation for . Lucrezia becomes mad and tries several different ways to kill Bianca . She finally takes the last of the apples she was given and puts poison on one side of it . She gets Bianca to eat the apple by tasting from the non-poisoned side first.Bianca goes into another deep sleep lasting for years . The dwarves recapture their mirror and take the glass out to place over her coffin . Vicente stumbles upon her and just sits there for years before wandering off and dying . The gooseboy stumbles upon her and takes the glass off her coffin and asks to kiss her . The hunger , Primavera 's grandson , comes back and stops the gooseboy and takes the pleasure for himself , awaking Bianca.Meanwhile Lucrezia wants to be happy and will stop at nothing for it . She is obsessed with the apple and feels that if she could have only had more of it , she would be happy . She remembers the third apple Vicente spoke of and sets off to find it . When she gets there , she finds a man who is using the apple himself . He has it in place of his heart.The end - that 's it . The whole sordid tale does n't make much sense to me . The story is too hard to follow and no one seems to be motivated to act the way they 're acting . Things just happen for no good reason . Nothing is really explained very well.As mentioned before , this is a disappointment compared with Wicked . No magical world was created for me filled with wonder and emotion , friendships and excitement . Just a hard-to-follow story that is trying desperately to be exactly like , yet hardly familiar to the story of Snow White .	-1

I 've read all of Sister Roby 's books and I would be remiss to say this one was comparable to any of her previous work . This was utter trash . Apart from my personal opinions on interracial relationships , the book did n't flow well and I 've read creative writing stories by sixth graders that were better than this.The characters were weak , soap opera-ish and one-dimensional . I realize that sometimes fact is stranger than fiction , but come on ... Who in their right mind ( some of you know what I mean when I say `` right mind '' ) would run into the arms of a white man when their spouse has left them for a white person , goes to work everyday to be betrayed by white folks and then in the end is still pushed aside by said white man ? Every page seemed to be a PSA for the Rainbow Coalition as well as justification and rationalization . If you 're going to do it , at least do it well.Trash . Just trash .	-1
The Simmons I love is the one in Hyperion , Summer of Night , and The Terror . Stories with a good balance of good underlying ideas for the plot , exceptional character development , and phiolosophical themes . The stories in Worlds Enough have only one of them : philosophy . Lots and lots of it . There is so little else going on than one wonders why does n't Simmons just write a non fiction philosophical book and get it out of his system already . The last story in particular was so dull I could n't wait for it to end . The others were mostly Zen riddles , you know , the kind that leaves you scratching your head wonderig what the heck did you just read ? The only passable one was the story set in the Hyperion universe , which earns the few stars I am giving .	-1
Light and fluffy with no real content except discontent and the exercise of bad judgement . The first half of the book hints at the possibility of some deepness in the second half , but disappoints in that respect . The `` Afterward '' gives the appearance of the story being non-fiction , but unless the author is using a male pseudonym , that would be impossible.If you want to follow the meaningless lives of two sisters and wallow in the elder 's loneliness , peccadilloes , and bad judgements then this is a book for you . The older sister of the first half of the book has so much potential which is fully destroyed by the author in the second half .	-1
I just finished , & # 34 ; After I 'm Gone. & # 34 ; Though I did n't love it ( plodding , with needlessly quirky characters and occasionally numbing backstory ) I want to love Laura Lippmann , so I thought I would work my way forward through her stand-alone novels.Other reviewers have summarized the plot and explored the clues which go nowhere , the vast overpopulation of unnecessary and unlikable characters , and the disappointment of the end.I 'm left with a question . Did Cynthia and Warren adopt Alice 's baby ? If not , would n't the book have been a whole lot better if they had ?	-1
The hero is in his mid fourties , the heroine is 20 or 23 yrs old ( writer forgot what age , mentioned 2 different ages . I am not into old men going with young girls , reminds me too much of pedophilia . Hero is boring and straight laced and heroine is a tart , so are the other women . There is a difference between sexy and vulgar.I am not even finishing this book and will toss the other book I ordered from same writer . Instead try some of the Harlequin Historicals , their writers may not be as well known , but know how to write a story .	-1
Why do I feel that Eloisa James is trying to make historical romances seem like contemporaries ? Her female characters -- including the multiple heroines -- are promiscuous and utterly contemptuous of society 's mores.Esme , the willing widow type , has had multiple affairs during her arranged marriage to an older man . Adultery in a heroine is hard to swallow , but this sort of behavior was condoned as long as the parties involved were discreet.Ditto with Arabella , the aunt , a widow three times over . Okay , these two are not really heroine material , in my view , but they 're borderline acceptable.What is n't acceptable is the young , unattached Beatrice , ostensibly the primary heroine of the piece , who dresses and acts like a doxy because she was `` ruined '' and can never marry , so what other choice does she have ? This is a heroine ? ? ? Well , perhaps if she had some terrible secret in her past that made her that way , but simply being a precocious teenager does n't quite do it for me.Eloisa James has this annoying tendency of creating convincingly depraved characters and then insisting that they really are n't so bad after all . I did n't like it when she did it with Rees Godwin and his mistress ( that situation still makes me hot under the collar ) , and I do n't like it here . Bea is either a tart or she is not , and I fear that any young girl who goes around offering herself to gentlemen has to be a tart . At least in the 19th century.In the 21st century , society is more forgiving . But the ease in which these willing widows and demimondaine characters find their way into the upper echelons of 19th century society is simply not believable by anyone reasonably familiar with the period.I ca n't recommend this book to anyone . In fact , James ' last two books have been disappointments , and I wo n't even buy the one before that because of negative reviews and a likewise disappointing plot . Hopefully the tide will turn soon . . . .	-1
It took me 1 month to finish reading this book . It was a disappointment compared to his other novels . It 's a waste of money and time .	-1
I 'm sorry , I found this book a total bore . None of the characters were particularly remarkable or interesting -- although , my heart went out to little Charlie . I could n't figure out why Mr. Kimble married the first wife . Not much in it for him with that one except youth . And what was he doing while he spend so many hours away from home ? Was he truly engrossed in his business or was he with other women ? There are just too many people like him and too many dumb women in real life to make this book interesting . Nothing unique about it . If I had n't been stuck in the middle of nowhere with nothing else to read I would n't have read it . It makes the good books out there seem so much better .	-1
The authors here assert that they have discovered revealing new information about the Fischer Spassky match from declassified KGB files and the like . The reality is that this is simply a story retold with nothing of significance that I did not already know from memory and other sources . That does not make it a bad story for those who are not familiar with the match , but it does make it less than advertised for those who are . Even if some details were presented for the first time , I would not have much faith in their accuracy given the book 's plethora of factual errors . ( Palma de Mallorca is referred to as a `` walled city , a decisive game of less than 20 moves between GMs is said to be so rare as to be `` historic , '' etc . ) It is clear that the authors know little or nothing about chess , so chess players in particular can be safely warned away from this book . Not only are they more likely to be familiar with the book 's content , but they will also be more sensitive to the authors ' many mistakes and exaggerations .	-1
Any book that is so annoying I ca n't finish it does not deserve more than 1 star . Since I did n't have the `` Vietnam experience '' I can only review the book based on the story itself , so forgive me if my rating does not include it 's relevance to the Vietnam era .The beginning of the book was pretty good , despite some inconsistencies , and as I approached the middle of the book I planned to give it 3 stars . This first half of the book takes place in space , as our main character goes though boot camp , graduates , and goes on his first mission to fight the enemy aliens . Most of this is pretty good story-telling , though as a hard science fiction fan I was disturbed by a few `` common sense science '' issues:1 . The space army is made up of the `` best and brightest '' of earth ( everyone with a masters or doctorate in the sciences is automatically drafted ) . They go through rigorous training but we do n't see much in the way of military tactics being taught . That 's because once in actual combat they are given a post-hypnotic command that turns them into unthinking killing machines ( author 's description ) . Why do we draft the brightest minds of all humanity if all we 're going to do is say some magic words and turn them into mindless murdering zombies ? 2 . Boot camp is on a frigid , absolute-zero world , but our soldiers cope with that by using high-tech suits with insulation so perfect they need a heat exchanger to keep from dying of heat stroke . The environment is so dangerous that half the recruits will die during basic training , mostly from accidents where the hot heat-exchanger fins touch frozen helium and cause an explosion . Like me , you may wonder why none of these `` best and brightest '' people ever thought about using the perfect insulator material of the suit as a protective cage around the hot fins , or to use it on their boot soles to keep them from sliding on frozen lakes of helium that evaporates as soon as their foot touches it . Or why not leave a small area of the suit with a less-than-perfect insulator so you do n't need an air conditioner at all , or why not.. ( the list goes on ) .3 . Once we have a battle , the alien base is captured , and we have lots of other-worldly gadgets to play with , you might expect the `` best and brightest '' solders would be put to work trying to make sense of this new technology . This could be an interesting part of the story , but no , instead we bring in a never-before-mentioned team of `` scientists '' and the soldiers go back to the ship . I do n't expect much from the scientists , considering they can only be the `` second brightest '' people from earth ? The story really gets bad once our heroes make it back to earth , where , with relativity effects , about 30 years have passed since they left . This new earth is full of impossible economic and social situations , such as:1 . Unemployment is over 60 % , yet menial jobs pay so much money that a person can afford to live on a fraction of the actual wages . ( I say `` menial '' because it only takes a day to train a new person to take over your job and you split the salary with them , keeping half for doing nothing ) .2 . The United Nations controls all the jobs , and doles them out to only the poorest citizens . Yet with such absurdly high pay scales it is never explained how a previously-poor person keeps his job for very long , because after a year or two the person must be reasonably wealthy , and thus lose their job to a poorer person.3 . With the economy so bad and jobs in such high demand , you might think those controlling the jobs would be subject to bribery , but we 're told they are `` 100 % incorruptible '' . On the other hand , all you have to do is contact your local black-market job dealer at the corner bar and you can get a second-hand ( or third-hand ) job in no time , where you work someone else 's job for 1/2 , 1/4 or even 1/8 of the salary , which is enough to live on , so much so that you can afford to pay the black-market job dealer a portion of your 1/8 wages.4 . Crime is so bad that every non-criminal citizen must hire a personal bodyguard so they can survive the elevator ride to and from their apartment . Wait - I thought the UN controlled all jobs , so where do personal body guards come from ? And how does the 60 % of the population living on government subsidies pay for their bodyguards ? Is body-guard pay included in your government check ? 5 . Because the entire planet is in a constant state of starvation , criminals about to be sent to jail are shanghaied by farming communes for use as slave labor , but the commune keeps the criminal 's government food ration book and uses it to supplement their food supply . Really ? The government ca n't track the criminal fugitives by their ration books ? 6 . The farm communes are constantly being attacked by roving gangs of starving people , who steal the farm 's food and then `` escape into the forests '' . Forests ? Huh ? In an over-populated world where food is scarce we still have un-farmed forests for the hoodlums to hide in ? Why do n't they just cut down the trees and start their own farm ? At this point I was still reading , ( as I re-read this review I wonder why ) but when I came across this next gem I had to end the torture - The biggest fear of earth is that the alien war will end and wreck the economy . What ? The economy is not wrecked now ? And how could keeping the best brains of humanity on earth instead of killing them off on a distant planet wreck the economy ? How could using all our high-tech gadgets to improve living conditions at home be worse than sending our technology into space never to be seen again ? And how could keeping the GDP of a planet circulating though the economy cause economic turmoil ? This world created by the authors is so unbelievable that I simply could not continue reading the book . I am not such a critical reader that I ca n't overlook a few inconsistencies here and there , especially when they are minor distractions and not critical to the plot . But an entire world where every aspect of life defies logic and common sense is just too much for me .	-1
Naomi Wolf was a lovely young slip of a girl when she wrote this remarkably brainless book . The only reason people paid attention to this idiotic book was because Naomi was young and hot-looking . It drove Camille Paglia insane that Naomi was being treated like she knew anything about life . Naomi has done a lot of growing up since then , and I imagine she must be pretty humiliated that people are still reading this deeply awful book .	-1
I tried twice - kept thinking it must get better . But it did n't - not for me . I just could n't make myself finish it , and ALWAYS make myself finish books ! !	-1
I actually *bought* this in hardcover -- something I do n't usually do but I have very much enjoyed Stephenson 's earlier work ( including Interface & amp ; Cobweb under the name Stephen Bury ) and thought this would be worth the clams . It 's just not . I wish his editor had told him to slash 500 pages -- & quot ; just keep the 400 best , Neal & quot ; and then I would n't have had to sit through weird digressions that mean nothing to the plot or furniture really turn some people on . It was supposed to be a letter to Penthouse and that 's just what it read like . Yawn.I reacted very badly to his stereotypes about men and women ( he seems to be in the women-are-inscrutable-and-so-much-smarter-than-mere-men school of odd reverse sexism ) . In this world either you 're a wimpy new-age sexual disappointment or a Nip-killing caveman with enough pheromones to rend a catholic high school delirious.The story pops around from WWII to the present and there are interesting bits of actual factual content around Ultra and the German Enigma engine but I found myself wishing I was either reading a straight history of Ultra or a fictional novel about something else . There 's plenty of good stuff out there on WWII and it would make for more entertaining reading anyway.The underlying philosophy seems about as well thought out as the average Wired editorial - it may appeal to a bunch of socially inept webheads but to anyone who looks for something beyond drooling accounts of how much horsepower , RAM , Mips , penile inches etc . it 's kinda flat and thin . Basically technology is really cool and you can make a ton of money and get babes ( who of course are n't doing any of the actual technology ) doing cool things.The comparisons to Tom Clancy are certainly justified . I 've always thought poor Tom only had one good book in him ( Hunt For Red October ) and everything else was just the turgid right wing blather of someone who gets a hard on from watching military hardware . I thought Neal was better but he 'll probably sell a killzillion copies of this book and we 'll have to suffer through an endless parade of sequels . Just say no	-1
First we get the obvious out of the way ; Sean Hannity is a man with an agenda and , therefore can not see the difference between truth and whatever helps that agenda.We only have this writer 's unswerving loyalty to the Bush blunders in Iraq , his disregard of the lies Bush has told in order to get us into an unnecessary war and keep us there , and his willingness to blame others for the complete and absolute failure of `` conservative '' right wing policies to see that ANYTHING that he says or writes is suspect at best ... Now I will not claim that liberals do not themselves have an agenda , but I will compare its fruits with those advocated by the Sean Hannitys of this planet , and , for most , the comparison reveals some very obvious conclusions..School vouchers , which the right wing loves , are an excuse to divert public funds into private institutional hands ... It is also an attempt to get around a non-denominational education using public tax dollars ... If ANYONE wants a private school education they are welcome to it , AT THIER OWN EXPENSE , and not at mine ... As a taxpayer it is my obligation to contribute towards paying the costs of necessary public elements , the PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM being one of these.Any whining about how the poor somehow are being short-changed by not being able to send thier kids to private school at taxpayer expense seems hypocritical at best coming from this writer , especially as neither Hannity nor any of the other extremists he fits in with have any concern over getting the poor universal healthcare , better housing , or a higher wage..Private school education , however , is something conservatives DO want , FOR THEMSELVES , and what a nice touch it is couching thier empty blather in a bogus concern over the `` quality '' of the education recieved by the poor in our public schools ... Terrorism is , of course , a real threat ... but so is arrogance , greed , and unbridled corporate sponsored imperialism , all of which the conservative movement has in spades ... Making `` Terrorism '' the excuse for an american right wing effort to reshape the world is more than wrong , it is dangerous and criminal ... Hannity has shown himself a booster of the Bush agenda , which , considering all of the Bush lies about that war , either makes Hannity a fool or a willing co-conspirator in those lies ... Liberty , for the Hannity-types , is an ambiguous term..Libery , it seems means sifting through citizens mail secretly , torturing political prisoners secretly , trashing the constitution when its meaning is in conflict with what the right wing wants ... Liberty means bowing to christian fundamentalism..it means restricting rather than enlarging our freedoms ... it mean yearning for the good old days , when everyone '' knew his/her place '' and when bigotry , discrimanation and worse were the commonplace features of everyday life in the ideal conservative-oriented universe ... Liberty to Hannity and the other conservative thugs is not libery at all , but that is not what Hannity proclaims , either in his book or on the teevee ... Hannity 's book is trash ... it is worse than trash because it is not truthful , it is not accurate , and it is a blueprint for a society in which liberty will be replaced by goose-stepping and repression , some of which we are already experiencing under the Bush administration .	-1
Indeed this is the book Rush would have written had he not been so stoned on all those pain pills for the last how many years ? Which in fact is part of the problem here , this is cookie cutter right wing ranting could have been written by anyone who has bought the Fox News Kool Aid.Oddly missing for me in this book was any mention of the fact that Hannity 's allies on the right , people like Mr. Falwell who famously said we `` probably deserved '' 9/11 have a vision of America that is uncannily like that of the Taliban . Remember them ? I can assure you they had prayer in school , women knew their place and `` liberals '' were stoned with rocks not with handfulls of pills like Rush . But somehow the solution to fighting these theocratic fascists is to become uh theocratic fascists ourselves ... ? I 'm sorry but I just could n't make that leap ... how many pills was Rush on a day ? Sixty ? For me personally this was n't as amusing as Deliver Us from Evil , it lacked that books jolt of misanthropy this book reads more like a drooping comb over . So if you want your Hannity shrieks I do n't think this is your best value for money .	-1
Apologist , Propagandist , Lying Wimpy limp fisted crap , served up in a ham fisted sandwich like yesterdays news . Less interesting , less fun , less humour , less insight , less subtle , than the five o'clock follies , only less truthful . Less informative than a broken watch , Hannity is NEVER right . He 's just on the RIGHT , and like the rest of the Lemmings and that idiot Coulter , he 's headed over a cliff . Good Bye , Good Night , and Good riddenceJeff Gannon ( Reformed in Washington )	-1
First off , let me give credit where credit is due . The book is stylistically very good , lyrical , descriptive , and generally highfalutin ' . The characters and the situations she writes about are individually very interesting and absorbing . There 's crime , mystery , lesbians , and a host of other interesting albeit random things in Erdrich 's book.Now for the bad part- the disjointed nature of the book makes it painfully obvious that she took short stories and haphazardly stitched them together in order to market a novel . At the end , after all the connections between the characters and their actions had been revealed , and the initial joy of having finally understood what was going on passed , I was left feeling cold , empty , and unenthusiastic.In the end , this book has neither a cohesive plot nor theme , and no character is developed to the extent that it even qualifies as a novel .	-1
I have read many of Gaiman 's other books and liked them , a lot . Anansi Boys was a huge disappointment for me , twice . I tried to read it years ago and put it down due to lack of interest . Picked it back up and started over recently and got halfway through before I could n't take it anymore . Boring .	-1
Homes has a vivid imagination and outstanding writing skills . She 's in command of her storytelling technique . Her prose strikes all the right notes . She 's even good at characterization.Unfortunately , she 's a slave to literary fashion , specifically , boring , New Yorker-style catatonic realism . ( In fairness , perhaps to break the mold a little , Homes tosses in some self-consciously clever surrealistic bits here and there , but it does n't work . ) Homes gets accolades because she believes all the right things and expresses them in all the right ways -- but that 's not the sign of an intellectually rigorous writer.The women tend to be hyper-accomplished professionals , usually married to confused , weak men whom they have to dress and feed in the morning . This scenario got tired after the second story . By the fourth I began to feel like I was dealing with an ideologue.Of course , that 's the risk when you put together collections of stories from the last ten years . You start to see the writer 's tricks ... for example , several of her characters are obsessed with being prepared . They try to stock up on emergency supplies to plan for every conceivable occurrence . OK , good enough idea once . But two , three times ? Recommendation : If you like New Yorker-style fiction , you 'll really enjoy this . If you want ideas and characters explored in a little more depth , take a pass .	-1
I 've listened to Dr Laura for sometime as entertainment on long drives . She very often references this book , and many of her callers exclaim how the book saved their marriages . Out of curiosity , I bought the book ... .Well , the book is n't as interesting as her XM Radio show . Preachy , yammering , patronizing , and condescending . I did n't hate it , but I did n't like it either . Then again , I could only stand to read about 1/5 of the book -- I kept waiting for something redeeming -- but could n't read anymore . Why ? It was depressing . The examples she uses are & # 34 ; no duh & # 34 ; examples.Maybe I did n't like it because I already take good care of my husband . Maybe I did n't like it because of the tone . Maybe I did n't like it because it highlighted how awful some marriages are . But most of all , I felt like I was listening to her radio show ... Come to think of it , when people call in to say that they read the book and it helped them , I do n't think most had been listening to the radio show for any length of time . If you listen to the radio , then you do n't need to read this book . If you do n't listen to her show , then maybe this book is good for you .	-1
Schlessinger spends much of this book belittling women and explaining away all the shortcomings of men . For example , if a man is philandering , you can bet his inattentive wife is to blame . I found her overall tone to be disturbingly anti-woman and felt bad for having read it at all .	-1
Before you purchase this book consider this . On the Sean Hannity radio talk show , Goldberg said FOXNEWS is NOT biased , unlike the other major networks that are . If you think that is a credible statement , I 'm sure you 'll think his book is credible .	-1
I keep trying but can not get interested in the stories by this author . They seem to drag out with her style of `` he said/she said '' writing with nothing exciting , except perhaps one part in this book . The story begins as the famous Lt. Bak is asked by his commander Thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named Minnakht . His guide , Senna tells Bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea . The land is hostile and murder and death come as Lt. Bak questions each man over and over . The ending was not exciting or unexpected . Lt. Bak 's constant referrals to the donkeys ( we know how he is sympathetic to animals , this big strong medjay ! ! I had to make myself sit and finish it .	-1
I love Kathleen Tessaro and I have bought every single one of her books . This was my least favorite . To be honest I am not sure if this was her first book as a writer , but I hope so . It felt slightly & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; if you know what I mean . As if she had an idea and started writing and no one ever told her that it needed work . Love her , love her writing normally . Do n't love this book .	-1
I ca n't believe this book got 4 stars . It has gross drug and sex scenes . A main character is not innocent she is just stupid . She spends the whole book wondering why her life is miserable . You wait the whole book thinking she is going to wise up and she never does . Of course in the end a man falls in love with her for some reason that is never revealed to the reader and rescues her . Usually I resell my books , but I do n't want to inflict this one on others . It is going in the trash .	-1
I was really glad that after reading & quot ; Elegance & quot ; by Kathleen Tessaro that I did n't pay for it . I really had high hopes for this book . It looked like that it was going to be good book , but the truth is that it was not a good book . Louise Canova is a American living in London married to an English actor . At thirty-two she acts like at lease fifteen years older . Until she finds a book called & quot ; Elegance & quot ; by Madame Dariaux in a second hand shop . This small book leads Louise to make some major changes in her life.This is really not that good . The author left major wholes the story that just did n't sense to me . I kept hoping that Ms. Tessaro would fill in the holes , but she didn't.The reason that I gave & quot ; Elegance & quot ; two stars is because of the work of Madame Dariaux , who 's book will be selling on Amazon.com in August .	-1
I 'm a great Elizabeth George fan . She is one of a small number of writers whose works I buy in hardbound.But I 'm afraid she 's no short story writer.The collection gets off to a bad start with `` Exposure , '' which ought to be interesting to George fans because of the presence of detective Thomas Lynley . But the story is a mess . I do n't understand the perpetrator 's motive . The `` puzzle '' aspect is poorly presented -- we 're not really given enough of a clue to solve the puzzle ourselves . The perpetrator actually commits two crimes -- and I do n't believe that the methods used to commit either crime would have worked in real life.Three of the the stories feature `` O. Henry endings , '' none of which , in my opinion , quite come off.The title story , `` I , Richard '' intertwines a sort of pseudo-mystery story concerning the truth about Richard III and the Princes in the Tower , with a modern-day murder story . Unfortunately , to someone who is n't a `` Ricardian , '' the Richard III part is muddled and boring -- and the framing murder mystery is unbelievable , except for the ending -- which is all too predictable.Similar motifs recur in several of the stories -- giving a slightly stale or repetitious flavor to the collection.Perhaps the best is `` Good Fences Are n't Always Enough , '' which comes close to being sad and touching . But all of them , even this one , read more like extended jokes than like real stories . The characters in them are paper cutouts . The author 's attitude toward her characters is remote and almost contemptuous . She never seems involved with them , nor do we . The stories succeed neither as slices of life nor as clever little clockwork gadgets.And , incidentally , the book is a rather poor value . There are only five stories in it . It 's thin , the type is large , and the lines are widely spaced . By my estimate , it contains roughly about 70,000 words ( for [ money amount ] ) or about one-fifth as many as `` A Traitor to Memory '' ( [ money amount ] ) . Distinctly short measure , to my way of thinking .	-1
Bob Dylan would be one of the most difficult subjects for a biography you could think of . His enigmatic statements and constant reinvention make him hard to pin down - not to mention the way he protects his privacy , giving few revealing interviews . Heylin attempts to make up for this by describing lots of often irrelevant details but never succeeds in giving you a sense of the man or his music . Heylin declines to make his own analysis of Dylan 's music , perhaps feeling too scared he would make a fool of himself if he did . After a while it just becomes boring . Oh and what a terrible title .	-1
This book is a sequel ( middle book in a trilogy ) to TO MARRY THE DUKE . The first book was entertaining , not great literature , not historically accurate , not populated by well-defined or believable characters -- just entertaining . This book is an embarrassment . The hero is a self-pitying , embittered , and arrogant boor with one or two redeeming qualities . The heroine is irritating , impulsive , spoiled , self-centered , and totally lacking in common sense ( among other things ) . The author describes her as charming , refreshing , and witty . The two characters fall in lust-at-first-site ( ca n't imagine why ) and the whole book flows from there . It is supposed to be set in Regency England , but could have been set in 21st Century Manhattan without changing the characters ( just their wardrobes ) . There is a possibility , I suppose , that the book got better after page 195 . But , by that time , I figured I had punished myself sufficiently for having spent the $ 6.00 .	-1
Like several of the other one-star reviewers , I 've been reading this series out of habit . I also confess to an interest in seeing how the character of Julian turns out . I do n't always like Marla , but I enjoy her weight and her wealth as something different among the genre 's usual sidekicks.I am thoroughly sick of Goldy Bear Schulz , though . Davidson lost me a few books back in the installment in which Goldy suspects her husband of infidelity and then proceeds to be unfaithful to HIM ( though not sexually ) in truly spectacular ways , lying , sneaking , committing felonies of her own , and finally getting someone killed because she impersonated a police officer -- without Davidson seeming to have any personal moral awareness of her character 's horrific conduct.Goldy 's just as criminal and neurotic in this episode . She steals a car , with no thought of how this will reflect on her husband if she 's caught . She 's still freaky about her 15-year-old son , overreacting to his every mood , nagging and brooding and generally carrying on as if he were a toddler instead of three years from emancipation . In the first few pages of the book , she cleans up a crime scene while the police are on the way , removing all evidence of the attack for which she called them ! Goldy continues to be abusive to the people she supposedly loves by endlessly lying to them about all things , large and small , and recklessly embarrassing them . A lot of the lying is simply childish . Example : ' `` I 'm fine , '' I declared , although in truth , I ached from what was now the third bust-up I 'd had that day . Which had been worse , crashing [ someone 's ] car , rolling to the creek bank , or being assaulted at a ski area ? 'All three of these were depicted as creating potentially life-threatening head injuries , but Goldy lies to her doctor ( ! ! ! ! ) as well as her family and slogs on . Is this supposed to make us think she 's brave ? Admirable ? No , she 's a moron.And obviously I am too , because I 'll probably read new installments just to see how Julian 's character turns out , but I 'm smart enough to get them from the library.Ms . Davidson , PLEASE allow Goldy to grow up . She 's worse than a teenager right now . And her desperate , degrading sucking up to clients along with melodramatic nervousness about whether they 'll like her work is something out of a bad 1950 's sitcom . Evolve past it , please . She can be interesting without being a flake . You can depict the compromises service professionals have to make with unreasonable demands without turning Goldy into a complete lickspittle.She should stand up for herself with dignity , not histrionic hysterics . She should treat her husband with respect and honesty , as if she took him seriously as a person instead of a caricature of Desi Arnaz : `` LuuuuuUUUUUCY ! ! '' He 's her husband , not her warder . And for heaven 's sake , moderate her obsession about with her son ! It 's getting really creepy ! Apologies for any hurt feelings ; after all , these books sell very well and this is just one person 's opinion .	-1
I no longer CARED who-done-it , I just wanted it to be over . I sometimes think successful authors publish really mediocre books either a ) because they 're under pressure to come up with a book and they just do n't have it in them to write it , or b ) they 're so successful that they can get away with things the publisher/editor would not allow a less successful writer to get away with.This book seemed self-indulgent -- not edited by an objective editor . It was way too long , all other issues aside . I heard way too much about wonderful Goldy and her wonderful family in her wonderful town cooking wonderful meals and solving mysteries that stump the police , and way too little about the actual mystery.I got really tired hearing about Goldy 's wonderful but mouthy son Arch , and even found myself wishing that he and his two buddies were upstairs cooking an illegal substance instead of cleaning his room ( we hear about that activity throughout the book ) -- it would have livened the book up . I also fantasized Goldy discovering that her husband is having an affair -- anything to make this book less of Goldy's-wonderful-life and more dramatic.Arch wanting to go snowboarding and what the place he snowboarded was like should not have been repeated over and over again . And it 's not just that snowboarding stuff that got repeated several times . The author regularly summarized the same material over and over again . I could n't decide if she was getting paid by the word and had to pad the book ( to pay the mortgage ? ) , or really thought the reader was too dumb to follow along without frequent repetition . Or maybe the book was meant to be published as a serial in a magazine ? Because from time to time , there was the kind of summing up that allows readers who have n't read any of the previous chapters to follow along anyway.I love mysteries , and I love cozies , but this one should never have been published . I rarely write a review that gives a book less than 3 stars , but I had to make an exception on this one . In fact , I wish I could get back the money I spent on the book -- should n't books come with guarantees or your money back ? I have n't read any other in the series by this author , but this one discourages me from wanting to reading earlier books about Goldy , since by page 400 or so -- it 's quite a long book for a cozy mystery -- I was bored silly hearing about Goldy and her world . I get the idea , however , that her earlier books was much better , so I may eventually give one of them a try .	-1
I am the absolute last person to suggest book burning , but if I did this thing would be high on the list.Mr Zinn has built an argument for his idea of socialism by cherry picking facts and quotes . Almost all of his sources are secondary , written by known Marxians . These secondary sources then support a wildly fantastic tower of suppositions that eventually become laughable . For example , the Civil War was part of the international proletarian struggle.I should say & # 34 ; would become laughable & # 34 ; because this piece of shoddy , biased & # 34 ; scholarship & # 34 ; is being assigned to college students as a legitimate history of our country .	-1
Why should it cost $ 3.89 more to get the e-book as to the paperback ? Will pass on anything that is overpriced !	-1
If you want to read a good book about leaving the Amish , sadly , this is not the one . Read `` Growing Up Amish ; A Memoir '' by Ira Wagler . Read `` Prophet 's Prey '' by Sam Brower . ( Also not great , but certainly better than this . ) Best of all , read `` Under the Banner of Heaven '' by Jon Krakauer . It is a great book that also happens to have a great title . Well researched and fascinating . This , however , is neither . This is simply a story chockful of Bible passages and letters from the family begging Ruth to come back which all sound the same after awhile taking up a lot of space , and a thin story line tieing it together . Sorry , but I found the idea of a young Amish girl taking up with a much older , 450-pound man less than desirable and even kind of creepy.If you listen closely , you can hear the whisper `` I sold my story for the money '' behind this one .	-1
I got this book with 3 others for my 18 month old son for potty training . This is not at all helpful with potty training . And is not a good choice for a 18 month old . It has a lot of small flats to revile images on the page which my son loves to grab and rip off . If you are looking for potty training books you are better off with `` Potty '' ( by Leslie Patricelli board books ) .	-1
Another dark book supposedly for children . The first several pages , and a plot summary I read elsewhere - that 's as far as I got with this book . It was enough to tell me this book is not for me . I wo n't encourage my kids to read it either.After beginning a book with a bloody knife and a family murdered , and a toddler whose whole family was just killed now also imperiled with murder , there is nothing that can happen later that will redeem the book . It 's not for kids . Period . And why would any adult want to read it either ? What was the Newbery commitee thinking ? One can only imagine how many good books they passed over to give their award to this one . I give it two stars instead of one because it appears to be well-written and creative . But a horrible story artfully told is still a horrible story .	-1
I once read a review that said this was Joyce 's most controversial novel to date . So , I gave it a shot . I 'd read one short story by her that I really liked . However , this novel was practicaly unreadable . I mean ... there were english words and sentences , but it was very cumbersome for some reason . I did n't think the writing was tight at all . So , I did n't finish it . I think the only thing controversial about it was how boring it was .	-1
Really enjoyed this book . Here 's one star from backwards retarded Florida . The chads for the other stars I gave you must still be hanging on the ballot . Perhaps you 'll get a recount .	-1
I was disappointed with this last book for a number of reasons.First , I found Gregory to be without direction , as the other Bridgerton brothers ( i.e. , Anthony-Viscount ; Benedict-Painter ; Colin-Writer ) . Gregory just did n't seem to `` do '' anything.Second , I was frustrated that Violet , and the other Bridgerton siblings did not appear very often in the story . They were quite prevalent in most of the other books ( not , however , When He Was Wicked , which I also found lacking ) , and I felt that they were only mentioned to remind us that Gregory comes from a large family.Third , the heroine was not believable . I understand that the true love interest is supposed to be beautiful beyond compare , especially in the eyes of our hero , however , I felt she was just the `` runner up '' with a great personality.Lastly , has anyone noticed how many times a word is emphasized in italics per page ? I counted no less than three to four per page throughout the story . It becomes very annoying when trying to read a descriptive piece and everything seems so `` over the top '' .Julia , I look forward to your next book , however , let 's shorten the series and PLEASE , PLEASE , PLEASE leave the italics alone !	-1
As a work of history , `` 1421 '' simply does not suffice . Gavin Menzies creates an intriguing tale , but his methods leave the reader waiting for additional evidence as well as the opposing viewpoint before making up their mind . The book appears to be written from the perspective of someone who has created a theory and is trying to prove it , instead of being written from the perspective of an impartial historian trying to find out what the true story is . To be fair , Mr. Menzies does state in his Acknowledgements that `` this is a book for the general reader , not the academic '' , and he does offer to make his notes available as well as provide an internet site with more information.Mr . Menzies through the course of telling his story bombards the reader with a lot of circumstantial evidence in such a way as to make his conclusions look like the only possible explanation . However , there are times when he makes statements which are incorrect which leave the reader wondering about the other evidence he presents . For example , he repeatedly states that the Chinese discovered America before the Europeans , and had colonies in America before the Europeans as well . However , even if he is completely correct about the stories of the Chinese fleets , the events would still be hundreds of years after the Vikings first came to North America and had a colony there . Some speculate that the Irish may have been in North America even earlier than the Vikings.Some of Mr. Menzies evidence does n't seem to add up either . For example when talking about the Piri Reis map , he mentions that `` the ice depicted on the Piri Reis map corresponds with the normal maximum limits of drift and pack ice in midsummer '' , referring to the Antarctic . Later , in an effort to explain differences in another map , he states `` Sea levels in 1421 were lower than they are today . Global warming has caused the south polar ice to melt , causing sea levels to rise slowly but inexorably . '' If the second statement were true , then we would not expect the region around Antarctica to be depicted as having the normal maximum limits of drift , but instead to have considerably more ice . To make matters worse , he supports the idea of the Chinese circumnavigating Greenland with the statement : `` Greenland was far warmer than it is today . In 1421 it would have been a country of green pastures where cattle grazed in the open ... '' If that is true , then runoff from Greenland and North America ( and probably from Scandinavia and Russia as well ) would serve to raise water levels and counteract some of the effects of more ice in the Antarctic region ( if indeed there were more ) . Thus , it is difficult to imagine a world climate that would completely support his theory of Chinese exploration.Another thing which is puzzling is why the Chinese did n't visit Europe in their attempt to map the entire world and to create trade . Mr. Menzies never offers much of an explanation as to why they covered the entire world outside of the one continent whose civilizations would have recorded their visit . Of course this is n't proof that things did n't happen as Mr. Menzies claims , but it is a mystery left to be solved if the rest of the story is true.This book is very entertaining , and it is a good story . However , it can not be taken as the final word on this subject , nor can it even serve as a solid historical document . If this story is true , then this is merely the tip of the iceberg . If it is not true , then this is just a collection of evidence used in a misleading way to support a false theory . Additional historical documents and scientific testing of the evidence may eventually determine the veracity of this theory . Because of the contradictions and mistakes , and the resulting weakness of the evidence , I can only give this book two stars . As far as the writing goes it is very readable and would fall between three and four stars if that were the only criteria .	-1
As engaging as this book is , Menzies hangs his theories on the thinnest of threads . He is not the only one to put forward the argument that the Chinese reached American soil long before Columbus . Paul Chiasson puts forward a similar argument inThe Island of Seven Cities : Where the Chinese Settled When They Discovered America . However , Menzies takes it a step further , saying the remarkable voyages of Zheng He circumnavigated the globe and reached the Carribean as well . But , by a malicious turn of history all these marvelous records were banished by a vengeful emperor . At times , I thought I was reading The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen.By most historic accounts , the exploration voyages of Zheng He took in a remarkable portion of the globe , that reached all the way to Africa , but stretching these voyages out the way Menzies has defies all conventional accounts , as it would have been impossible to take in a voyage as extensive as Menzies would like us to believe within a span of two years . The ships were huge and the flotillas large , but probably not as large as Menzies would have us believe . It is very difficult to fathom junks 450 feet in length when the average ship of the time was 75 feet in length . My guess is that the Chinese measurements were improperly transcribed into English measurements , as most historic accounts place the Chinese treasure ships between 150 feet and 275 feet length , still much larger than the Portuguese caravels or any other ships of the era.Of course , you can choose to believe Menzies or not . There seems to be a growing consensus view that the Chinese did indeed reach the West Coast of America . Daniel J. Boorstin thought it possible inThe Discoverers , but put forward the more probable hypothesis that some ship or ships got separated from these large flotillas and happened upon the Pacific Northwest . Unfortunately , Menzies chose to take a less structured approach to his narrative , putting forward a number of hypotheses and suppositions in the form of a history , with very little corroborating proof .	-1
There has been a vogue in recent years for books devoted to the events of one year - for example , 1066 and 1415 ; and some of these are very good . This book is not one of those : it is not a detailed account of events , but an overly long exposition of the author 's far-fetched pet theory that the Chinese circumnavigated the globe in 1421 , a century before Magellan 's well-attested voyage . By the way , they did it in outsize junks.You might think that , if the Chinese had done this , we would have heard about it before now ; but the lack of hard evidence does not appear to trouble Mr Menzies . He is content to rely on ( 1 ) A Chinese account that a fleet set off to circumnavigate ; ( 2 ) dubious archaeological and anthropological evidence in several Continents , which appear to suggest that strangers turned up there around the years 1421-3 , and some of them stayed on ; and ( 3 ) his gut feeling , as an ex-submariner , that such a voyage would have been possible.None of this evidence stands up to scrutiny for a moment ; but it satisfies Menzies , who rather takes pride in the fact that he is not a historian , but a sailor , and can therefore see things that mere landlubbers can not ; but one has to ask how much experience as a submariner is worth when it comes to understanding a 500-foot fifteenth century Chinese junk , or for that matter the law of probability.This book is not really history at all . It is travel-writing , disguised as history . It is also a demonstration of the fact that , in the modern world , it is not necessary for a book to have any merit , for it to become a bestseller.Stephen Cooper	-1
I think my expectations got in the way of my enjoying this book . Jenna Jameson is the ultimate adult actress , and she is also the consumate business woman . In addition to her looks , she is intelligent , otherwise she would not have risen to the top of the adult industry . So I had hoped to read about how she conquered the industry and rose to the top . There is some of that , to be sure , but the lion 's share of the book is how she bounced from one bad relationship to another , always self-destructing and falling back in to some sort of addiction . I expected some of that , but it 's pretty much the entire book . I actually ended up feeling really bad for her , even at the end with her new found happiness and new husband and all her success . ( Knowing that the second marriage she wrote so fondly of at the end of the book ended in divorce after publication did n't help much , either ) .On the bright side , there are a lot of extras in the book that I did n't expect , such as the cartoons and the diary entries . There are also a lot of photographs which certainly add to the overall value of the book.After reading Christy Canyon 's book and Ron Jeremy 's book , I guess I expected something a bit more positive . Canyon and Jeremy put a human side on pornography , and I expected the same out of Jameson . But after the drugs and bad relationships , there was n't much time for that .	-1

The crude obscene language which the women use , both in direct quote and in relating what they will do , was bothersome to me . I can not respect a woman who stoops to such gutter language . I was also annoyed by the apparent approval we were expected to give to the central character 's belief that her cloistered twin sister was & quot ; throwing her life away. & quot ; The scenario is pretty incredible , and the out of wack reaction Mary has when she gets mad seemed so stupid for a smart lawyer , and made me wonder how smart she could really be . I have no intention to read anything more by this author .	-1
This book could have been writen in half the pages . Way too much about family things that were so uninteresting and had nothing to do with the story . If I could have given it a zero , I would of .	-1
I agree that this book features two of the most immature characters that I 've read . Eleanor Griffin , who is tired of being protected by her big brother , Sebastian , spends the entire story proving him right that she needed to be watched because she is not a grown up . Her method of seeking her `` freedom '' is well , dumb . Valentine , the rake , has `` issues '' but why would he even be intersted is such a silly girl ? I started skimming this book after a while . Do n't waste you time ! !	-1
While reading this , I found myself wondering -- is this how the North Koreans teach their children to hate Americans ? Do they have their children read political propaganda at an early age to indoctrinate them into a particular ideology ? That 's what this book is -- a well disguised indoctrination into the Republican party/Conservative movement.If you want to raise children who think for themselves , steer clear of political propagandists .	-1
For a TV entertainer that spends most of his airtime belittling his guests , outright lying on his program ; then denying such comments even when presented with video evidence , and using the word 'nazi ' more than most WWII veterans ever did , this is not the type of fellow you want to be around , let alone expose to your children.And , you certainly do n't want him educating them ; ( a ) for the above-noted reasons , and ( b ) there 's nothing in this book ( other than the usual 'Bill-speak ' - pinhead , etc - they wo n't be taught in school.A blatent attempt at money spinning by the author .	-1
This is the last book written by George that I will buy . I bought , read and enjoyed all her earlier titles . Her choice for whom to kill off and the effects on Lynley and Havers indicate to me that she is trying to end/kill off the series . Otherwise , why would she make such a cruel decision ? Her rightful choices as a writer for this title prompt me to use my rightful choice as reader to write her off .	-1
Another good author pandering to the sick and twisted minds who crave this sort of graphic description of horrible people doing horrible things . Just watching the news and reading the newspapers now is enough to make us despair of what the human race is becoming . I do n't want to read fiction about it . Please , Ms George , go back to your tried and true formula of stories about murders solved by likeable people whose own stories are interesting .	-1
I absolutely loathed this book by one of my favourite authors . We all know that there is an underworld which is inhabited by lawless , immoral low lives , but I for one , do n't need to read about it as a source of enjoyment . The book is based around the lives of the family of the eventual killer of Helen Lynley and his terrible childhood . Yes , poverty , misery and crime exist but I do n't derive any pleasure from reading and wallowing in it when I could be reading an exciting , uplifting book about decent people , rather than knowing all the details of depraved , amoral garbage who have fewer fine feelings than an amoeba !	-1
This is possibly the worst book I have ever read . It hard to read ; it is depressing and the ending makes you wish you had not wasted the time it took to read it.What Came Before He Shot Her	-1
I 've read all of the Inspector Lynley series & thought this one ( which is NOT Lynley & Havers ) might give some insight as to why Ms. George wanted to have Helen Lynley murdered . However , the book is extremely dreary , the characters are poorlly drawn & have no redeeming qualities whatsoever . I felt no connection with them & did n't care what might or might not ahppen to them , so after about 100 pages I gave up & returned the book to the library . What a disappointment - I would give this one minsur 5 stgars if I could . Do n't waste your time on it .	-1

I was in love with Wicked and Son of a Witch so when I heard that A Lion Among Men was coming out I was so excited . I impatiently waited for it to arrive in the mail and then started reading it as soon as it arrived . I found that I could n't get through 20 or 30 pages without being bored . I just never was able to get into the book . I made it through maybe half of it before I gave up and it has been sitting on the book shelf collecting dust since . The lion was not one of my favorite characters in any of the books so maybe I should have seen my dissapointment coming . My advice is that the book is lame and you should n't waste your money on it .	-1
To start off , I have to say that I enjoyed reading `` Wicked , '' and have waded through all of Maguire 's work with varying degrees of interest . As for `` Son of a Witch , '' I stopped reading after 72 pages - it is horrible . Maguire is increasingly and pointlessly genital-centric in his novels , which becomes both frustrating and antagonizing after just the first few scenes . While I certainly have no problem with sex and sexuality in fiction and literature , Maguire is simply absurd . Freud would have had a field day with him - I just could n't make myself turn another page .	-1

I purchased this book based on the all the reviews listed on Amazon . Are these reviews from independent readers or are these people affiliated with this author ? I found this book to lack substance and does not provide pick up techniques i was expecting . If you like to read about a group of PUA 'S and their shallow private life style then buy this book . The author has no in depth study on female psychology or any academic credentials . He is one of many PUA 'S trying to explain techniques and make a buck . It was absolutely disappointing and a waste of time .	-1
My son wanted this book and from the reviews it looked ok enough , like the movie Hitch , which was very good , but it was in no comparison like Hitch . As I looked into and preread the book to protect my son , who is 16 , I realized this is not a book I would recommend . From what I saw the lives the men lead in this book had no morals and were going in and out of bars , going out with strippers and going to bed with them . It was not graphic but the lifestyle was nothing I would want my son to ever live even as an adult . I say all this in warning . Plus my 20 yr old daughter read the book and said she disagreed with the book and said ... '' men just need to be themselves '' . She can see through men like that and wants nothing to do with them . She said she wants to know what a guy is like right from the start . No lines . So she too rated this poorly . My husband looked over the book and he too felt it was not a book to teach young men how to get a girl . PBS did studies of men and women getting together and found that the Secret Society of Pickup Artists are not doing any better than any other type of person . We say pass on this book and just be yourself .	-1
The publisher/author have done a terrible job on the design of this book . With a faux leather cover and gold page edges , it looks like a bible or something . But it has pictures of nude women on the front cover.The book looks so hokey , it is guaranteed I can not read it in a public place without being considered some kind of pervert or something.Thanks a lot . Not .	-1
Ewan Lochlain returns to his home town of Fairy Cove to uncover the truth surrounding his parent 's deaths in a boating accident 21 years earlier , leaving him and his sister at the hands of their evil aunt Angela , who had an obsession for Ewan 's dad.Cyd ( aka Molly Claire ) is the daughter of the town slut . She has nightmares stemming back to an incident when she was six . It does n't take a rocket scientist to guess what that incident involved . Now grown up , she is only interested in making money , with a cash register for a heart.This is yet another bad boy returns to his hometown to rescue the over-30 virginal damsel in distress who saved herself for him , only to not realize it at the time . And the dialog is so grating . Her refers to her constantly as `` darling mine '' and `` dear heart '' ... what is this , 1876 ? No contemporary guy under 60 would talk like that.The plot , while interesting , is not well drawn out . There is really nothing likable about Cyd to attract the lust of Ewan . She is rude and just annoying - not sure what he sees in her , particularly since she constantly refers to him as an idiot . I found all their interactions to be annoying - her constant harping on him selling his land was so redundant . I was kind of hoping someone would the darned bogey man get her and put us out of our misery . The ending was clich & eacute ; d and abrupt , trying to hard too wrap things up.The more interesting romance ( by far ) involved Ewan 's sister and his best friend , Sean . Unfortunately , no real storyline was devoted to the much more appealing pair .	-1
I have read several of Gaiman 's other works , including Anansi Boys , and enjoyed them very much ( though less so with Anansi Boys than with others like Stardust and The Graveyard Book ) . This did n't achieve the same wonder and emotion from me that I felt in his other works . It lacked a lot of the complexity that I usually enjoy in his stories . It was difficult to read ; sometimes I felt impatient , just wanting the book to be over so I could go read something else . I never felt connected to any of the characters . I kept waiting for the magic I expected , but ultimately I did n't like this book . As a Gaiman fan , it 's nice to see more work from a beloved author , but I certainly would n't recommend this to anyone .	-1
I found this story to be quite boring for a while . To sum it up , I did n't really get interested until about the 500th page and then it was over 50 pages later , along with a drawn out resolution to cover all the other loose ends from all the other subplots , which I did n't really care about by then.The writing was good . I just needed something more to keep me interested and after the first couple hundred pages I felt I was reading only to just get the book over with so I can start on another book .	-1
I could not finish this book . I got just over 200 pages into it and I threw it into the same box I threw Knights of the Burning Blade . The story did not go anywhere in those first 200 pages . I just kept hearing `` A storm is coming . '' Any hint as to what this storm is ? You would think a book like this would be right up my alley . I mean a multitude of gods from different pantheons , an epic battle between old gods and new , some sexy parts thrown in ... I brought this book to work so I would have more time to read it . Nothing profound happened . This book shows gods doing nothing but mundane every day stuff.I guess the point of this book is that America is getting to much into technology and getting away from older beliefs . I think if you travel to other countries you will find that the United States you will find that we are not the only ones that sacrifice a lot of time to television and invest in shopping malls.I have nothing against book that have something to say . But if you are going to be standing on a soap box for almost 600 pages , at least entertain me .	-1
This novel concerns a battle between the old gods of the old country , mainly from Norse mythology , and the new gods of internet , credit cards , and television . They are getting ready for a showdown , a battle to end the battles . In America , the old gods are dying and the new gods are taking over . Mr Wednesday ( Wotan ) enlists former convict Shadow to help him through the battle . Shadow does n't quite know what he is getting into , but goes along since his wife died with his best friend in a car accident before he was released from prison.There are some asides in this book , short stories in their own right , philosophical meanderings about the death of the old gods and what this means . Ultimately , we are told that the individualistic streak in Americans , where everyone can pick and choose their own philosophy and creed , is what is causing the death of the old gods.There are many different directions to go with this . The idea of this novel are brilliant , and the meticulous research is obvious . Mr Gaiman did his homework here . But the problems are manifold . The ideas may be great , but Mr Gaiman does n't go anywhere with them . The characters are very flat , and Shadow , as the lead , is about as dull as it gets ; almost as if Mr Gaiman had decided on casting a literary Keanu Reeves for the part.The second major problem with the book is Mr Gaiman ` s prose . As flat and uninteresting as the characters he draws , the style has the pretensions of being literary but does n't come anywhere close . ( See The Club Dumas , which has excellent style and a great story but was completely ignored by the fantasy community , and The Horned Man by James Lasdun , which will likewise be ignored . ) His constant references to other writers and titles is forced and extremely annoying . It is far too self-conscious , a literary game of `` look at me ! I know who these writers are ! '' ( An aside here ; this type of thing seems to belong the fantasy , science fiction and horror genre more than anywhere else . ) Mr Gaiman often uses his characters as mere mouthpieces for his holier-than-thou proselytizing , a device straight out of Heinlein . Mr Gaiman seems to want to be a literary writer and a great storyteller . Mainstream popular writers often feel that this is impossible , but the market is rife with novels that have tremendous style , timeless stories , and authors who do not put their egos in the reader 's way . Mr Gaiman seems to be a good story-telling writer ( but not much in this book ) but not a literary writer .	-1
I thoroughly enjoyed Anansi Boys and Neverwhere , so I was really looking forward to American Gods because I knew so many people that looooved this book . When I finished the first chapter , I was sure I 'd be one of them . But by the time I got halfway through , I felt like I was still trying to figure out where the story was going . There were too many scenes that did n't seem all that relevant to the plot . This one just did n't grab me like his others.I know many people value a strong literary voice ; I 'm not one of them . Gaiman really seemed to capture a nice balance between the literary arts and the pace of unfolding a plot with Anansi Boys and Neverwhere , but I felt American Gods tipped over on the literary side this time .	-1
`` The problem comes when the church is so conformed to the values of the world that it offers no real alternative to the ruling societal values '' ( p 65 ) . So true - but this author does n't have a clue as to who the real `` conformists '' are.He says a `` revival '' is taking place among American Christians , a revival his books have helped bring about . By his definition , `` revival '' means `` Christians support the political Left . '' The only purpose a person 's `` conversion '' or `` renewal of faith '' serves is to make that person a liberal activist . `` Two of the great hungers in our world today are the hunger for spirituality and the hunger for social justice '' ( p 12 ) , but for him that amounts to just one hunger , since the `` spirituality '' only exists to create activists for `` justice '' as the left defines it.The author is not modest . He seems downright giddy that his books are helping turn young evangelicals into political radicals , although the truth is the shift of evangelicals to the Left is a result of living in a culture tilting way Left . He credits his 2008 book God 's Politics with opening up `` a new conversation about faith , values , and politics in America '' ( p 33 ) , when the real influence was a culture that constantly mocks conservatism.On page 49 he admits he counts many secular people as `` close allies , '' while reserving his contempt for evangelicals - except for the ones tilting Left . On the same page , he makes it clear that any Democrat who speaks publicly about his faith is a good guy , while any Republican who does the same is bad . He ca n't conceive of a conservative Republican who fits his very narrow definition of `` Christian . `` The main purpose of faith is `` to transform the world here and now '' ( p 54 ) . This can only be done through political activism . For the liberal , `` love thy neighbor '' is never applied to one-on-one situations , but to whichever `` victim '' group is agitating the loudest . On p 56 he says that the sayings of Jesus such as `` love your enemies '' and `` blessed are the peacemakers '' are commands for political involvement , since he can not conceive that those words might have anything to do with an individual 's own personal relations . Someone who works to end a quarrel between two family members or co-workers is putting `` blessed are the peacemakers '' into action , but for the liberal , `` blessed are the peacemakers '' can only mean `` vote for candidates who wish to cut the U.S . military . `` On p 60 , he talks about how the Old Testament prophets preached the need to show kindness to widows and orphans , strangers , and enemies , then he puts a liberal `` spin '' on these categories : being kind to `` widows and orphans '' means promoting feminism ; being kind to `` strangers '' means encouraging illegal immigration ; being kind to `` enemies '' means cutting back our military and caving in to terrorists.In `` spinning '' the Bible , he deliberately twists the meaning of words in the Greek New Testament . On p 61 he says the Greek word metanoia means `` transformation , '' when in fact the Greek word for transformation is metamorphosis . Metanoia literally means `` change of mind , '' but it 's usually translated `` repentance , '' and it definitely refers to something that happens to an individual . But for him , metanoia does not apply to the individual ( although in the Gospels it clearly does ) but to a whole new political order . Being `` born again '' means `` join in with our political side . `` `` In all my growing up years in our evangelical church , I never heard a sermon on the Sermon on the Mount '' ( p 63 ) . That just ca n't be true . There is NO church anywhere , certainly not an evangelical one , where the pastor has not preached on the Sermon , one of the most important and most-quoted parts of the Bible . He is taking a dig at evangelicals , not because they do n't preach on the Sermon on the Mount ( they do - often ) , but that they do n't interpret it his way , urging people on to political activism . `` It is impossible not to be involved in politics '' ( p 69 ) . Not true . I know Christians who do n't vote , much less engage in any protests or demonstrations . Some of these are very decent people who think that `` love thy neighbor '' is meant to be applied to how they actually behave to people they come in contact with . This author could never understand that people like that make a huge difference in the world . `` The problem comes when the church is so conformed to the values of the world that it offers no real alternative to the ruling societal values '' ( p 65 ) . Truer words were never spoken - but the author does n't see the obvious : liberalism IS conforming to the `` ruling societal values , '' which tell us that : only material things matter , group identity is more important than any individual , groups who identify as `` victims '' ( whether they are or not ) deserve special treatment ) , spiritual things matter little or not at all . The `` ruling societial values '' are exactly what he supports : feminism , preferential treatment for minorities , encouraging illegal immigration , supporting same-sex `` marriage , '' spending huge sums on `` green '' projects , `` combating '' global warming ( despite the revelations of `` Climategate '' that scientists are n't unanimous about the issue ) , extending welfare to as many people as possible , bleeding American taxpayers dry by doling out foreign aid to poor countries where the money ends up in the pockets of thug dictators . Does he really think this is what God wants us to do ? Does he really believe that people who oppose all those things are the `` conformists '' ? `` We are to be Christians first and citizens of our country second '' ( p 75 ) . That is a very biblical sentiment - but for him what it means is that America does not deserve our love and devotion , while the United Nations ( p 76 ) does . He ca n't conceive that the UN could ever do anything wrong , while practically every action of his own country is suspect.The book is so repetitive it could 've been edited down to 20 pages . Over and over again : `` A revival is coming . '' `` The Religious Right is dead . '' `` People are tired of divisive politics . '' `` People are hungering for the spiritual . '' And on and on and on . The author has nothing new to say , and so many words to say it .	-1
I was looking forward to this but struggled to get by each page . Kind of dry and awkwardly written . It would be nice to read a book about the Family if the writer was able to engage the reader more effectively . There was a great book in there somewhere .	-1
Helene Holland , Countess Godwin , has been living apart from her husband , notorious rakehell Rees Holland , for the past nine years . In the interim period , Rees lives in their home with his mistress and taints their family name with all manner of scandals . Rees ' brother , Tom , has become a vicar in a nearby town . When Tom comes to visit and Rees makes Helene an offer she ca n't refuse , all sorts of mayhem ensues for this noble family.I found this novel more boring than anything I 've read in awhile and only finished it because , at the time , there was nothing else to read at hand and the library was closed . Helene , has nothing to offer in the way of a romantic heroine besides constantly-shifting morals and a lack of virtue . I found it ridiculous that a woman of her stature would even consider living with her husband 's mistress in the same house , yet alone with mistress having her bedroom . It was completely unacceptable and no amount of inner dialogue on James ' part would make me think any different . Conversely , Rees Godwin had no love for anyone but himself and his music . It 's ridiculous to even suggest that he could think of someone else when he invited his wife to live with him so that she can help him write his scores ( try using your own talent to get ahead ) and insists that his opera singer mistress stay so that she can sing what he 's written ( as though there are no other artists in the world . He even mentions himself that she is n't that wonderful a singer ) .Overall , James made a valiant effort and failed miserably . The subplot with Rees ' brother the reverend falling in love with his mistress is laughable and never really gains any sort of momentum . I would not recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys Regency romance with strong plot as well as a couple to whom you can feel a sense of kinship . I was glad when the reading experience was over .	-1
This is my first Judi McCoy book and it will most likely be my last . The set up was great and I enjoyed the first part of it . Then it just goes flat . I did n't feel the chemistry between these two characters . The hero is way too nice . So nice that he 's boring . There was no conflict between the two besides the lies they kept from each other . When Zara confesses that she 's an alien , it 's no big deal ... no one even disbelieves it for a second . I got through half the book and then did n't pick it up again for about 4 days . That is not a good sign for me . The epilogue was just a sneak preview for another book I guess . I wanted to know what happened on the spaceship . I guess I 'll never find out since I wo n't pay money for another one of these books .	-1
Bernard Cornwell 's Richard Sharpe series - the original books - are fantastic . Brilliantly written , fast-paced , with superb character development . We meet Richard , the `` soldier 's soldier '' whom the ladies ca n't help but notice ; Patrick Harper , his trusty , entertaining , and formidable sergeant ; Wellesley/Wellington , who although somewhat disdainful always has an interesting word with Sharpe . Then there are a host of other characters , from Majors Hogan and Nairn , the sharpshooters ( the Greenjackets ) , and the beautiful women , all of whom are fascinating - and who fascinate Sharpe . Even the villains are beautifully drawn - such as the schemer , spymaster Pierre Ducos.But Sharpe 's Escape features cardboard-cutout characters , absolutely lifeless and uninteresting . Frankly , I did n't care about anyone in the book . Not even Major Hogan , as written here , could liven it up . But Sharpe - Sharpe was the worst of the bunch . He was surly and bad-tempered throughout . The book offered no reason for men to want to follow him . The plots involving Sharpe were idiotic . The battle scenes were n't even as good . Slingsby was like a very poorly drawn Simmerson ( Sharpe 's Eagle ) . I also found it hard to believe that Colonel Lawson would put the Light Company at risk the way he did near the end . And the scene with Wellington was absurd . If you 're not going to do it right , why include it ? It 's as though once Cornwell saw the Sean Bean series , he figured we could all picture the action in our minds , so why bother with setting a scene ? So beautiful scenes , as with Teresa in the church ( Sharpe 's Rifles or Gold , do n't remember ) or with the glorious but treacherous Helene , or anywhere else that we 're told what 's going on in Sharpe 's mind , do n't appear anywhere in `` Escape . '' Not worth your money or your time . Everything seems out of step . The characters were n't true to the originals.For good Cornwell/Sharpe entertainment , read the original series : Rifles , Eagle , Company , Gold , Enemy , Sword , Honor , Waterloo . I 'm sure I left a couple out , and those I 've listed probably are n't in order . But they are superb reading . The first chapter of Sharpe 's Honor is not to be missed - brilliant strategy , and a wonderful way to see how Sharpe 's mind works . If you 're a Napoleonic buff , you wo n't want to miss them .	-1
This book is full of juicy stories first seen in Andersen 's earlier book , Bill and Hillary : The Marriage . There is very little new here and this appears to be an attempt by the author to make some extra cash this election year . Save your money and buy the earlier book used for a penny .	-1
Goodness we all have things about us that are n't pretty to look at . However this book does n't seem to be able to see anything but the flaws . I have heard for years that Ms. Streisand can be difficult and sometimes down right outrageous . Maybe there is some truth to these legends . WHO CARES ... .We do n't have to get into bed with her every night , we are n't being directed by her in a film , and we certainly are not people like her sister or her son that really know her . I personally am glad she is a perfectionist . Look at the work that she produces . The only thing I care about as a fan is being entertained . Ms. Streisand certainly does her job in that department . Yes it is true this book is cruel and Ms. Streisand deserves better . She knows it 's not a good book . That 's why she is n't wasting time on her website to refute the book . She said , '' Maybe it 's finally time for an AUTHORIZED biography '' . Keep your fingers crossed . Maybe if we are lucky she will write her own autobiography . I gave this book 2 stars because I liked the pictures . But , I 'm not by any means supporting it .	-1
Got this as a gift and sifted through the ramblings of a mentally ill liberal . I admit I skipped a lot , but doubt I missed much . If this sophmoric tripe does n't convince you the right is right , and the left is not right . . . nothing will .	-1
This book was mis-labeled ... it says condition is used-good , but all the corners of the book AND the spine are dog-eared and have the cover rubbed off , I ca n't peel the extra bar code/price sticker off the back without ripping off part of the design on the cover itself , and it has a little girl 's name written on the inside cover ! While I did n't spend a lot on the book itself , shipping was $ 4 and if I had known the ACTUAL condition that the book was in then I would n't have even bothered purchasing it . Very disappointed .	-1
A lot of the reviews say : `` I wanted to find out about Audrey '' .For those who are seeking what happened to Audrey , read `` The Last Attempt '' by Carlos Serra : a sad , but excellent book .	-1
Wasted potential thy name is 'In My Heart ' . This was such a promising book at the beginning . It has a not very social academic heroine struggling with her position at the Bristish Museum , an Irish businessman hero who is in constant battle with a society which values titles more than accomplishments and a 10 year old annulled marriage that has given them a boy who died as a toddler . It even has a mystery about stolen gems as a backdrop.But the love story ( if you can call it that ) just did n't work , mostly because I soon came to loath Christopher , the hero . He seemed to be devoid of any big emotions towards Alexandra , was snotty , utterly passive , never stood up for her ( or for his intended fianc & eacute ; e for that matter ) and just stumbled into an affair with her because she instigated the whole thing . When he confesses that he never thought about her during their separation you totally believe him.Furthermore the dramatic past has practically no impact on the present . Alexandra harbours no ill feelings towards him for never coming back to her and he rid himself of all memories - I honestly would have preferred it if he 'd taken her as his mistress to enact some kind of revenge scheme . At least that would have shown he cared and was an active player.Her father was penned as the villain of the story , separating his precious 17-year old daughter from her suitor who 1 ) was a drunk , 2 ) only approached her because of a dare and 3 ) had a tarnished military history . I only cheered him on because Christopher never gave any indications that he truly and passionately loved her . Even at the end when he decides that his relationship is more important than his business ventures it was n't a big thought out romantic gesture he had worked towards . Just another thing that kind of happened to him.When I finished the book I was cranky and slightly depressed for the heroine who for whatever reasons sold herself short.p.s . : I normally could n't care less about anachronisms in historical romances but here they grated because most of them occurred in connection with Alexandra 's position as a women in a professional academic enviroment . Female scientists in Victorian England are an interesting topic . It is well researched , research the author could have used to make the heroine 's situation believable and interesting at the same time .	-1
This book makes for a great promotional piece and that is about all . For the true story , the whole story on John Kerry 's `` Tour of Duty '' check out Unfit for Duty coming out next week . A book written by people who really knew the REAL John Kerry-The RAW Deal .	-1
Thomas recounts in vivid detail all the injustices and hardship suffered by his grandparents , parents and himself over the last century and how all of that attracted him to Republican conservativism , which embraced the ideals of racial equality , affirmative action and eradicating poverty - ideals which helped Thomas reach the heights of success . Huh ? He seems keenly aware of the fact that he did not possess the legal expertise or the intellectual depth to sit on the highest court in the land . But after spending time with the other underqualified and highly over-rated justices on the court such as Scalia and Rehnquist , Thomas came to realize that he had nothing to feel bad about . The one regret he has is the advent of C-SPAN , which provides an unwelcome measure of public exposure to the court . He worries that the blind reverence and assumption of supreme intelligence which the public held for the judges for over 200 years has come to an end . Instead , the public now has C-SPAN to show them that the court is really nothing more than a collection of simple-mided political suck-ups with giant egos who do strange things with soda cans and who will approve the torture and dismemberment of their own mothers and children at Guantanamo Bay if it will get them appointed to the court.Although he still harbors a great deal of anger over his historic and divisive confirmation hearings , he hopes to find the infamous coke can , which he dreams of selling one day for a certain fortune at e-bay .	-1
If you 've been reading the Bed & Breakfast series from the beginning it is obvious that the quality of the stories has decreased . Dead Man Docking , her last book was ok , but this one is definitely the worst of the series.I 'd describe the storyline but it 's so convuluted with multiple stories , including a murder , a missing violin bow worth a fortune . An old murder . Possible illegetimate child , Nutty people . Ex-wives , stepchildren , drug addicts , alcoholics mysterious strangers and a partridge in a pear tree.It never comes together into a coherant story . Not only do n't I care who committed the murder , I 'm just sorry more of these loser characters did n't bite the dust.I think Mary Daheim should consider starting a new book series with fresh characters and leave Judith and Renie alone for a while . I would rather wait a couple of years and get a tight , exciting mystery where you ca n't put down the book ( as many of the earlier books are ) instead of a book every year or so that just does n't seem worth the effort to read.Highlights : No matter how bad the book , Judith has always been a great character . Very loving and very funny . I love her romance with her husband Joe , although he has almost disappeared from the storyline for the last few books.Humor . Not as funny as they used to be , but I still find Renie 's obcession with her stuffed Ape and live bunny to be very funny.Lowlights : Bad and boring mystery.Cousin Renie : There is a small line between eccentric and nutty . Renie has now crossed the line . What used to be funny about her messy , aggressive manner has become annoying . I would be embarrassed to ever be in a public place with her as her behavior has become so annoying.Gertrude : Her nasty behavior has increased as the series continues and is no longer funny , just because she 's old does n't make it any less abusive.Very disappointing , I agree with another reviewer , if you 're just starting the series , do n't begin with this book . Go back to the beginning for some really great reads .	-1
Bed-and-breakfast proprieter Judith Flynn and her husband Joe are badly in need of a vacation . While Judith dreams of a trip to the beach , Joe is planning a `` surprise '' vacation for her . They are accompanied by Judith 's cousin Renie and her husband , Bill . The setting that the men choose is great for their fishing plans but the women are n't so pleased . At least Judith feels that she will be removed from the curse of finding dead bodies , which seems to plague her at the B & B . Unfortunately , this is not the case . A dead body soon appears , and Judith begins her usual sleuthing to try to find the killer . From there , the book becomes so long and tangled that it 's difficult to keep the characters and the plot straight . Renie seems to be even more over-the-top than usual and the characters tend to be caricatures . This is not Mary Daheim 's best work .	-1
This book was a letdown . Having recently spent some time in Ireland I was eagerly anticipating a fun chick read taking place there . Instead , I found the main character annoying , whiny and completely self-absorbed ! Additionally , she used everyone around her and gave not much back ! I found her unlkeable . The author threw in random scenes of drunkenness and one night stand type sex & frankly I could n't figure out how such a generally unlovable individual would be attracting all those men . I stuck this book out to the end hoping that I 'd get a glimpse of a likeable person in the protagonist but did n't . I suggest instead Patricia Scanlan 's books which also take place in Dublin .	-1
I agree with the 1- and 2-star reviews . Ann Patchett 's writing is beautiful -- it was the only thing that kept me reading -- but Lucy is such an unpleasant person that I began to feel like Ann did ( much too late for Ann ) . This reminds me of Benji the Dog movies : Benjie runs up the hill ; Benji runs down the hill . I think Ann needed help to look at her codependency and why she allowed this woman to repeatedly abuse her . I expected a memoir about Ann but got a story of someone who is hard to respect .	-1
I 'm a bit embarrassed to admit it , but I 've never read this before . The only other Vonnegut I 've read is Breakfast of Champions , which struck me as a self-serving pity-fest . Slaughterhouse-Five seems no less bleak , but at least it 's bleakness is tempered with a nastily acerbic sense of humor which made me occasionally snort at the wretchedness of life , the universe , and everything . I think I 'd have to be a bitchy , nihilistic teenager again to really love it though . And I have to say , this book has an incredibly strong reservoir of bitterness , defeatism and hatred which seems to be hovering just below its surface and which even the satire ca n't make entirely palatable . I wonder if one reason Kurt Vonnegut is so good at writing about what miserable wretches human beings can be is that maybe he was something of a miserable wretch himself . I get that living through the fire bombing of Dresden would probably fundamentally alter how anyone looked at their fellow man for the worse but man , Vonnegut seems like an incredibly rare , insufferable breed of jerk at times .	-1
I keep looking at all the reviews from everyone , and wondering if they read the same book I did ? I 've read stream of consciousness before , but his was stream of consciousness on crack . I guess if you like things , because they do n't follow the prescribed formula of a novel , then this book is for you . Otherwise , I 'd ignore all of the people claiming this is a masterpiece and pick up a book that 's enjoyable to rea	-1
One of my high school students absolutely insisted that I read this book , so after some feeble attempts at making excuses , I agreed to do it . Because I did n't want to disappoint the boy , I finished the whole book , but if I had n't promised to read it , I would have put it down about halfway through . The plot is trite and predictable , but it takes the author forever to get to the predicted point . ( If you 're going to write a trilogy , I guess you need a lot of filler . ) The pacing was horribly uneven , the characters are annoying , and the `` Kyralian '' and `` Elyne '' words for things we do n't have in our world are just plain silly . There is a glossary in the back of the book if you ca n't figure out from context what `` bol '' and `` sumi '' are . The magicians do n't seem able to DO anything with their magic except create force-fields and communicate telepathically with each other . Perhaps this book is really an allegory about classism and talent in a stratified society , or maybe it 's just another sophomoric , second-rate fantasy novel . Do n't waste your time with it . Reread Tolkien .	-1
I will be `` kind '' in this review and just say , Gaiman seems to like ghosts ( remember `` The Graveyard book '' ? ) .This little girl is stranded with a horrid `` other mother '' and other sordid characters ... for only two days ? It seemed like years.This is a horror story for kids.Could n't wait for it to end.Sorry .	-1
It does give advice but the art of verbal judo is something that requires lots of practice and ca n't be easily attained . I also do n't think its entirely necessary , if people were more straight forward and did not get so butt hurt because you did n't stroke there ego we would be better off in this world . Just my 2 cents , but it might help some I just do n't agree with the message	-1
First , let me point out that Mona Charen believes , among other bits of amusing malarkey , that the Clintons had Vince Foster assassinated . We are not dealing with someone who has a great respect for facts . Now , her argument seems to be that 'liberals ' ( a term that seems to include everyone from Thomas Friedman to the Weather Underground ) have historically been what the John Birch society used to call & quot ; comm simps & quot ; that is , ardent fans of totalitarian communism . Look at the long list of liberal commie-lovers : Harry Truman , who started the Korean war to keep the DPRK from owning the whole Korean penninsula ; JFK , who started the Vietnam war with similar goals in mind ; Lyndon Johnson , who stoked the bloody mess still further . You would have to go pretty far left to find anyone who still defended the USSR past the early fifties.Meanwhile , in the name of fighting communism , we have bombed dirt-poor villagers in Vietnam and Cambodia , murdered the democratically elected president of at least one nation , funded murderous rapists in Nicaragua ( people whom Ronald Reagan called & quot ; the moral equivalent of our founding fathers ) and generally caused mayhem on a scale the Soviet Union only dreamed of.What did it achieve ? Why did we do it ? I seem to recall we were listening to the Ann Coulters and Mona Charens of the day , and losing our sense of human decency in the process .	-1
That someone as useless as Mona Charen would rail against Jimmy Carter for begin a supposed `` idiot '' is the sort of blasphemy I was not expecting in this latest on my reading list of sensational diatribes against `` liberals . '' I 'm really trying hard to figure out how it is that a war on drugs and the push for faith-based organizations and initiatives fit in with the idea of less government . Hypocrisy is the worst characteristic of the `` Right . `` In response to all those who write in complaining that we liberals never comment on the content in these books , I have an answer : we look for content and substance that we are used to and we come up dry ! The `` Left '' is often better read than the `` Right '' and we often become aghast to discover works like this - that offer so little - skyrocketing up the sales charts . We falsely assume that there must be something to it . Reading O'Reilley and others is like pluggin ' your adult brain into Barney for grown-ups . You have some laughs , get some giggles and go away hungry for quality programming ! If just one of these books can ultimately prove more enlightening or amusing than one off-night episode of The Simpsons , I 'll gladly wax poetic on the wonderful substance and content of the work . Until then I 'll stick with matching the artificialty of the work I am reviewing.It never ceases to fail . Books like `` Useful Idiots '' are the equivalent of two-day old barbecue in the refrigerator . It just tastes bad .	-1
The story itself was a good idea . However , it moved a bit slow for my taste . I found myself thinking I would never get to the end . I do n't like to give away anything for those who might enjoy it more than I , so I wo n't go into the details of the storyline . I will wait for the second book to be released in paperback , that is if I decide to give it another try . I like to think the kinks are being worked out in a first book , so I usually read 2 before giving up completely . I think it takes great courage and skill to put a book together , kudos for those brave enough to try .	-1
Yep , it 's true , and basically , it comes to say that Sean Hannity is yet another conservative scumbag that worships the man and thinks that liberals are terrorists . Plus , the guy 's on FOX News , the channel that despite its slogan `` Fair and Balanced '' , leans over to one side and is up to the brim with bias and lies . Hannity is a liar , a hypocrite , basically he 's one that basically follows the road of terror that Bush crafted . If you can take one word he utters in this book seriously , you need help .	-1
This book is so skewed right it makes Rush Limbaugh look like a Kennedy.I just wish this guy would be honest about what his real agenda is : personal gain and ego gratification . His show is a joke and his obvious infatuation/obsession with Bill Clinton is disturbing.I 'm amazed that people actually buy this crap , it 's so plainly obvious that Hannity is a hack . For instance , I 'm not a fan of John Kerry , but he 's been blabbing about a & quot ; possible affair & quot ; with an intern for weeks on his radio show . It turns out that there is absolutely no evidence of this , and that this unsubstantiated claim has caused a great amount of grief to the woman and her family . Imagine having people one the radio claiming something so sordid of you all over the radio without any facts . Of course , republicans have these dalliances all the time , but you never hear about them from Hannity . He 's a shill , plain and simple.Do n't waste your money .	-1
Gound Zero nonsense aside , I have to say that this is one of the most ooey-gooey , badly written , patronizing , craven books on Islam yet . Its thesis : the Clash of Civilizations is n't necessary , because we have SO much in common . When the Abrahamic ethic , or `` Judaeo-Christian tradition , '' developed in the ancient world , Moslems were ultimately blessed to realize the full profundity and infinite extent of God 's law : sharia . Since God made everything , sharia can be found everywhere ! ( Plato 's `` Republic , '' anyone ? ) Sadly , in the West , sharia wandered into the weeds for a bit , yet even here you can see sharia . Rauf ruminates on Dawkins ' ruminations on sociobiology , which prove that nature is sharia-compliant ( as is , presumably , Dawkins himself -- he 'll be pleased to know this ) . The Constitution ? Founded on the Abrahamic ethic of love , and hence sharia-compliant ( though `` The Federalist , '' which Rauf 's clearly never read , contains not one reference to The Bible , but a TON of quotes from the Greco-Roman classics , which he 's also never read ) . The separation of powers concept is really brilliant , which makes it Islamic ( though the idea really comes from Aristotle 's `` Politics , '' the only work of the canon that was never translated into Arabic , so Rauf 's not likely to have read it either . ) Gee whiz -- you can just TELL the Godliness of the Constitution -- it 's proven by a quote from Nino Scalia ( who in real life undoubtedly loathes Rauf 's bleedin ' guts ) ! The reason we need Rauf to tell us this is that , of late , the West has been assaulted by Militant Secularism ( which Rauf ca n't distinguish from atheism , but neither can Pat Robertson ) , but the sooner we disregard these people ( who presumably include Aristotle himself , Ayaan Hirsi Ali , Ibn Warraq , and -- lest we forget -- Salman Rushdie , all available on Amazon and all more honest writers ) the sooner we 'll become REALLY sharia-compliant , and we 'll all live happily ever after . Clearly , this is Sayyid Qutb Lite . Regrettably , Rauf ignores the fact that the theocratic tendencies of Islam have caused far more suffering among Jews and Christians than vice versa ( by the way -- what WERE those Moors doing in the south of France ? And just why did they massacre the Jews of Granada ? ) and that Moslems are still dipping ther hands merrily in each others ' blood . And try looking up the word `` apostasy '' in the index . It is n't there , of course -- guess why . Ignore this book . It 's junk . ( An addendum , several months later : you do n't have to feel guilty about not buying this ; Rauf wo n't starve . I recently heard on the news that he 's got about $ 100 million worth of backing for his mosque from sources he wo n't reveal , so he does n't need your money . )	-1
I 'm a big Evanovich fan , or , I should say , a Stephanie Plum fan . However , the Barnaby/Hooker series is downright disappointing . After reading both books in the series , I still do n't feel as if I know the main characters and at this point I 'm not sure if I want to . I 'm assuming Ms. Evanovich put Alex and Sam in the off-again '' part of their relationship at the beginning of the book in order to create sexual tension throughout the book . Unfortunately , it still was n't enough to make me want to continue reading . I almost quit several times . However , NASCAR information was interesting even though I 'm not a fan . I did n't care for the disrespectful manner in which dead bodies were treated . It was obviously supposed to be silly and slapstick , but I found it distasteful . Did n't have any LOL moments while reading this book , but I guess the really good jokes have to be set aside for Stephanie and the gang . Still a JE fan , but wo n't be reading any more of this series .	-1
Could wrap myself around this one either . I was hoping it would be a different great adventure . Someone else has to of loved it , but it was n't my cup-of-coffee ! ( I do n't drink tea )	-1
The first couple of Plum books were wonderful but Evanovich apparently got lazy and invested nothing in character or plot development . I thumbed through a couple pages before I bought this book and was very happy to see an intelligent woman with real skills as a main character . I 'm over half way through it now and I do n't know if I 'll ever pick it up again . Every book of this and related genres requires a suspension of disbelief -- they all include the good guys and the villains making stupid decisions that are necessary for the plot to move forward . But this book takes that problem out to lunch . At every turn , all the main characters make decisions and do things that no sentient being would make or do . And the relationship that started out cute in the Plum novels and then became boring is just ridiculous here . While I probably will finish the book ( I 'm the type who reads the backs of cereal boxes ) , I wo n't recommend it to any one ( I gave the first couple of Plum novels as gifts ) . Ms. Evanovich , show a little respect for your readers and put a little work into writing your next book .	-1
My first Dorsey book that I actually gave up on . Serge and Coleman are hilarious as usual , but the problem is they seem to play second fiddle to other characters that just are n't that fun . The plodding plot setup was killing off any fun the story had to offer . With 365 pages to tackle , I first thought of maybe just reading the serge and coleman episodes , but I do n't go for cheating myself out of reading a full book . So I set it down around page 150 and might pick it back up sometime down the road . At this point it stands on my bookshelf with a two star rating . Since when did reading Dorsey get so ... ... ... complicated ? Definitely not for new Dorsey fans or old ones expecting good new material .	-1
Riker drops the ball on this one.From what has BEEN an excellent series about brave and honorable Navy SEALs fighting America 's battles , this time Riker degenerates into the same type of Loony-Left anti-George Bush/anti-war BS that can be found by turning on any 6:00 O'clock network news program.Riker regurgitates the usual `` Blood for Oil , Bush did it for his rich Oil buddies '' story line that 's so beloved by the Far Left.Riker earned a single star for this junk , and just may have lost a very faithful reader.I want my eight bucks back , and Riker may not get my money for a future book .	-1
I wish I had read all the 1 , 2 , and 3 star reviews before I ordered this book , as they say it all . Heed the warnings ! I ordered this book on my Kindle , so I had no clue how LONG it is . Long is great if the story is compelling and well written - not the case here . It was a real struggle to trudge through this mess . I admit I eventually resorted to speed reading to get through it , but it still was n't worth it . Those are hours of my life I want back . Even allowing for differences in taste , I ca n't imagine that those who gave it 4 or 5 stars read the same book as I did .	-1
I 'm a 19 year old democrat who spends a great deal of time studying politics ... for fun . I picked up this book to see if my views could be changed by another young man who actually had a book published . I was dismayed.I do n't know how to put this except that it seems that this kid has n't had any difficult ordeals in his life . He 's sheltered and proud of it ! He stands by a bunch prinicipals which do n't hold any real value for most Americans . Absolutely none of his arguments were new ( espeacially the ones against gun control ) and he supports leaders such as Rumsfeld and Bush simply because he can relate to their good old southern values , even calling Bush a `` hick '' he can be proud of because he knows how to speak to a man about fixing a tractor ( but he 's sure good at dividing a country and destroying the people of Iraq ) .The book is simple to read because it offers nothing new to anyone who actually has the desire to read it . A young middle school student might be able to appreciate it , but they are going to be quick to realize Ferguson is a child of homeschooling ( oh ! but he does play tennis ! ) and not someone they can relate to at all.I might not have a radio show , or book , but the only people who can use a role model like Ben Ferguson are the ones who tune into Fox News for thier nightly return to conservative comfort .	-1
This book was moving along in a fun way ... . then went off into stupid land . It was as if the author ran out of material . Would not recommend .	-1
( Spoiler warning ! ) I read and absolutely loved The Cryptonomicon . I had high hopes for Quicksilver but alas I was disappointed . While written in the same style as the Cryptonomicon the threads are too nebulous and fluid.An example is that there 's a lengthly section about silver mining and how a Natural Philosopher ( scientist ) and the enigmatic Enoch Root discover a way to economically coax silver from silver mine dregs . So the group travels to Amsterdam ( or someplace , I forget ) to get mercury , a necessary ingredient for the silver reclamation process . We never hear about it again , except for a single one-line reference 100 pages later.The book is full of threads like this that go nowhere or are too subtle for my limited intellect.Quicksilver just did n't gel for me .	-1
Lots of romance , good descriptions , mystery with lots of action and intrigue.Will read more of her work with interest .	-1
` A Fine Passion ' just was boring . The romance story was passable but the mystery was confusing and tedious . It took me almost a week to read this book because I would find other things to do . So , if you need a clean house then pick up this book because you find yourself gravitating to others things . If you were looking for a romance/mystery , I would buy A Loving Scoundrel by Johanna Lindsey or ` When We Meet ' by Victoria Alexander and save your money on this one .	-1
I bought this book because it was a Kindle Daily Deal and it had a lot of really positive reviews with words like `` unforgettable '' and `` classic . '' I 'm not sure which book those reviewers were reading . I finished the whole book in the span of an afternoon because it was so short and I had nothing else to do , and when it was over , I immediately started a new book . That should be some indiction of how little I was invested in `` Crooked Letter . '' The characters were all pretty trite and the mystery part was mildly interesting at best.Overall , not a bad way to pass a rainy afternoon , but I would n't recommend it to anyone and I 'm definitely glad I only paid like $ 3 for it .	-1
I 'm sorry , but the plot in this book just moves along much too slowly ... ..The author spends too much time discussing trivial details but not enough time discussing personalities or moving the story along .	-1
To be fair , I am not a fan of Scooby-Doo mysteries , implausibly-tidy endings or characters who speak in cliches . Unfortunately , this book contained all of those things . The writing itself was so bad that I ca n't even justify giving this two stars . I recognize that many people LOVE this book , but the corny dialogue and silly plot development left me feeling like I 'd rather be overtaken by kudzu and cottonmouths than read this book again .	-1
I liked Melissa Nathan 's other books , particularily Pride..Jasmine Field , but this one was hard to like . Primarily because Annie was such a drip-no backbone whatsoever . Furthermore she stayed a drip till the very end . Her sisters were selfish twits which would have been okay if they provided comic relief . Unfortunately , not . The other characters were two-dimensional and also , not entertaining .	-1
The author says the book is for Jewish readership , but I can & # 8217 ; t imagine why anyone Jewish or otherwise would be much interested in it . It & # 8217 ; s not based on historical or biblical scholarship , but more like a long sermon in conjunction with a retelling of the books of New Testament ( I guess for people who don & # 8217 ; t want to read them for themselves . ) No footnotes or endnotes , ( only references to Scripture ) so no sources for her information or explanation of conclusions . She seems completely oblivious to the tremendous amount of scholarship and research done in this area over the last decade . There & # 8217 ; s no reason to believe she & # 8217 ; s ever heard of Earl Doherty , Alvar Elleg ? rd , Richard Carrier or several hundred other scholars who have published on this topic . Two major sects , the Essenes and Gnostics are each mentioned exactly once ( pages 10 and 275 respectively . ) This is like describing events leading up to the world wars and overlooking Germany and England . No mention of Tacitus , one of Pliny ( she means The Younger , but may not know there were two . ) one of Suetonius ( p.185 . ) Josephus who wrote a 21-volume history of the Jews gets only four mentions , while G.W . Bowersock , the modern historian of late antiquity , gets none . The author doesn & # 8217 ; t appear to be especially knowledgeable or have any real sense for the age , but apparently felt a need to write about it . I admit the one-star is harsh , but the book both misleads the reader and pretends to an authority it simply doesn & # 8217 ; t have .	-1
I 'm a sucker for memoirs of self-destruction . Whether by booze , drugs , or mental illness , chronicles of despair and endurance of lives hardly worth surviving are more often compelling than not . This was n't one of them.As another reviewer mentioned , she wrote this for the money . It shows . The lack of connection with a difficult life comes through in every well crafted , stylistic , and hollow sentence . Virtually every line , and certainly every paragraph , was like watching a little girl put her hands over her ears and pirouette her way through chaos and carnage without any thought as to why . And , virtually every sentence was peppered with language and metaphors that did not infuse them with emotion but drained them of any . This pretentious writing at its best . Even her `` letter '' to her son felt detached , as if she wanted to convey some deep feelings and instead sounded like someone who dreamed of Anne Sexton , drowned in thesaurus and , as a result , never said anything.I just finished Driving With Dead People and , while not about alcoholism , it 's a powerful and gripping memoir that works from front to back . The strange thing is , I think Mary Karr is probably a better writer . The problem is , she knows it . A good memoir is a story that needs to be told . Lit is a story that did n't need to be told , it was for bills needed to be paid . Financial needs are powerful but they are insufficient motivation for quality writing.Memoirs are often criticized for being too sentimental . Lit has the opposite problem . It feels like it was told , with forced color , by an indifferent witness to a difficult life . As anyone with a brain knows , it 's way too easy to obscure yourself and your emotions through language , self-deprecation , and wit . I wish she 'd written something else for the money and waited to write this one when she actually wanted to . It would have made a huge difference .	-1
I did like Ms. Maclean 's `` To Marry The Duke '' , but unfortunately , she seems to have gone steadily downhill as a writer from that point . This story is particularly dull , flat and episodic . The writing is not fresh , nor are the characters.The biggest problem is that none of the characters are memorable . They are all , without question , stock romance-novel characters , with NO life to them . Just for example , the Sophia of this book is NOTHING like the Sophia of To Marry The Duke , and James , her husband , has become a stick figure . Admittedly , the conflicts of this book do not directly involve them , but a supporting character should have SOME character , and consistency , particularly when you 've met them in another book ! Whitby the charming rake , and Lily the girl who would love to reform him ... These characters are so familiar , and so dully written , even their bedroom scenes are lacking energy , despite Ms. Maclean 's descriptive powers . The opening chapters move soooooo slowly . The plot became so predictable , I was skimming by Chapter 4 ! I am disappointed with the way this series has panned out . To Marry The Duke , about the romance of the duke of the title ( James ) and Sophia , the rich American title-seeker , started the series off very well . But the two sequels about Sophia 's sisters , Clara and Adele , were basically just sex romps with no depth . And this little detour involving James ' sister , Lily , is just more of the same . Very disappointing .	-1
I was not aware that Janet Evanovich wrote romances . I will stick with only the Stephanie Plum books from now on	-1

Wow ! This book was a complete letdown . First of all ... this book is only 188 pages long . And they 're small pages ! To think that you could even come close to encompassing even the public life of Jefferson in less than 200 pages is laughable . Secondly , instead of focusing on particular points in Jefferson 's life , Hitchens attempts to cover many different topics , in no specific order and thus barely scratches the surface on any of them . To say the least , this book left me wanting more ... a LOT more . I do n't know if Hitchens just decided to slap together a quick book on TJ or if he was given an impossible deadline to meet by the publisher . But this book does n't even cover one subject about Jefferson partially , let alone many subjects completely . The positive side to this book is that it is short , so the painful incompleteness only lasts a couple of hours . For those wanting a good book that encompasses more than a mere cursory look at Thomas Jefferson I would certainly recommend looking elsewhere . For those looking to burn a couple of hours who do n't really care what they read ... I would still recommend a different book ... a good fiction or something of the like . This one gets a definite PASS ! !	-1
I 've enjoyed previous books by Jane Heller , but this one was a stinker . Mel , the main character , is a mean-spirited workaholic . Her magic change of character at the end of the book just was n't believable . I disliked her through the book , and did n't like her better at the end . Why did Ethan like her , anyway ? The only thing she seemed to have going for her was good hair and big boobs . Her personality was rotten.There was also a petty attitude regarding women paying alimony . Why should n't they ? I was left wondering if Jane Heller got stuck with a nasty divorce settlement.I wo n't be rushing out to buy any new books from this author . Try the library for this one .	-1
Readers should be aware that this study was first published in 1953 , and despite light revision reflects the state of scholarship half a century ago . We 've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then , and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book ( e.g. , in the ghastly section entitled & quot ; The Darkest Hours : The Great Recession , A.D. 500-950 & quot ; ) have been thoroughly discredited . The bibliographies for each section do n't include works published in the past half century ( despite the so-called revision ) . Even the very language is dated , with its grandiose , sweeping style , capitalization of popes , etc . This book perpetuates a great many old myths , making the job of historians of religion just that much harder . There are now much better books on the market .	-1
The Screwtape Letters by C.S . Lewis is a satirical account in which a & # 8220 ; highly placed assistant & # 8221 ; of & # 8220 ; Our Father Below & # 8221 ; writes a series of letters to his nephew , Wormwood , a novice demon whose job it is to secure the souls of young men . In a series of letters Screwtape gives Wormwood advice on the nature of humans and how to successfully tempt them . It is a kind of Machiavellian approach , saying in effect , this is how humans are and how you can overcome them . The frame is World War II and certainly there is a lot to criticize about a God who would allow such a tragedy . But I found Screwtape & # 8217 ; s comments too obtuse . Moreover we never get to see Wormwood & # 8217 ; s responses directly . Maybe if you are British or a particular fan of Lewis you will like this book .	-1
This book is a compilation of nine essays and speeches on Christianity by C.S . Lewis . The book offers direction and motivation to people in despair . These are messages that supply an empathetic image of Christianity.In the past few years I have become a great fan of the theological writings of C.S . Lewis . His writing is deeply learned , easily understood , intensely theological and very entertaining . This is the first of his books I have found to not be enjoyable . This collection of essays is very convoluted and disjointed . The book is a compilation of essays , sermons , and speeches delivered by Lewis to divergent audiences over a 15 year period . Lewis did not write them or deliver them with the intent that they be bound together . The work looks to be a sloppy attempt by an eager editor to slap together a book for a quick buck , rather then the usually cogent and succinct work of Lewis.The nine chapters on their own were enjoyable and entertaining . They were the usual work that one comes to expect from Lewis . But , they have no business being strung together . Each chapter is delivered in a different style and tone . This makes sense when the reader understands the original audiences . One was delivered to Christian doubters , several were given in churches , several were given to Oxford students and one was penned to a Pastor . The reader can imagine that the verbiage , tone and delivery would be different to each audience.Avoid this unfortunate work . It does not do justice to this fine author .	-1
As a reader and collector of books on the subject , especially Pre- and Early Christian History , I just *had* to get this book . ( I did n't get it at Amazon , however . Sorry , guys . ) I am torn on how to treat the book . In one sense , it is a fascinating theory put forth , not only by the author but a great many others . Lots of stuff to back it up . On the other hand , he tends to interpret things , take things a certain way when it suits , and that just turns me off to quite a chunk of the book . It 's not even *close* to better books on the subject , but it is n't a bad read , in the end.I think the author could have done a substantially better job being honest to where the evidence ( and lack thereof ) led . Instead , I believe he started with a destination in mind , and that 's bad scholarship .	-1
The GOSPEL OF THOMAS , even before I saw the edition under review here , got me to be an active Christian believer from being just a nominal or cultural one . There is promise here of salvation -- and what is that ? To save ones soul for everlasting life -- not a bad idea many would agree . And that offer is held out in Thomas ' opening comment in this Gospel of Jesus ' sayings -- contingent on one understanding his sayings that follow in the text -- and it sounds authentic . But that is a TALL order.As I read it , the main sub-text is to give up the `` things of this world '' ( material and physical things ) and to go to the `` things of the Father '' ( spiritual things ) .But this is tough stuff indeed for it means cutting back on that which , at least on some of the things , many of us like : desire for money , excessive or fancy foods , fashion , concupiscence , and expression of ego . But then it also means eliminating infidelity , drunkenness , drugs , adictiveness , homosexuality , pederasty , and pride-fullness . But further , eliminating : lying , cheating and stealing -- those behaviors that astonishingly are allowed and even encouraged by the holiest book of one of the other of the worlds most dominant religions.This may begin to sound a little preachy , but there it is , take it or leave it . Still if one has an eye for continuing or everlasting life , one has to read this for one's-self to possibly come to the iluminating moments alone . However this is not the best available presentation of Thomas . It seems to me , this particular edition has problems.The organization is clumsy in the extreme . The first part has the sayings in English opposite to the Coptic . That would be good for a scholarly paper . But while the Coptic font is graphically striking , it has no use for the ordinary reader other than aesthetic.The next part has comments on each of the sayings . But these two parts are not conveniently organized because one has to read both together in two different parts of the book . These comments largely refer to other similar or related sayings in the Synoptic Gospels but without quoting them directly , so that adds a third text -- the Bible -- one must juggle at the same time.So the book by itself is incomplete . The author and editor could have added the requisite full quotations thus adding a few more pages but making the book much more useful and valuable.Many of the Jesus sayings are obscure , even counterintuitive , and it would take very wise and insightful research and commentary to unravel them . Author Meyer does n't do enough along this line . A good deal more of free swinging but informed speculation as to meaning would be helpful . But that 's where scholars are frequently fearful and too conservative . An editor may have also seen that need in the original text.The publisher then must have thought it appropriate to engage Harold Bloom for an end essay . But why should a Jew horn in on Christian Holy Writ ? -- a fox in the henhouse.If Thomas ' work is Gnostic , it is heretical . Yet Bloom , singlehandedly , in this book by another author , makes much of what he sees as a gnostic element in Thomas . But for peerspective let 's differentiate here between the gnostic religion and the personal gnostic . Straight Christianity without the weird and contrived gnostic vector is best . But the gnostic as personal knowledge is to be sought -- YET with a cautionary note : In the book a comment on Saying # 87 notes , `` ... damn ... the soul if it remains fixed only in its own nature and relies only upon its own works , not having communion with the divine spirit ... '' . That emphasizes that the good Gnosticism , the gnostic insight from personal inspiration , seems to require divine moderation . So there is no free gnostic lunch . There is always the need for the Source.Also the classification of this gospel as a gnostic one is not globally agreed on by scholars , not even by Prof. Meyer right in this book . That 's the author 's view which Bloom remarkably makes an end run around.Bloom also champions Barton Mack 's somewhat unscholarly casting of Jesus as merely a kind of wandering wisdom teacher of the Greek Cynic variety , thereby diminishing Christian origination.Finally , as a Jew , Bloom , of course , favors this Gospel because it has only Christ 's sayings and no narrative that tells of Christ 's Divinity . In fact Bloom further demeans the New Testament by squarely doubting its veracity because of it being written forty and more years after the events ; and that the original writings are lost with only the Greek translations available . Is n't that like saying , `` Reading Plato in English in the Twenty-first century A.D. is not relevant because the original was in Greek , 500 or so B.C . '' ( even though not lost ) ? Where would the place be in rational Christian discourse where corrosive commentaries like Bloom 's can abide ; tendentious as they are but masquerading as objective ? They generate more heat than light and seem more apropos as addenda to his Talmud .	-1

The book was mainly about other people he knew ( like Roy Orbison ) . It hardly told his own story . At the same time he would share history and stories of each house he owned and little stories that you 'd hear a grandfather talk about on holidays of sorts , so that was kinda nice . I learned much more about him from reading all his old letters and such in `` I Walked The Line '' by Vivian Cash ( his first wife ) .	-1
Okay , it 's interesting enough , not a bad read , some compelling ideas , but this has got to be the most self-congratulatory book ever . It 's about a brilliant `` noetic butterfly '' ( really , that 's the smooch the author gives the economist ) who shocks the establlishment , and the brilliant journalist who gains his trust and respect , and then the brilliant journalist quotes his own brilliant articles about the brilliant economist and calls that a book . It 's a little insulting how we 're supposed to be blown away by these mavericks . I 'll give them credit for making science sexy , for making economics and statistics seem like valid tools , but please , fellas , a little humility , a little less marketing , and , if you really need to make out this much , get a room .	-1
The author says there is a correlation that Roe v. Wade helped reduce the number of unwanted children who typically commit violent crimes , therefore justifying the millions of aborted babies . What ? Levitt really lost me when he argued that parenting methods do n't really matter much . He fails to see any correlation that the latchkey kids from the go-go 80 's recognized they did n't want to repeat that empty materialism lifestyle . He did n't recognize the importance of having two parents that raise the children , especially fathers that stick around for the long haul . These latchkey kids are now creating families with a dad , a stay-at-home mom , and kids.This short book proves anyone can produce hype and a product to sell , I 'd skip it .	-1
Freakonomics is perhaps the predictable result of a collaboration between an economist , who by trade rationalizes the value of a given activity by its value ( read : income ) -generating returns , and a journalist who knows full well that controversy sells books . I say this not to impugn the authors ' motives , as I am confident they actually felt they were making a legitimate contribution to modern cultural discourse , but as a disappointed observation on their finished product : some insightful observations , yes , but ultimately unconvincing and at times truly inflammatory.The authors relate some interesting stories and anecdotes about various social issues -- their stories about Kennedy Stetson 's infiltration of the KKK and Sudhir Venkatesh 's infiltration of the Black Disciples crack gang are the highlights of the book . But their pedestrian commentaries on miscellaneous topics ranging from rigged sumo matches to theories on the names given to children of different racial and socio-economic backgrounds are only cursorily analyzed and profoundly suspect . The authors rely almost exclusively on quantitative methods , accepting statistical data at face value and drawing profound conclusions from their often poorly-explained calculations . This is the point -- support a crazy theory with an impressive-sounding statistic , and you have a perfect recipe for controversy.Example : on page 170 , the authors argue that the Head Start program does not contribute the educational development of children . Their evidence ? `` [ A ] ccording to the ECLS [ Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , by the US Dept . of Ed . ] data , Head Start does nothing for a child 's future test scores . '' Based on this , the authors conclude `` we must acknowledge that [ Head Start ] has repeatedly been proven ineffectual . '' In other words , the authors presume that because Head Start has not shown to improve children 's test scores , the program is ineffectual -- even if it is true that Head Start does not improve children 's test scores , the authors conclusory determination that the program has no other apparent benefits is not supported . Moreover , the authors fail to discuss any of the large body of authority arguing that standardized tests are culturally biased ( against the exact same children likely to participate in Head Start ) , or examine other potential explanations why children from Head Start programs may do poorly on tests . This is one example , but unfortunately , the text is filled with these types of analytical omissions and overdrawn conclusions.At the beginning of the book and interspersed throughout are numerous fawning vignettes describing Steven Leavitt 's ( the economist ) supposedly amazing genius . While I think Leavitt makes some good points ( his demonstration of the correlation between legal abortion and the declining crime rate is noteworthy , though I found the proof incomplete ) , he does n't live up to the hype in Freakonomics . That 's another thing Dubner ( the journalist ) should have helped with -- show , do n't tell .	-1
Let 's say you went into your kitchen and made 600 bean-and-cheese burritos , then left them out in the sun for about 12 hours , then fed them to a horse . The resulting output would be equivalent in quality and value to this book.See the excellent reviews submitted here by `` Giblet '' and M. Veiluva , which which I agree wholeheartedly , except that I think they were too kind . In short , the book is superficial and sensationalistic . The writer uses a tiresome self consciously `` clever '' tone throughout . And the bulk of it is filler . It could easily be summarized in a medium-length magazine article without dropping anything important.And the title is idiotic and insulting . It sounds as if some marketing nitwit was trying to `` target '' the book towards 18- to 24-year-olds by making it seem `` edgy . '' ( `` They 'll buy it because it 's FREAKy ! '' )	-1
Those readers who gave this book 4 or 5 stars must not read many football books . Franklin 's Foer 's writing style is good and for that reason I give him two stars rather than one . His research was patchy and one-sided and he does n't reveal any new information.I have to agree with all the other negative reviews of this book . Like so many teams full of superstars , it fell flat . I 'd recommend anyone who was disappointed with it to get a copy of Simon Kuper 's excellent book , `` Football against the Enemy , '' or `` The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro , '' by Joe McGinniss , which is a magnificent read .	-1
Good Soldier , but not a good book . Outstanding performance in OEF and OIF , but this book is too long and too boring . Regretfully , I can not recommend this book to any of my active duty or retired military friends .	-1
`` The Constitution . . . is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary , which they may twist and shape into any form they please . '' Thomas JeffersonBeing rather middle of the road on these subjects I was generally shocked by the content of the book . # ... # Probably the best , but most tedious part of his book is all of the examples . Over 300 solid pages of thousands of illustrations , all carefully documented , makes one wonder why no major news outlet is not reporting on this problem . This should be a page one story for the news-media who proclaim the first amendment as their shield . Perhaps if reporters were to read the amendment they would understand that Freedom of the Press is inexorably linked to Freedom of Religion . Erode one and the erosion of the other will surly follow.To read this book one must distances themselves from their ideology . If you can do that then you can easily see how Christians in this country would feel discriminated against . The title ` Persecution ' , as many have pointed out is a little excessive , but that should in no way negate the effects of the vast pernicious discrimination . Limbaugh does a good job in showing those on the ideological left who claim tolerance are really the MOST intolerant of any beliefs outside of their own . The hypocrisy is extant and miasmic.The question he fails to answer is why have these secularist launched a holy jihad against Christianity ? Metaphysical reasons aside it would seem to this reviewer that they do not want their personal conduct to be judged . That is what this holy war is all about . If Christianity is allowed to be discussed in the public arena then questions about abortion , drug use , sexual orientation , or other moral dilemmas will be open for discussion . Above all secularists do not want open discussion , in fact they fear open discussion of ideas more than almost anything else , that is because they want a moral anarchy to exist , where adults can do anything they please by invoking the call of personal freedom.We have already seen the destructiveness of moral breakdowns since the 1960 's , children born out of wedlock which is the primary cause of poverty , the rampant drug use which is the primary cause of violent crime along with many other breakdowns in the liberal ` it 's all about me ' society . Of course the left has no answers or even compassion for those humans ' lives that are destroyed and discarded in their selfish quest for personal nirvana . They show only contempt , what a disgraceful and sad commentary.To sum things up this country was founded on Judeo-Christian philosophy not on a particular religion . It is obvious to any clear thinking American # those who have not been propagandized by their ideology # that spirituality and Judeo-Christian philosophy were main ingredients that gave us the Constitution . Simply put historical revisionist and antireligious fanatics are tearing down what the Founders relied upon ; moral clarity . But do n't take my word for it , ponder the sage advice given by the founding fathers themselves : '' God who gave us life gave us liberty . Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god ? '' Thomas Jefferson '' We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion . . . . Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people . It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other . '' John Adams '' I therefore beg leave to move - that henceforth , prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessing on our deliberations , be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business , and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service . '' Benjamin Franklin to the constitutional convention . `` We have staked the whole future of American civilization , not upon the power of government , far from it . We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government ; upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves , to control ourselves , to sustain ourselves according to THE TEN COMMANDMENTS . '' James Madison '' America was not founded by religionist but by Christians . It was not founded upon religions but upon the gospel of Jesus Christ '' Patrick HenryGood Job Mr. Limbaugh	-1
After reading the reviews for this book , I really looked forward to a well-written autobiography of a man who had , as his claim to fame , a familial relationship to one of the most controversial political families in my lifetime , and life experiences I could feel inspired by.I was sorely disappointed by the meandering , unfocused writing `` style '' of the author . Perhaps I just found that I did n't care for the personality of Christopher Lawford and the biting , narcissistic perspective he displays , but his prose is sorely lacking in merit as well . Having never heard of him until the release of his book , I can say I had no previous opinion of him . I read through a few chapters which were frustrating , almost indecipherable paragraphs that moved back and forth through the most minute details of whatever memories Lawford could dredge up . Do I really need to know that Peter Lawford preferred to dress by putting his socks on first , or that he once put a sock on his genitals ? What 's the point ? This book could have been a beautiful , personal account of the life Christopher Lawford as an individual with a life worth hearing about . Instead , it is yet another attempt to cash in on whatever celebrity he can eke out of being a Kennedy cousin . I left the book behind when I checked out of my hotel .	-1
I 'm an accomplished `` home '' cook . First I made `` St Johns ' Eve Pasta '' which had easily a half cup more breadcrumbs that needed in the recipe.It made the recipe . `` Way too Dry '' Secondly , we spent an hour making Malloreddus with Fennel Seeds and Tomatoes with the saffron semolina pasta . The pasta is terrific , but once again 1 TB of red pepper flakes made me choke.DIANE FRIEDMAN	-1
Having read several of Mr. Margolin 's previous books , I found this story much weaker than the other stories , and so implausible as to be exasperating . This is a defense attorney 's silly fantasy in which all defendants in the account ( at least five distinct legal proceedings ) are actually innocent ; they are only being prosecuted because of craven malice on the part of the police , the DA 's office and the criminalist . Granted that the villain is falsifying evidence , you would think that at least in SOME of the cases the defendants would actually have committed the crimes of which they have been accused .	-1
As with the other two-star reviewers , I have to reluctantly agree that this is a pretty poor book , very badly written and with a ridiculous unbelievable plot and one-dimensional characters.As I have enjoyed other of his books , I ca n't imagine what got into him to produce such a shabbily-written book . Was he strapped for money , half-drunk , or just not caring when he churned out this terrible tome ? It was difficult to finish it , and when I did I could only wonder why I bothered .	-1

A couple of years ago we watched the movie with Will Smith playing Chris Gardner and were filled with admiration at the persistance and perseverance that Chris was portrayed as having . However , the movie only encompasses about 50 pages of the 350+ page book . And the movie eliminates the foul mouth and insatiable sex drive of the leading character.We tend to read a good book aloud and after a third of the way through the book , my husband asked me to please just `` skip the F*** words and S*** words as they detracted so much from the power of the telling . I had to agree with him . We had fallen deeply in respect with Chris Gardner when we watched the film and were pretty convinced that there was much too free a license of profanity and gratuitous sex in his relating of the story . This is NOT a book that should be read by children or teens and yet the movie was a powerful witness of the triumph of the human Spirit and dream and suitable for older children to watch.This book comes with a multi star `` caution '' .	-1
Recently , I picked up a book written by an author I did n't recognize . Myrren 's Gift by Fiona McIntosh was published by EOS publishers , a division of Harper Collins . The author lives in Australia and the book first circulated there.This story is a fantasy and part of a trilogy called The Quickening.The plot in a nutshell : The story revolves around a young man , Wyl . He inherits a high ranking position in the king 's army . The antagonist is the king 's heir . Wyl shows mercy on a dying witch , Myrren . This witch then gives Wyl a gift.The gift protects Wyl 's soul and basically , he ca n't die until his life is where Myrren believes it should be ( although , you do n't find out that last tidbit until book 2 ) . When someone kills Wyl , his soul is yanked from the dying body and enters the body of the one who killed him . This premise is very interesting . The story kept my attention simply because I was interested in seeing how the `` body swapping '' would progress . The antagonist plays his part well , the reader hates him . Although , the antagonist is almost too much . There are no redeeming qualities , there is nothing about the antagonist that makes him seem real to me . He 's just there to be as evil as possible to give the hero someone to fight.I read book one and book two and I 'll probably finish the trilogy . I really hate leaving a story unfinished . However , there are some definite cons to this series . First , the first book starts with characters jumping point-of-view halfway through a paragraph . I do n't mind pov switches ... but I like them broken by chapter or at least scene . The first few chapters include so much exposition and back story I found it surprising the book was published . This is a trilogy that includes quite a bit of tell , not show . There were so many uses of `` was '' and `` had '' I kept thinking ... `` wow , ok , my writer buddies would be all over this . '' There are some plot holes and some things that just strike a wrong tone with me.One of the main characters is a young gong boy , age 10 , very small who cleans the poop shoot . I enjoy the character and I think he 's interesting ... BUT , there is no way he ever , EVER appears to be a child . His thoughts , his speech , his behavior , his acceptance - all sound like an adult . Even if he had a hard life , even if he was gifted with some special ability ... I just could n't suspend my belief on that character.If you like body swapping stories or if you are on the lookout for a new trilogy to read . You may want to give this trilogy a shot . I think the 2nd book was written a little better and hopefully future books would be tighter and flow better . I probably wo n't read anything more of this author , but I 'm sure others will enjoy it . Oh , I should add a little warning though . This is definitely mature content , it includes torture and rape . In fact , Wyl gets raped while he 's a woman ... or at least , I think he was raped . It gets a little confusing around that part . I was n't very comfortable with it and it left a sour taste in my mouth.Here 's an excerpt from early in book one . The story is mostly in Wyl 's point-of-view but bounces around to whoever is near Wyl . In this scene Celimus , the heir , has defeated Wyl in a competition and he 's claiming `` virgin 's blood '' - he wants to take Ylena , Wyl 's sister , to bed before she marries Wyl 's best friend : Magnus opened his eyes and nodded , hardly daring to believe that Wyl might have taken his hint as to how to foil Celimus 's plan.Wyl straightened . `` Sire , apologies , I do believe there has been a misunderstanding here. '' '' Oh ? '' Magnus replied , hope suddenly flaring in his heart.Wyl nodded gravely . He looked at Celimus . `` My Prince , as her only living relative , I can not permit you to choose Ylena . `` Celimus 's smile faltered , turning into a sneer . `` I 'm not sure your familial ties override the royal claim , Thirsk . Step aside . `` Gueryn 's eyes narrowed . He had no idea what was going on here and he could only pray that Wyl knew what he was doing .	-1
I just could NOT get into this one.I will try again someday . Maybe.I love his other books ... . so worth one more look .	-1
I liked this book okay only because I had to repeatedly skip sections and whole pages to move on to the next topic . Over and over it was describing why this situation was so bad . Over and over it was explained how it was in the cell . Do n't get me wrong I know you have to have a description of everything to tell the story , but every other page is his anguish over what his brother did to him , why he did it , what would everyone think and how no matter what he could n't touch a woman who did not belong to him even though he is the rightful heir and he is the one who married her . He was feeling guilty for taking his brothers would be wife but the fact that his brother was a first class creep was at times conveiniently forgotten . UGH ! ! !	-1
Sadly , the character of the author , as revealed by his prattling narrative , does little to educate the reader regarding seamanship . Or perhaps , it serves as a warning and a signpost for other would-be voyagers on the type of character to avoid when going to sea.If this book had been written by George Fairhurst , perhaps real knowledge and wisdom of the sea might have found their way to warrant ink and paper.This is one of the least-enjoyable books on sailing I have read .	-1
The author uses a very bad writing technique : he starts the battle , then goes into a long diversion about British history , or the history of the British , Spanish or French Navies , or previous battles , or the histories of the people involved in the battle . Then he inches closer to the battle and interrupts with another long disgression . This removes virtually all drama from the story until finally , at the end , he allows the battle to commence . Here he takes great pains to stress blood and gore -- way more than necssary . I am sure there are much better stories of this battle than this one .	-1
I bought this book for myself and my mate of 45 years , after hearing the author on NPR . She sounded innovative and interesting in the interview . Sadly , the book is the opposite . This is a writer with one essential idea : intimacy and desire are at cross purposes with each other . In case you think this is a new idea , you have only to remember age-old quotes like `` familiarity breeds contempt '' to recall that this is a very OLD idea.The author makes this one point over an over again , starting with the introduction , and then repeating herself , in slightly different words ( or sometimes even the same words ) throughout the book.She makes a very spare number of specific recommendations to address the dilemma of intimacy and desire : ( 1 ) Do n't assume you know everything about your partner , and cultivate a certain amount of mystery ; ( 2 ) Do n't expect desire to be `` spontaneous '' - it can be kindled just as well ( or better ) through forethought , scheduling and careful planning - just like a great meal or a long-ago date ; ( 3 ) Sexual fantasy is ok ; and ( 4 ) imaginary or real third parties add spice to relationships - a little jealousy is a good thing , and do n't take your partner for granted.OK . That 's the book . If you want to read a lot of her chatty case studies , or hear her repeat herself over and over again , buy the book . The writer is in dire need of an editor . But then again , if she eliminated the repetition , the book could be reduced to one page , or even one paragraph , and there is no money in that kind of efficiency !	-1
This is a book which has been much hyped in the SF news literature , and some critics have given it extremely generous praise . I am sorry to say that much of this praise has been far too generous.It is true that this novel is based on several fascinating conceits : a world being invaded by alien beings who are slowly but inexorably expanding their domain despite all attempts to stop them ; the invasion is fought by a group of near gods raised to immortality by an emperor . The novel is told , in first person view , from one of those near-gods ; a very flawed and addicted Mercury-like individual.However , the fantasy land in which these conceits are set is totally unrealized , which means that readers have little investment in what happens to it . Moreover , the vast majority of characters in the novel are little more than names on the page ; only two characters are fully realized , and neither one is particularly attractive . Moreover , the novel has in it a strange parallel universe world that is not well explained or fully fit into the setting . It is at best distracting.I wanted to like this novel quite a bit , but in the end , I found that it lacked what a fantasy novel needs above all else : a verisimilitude of setting and characters that will anchor you to the created world and cause you to care about what happens within it .	-1
In the town of Market Chipping in the land of Ingary , Sophie Hatter seems condemned to a boring and uneventful life , being the oldest of 3 sisters . Even her name seems to imprison her into running the family hat shop after her father dies , and her stepmother takes over the destinies of her and her two sisters , Lettie and Martha . While the other two move on to other lives , Sophie sits , working diligently with little reward and probably the future of being an unmarried spinster before her . That is , until the Witch of the Waste comes into her shop , and believing that Sophie has been rude to her , changes the young and pretty Sophie into an 90-something old crone . Not wishing to reveal what has happened to her to Lettie and Martha , she leaves the town and runs smack into the Moving Castle of Howl , a fearsome and supposedly woman-eating wizard ! Along with his apprentice Michael , and the fire demon Calcifer , Sophie must learn how to break the spell on herself and also learn how to survive a close encounter with Howl himself.I came to this book after seeing and enjoying the anime version of this novel by the great Japanese director Miyazaki . I have to say that the novel suffered in comparison . Frankly , this novel was a little dull and lacked any suspense . The Witch of the Waste especially suffered from a lack of characterization . The motivations of the characters also seemed to lack any sense of urgency . `` Oh well , I 'm an old lady . No rush to change me back '' . `` I 'm enslaved by Howl , no rush to free me . '' Sophie and Howl also acted like 5 year olds most of the time , being spiteful , hateful , and crude most of the time . I did n't like them . Flat out . Romance was completely dead here and the whole thing just puttered along with mediocre writing until it ended .	-1
I had a try at reading this book when I was 25 or so because I was told it was wonderful . I did n't get very far . I found it boring . Just the other day I found it in a thrift shop for $ 1 so I thought I would try againStill boring , but I am an old fart now with more time to kill , so I persevered.I really wonder if People who give rave reviews , would want to be like these characters . But then , anyone who writes a review here has disqualified themselves already . Others , I guess , get some kind of vicarious thrill out of reading of their exploits which consist mostly of bar hopping , listening to music , chasing girls , and ripping people off . I have no problem with that , it 's a valid diversion . If they just got on with the drinking and screwing I would be fine with it . it 's just that the flowery prose on how everything they `` dig '' is so over the top wonderful , rings pretty hollow when you look at it.There is a lot of Cervantes in this tale . The true reality around them must be elevated , at all times , to impossible levels of wonder . I mean for God sake ... Look at the authors description of Hollywood ... or for that matter of Bakersfield ! Dean as an anti-hero is particularly boring . After the first chapter , you can predict what he will do all the rest of the way . Blah , blah , blah ... But I guess that goes for the rest of the characters also.The self centered blather and dazzling `` insights '' that the characters keep talking about throughout the book , kind of reminded me of some of the Facebook sites I have run into . The `` see how more deeply I can feel than ordinary human beings '' tone of the narrative struck me as just plain silly.To me the characters seemed to be trying awfully hard to convince themselves that they were having `` kicks '' .So you folks who say it changed your life ... maybe it did.I hope it did n't change it in the direction of the self centered jerks portrayed in the book . Probably not or you would now be a drunk , a drug addict , in jail or at least would n't have many friends.Anyway if Dean and friends seem free and romantic to you then , next time you are robbed , or someone wrecks your car , or you get exploited for sex or money , or some one walks off and leaves you in a bad situation , then dig it ! It 's just one of those free spirits having kicks ! A classic it is ( only by default ) great literature it ai n't	-1
Either the emperor has no clothes or I cant see them , and I think the former is correct.I am glad I read this book after having head about it for 35 years . That is the best thing I can say about it.It is a very adolescent book . It reminds me of sitting with my 20 year old nephews and listening to them talk ( sex drugs and rock and roll and not a whole lot else ) . It reminds me of being 20 and traveling across the country . Of coming from a big city and seeing noting but regular folks , and finding all of the hicks met in the wild west to be wonderfully interesting . Not much of interest happens to the characters . The writer does not have the gift to keep you engaged . I marvel that this book is considered a classic . I know it came out some 60 years ago , but Jack would not have a hope in hell of getting this published much less read today . It is kind of like listening to a really bad Bob Dylan song . The difference being Dylan had lots of great songs and this is Kerouac 's Blowin ' in the Wind.I recently purchased four `` classics '' . In Cold Blood , 1984 , Fahrenheit 451 , and On The Road . The only one of these that is a great book is In Cold Blood . The others may be considered great because of their ideas contained or their timeliness . But of the four only In Cold Blood does n't need crutches . Perhaps Capote is the only `` great writer '' of the four . Orwell and Bradbury being idea men , and Kerouac being some adolescent fluke ( a Miley Ray Cyrus of his literary time ) .	-1
I usually like classics , and was excited to read a book about being on the road and traveling . I tried reading it when I was 16 and never finished it , so I thought maybe I was just too young to care . Now I remember why I did n't . I am so bored reading this book , and I do not like the characters at all . What 's so freeing to read about a guy who just bums off of everybody and has to keep asking for money from his aunt ? That 's not inspiring . I 'm disappointed this book is n't any better for me . I made it a little further this time ( halfway ) but I am not going to finish it , and am going to retire trying .	-1
It is impossible to imagine why any reader would enjoy this book unless they too long for Neal Cassady to tickle their prostate . This wretched exercise in homoerotic mythopoetics is almost exclusively based on Kerouac 's infatuation with Cassady , a by-all-accounts beautiful young man who was , meanwhile , little more than a bisexual , car-stealing , alcoholic , drug-addled punk.Towards the end of the book , as Kerouac lies ill in Mexico and Cassady , quickie divorce from his wife in hand , abandons him to head back to New York & amp ; marry anew , we ca n't help feeling that Kerouac 's gotten what he deserved.But the epitaph for this & quot ; novel & quot ; must , inevitably , be Truman Capote 's brilliant bon mot , On the Road & quot ; is n't writing ; it 's typing. & quot ; An immensely stupid and unwarrantedly respected piece of dreck.GRADE : F	-1
In 1992 , while a graduate student , I decided to discover the real America by setting off on a road trip - from Berkeley to Austin Texas . I was joined by a neurotic New Yorker and a Mexican citizen , both of whom happened to hanging about the student co-op house on Durant Avenue . I had met only days before they volunteered to come along for the ride and , as I had had hoped , share the costs.It turned out the Mexican had no money at all , and was overstaying his visa . The New Yorker had money and was certainly legal , but drove me crazy anyway over next 4 days as we drove through the Mohave Desert , lit illegal campfires in the Grand Canyon and got stuck without gas in the mountains of New Mexico . Thankfully , we were able to coast dowhill to a town which seemed only to have one gas station , one person and one dog in the entire place . After 3 days of driving we reached Texas late at night . Next morning a searing sun , the kind I had last seen only in India , woke us up early . While driving later on I-10 , near Sierra Blanca , next to the Mexican Border , an INS checkpoint relieved us of one of my two companions , putting him on a deportation bus to Mexico . Thankfully , he took it a lot better than the New Yorker or I did . The New Yorker went nuts and started blabbing about 'hicks ' in a nearby restaurant . There were guns and cattle heads on display above our heads , and lemonade was being served in mayonnaise jars . But the clearly Texan clientele calmly regarded the dark skinned Indian and New York Jew in hawaii shirt shorts dissing their culture.anyway , more about that trip later , in some other place ( the return to California , through Durango , Colorado , and Moab , Utah , and then the 'Loneliest Road in America ' US 50 , to triple flip car crash that nearly killed me near Fallon , Nevada ) ... I had hoped to read 'On the Road ' and recapture the spirit of my trip , in words perhaps better than my own . I was slightly disappointed . A beat ( ific ) writer in the 50s probably sees and looks for different things than I did . In any case , I found the story line dull , the writing passable , and the observations on the meaning of life to be fairly meaningless.Dont bother with this book , if you really want to get to some of the philosophical mood of hitting the road , just rent 'Easy Rider ' .	-1
I can picture Ann Hathaway and Meryl Streep in this movie . Oh , that 's right , it 's already been done . Too many parallels to the original , and poor character development . Easy read , annoyingly simplistic main character .	-1
Nevare gives himself over to the Speck magic , and this book is spent mostly under the influence of his `` other half '' `` Soldier 's Boy '' while the `` Nevare '' half of his soul is pushed around and silenced . This makes for a confusing , frustrating read as pages upon pages are written between the spiritual struggle of the two halves without anything really interesting happening . We are given insight into the Speck world and their `` Great Ones '' , hugely fat sorcerers that do nothing but eat and have feeders so that they eat the stuff that makes them the fattest ( and thus getting fat with magic ) . The fatter the sorcerer , the more powerful and Nevare/Soldier 's Boy is determined to be the fattest of all so he can somehow save both his human people and the Specks . The whole thing reads like a primitive food lover 's guide as they stuff themselves with every kind of mushroom and fantasy fruit imaginable . The Great Ones are like giant human slugs ( Jabba the Hut , yes ) . Of course near the end he manages to break free from his turmoil and perhaps save some of the people he cares about . Why ca n't the Specks see him near the end ( they can see other humans , magic or no magic ) ? Why did Lisana make that last grab for eternity with Nevare when she already had a piece of him already ? ( this was really at odds with her personality in the book ) .Confusing and just plain awful to read . Would not call this an `` epic '' by any stretch of the imagination .	-1
Though I read the whole series , I did n't particularly enjoy it . I 'm not sure what kept me going , but I think it was my loyalty to the author . I 'm a huge fan of her other series , including Liveship and Assassin/Farseer.This series could have been written by another author . The characters were too few , and too simple . One of my most favorite things about Hobb 's books are that her characters are so dynamic . You can relate to them , they change over time , and there are so many . While technically this world is as creative and as original as her others , I did n't find the overall reading experience pleasurable . Most of the time I was bored or irritated with the characters and storylines.If you are a fan of Hobb and looking to explore this series , I 'd say you are better off missing out . If you are new to the author , PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD start with another of her trilogies .	-1
I do n't understand all of the rave reviews.There were too many characters . Several chapters in , I still could n't remember the names of every single person featured in this book . It seems these women have no lives besides pregnancies and bitching at their husbands . Stereotypical and trashy , unflattering and slow . For being older women , they act like their daughters : high school girls who only value immaturity and superficiality . Seriously , I do n't distinguish between the two groups.Besides that , everything else is just predictable and cliche . Would not recommend to anybody .	-1
It must be crap ! I would n't buy this book to use as TP .	-1
This is just ridiculously dishonest . Goldberg denounces slandering , the decadence of political dialogue , the hateful atmosphere - and goes on to compiling a list so partisan that he needs laughably convoluted explaining for his choices . He tries to impregnate against criticism by stating at the onset that this list is `` personal '' . But it is n't just personal , it 's insulting the intelligence of every honest reader.A list with demagogic Michael Moore on top - but n o Ann Coulter ? With unfriendly-to-his-guests Al Franken - but n o t Bill O'Reilly ? With the oh so biased CBS or the New York Times - but n o t Fox News or the Washington Times ? And , for cryin ' out loud , with Barbara Streisand ... ! ? Cheez , dear conservatives , you do n't believe that yourself , do you ? But it must be good entertainment and I guess even a Bernhard Goldberg has to earn his living : I was old and stupid but I needed the money . More of it.So Goldberg joins the ever growing crowd of , ahem , authors like Dick Morris or Edward Klein which changed side to henceforth copy-paste quick and easy pamphlets for the insatiable appetite of the right wing . What 's amazing is n't really that they 're doing it but that their readers are swallowing the same tales over and over and over again.Enjoy !	-1
Probably enjoyable for those of you that are not brave enough to get your info from anything other than Faux News.Or for those of you in love with the boy president and his total screw up in Iraq .	-1
What 's the proper recourse to this mind-numbing drivel ? To write a book about the top 100 conservatives who are ruining America ... with a few token ( and blatantly obvious ) liberals thrown in there ? It really boggles my mind that so many people prefer a growing divided America , by devouring these hate-filled piles of trash , over a united America . People like Goldberg pander to the lazy and weak-minded . If you 're one of those , I fully expect a five star rating . Enjoy .	-1
I have read -- and enjoyed -- every other book the Armistead Maupin has written . I loved all of the tales and his subsequent non-tales novels . So when I saw this listed and read the `` starred '' reviews I immediately ordered the book.Alas , glowing reviews notwithstanding , I was sorely disappointed in the book . The plot was thin to the point of anorexia . The description of the relationship of an aging gay man ( the living Michael Tolliver of the title ) and a younger one was ho-hum and the characters , with the exception of the indomitable Anna Madrigal ( about whom not enough was said ) just did n't have any of the life and charm of Maupin 's earlier subjects . Michael Tolliver et al were much better left alive only in the readers ' memories and imagination . Michael Tolliver may live , but Maupin was n't able to make this reader care .	-1
The book reminds me of white bread . Lots of fluff , sugar , air . But deucedly little substance.The book starts with 40 pages ( ! ! ! ! ) of bull . . . a sales pitch about how great the book is and what you 'll learn later in the book . Along with endless useless anecdotes about his family selling on ebay . I am reminded of a cross between a carnival barker and a scam artist.Eventually we actually get into selling on ebay , but it is short of substance.The book is SEVERELY outdated , evidently published in 2005 but actually written well before then . Much of the info is incorrect or misleading . His comments on photos and digital cameras are ludicrous.The author admits , rather brags , about some gamey behavior , such as his tricks for removing bad feedback by misleading the customer as to what to write.Problems throughout with some pretty slipshod typesetting.If you removed the rah rah rah , baloney , horse manure , the book would be half the size.Oh , yeah , there 's plenty of space devoted to sales pitches for his own software packages and services to help you get rich overnight on ebay.Did I mention it is severely outdated ?	-1
who thought this book was one ego-driven story after another ? I really could n't finish it - I do n't think there was one superlative that she did n't use in describing herself . And to think I had a Julia Mattel doll when I was a wee lassie !	-1
Why would the authors dislike Michael Moore since about 75 % of the Republican Party consists of `` big fat stupid white men '' ? Just check out the delegates in NYC . Other than the clothing , I challenge anyone to distinguish between Michael Moore and any of the GOP faithful at least on a physical basis , which seems to be the author 's criteria for criticizing other people . When can we expect Laura Ingraham is a Skinny Whiny Stupid White Woman ?	-1
Rather than actually defend the indefensible administration currently in office ( you have to wonder if real Republicans feel sick to their stomachs trying to defend Bush and his co-thieves ) , the writers of this book attack with baseless lies and other moron-icisms . Do n't waste your money . Instead , go buy one of Moore 's books or see Farenheit 9/11 . Much better use of your money and time .	-1
I have only read the first book in this series ( Revenge of the Witch ) and so do not know if the not so subtle misogyny works itself out in later books in a more hopeful and nuanced way . While the writing is wonderful , the plot gripping , it would be unfortunate if young men ( or women ) were to read this book without an attendant history lesson from their parents . My 10 year old read picked it up but I read it first , then my 14 year old . We talked about how the book portrays women as at best mysterious and often evil , with male characters only stupid and manipulated rather than evil , or the heroes of the tale . Again , I 'm hopeful that later books in the series do something to explain why it 's only female witches that need to be locked in a hole in the ground as a `` charitable '' alternative to being burned at the stake . The book 's writing and plot deserve five stars but as a book for children , its rating needs downgrading .	-1
I ca n't particularly think of much good to say about this book . I would n't say it was downright horribly bad ... well , maybe not . It was a waste of $ 7 , though.The plot is n't exactly original . A serial killer meeting victims online ? Kinda old . Not that I 've read a book with that exact plot before , but it 's still a pretty common idea . And there was nothing to this storyline to separate it from anything else out there . It was all pretty basic and lacking a hook to really draw a reader it . Then again , this was mostly a romance , not a suspense . The plot was secondary . Even so , it was n't a great plot.The romance was n't too bad . But pretty average . Nothing special . The characters were okay . I did n't love them , but I did n't hate them . They were just there . No particular draws either way . The sex scenes were average . They seemed to start off hot , but then kind of fizzled . There were some comedic points , but - to use the word again - they were average.By far the worst part of this book was the writing itself . At times it made me want to bash my head against a wall . It was like reading a step-by-step manual . Gibson had this awful habit of describing each and everything thing a character did . Sort of like : He turned off his car and grabbed his notebook and laptop off the passenger seat . He carried Lucy 's suitcase with his free hand , and she followed him into the house . He set his files and computer on the kitchen table and turned on the lights as they moved down the hall to the spare room . He tossed her suitcase on the queen-sized bed ... '' There were so many scenes like that in the books ... he did this , he did that , she did this , she did that . Always stated in the same , dull , trite way . It was so irritating and boring . I do n't need to know the details of how a person got out of their car and walked to a store , or how they got dressed in the morning . And even so , her sentence struture had no variety or complexity in these scenes . There are so many better ways to convey scenes like that . I just could n't keep my head in the book when the writing was so uninspiring.Overall , a completely lackluster book . Not worth the time or the money . I read one of her books before , and I remember enjoying it , but that was over a year ago , and I was n't quiet so critical then.Rating : 2 / 5	-1

I have a 26-month-old who is on par with 5-year-olds for his vocabulary . He loves books , and mostly longer books that tell a story . I saw this at the library and decided to see what the hype was about . I was so confused as to why this is rated so high . My son asked me `` Mama , what 's mush ? '' Um ... ..I did n't know what to say . What is mush ? Is that even a noun ? I know mushy is adjective of course . Then the `` old lady '' aka a rabbit - so confusing ! My son again asked `` what 's an old lady ? '' Well an old lady IS N'T a knitting rabbit . He clearly knows what a rabbit/bunny is . He knows what a noise is , since he always asks `` What 's that noise ? '' when he hears something . At the end when the author writes `` Goodnight noises everywhere '' makes no sense.All in all , I think this book is confusing and detrimental to a toddlers vocabulary . So glad I did n't pay for this one and I recommend you do n't either ! There are books out there that are so much better and valuable !	-1
I thought I would love this book . The author is the marketing person behind the book A Purpose Driven Life , one of the more successful book launches in the 21st century . When I read about the subject matter of this book , I though it would be a great `` how I did it '' book discussing the means in which his publishing company used viral marketing to spread the word about this highly successfully and personal book . While he did do this , the author felt it necessary to use the analogy of starting a fire , and keeping a fire going to explain his take on viral marketing . While this would not be a problem in itself , he never let go of his simplistic analogies.I had a further problem with this book . The author compares his selling and marketing of the book to Jesus Christ 's selling and marketing of his religious beliefs to the believers and the non-believers . I have a problem with this type of analogy . I think comparing Christ to a bookseller is a bit of a stretch , and a bit simplistic . All that being said , there are some useable messages in this book , and it is worth reading . But you will read a lot of unnecessary words to get to the meat of the message , so you will have to cut through it like unwanted fat on a steak .	-1
This book goes solidly into the `` not for me '' pile . I did n't find Lisick 's alternative lifestyle interesting , or humorous , or in the least bit respectable or necessary . I 'm sure it would appeal to some , hence the two stars instead of just one , but in my case , I 'm just glad it 's off of my to-be-read shelf .	-1

This may be relevant to people considering this book : The Boston Globe 8/12/2010Harvard University psychologist Marc Hauser -- a well-known scientist and author of the book `` Moral Minds '' -- is taking a year-long leave after a lengthy internal investigation found evidence of scientific misconduct in his laboratory . The findings have resulted in the retraction of an influential study that he led . `` MH accepts responsibility for the error , '' says the retraction of the study on whether monkeys learn rules , which was published in 2002 in the journal Cognition . Two other journals say they have been notified of concerns in papers on which Hauser is listed as one of the main authors . It is unusual for a scientist as prominent as Hauser -- a popular professor and eloquent communicator of science whose work has often been featured on television and in newspapers -- to be named in an investigation of scientific misconduct . His research focuses on the evolutionary roots of the human mind . In a letter Hauser wrote this year to some Harvard colleagues , he described the inquiry as painful . The letter , which was shown to the Globe , said that his lab has been under investigation for three years by a Harvard committee , and that evidence of misconduct was found . He alluded to unspecified mistakes and oversights that he had made , and said he will be on leave for the upcoming academic year .	-1
Mr. Boteach , what planet are you writing about ? Is it sometype of fantasyland , where woman are subservant to men . That their place is in the home ? ? ? ? I picked up this book in a Bookstore thinking that it was an interesting title , but inside was the most contrived tripe.He blames woman , for the sexual problems in this country.. Enough already..We get it already , woman should go back to the home , worship at the feet of men , and beg men , becasue they are forgetful , to be intimate with them ... .I did n't buy this book and ca n't suggested it to anyone .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in this book , from reading her previous books , I was expecting this to be a good one . This book is more of a fantasy book than a historical book . The plot is lukewarm , the characters are lukewarm . I had to fast forward a few pages every now and then . I recommend anyone to bypass this book , and it looks like she 's going to go with this theme for awhile since she 's writing about Sebastian 's siblings . this is more like a fairy tale than a romance novel .	-1

She 's giving things up that the majority of Americans do n't even have the monies to buy and patting herself on the back . What I found more interesting were the number of 5-starred reviews HERE that all tend to read the same . Checking each of them , the majority of the 5-starred reviews are - guess what ? - the ONLY review by that reader . It looks like the author has gone from cluttering her life to cluttering amazon with falsified reviews .	-1
The book purports to contrast lives and attitudes of rich and poor in Indian society . If there is a social point to be made , it 's camouflaged in a purely fictional family relationships that include no effect of either history or religion . Any residue of the the caste system is ignored . The protagonist switching from hating Muslims to hating politicians could be a story of great interest . It must be a conclusion from another book . Other subject matter , pregnancy , abortion , AIDS and marital abuse is well buried in kitchen and bathroom prattle . Three generations , one like the other , and repetition of dinner episodes with changing partners precludes any character analysis . There 's one sexual episode , undoubtedly written at the behest of the publisher.Timing of the milieu in Bombay is difficult to place . Why is it referred to as Mumbai only once ? There 's an allusion to Indian communism , but another to Tata Motors probably places it later . I do n't suppose it matters to the target audience . A couple of statements about Parsi nationalism , right or wrong , are made without any substance . Occasionally sparing a phrase or two from the culinary babble for social commentary , Umrigar touches very lightly on ethnicity of Hindus , Muslims , Parsis ( ethnic Iranians ) and Pashtuns ( ethnic Afghans ) . The comment , relating Jewish right to Palestine to a Parsi right to Iran is entirely void of substantiation in this book . Again it 's a deviation to a subject matter of no apparent interest to her readership.Simply written , the book reads like an over long Dick and Jane tutorial , with an excessively small vocabulary . At one point I tried to amuse myself by counting four syllable words . There are some , but they are well spaced . The Indian vocabulary is limited to culinary and terms of endearment . Perhaps a reader can relieve boredom by finding an exception or two.The great insight of the title is apparently justified by closing the gap between people for a hug . Only in the last chapter is there a pretense of literary symbolism or a meaning that is n't spelled out in excruciatingly simplistic detail . The protagonist buys and releases a bunch of colored balloons before wading ankle deep into the sea . By that time I was beyond caring about any interpretation . Does grandma wade further ? That interpretation is contradicted by a statement signifying a restart of her heart , making the conclusion as banal as the rest.Over numerous characters are thinly drawn . Issues of interest are so fragmentary as to read like they were inserted by mistake . No space between us is as wide as the quality drop to this novel from `` Passage to India . '' In future , when my book club selection is voted exclusively by the female members , I 'll not bother to read it .	-1
Raymond Feist 's original Magician was in many respects such a gem of a book because it used a world that was normal enough to be relate-able with just a few twists to make it interesting . Feist has been twisting and tweaking that world ever since , and it has come to a point with Wrath of a Mad God where it is essentially broken , disfigured beyond any semblance of reality . There is little way for the reader to relate to the world any longer , and nearly everything dealt with is simply alien . I suppose this is fine if you 're seeking utter escapism , but it almost forces you to sink into the action rather than the universe this way , which is like trying to be entertained by non-stop explosions instead of finding a way to enjoy whatever life offers.Moreover , initially Feist wrote in such a way as to follow characters with some depth , flaws , and layers , but he has increasingly turned away from character-driven to event-driven plots and populated the world with generic figures that even he does n't know what to do with . This trilogy began with Tad and Zane , but by the end , Feist had all but forgotten about them and turned them to shells of people . Then , for what seems little reason , he introduces from nowhere yet one more semi-phenomenal player with amazing abilities in Jim Dasher , whose one weakness poses no actual threat to him . Wrath of a Mad God 's characters are simply flat.The previous novel began to devolve at the end so that the narrative kept jumping from setting to setting and character to character every two to three pages . One might argue that this was to heighten the sense of urgency and action , but Wrath of a Mad God uses this same technique in the middle of the book , and it just feels choppy . I felt like I was getting literary whiplash from being jerked from scene to scene.And let us not forget the random side-plot that was thrown in at the Peaks of the Quot that had only the most tenuous connection to the rest of the book . It might have been set up for later books , but what I can find suggests that Feist completely dropped it . I must admit , though , that dropping it was a positive considering that it is nothing but a rehashing of the lifestone plotline in a new form , making me question whether the author 's creativity has simply run out . Plus , with the introduction of the anoredhel , it feels as if when Feist grows uncertain of what to do , he just adds another race of elves like a floundering chef , tossing spices into the pot with the hopes that they will enhance the quality of the dish . I understand that this is the foundation for the following trilogy as well , compounding the problem.Finally , various plot points were problematic in of themselves . First , some were contradictory to previous books in the series . For example , the Minwanabi ominously are returned to the series despite their destruction , though do n't actually end up causing any problems . Other plot points were simply confusing . I still do n't really understand what happened at various fairly important points despite reading the paragraphs several times before giving up and moving on . Things were often wrapped up quickly and in unclear prose with little reflection following . Even the characters seemed to feel little emotions in response to the closing events or at least no impetus to talk about them with one another . It felt like the author knew what was happening but was n't concerned with communicating it clearly and simply wanted to finish up and move on.The narrative to the book was , ignoring the sections where it pinballed from scene to scene , sufficiently good to keep me reading , but after it ended , upon reflection , I grew more and more frustrated with the book . I 'll not insult Feist by saying it was a tale told by an idiot , but I 'll definitely aver that it was full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .	-1
The third and final book in this trilogy of sisters who were kidnapped as babies from their courtesan mother is such a disappointment . And this is coming from an author who has years of experience writing enjoyable historical romances . When you have constant eye rolling by the third chapter and throughout the book you know this was written on auto pilot.The premise looks to be interesting as mother `` Madame Aphrodite '' pays our hero Sebastian to try and find the evil ones responsible for stealing her children years before . Sebastian is your typical angst filled man who lives on the dark side for some wrong he has done in the past . The horror ! The total clich & eacute ; ! Sebastian happily takes on the case and in the process almost dies by being left to drown in some bog . ( They actually have marshy bogs in England that will kill you ! ) He is found and saved by the youngest daughter Francesca as she walks with her dog through the moors even though she is suppose to be some respectful young woman . What a coincidence this makes . Sebastian is over come by lust the minute he sees her ! And Francesca , even though she does n't want to act out any traits of her trashy mother , tries not to think these lust filled thoughts.Even though by page 100 she and Sebastian have fallen in bed together.Zany turmoil and constant villains surround these two over and over . And along the way they are overcome with passion and ecstasy while always in danger.If only there were not clich & eacute ; s ' and over the top actions by the villains and the two main characters , then maybe this book could have been redeemable . For a good chuckle , and not in good way perhaps this book is for you . Otherwise check out Bennett 's earlier works for more substance and no eye rolling.KatiebabsRules of PassionLessons in Seduction	-1
When I found this book at the bookstore , I had never heard of Kinley MacGregor or the Lords of Avalon series . I bought this book because it was relevant to the King Arthur legend -- I 'll buy just about any King Arthur novel out there , although I 'd say half of them disappoint me . This one turned out to be near the top of my list of disappointments.First of all , it was n't until after I finished reading it and I went to Amazon to read reviews by other authors that I even realized I had read the 2nd book , not the first , in the series . I had thought it was the first since inside the book is a list of the author 's other works and it is listed above Sword of Darkness , which made me assume it was the first and Sword of Darkness the second in the series . Nowhere on the front or back cover was it indicated in which order to read the books . However , I do n't feel I missed anything by not reading the first in the series and I have no intention of reading it in the future.I also discovered at Amazon that Kinley MacGregor is a pseudonym for Sherrilyn Kenyon , whose name I had heard in reference to her vampire novels , although I had not read them . Those vampire novels might be worth reading , but when I did a little more research and found this author has written over 60 novels and is only in her mid-40s , I understood why Knight of Darkness is so bad . No author can whip out that many books in 20 years and expect to create quality . That she is a bestselling author is just a sign of how good marketing can sell anything . The attractive cover must have helped sell this book -- the writing inside sure couldn't.Actually , Knight of Darkness did n't start out too badly . The main character , Varian duFey , is the son of Sir Lancelot and an evil woman who is Morgen le Fey 's right hand . Varian , however , works for the good guys -- including Merlin , but a female Merlin -- and as a hired assassin for them . The book is set in modern times as well . I was slightly intrigued by the situation.When a grail knight is assassinated , Varian is supposed to find out who the murderer is . So far , so good , and for about fifty pages , I was interested , despite the writing not being of the first quality , but then the book falls into campiness . Varian is captured and imprisoned , and in his efforts to escape , becomes involved with an unattractive woman , Merewyn , who agrees to seduce him in exchange for becoming beautiful -- and Varian 's mother is the one who makes the deal with her . I just read this book a couple of days ago , but I 'm having trouble remembering the details of what they even wanted from Varian -- a sign the plot was n't thought out well . Varian has magical powers they want to prohibit , but they also want to stop him from learning who murdered the grail knight.But what makes things really difficult is the whole mystery gets forgotten in the ridiculous overuse of magic throughout the novel , Varian and Merewyn 's escape into some sort of inbetween realm that does n't make sense -- really is nonsensical , not to mention cheesy -- and a whole lot of erotic scenes between Varian and Merewyn that go on and on and tend to be more boring than titillating . Add into it Merewyn falling into a slough of despond or some such name that sounds like something out of Pilgrim 's Progress , and mix into that a bunch of characters who keep quoting from Spamalot -- a show I like but which I do n't need to have replayed for me in the pages of the book ( I wo n't even get started on the book 's other faults , including the talking rock that 's supposed to grow up to be a gargoyle and all the ridiculous geeky dialogue ) . Suffice it to say , this book may well be tied with the movie Quest for Camelot for the title of the ultimate Arthurian cheesefest ! Seriously , I do n't mind some humor -- I find Spamalot very funny -- but cheesiness is more than I want . The Arthurian legend has prevailed for centuries because of its tragedy , its romance , its awe and mystery , its sense of ideals to strive for , even if they may not always be reached . None of that exists in the pages of this book . All that is here is a badly-written , badly-thought out story , that I would not have even finished reading if it had n't been the only book I had to read while on an airplane.If you want some cheesy Arthurian time travel in other dimensions type story , go check out the worst of the remakes of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court -- there are plenty of them , and they are all better than this book . Knight of Darkness is truly a dark night for Arthurian literature.- Tyler R. Tichelaar , author of `` King Arthur 's Children ''	-1
As best that I can remember , I 've never voted a book such a low score.Like so many people , I closely watched the Peterson trial all the way to the end.But the minute Gloria Allred said that Amber does n't watch the news , yet later said that Amber has a book coming out , I wondered what Amber Frey could possibly say differently in a book - that was n't already said in her transcripts.This book reads like her transcripts . I 'm shocked that she used Laci Peterson 's , and the Rocha 's pictures , on the jacket of this book.The sentences and paragraph developments do not flow.The questions that I still have on this topic are : What kind of a best friend would , after finding out that Scott Peterson was married and is a liar , call him , before calling the best friend , and give him room to `` come clean with her best friend ? `` What kind of behind the scenes deal did Amber Frey and Gloria Allred make with the media , given that it appears that Matt Lauer , Oprah and you have no respect for Amber Frey . It 's seems that you all have done these interviews as a favor for someone.Why has no one asked Amber Frey what her commitment is to changing emotionally and psychologically ? Obviously religion , albeit it has its value , is not the solution.Though the book jacket says that this book is a story of how a young woman becamse ensnared in Scott Peterson 's web of lies , then risked everything to seek justice for Laci Peterson and her unborn child , Conner , I 'd say that this is a book about what happens when women put looking for a Prince Charming before looking for someone who earns their trust. [ ... ] Also , if Amber Frey were really trying to get on with her life , and to turn a tragedy into many blessings , would n't she invest more time in healing her soul , than in telling the world that she chooses to still be a victim ?	-1
In my years of teaching philosophy and religion I have read many textbooks intended for introductory college courses . Most of the religious textbooks are dumbed down to the point of worthlessness and Smith 's certainly falls into that category . I have a special angst over Smith 's book though because so many lazy college instructors use it for the wrong reasons.Smith wrote this book in 1958 and though the text has been updated a few times ( though not at all since 1991 ) it remains riddled with outdated myopic viewpoints . Smith takes a disppointingly detached viewpoint toward religions that only observes the surfaces and does not plumb the depths . Worse , he never looks at religions within their context but looks at them from an American 1950 's standpoint . What results is a kind of `` gee whiz look at what those people do '' dog and pony show that does n't give students any real insight or understanding . I am sure Smith did not mean to be disrepsectful to the religions he covered but he nevertheless ends up being so.Instructors assign this book for two main reasons . One , it is cheaper than all of the rest . Two , because its outdated and superficial treatment does not challenge students or instructors . No one has to take religions seriously or try to truly understand believers in context . While instructors thus get students to like them they are really shortchanging the students . It is irresponsible to assign a textbook that does not take into account the many significant religious events of the past 50 years and does not treat believers of other religions as full people living in a diverse and complex culture . It is far more important to give students a meaningful education than save them a few dollars on a simplistic book . The publishers should retire this book and no religion instructor should assign it .	-1
I started out hoping for some kind of drama , eventually , but the sickening sweetness was unrelenting . Combined with the fact these people had no business owning a large , strong working-breed dog . Gosh , the trouble they got themselves into -- how cute ! Still cute . Forever cute . I started to flip through it . Then just flipped to the end . Started disgusted with the owners for one reason , wound up more disgusted for another . If you know anything at all about dogs , do not buy this book .	-1
I was hesitant to start this book since my 14 year-old dog had died only 10 days before . I thought it would make me want to go out and get another dog . Instead , the first 2/3 of the book emphasized the expense , hassle , and time commitment of dog ownership.Contrary to Grogan 's assessment , Marley was not an unusual dog . ALL dogs bark , chew , eat everything , panic at loud noises , and need lots of attention . No dogs heal without training or refrain from jumping and sniffing in the wrong places without being taught . This dog was just a backdrop for 13 transititional years in this man 's life . That time period is mostly what Grogan is reflecting on here.The saving grace in this book is the end when Grogan gets emotional over his aging and dying dog . But even then I found it most interesting that he went to Disney World for a week . ( My dog was just old , not unhealthy like Marley and I limited all my trips to one nighters and then only went when absolutely necessary . ) Grogan discovers in the end that animals really ARE better than human beings . Is this supposed to be some sort of revelation to an animal lover ? He is constantly reminded of a dog now gone . And it is true a person does do this when a pet dies , but somehow with Grogan it almost has a guilty edge to it . I kind of hope it is guilt anyway , I hope he realizes in many instances this animal was mistreated.Aside from the content , Grogan is making a lot of money off a book that is not that well written.Next time Grogan should get a cat . The maintenance is not as high .	-1
This book is NOT for anyone who has even the most rudimentary knowledge of animal behavior or humane training strategies . People like John Grogan are the reason so many animals end up in the shelter . That aside , the writing style of this book really turned me off . The author 's voice sounds very full of himself . His wiser-than-thou arrogance had me rolling my eyes before I was halfway through the first chapter . If I could , I 'd give this zero stars .	-1
This book does not teach you any thing that any good knitting book has not already said.This woman is so full of herself , she thinks she is God 's gift to the knitting universe . The name-dropping was unbelievable even by Hollywood standards . I got this book through the library , I would not have paid a penny for this book . The patterns are so unimaginable , I have seen better designs in `` how to knit '' leaflets .	-1
This is not a book , It 's a joke . The confessions of a woman who thinks trash , talks trash , has a trash lifestyle , and is human trash . she should work for the sanitation department .	-1
I absolutely adore `` chick lit '' and celebrity novels , I was so excited to finally read the book - yet , it left me extremely disappointed ! The story has no substance whatsoever , the plot is inconsistent , basically it 's like an 8th grader wrote it . I had no reading pleasure at all with this book . It was like reading the diary of a junior high brat who lives in California . And NOT an entertaining one at that . Ugh ! A complete waste of time . Do yourself a huge favor and do n't bother with this book !	-1
The only reason I finished the book is because it was the only one available , and there was nothing else to do .	-1
When will publishing houses realize that when it comes to relationship advice , Hollywood is the LAST place those of us in the real world will look for advice ? It 's like taking how-to-run-a-successful-company advice from Ken Lay or Bernie Ebbers . The Hollywood track record for relationships is abysmal , at best.Just for giggles , I had to read this book . So I got it from the library . I expect it to be in next year 's book sale ( if not sooner ) , next to the Y2K preparation books they have n't been able to sell , let alone give away.Many of you know that Star Jones is one of the most shameless self-promoters out there ( i.e . her wedding as publicized from The View and the red carpet ) , and this book is yet another attempt for her to tell you how much better she is than you . Not so much to help you , the reader ; but to make her feel better about herself.So , when you consider the source , is anyone with a lick of common sense buying the relationship advice in this book ? I know that Al 's sexual orientation has come under fire over the past few years , but the painfully awkward awakening-of-love passages , which I suppose are supposed to be sensuous , come off as goofy and bizarre -- they wo n't be changing anyone 's opinion : '' The first time he held me in his arms sexually , it was almost frightening because we knew our erotic interest in each other could take over every other thing. '' Tsss ! Hot ! Yeah.You have to keep in mind that Star and Al have only been married a little over one year . Yet she feels she 's qualified to tell you how to find an everlasting love . And the love and sex workshop section of the book . After only one year of marriage ? Seriously . You have to be kidding me.Star is very up front with her obsession over material goods . My , oh my ! Money , money , money , money . We all have more than enough money , do n't we ? And all the wealth , power , and prestiege that comes with success . Wealth , she has . Congratulations . But power and prestiege ? She thinks she has it , but as other reviewers have said , we 're not buying it.Star , Star , Star ... If you really buy what you 're trying to sell in this book , apply it to yourself . You 've got some real soul searching ahead of you .	-1
at it 's smelliest . The review above says `` ... .As a religious historian and a leading expert in the field of arcane knowledge , Baigent has unequaled access to hidden archives , secret societies , Masonic records , and the private collections of antiquities traders and their moneyed clients . '' Does anyone really believe this ? What an insult to our intelligence ! I saw this clown on TV , completely staged for filming , with his dark glasses , leather ( or imitation ) jacket , long hair , and chain smoking cigarettes , and his pompous attitude . I almost fell out of my chair laughing , but gagging at the same time . He reminded me of a teenage motorcyle punk trying to be intelligent.I admit , I did NOT entirely read this book ; I was tired of being sickened . If you pride yourself on your intelligence , do not read this book , or at least do n't pay for it ( I did n't ) . On the other hand , if you are a hate-mongering , anti-Christian , or atheist , have at it , it 's right up your alley ... .	-1
I will preface this by saying that I saw the film way before I read the book and that makes me bias . For the record I adore the film ... but come any film where you get to see Chris Evans shirtless multiple times is a film I ca n't help but love . Plus I just love Chris Evans in general.Anyway , this book follows Delilah Darling on her journey to track down all her ex 's to avoid raising the number of men she has slept with . She reads an article stating that the national average number of lovers women have is 10 and since her number is literally twice that , she starts to have a bit of a breakdown . She enlists her neighbor to help her track them down and then sets off to drive crosscountry to confront them and see if there is anything redeeming about them.I was not very impressed with this novel . I hated Delilah . HATED . She is stupid and immature and I just wanted to slap her . The stupid girl buys a dog just to have an excuse to run into an ex at a dog park . Maybe I am just a dog nut , but I hate seeing people get a pet that they have no idea how to care for.It did make me laugh a lot , but it did n't have anything super special to keep my interest . Now that I really think about it , it had the things that normally make me love a novel . It was funny , it has a happy ending , and a decent amount of romance . I just did n't love it . The only parts I really enjoyed were the few scenes between Delilah and Colin .	-1
What a great premise . A widowed history teacher goes to Turkey to revisit the town where she honeymooned with her late husband . This story could have been a meditation on chapters of personal history , using as a metaphor the blossoming and decline of the succession of cultures that have thrived in Turkey over millennia . Instead we discover that this history teacher has little interest in history and thus we get very little of it in the story.In fact , if it were n't for the protagonist 's naivete while traveling in another country , the story could have taken place anywhere in the United States without there being much alteration in the story . Threads of plot go nowhere . An agressively hostile waiter appears , but there 's no explanation for his hostility . The owner of the house has an ex-wife , a mistress , and sexual preoccupations ( including sex toys and naughty pictures ) , but no coherent use is made of this information in service of the story.A very clumsy attempt at metaphor is made using a `` widowed '' owl . And the ridiculously kitchy ending would have ruined the book if it were n't already such a mess.As a side note , the book is so poorly researched that the author could n't even get the correct phonetic pronunciation of `` thank you '' in Turkish . This would be a minor quibble if she had n't so thoroughly misportrayed Turks themselves . During my own experience of travel in Turkey I found the Turkish people generally to be warm and friendly as well as being scrupulously fair and honest .	-1
This was the first Grippando book that I have read , so Swyteck was a new character for me . This was a free read in three parts from the kindle store , but I waited for all three parts to be available before I started reading . I did not want to risk being left hanging.From the book description , I though that this book would have a more legal or sleuthing edge to it , but it was more of a thriller suspense read . However , there were not enough nuggets given to uncover the mystery during the first two thirds of the book . Because of this , the events from the first part of the book , although they involved the same players , just seemed like random events . The last third of the book , then , had an overload of information finally linking all of the earlier events together . When the last `` thrilling '' event finally ends , the book should have ended there . Instead there are about four more chapters extending the story out more than it needed to be.The book was well written otherwise , and there were interesting parts in the book . Perhaps I would have enjoyed this more if I had read other books in the series . I can not tell . After having read this one , though , I have no plans to read any of the others.Note : This review as originally posted on Goodreads.com	-1
This book makes a perfect argument for buying used books rather than spending on a new copy . Unfortunately , I sprang for a new one . It 's all downhill after the first chapter . The story is trite & the dialogue reads like an elementary school primer.Picture , if you will , a good girl in high school who is tormented by a group of `` Mean Girls '' . A mean girl approaches nice girl ( Now a lawyer ) later in life & asks for help in getting out from under an abusive relationship with her mob connected boyfriend . Good girl even gets fired due to her convictions & belief toward her one-time tormentor , as well as her own personal guilt trip . Absolutely ridiculous.The story is weak & predictable . This was my first Scottoline novel & probably my last.Add a star if you can identify with the stereotypical Italian families ' behaviors , descriptions , & nicknames . The best part of the book actually . She does very well with that . It 's well done & comical . The rest of the book is forgettable	-1
I bought this one because the synopsis sounded so good ... '' Once a dedicated soldier of the Knights Templar , Derek de Molay was betrayed and killed . So instead of an eternity in Heaven , he has decided to battle the Dark Angels of Hell . But as the war between good and evil rages , he is summoned back to the mortal realm to protect a woman standing too close to the edge of darkness . '' Wow . Sounds awesome ! Dark and edgy ! Problem is that I have a feeling the same person who wrote that synopsis , did n't write the book , and they should have , because the writing for the actual book is just bad . Amateurish and lacking any kind of depth at all . Dark and edgy it is not . Disappointing and dull might be a better word for it . I found myself starting to get bored and skipping ahead at page 20 ! ! Not good.I should have felt for Derek and started rooting for him from the beginning . I should have wanted to read more about him , and I just thought he was overly sanctimonious and annoying . Then I thought , well , maybe once we meet Rachel , she 'll be the interesting one , and I 'll want to continue reading for her . No such luck . I found Rachel as annoying as Derek.Yes , I do know that some books are slow getting started , and I can appreciate that . But really good writing can overcome a slow start , and make you think , `` Ok , this is slow starting , but there 's something about it that 's drawing me in , so I 'm sticking with it . '' This one did not in any way give me that feeling . It was more a feeling of `` Hell ... I just wasted five bucks . `` You know that quote from `` Jerry Maguire '' that says , `` You had me at hello '' ? A book REALLY needs to do that ... have me at hello ... or I just ca n't continue reading it . This book SO did n't have me at hello .	-1
I had high hopes that this would be a fun read , but alas , it was not meant to be . Derek was described with sandy blond hair and blue eyes , but the book cover featured a black-haired hero . Hmm ... I thought the cover depicted the character better . I could n't picture a younger Daniel Craig as the warrior angel ... The plot was lame . The dark angels could have chosen a grander scheme ... I know that Lizz Weis is a financial expert , but come on , I did n't feel the sense of urgency to fight the baddies on this one . I 'm glad I do n't own this book .	-1
Some of her recipes are good but raw foodism is based on bad science and the plan she suggests is even worser due to the complicated food combinations she uses , which are based on even worse science , do you know that one of the international speakpersons of them Harvey Diamond has abandoned them completely ?	-1
The claims in this book are nuttier than squirrel poo . Moreover , they make no sense . You get healthier on a raw vegan diet ( as I am doing ! ) because you 're consuming no processed foods , no meat , no dairy , no eggs , no fried foods , no cholesterol , little or no saturated fat ( unless you get into coconuts ) , lots of fiber , lots of vitamins and minerals , and probably lots of water . In other words , you 're following the diametric opposite of the S.A.D . ( Standard American Diet ) that 's made so many of us sick in the first place . Garbage in , garbage out . Take out the bad things , replace them with good things , add exercise , and you will see improvements , even dramatic ones -- but there 's nothing mystical about it . All this natural-hygiene nonsense about enzymes and food combining and body pH and diluting your digestive juices with water ( people , your digestive acids can strip rust off a nail ! You ca n't `` dilute '' them ! ) is bunk and has been proven as such over and over again . But since suspicion ( if not outright hostility ) towards science is very popular amongst raw foodists , I 'm not surprised to see those myths resurfacing here.And if you 're consuming enough fiber and fluids , your colon will take care of removing waste from your body on its own . It was designed specifically to do just that . Nobody , not even Elvis , has a build-up of toxic material weighing down his/her colon . It really is n't necessary to obsess over the products and activities of that part of your body ; it 's pretty much self-regulating if you 're healthy . As for the consumption of meat , eggs , artificial sweeteners , alcohol , and dairy products ... well , those are the big troublemakers in most people 's diets , so I 'm at a loss as to why they 're included in a `` detox '' diet book.Unfortunately , this book encapsulates so much of the crazy hype and outlandish claims surrounding raw foods , rather than the real , and realistic , benefits ; and is a perfect example of the approach that turns a lot of people away from a way of eating that if properly followed , would do them much good . If you want a book with tasty , easy recipes and a good , solid , sensible approach to the raw vegan lifestyle , one that is grounded in fact rather than emotion and fanaticism and written by recognized experts in vegan and vegetarian nutrition , check out `` The Raw Food Diet Revolution . '' `` Living Cuisine : The Art and Spirit of Raw Foods '' also has great recipes and a more laid-back , balanced approach .	-1
Just so predictable ! And so boring . The story never really took off . Just went round and round with a lot of silly information .	-1
I read this book in my 20 's , and I remember loving it ! Now , in my 50 's I thought it was trite and predictable . I found the characters irritating . However , having said that Colleen is a great writer .	-1
I am an avid reader ; currently living in an unnamed South American country . I could wax poetic about the beautiful writing and character development in this book , but let 's be honest . I was reading it on a nine-hour flight without another option , otherwise this book would have been passed over quickly . It took numerous attempts to even keep going . It was unrealistic , superficial and I feel the ending was disrespectful to the people who made it that far . It was unbelievable and I feel the author lost interest in the book herself and copped out . This book rates in the bottom ten of all time , personally .	-1
Having seen this novel on the bookstores for years , I finally decided to give it a shot , and bought the unabridged CD version for daily commutes . The goal was to have something interesting to keep me awake during AM rush hour , but this novel made it difficult to keep the eyelids apart . The premise seems intriguing ( especially for an award-winning literary fiction novel ) , but one quickly realizes that a hostage situation is mostly about waiting , and so for most of the book it feels like nothing is happening . Love emerges between a quartet of characters , but is uninteresting and seems to languish . The supporting cast is described only enough to elevate above the ficuses , and the terrorists become the kind of misguided lummoxes that populate the Pirates of the Carribean movies . But the novel 's most lamentable trait is the excessive praise heaped on the star opera singer Roxanne Koss . The novel reinforces the stereotype that opera bathes in its own glory and likens Koss 's voice to a magical frequency that mollifies delusional revolutionaries and sets ossified hearts a'beating . Puh-leez . How cliche is it to laud opera ? Is this an episode of Frasier or what ?	-1
It seemed like Ron Jeremy in this book was beating the point of him knowing this person , and that person , and this person , and that person ... ... ... it went on and on and on .	-1
The real mystery with this book is why anyone would read anything that Peter Beinart had to say . I checked through the book enough to see that it is not 300 pages of Mr. Beinart saying `` I was wrong about Iraq '' over and over again . Hence , I can not recommend this book .	-1
I read the sample and was intrigued even though nothing had happened yet . It was the sample . Nothing is supposed to happen . It was an interesting opener though so I bought the collection and much to my surprise , nothing continued to happen in the opening story . I kept reading hoping one of the stories would spark my interest . I found a collection of redundant and boring concepts trotted out again with little imagination applied to the otherwise stock plots and characters . It is a struggle to pick up the book again every time I set it down .	-1
I just did n't like it .	-1
There could not , to my thinking , be a greater gap between celebrity of a book and its actual merit . The writing is vapid , tiresome , and often unintelligible . Often praised as of far more psychological and societal value than 1984 or ANIMAL FARM , such claims are thoroughgoingly absurd . In fact , I quite wonder what substances got into Huxley 's bloodstream and crossed the brain barrier when he was writing this drivel-ridden casuistry.P.S . My dismissive contribution here may prompt some of Huxley 's ardent devotees to desire initiation of a mass debate . No thanks . Anyone who gave credence to this sententious tome is already an accomplished `` mass debater . '' If only via a venerating cerebral cortex . I concede in advance to such `` skill . ''	-1
This is one of those old classics that everyone should read . Like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 , It gives us a glimpse of what the elitists thought of the future back when this was published . I gave it a 2 because I thought the ending was the author unable to come to a meaningful conclusion , so he just wrapped it up with a simple solution to his problem .	-1
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley was written in 1931 and depicts a world several hundred years in the future where genetic engineering , mental conditioning , and a liberal administering of drugs have pacified the populace . While some of Huxley 's concepts are revolutionary , or used in different and interesting ways , as a whole the novel does n't add up to anything much . It 's more of a cheeky observation on how a more peaceful totalitarian regime can rule through creating a genetic caste system so that all human beings are formulated in a lab somewhere and thereby rebellion bred out . All things considered , I could n't care less about these characters or the grim future world that Huxley placed them in .	-1
I love Meg Cabot , but I did n't like this book at all . I thought the protagonist was way over the top . I was n't able to bring myself to finish it .	-1
I was so looking forward to the third installment of the series . I loved this character from the first and second books so much and was eager to see her story evolve more . I was dissapointed in several points but do not want to give the plot away . The ending was OK , but the getting there threw in too many curveballs with what I felt were unrealistic responses by Lizzy and some of the other characters . Ending felt rushed too . Shari was almost non-existant in this book and prior to this was her best friend . Overall it seemed way too laisez-faire about some things most women would not take lightly and without giving anything away , there seemed to be something lacking . Read it , just get it from the library first .	-1
Such a huge disappointment . I love Barbara Kingsolver - have read all her books , LOVED the Poisonwood Bible , loved all her books . This one is just such a let down . Dull . Kept waiting for something to happen . I am abandoning the book half way through - something I 've only done with a couple books ever . But the main character is boring , the setting and historical context already very familiar ... sooooo disappointed . ANd surprised that the reviews have been so good ( not all of them , however . ) Read it if you 're tempted , see what you think - but do n't be shocked if you ca n't get into it and are disappointed . I kept thinking it was me , there was something wrong with me , I was n't getting the Literature - but now that I read more reviews , others are saying the same thing ... Sad .	-1
I am a lover of Barbara Kingsolver 's books . However , I did not like this book at all . It was didactic , rhetorical , and historical , but there is barely a novel contained within it . William ( or Harrison , as he is sometimes known ) is living in Mexico with his mother , who is an American expatriate , having left William 's father to live with a man with better economic prospects . William 's mother is distant , money-conscious and is trying to get her hands on the richest man she can find with not a whole lot of luck . William is finally shipped back to the United States to live with his father who spends no time at all in enrolling William in boarding school . This is the plot by page 110.The novel is the story of a young boy in the early twentieth century who has been keeping a journal since he was nine years old . This journal is , ostensibly , the story line . The bulk of what we read about is the history of Mexico and the United States , Cortes and the Aztecs . We learn about the horrible times of the Great Depression in the United States and the horrible president at that time , Herbert Hoover . We hear about Frieda Kahlo and Diego Rivera as they work on their great mural in Mexico City . William learns about capitalism and communism during that same time period . Kingsolver gives rhetoric about what is right and what is wrong . She talks about hobo camps , soldiers who have not received their promised pensions after fighting for their country during wartime . She rants about people being locked up for their political beliefs , the dire straits of the educational system , and the dichotomy between the wealthy and the impoverished . However , there is barely a story line.I really wanted to like this book as I 've loved her other novels . I had noticed that she was getting more didactic with each novel she wrote but I never expected anything like this . What a huge disappointment !	-1
Recalling the sensational OJ Simpson murder trial in Los Angeles , then LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman revealed himself as a non- credible source . He was caught lying on the witness stand during the trial . He claimed not to have used the insulting `` N '' word for the previous ten years , yet tape-recorded evidence proved otherwise . When Fuhrman was tried for perjury for this incident , he pleaded `` no contest '' - meaning he did not challenge the factual basis for the charges that were brought to trial . He also invoked his rights against self-incrimination ( Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution ) when asked if he had tampered with evidence during the trial of O.J . Simpson . Legally discredited , he left the LAPD shortly after the trial and built a career on writing detective novels.Along these lines , `` Silent Witness '' is NOT an objective book , despite Fuhrman 's claims otherwise in the introduction . He admits getting involved in this controversy at the request of Fox News host Sean Hannity , one of the most ideological and misinforming `` news '' broadcasters on the network or anywhere else . And guess what , Fuhrman is a frequent guest ! Hannity was an outspoken advocate ( not an objective news reporter ) for the Schindlers and has had them as guests , along with Fuhrman , on his show . ( for documentation of Hannity 's extreme right wing advocacy and numerous falsehoods , see Media Matters for America . ) '' Silent Witness '' pretty much takes the Schindler 's position at face value throughout , as they enthusiastically co-operated in the production of the book . Input from Michael Schiavo , his attorney , the right-to-die legal community , and related physicians and scientists was not sought . Thus Fuhrman 's account caused a brief flurry because of its `` investigative '' claim to authority , but added nothing new . The publisher did n't bother to follow up with a paperback edition.In addition , the book was rushed to press before the autopsy results for Terri Schiavo became available . This information should have changed some of Fuhrman 's speculations and conclusions . He also missed the report from Florida State Attorney , Bernie McCabe , on the further investigation of the allegations of abuse of Terri by Michael . This report appeared in Michael Schiavo 's book and is the official and legal refutation of Fuhrman , proving that he did not physically abuse his wife . Earlier investigations reached the same conclusions . The counter-factual anti-Michael Schiavo right wing continues to make false claims about these discredited abuse claims.To plump up his book with sufficient pages for publication , Fuhrman repeats material several times , as well as including dry boilder-plate textbook medical information that is easily obtainable elsewhere . In short , Furman entered the Terri Schiavo affair 15 years after it began , and can add only prejudiced speculation , via pseudo- '' cold case investigative methodology . '' `` Silent Witness '' is worthless in the body of research/coverage that came out of the Terri Schiavo affair . Those who cite/use it are grounding themselves in bogus information and speculation . That 's why I gave it the proverbial `` I hate it '' one star.For those seriously interested in the Terri Schiavo affair , I recommend Michael Schiavo 's account , the Schindler family book , and Shepherd , Lois ( 2009 ) . `` If That Ever Happens to Me : Making Life and Death Decisions after Terri Schiavo '' ( Studies in Social Medicine ) . The University of North Carolina Press ; `` The Case of Terri Schiavo : Ethics at the End of Life . '' edited by Arthur L. Caplan , James J. McCartney , and Dominic A. Sisti ; and Cranford , Ronald ( Summer 2005 ) . `` Facts , Lies , and Videotapes : The Permanent Vegetative State and The Sad Case of Terri Schiavo '' . The Journal of Law , Medicine & Ethics 33 ( 2 ) : 363-371.See also , Phillips , Rich , Producer . ( 2005-06-07 ) , as reported on CNN : `` Autopsy : No sign Schiavo was abused : Findings show woman 's brain 'profoundly atrophied . ' '' In summary , Schiavo 's brain damage `` was irreversible , and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons , '' medical examiner Jon Thogmartin said . `` Her brain was profoundly atrophied and the vision centers of her brain were DEAD [ emphasis mine ] , '' he said . Vegetative people may seem alert if their involuntary functions remain intact . They may blink , sleep , wake up , make sounds and flinch . They even may laugh , shed tears and utter random words . But the brain sections that control thought are gone . Most doctors agree that such patients have little or no awareness of self and surroundings , and will never improve .	-1
I did not understand what this book was about . I do like Terry Pratchett a lot , but this book I did not like nor did I understand why he wrote it in the first place .	-1
Early in The Loveliest Woman in America , `` The author requests the reader 's patience . '' As well she should.The story of Rosamond Pinchot Gaston is one I 've caught glimpses of in other books , most recently in Nina Burleigh 's `` A Very Private Woman '' the biography of Rosamond 's half-sister Mary Pinchot Meyer , so I was pleased to see a full biography had finally been written . Rosamond was `` discovered '' at 19 . She went on to star in a Broadway hit and appear regularly in the society columns of the 20s and 30s before her seemingly sudden and inexplicable suicide in 1938 . This is a story with definite possibilities.Even after reading that patience was required for this book I was n't too put off . I have a very limited tolerance for stories about the author 's unconventional childhood . Rarely are these stories worth telling to a wide audience and even more rarely are they well told . But who would anyone spend endless pages on , let us say , what it was like to attend elementary school in Princeton , New Jersey in 1963 when material from the life of a woman who hobnobbed with the likes of George Cukor and Claire Boothe Luce was available ? No one would be so foolish , right ? In a word : wrong.My patience was tried mightily by this book . The chapters about Rosamond are n't bad but they do include some very questionable prose and what I can only describe as an addiction to metaphors . Very , very bad metaphors . Elizabeth Arden is described as `` a walking empire of ingenuity , a siren of survival , a roving pink tornado . '' Another woman is described as `` dispensing advice like a wheezing lesbian oracle . '' The champ , however , is the description of Clare Boothe Luce as `` one of those women who attacked life with a sledgehammer . `` If you can make sense of out that description , please let me know . I ca n't figure out if Clare is treating life like a tear-down that she plans to remodel or if she wants to reduce it to small pieces she can cart away to her local landfill . Neither of which strikes me as being particularly indicative of ambition . Still , that sentence is a model of clarity compared to `` a woman who mucked around in the world of men whose love was about as murky as pond ooze . `` Of course , while that is bad prose it is n't as pretentious and downright insufferable as what goes on in the sections when Gaston ruminates on the meaning of life . These sections are helpfully printed in italics so that the reader can fortify him/herself with liquor to face lines like `` I suspect most Americans are lost . '' By the time I got to Gaston 's big thesis , delivered to an ex-boyfriend ( who she pointlessly lets us know was Canadian ) , I was wondering if I can soldier on to the end . Then I read the big idea of this book : '' Longing is n't love , it 's longing . `` I am very sorry to report that the Canadian boyfriend does not appear to have given this line the response it deserved , namely `` Woman , please . '' And so , unaware apparently that this is not profundity of the deepest sort , Gaston goes on to repeat this line three more times in the book so that we will all understand that when people we love go away we sometimes think we love them more than they would if they hung around and got on our nerves.There 's only one way to read the italics portions of this book . Out loud , with friends . Lines like `` I was in a deep sleep when I chose the men in my life '' are surprisingly entertaining in a group setting . Less entertaining , is Gaston 's utter failure to grasp the complexity of mental illness in general and depression specifically . She never explores what Rosamond meant by `` Cinderella feeling '' although it was obviously a code for feelings of depression and anxiety . Instead she either implies that Rosamond was used and discarded by the star machine and men in her life - what a radical notion , or she declares Rosamond 's suicide was just a middle finger aimed at the world . Because suicide is such a rational act.Most of Rosamond 's life gets this barely skin deep treatment . We never understand why Rosamond disliked her mother , why she was so resentful of her step-mother and her half-sisters well into her thirties , why she loved any of the men she loved or why she declared that she hated her own sons . Nor does Rosamond come across as particularly likable half the time although Gaston does n't seem to notice . `` Big Bill '' Gaston , Rosamond 's husband , comes across as a complete jerk which makes her attraction to him all the more inexplicable.Oddly enough , the two women who do come out best are actress Kay Francis , who is smart enough to know when a man is a good date but would make a lousy husband , and Lady Diana Cooper , who 's truly gracious and compassionate letter to one of Rosamond 's sons is included . I get the feeling they 'd know what to say if someone told them `` longing is n't love , it 's longing . `` If you do choose to read this book , consider the Kindle edition . Not only does it have all the photographs included but the fanciful spacing at one point makes it appear that Claire Boothe is attempting to rent a portion of Big Bill 's anatomy rather than his vacation home .	-1
I can sum this book up in one sentence . Very slow , very dull , could n't finish it .	-1
This was my first Jodi Picoult book , and may be my last . I felt like I was climbing up a steep hill , never to reach the top . The book starts out with a murder ? , suicide ? , and goes downhill from there . Tedious trial , and many unanswered questions . Why was this teenage girl so miserable and unhappy ? Some hints of abuse , but nothing is clear or validated . Her parents were clueless . Depressing story , with really no answers , not a romantic love story .	-1
While I commend Darla on her decision to stay at home , her targeted reading audience is highly limited . Cutting costs means doing without the nanny , housecleaner , and cooking meals using organics . When the author initially stopped working , it meant days at the gym or the salon . Her discussions and examples are limited to those who have chosen to give up a well paid career to stay at home . Her `` bargain '' store examples for cutting costs in clothes is way above the Walmart budget or second hand options for many American families choosing to live on one income.My suggestion : Save your money on this one unless you are in her income bracket . Currently , there are many good books written by women who truly understand what it means to raise a family on one income . It can be done !	-1
I was excited to read this book . I love being housewife and I 'm always overjoyed to find books that celebrate my profession.This book seemed so promising . My excitement turned to dismay as I read the author 's attacks on other mothers . She even goes so far as to public humiliate her sister by critizing her for not having her `` act together '' enough to attend her ( the author 's ) Christmas party . YIKES . I would hate to be related to this unforgiving lady.Her tone is so vicous and condescending I found it really vulgar . She 's not funny..she 's mean.Not all moms have the same resources , financial or otherwise . Some have children who are strong willed , or poor sleepers . Some are in bad marriages . Some struggle with post-partum depression.If we housewives are truly going to command respect , we must start by respecting each other.If you 're a strung out mom ( and are n't we all at some point ) a much better book for regaining control is `` Sink Reflections '' . The author is kind and her information is more inspiring and useful . She even has a web site to help you on your way	-1
The search for `` the historical Jesus '' and the assumptions made around that whole conversation are paramount in this work . If you believe that Jesus the man was primarily about socio/political fixes to the world 's problems you will probably like this book . If you believe his mission was much bigger than that - atoning sacrifice , etc . - then pass it by .	-1
For an author who is hailed as the Next Big Thing in horror writing , this limp effort was an exceptional disappointment . The principals suffer from so heavy an application of cliche that they come across as nothing more interesting than cardboard cut-outs culled from a recipe book of character creation . From gap-toothed teacher Lois Larkin to naive and beleaguered Meg Wintrob , to the essential lost-soul-ergo-bad-boy-and-thusly-plot-catalyst James Walker , there is n't a single character in this book that a reader is given cause to care about . Every one of them in the town of Corpus Christi is flat , dull , and unimportant . The plot does n't move at any pace faster than a snail 's trot , and what Sarah Langan tries for here has been done before , and with better writers at the helm : an industrial accident that causes environmental havoc , manifesting as an awakening of psychological horror . Bo . Ring . Put the town on top of an Indian burial ground and you realize you 've seen this movie before . Do n't waste your time with this book . You 'll only be disappointed .	-1
I loved this author , but now I need to rethink it . This book has too many mindless characters doing irrelevant things that are at best somewhat engrossing and at worse disgusting and horrible . You will never be able to keep track of all the characters because ... they are all the same . Every character is a no nonsense action packed lawyer that is compelled by sexual drive . Every character . And since there are six or seven stories ( none of which you care about ) you will immediately be lost.Mike DOES do a good job pulling you along in some of the sub plots which gets you pretty well through the book until the end when he truncates everything.Do n't read this , please . Listen to the other reviewers .	-1
25 characters introduced in the first 75 pages , 12+ stories flying around to confuse the reader . I 'm embarrassed for the author that he 's taking people 's money for this . I 've read all his work and this is below the bottom of his list . He inserts silly `` articles '' throughout to give snapshots of others ' perspectives on gene exploration . There are enough characters and sub-plots here to fill a trilogy , which might have been a better idea to pull off this book.My recommendation ? Go to libraries and bookstores and push this book behind everything on the shelves .	-1
Few authors are better than Michael Crichton at taking real world science and spinning it into thrilling ( and at times informative ) cautionary tales . Throughout his career , he wrote some of the most approachable mainstream science fiction in recent decades . His books were almost always smart , exciting page-turners.Next , the final work of his career , was not one of those books.Next deals with genetics and the controversial issues surrounding genetic research . Who owns your tissue ? Should genes be patented ? Is cross-breeding animals ethical ? And so on.What it does NOT deal with is presenting a compact , focused story . Instead , Crichton spins out almost a dozen narratives , sometimes intertwining them , sometimes not , while putting a slew of faux news articles and political speeches between them . And that , sadly , makes Next a chore to read.Lots of missed potential . There were several worthwhile stories in this book , all of which would have been good to read if they had some focus , but when they 're all thrown into a blender and none takes center stage the result is that the whole novel just all over the map . If the dozen stories going at the same time was n't enough to screw with the pacing and flow of the narrative ( s ) , the copious faux news articles kept bringing things to a screeching halt.I think Crichton was trying to hard to Make A Point rather than to tell a great story ( which he was excellent at ) . He delivered that message , however , at the expense of story . I really liked several strands of this double helix of a book -- Gerard the parrot was awesome , mom and her kid on the run was good , and the half-ape demanded a fuller treatment -- but hated having to sift through a load of other stuff to get to it . Worthless bits like glowing turtles , talking apes , and cures for addiction just went nowhere.There are several excellent novellas hidden away in this book . They do not , however , amount to one good novel.A very disappointing end to a largely stellar career . For hardcore Crichton fans only .	-1
This book was hard to follow , and had too many characters to remember them all . There were so many characters that no one character was developed enough for the reader to emphathize with . It jumped around from chapter to chapter , and was hard to follow . The first half of the book just gave various aspects of the gene controversy , and the last bit half-heartedly gave the plot of the story , such as it was . Perhaps a book with less people , and more character development would have been more rewarding .	-1
Crichton 's fifteenth novel is as disappointing as the overly complicated , unbelievable plot is ridiculous . Its only redeeming quality : the incorporation of previously published genetic facts into the story : chimeras , genes responsible for certain traits and conditions , and stem-cell research . Among its most annoying aspects : the existence of a character obsessed with young teens ( and everything else associated with him ) , the ( often inexplicably successful ) attempts of a family to pass off a humanzee as a human ( as well as the mother 's ridiculously nurturing behavior towards him ) , and the antics of an absurd , rude , incessantly talking bird . To top it off , the Author 's Note section , more appropriately titled , `` Michael Crichton 's Views on Current Policy Regarding Genetic Research , Testing and Patenting , '' reads like an Op Ed piece . He states : `` Stop patenting genes. , '' `` Establish clear guidelines for the use of human tissues. , '' Pass laws to ensure that data about gene testing is made public. , '' `` Avoid bans on research. , '' and `` Rescind the Bayh-Dole Act . '' Legitimate , logical and sound as his opinions may be , the time spent dreaming up Next might better have been spent writing a non-fiction book or creating a documentary on the subject . Of his fifteen novels to date , this is one of few that has been utterly implausible .	-1
Michael Crichton climbs on his scientific bandwagon again in this book focusing on genetics . While some of the scientific jargon is interesting , the story itself is not . Using several different characters and how genetics affect their lives , Crichton does n't develop any fully realized characterizations and the book ends up being a technical guidebook to genetics . The only fun characters in the book are the talking bird Gerard and apeboy Danny . While I 'm not opposed to authors warning us about the horrors of science , I wish Crichton could have made it a little more entertaining .	-1
Next - is or perhaps was , the late Mr Crichton 's last offering while he was still with us , although as we know there was and is more 'in the tank'.I am sorry to say , particularly as he is not with us any longer - that overall this book is below par . It is , as will have been no surprise to anyone , a yarn set in the world of Biotechnology . But the book is vague and muffly from start to finish - too many similar Bio Tech companies , lawyers , professors , their assistants and the ubiquitous ghoulish juniors who operate their own dodgy franchises in the wee small hours from the lab.As for central characters - well , take your pick from none , or a great many who at certain points run parralel with each other , but the lack of someone you can love or hate page by page is very obvious . It actually reminds me of the Simpsons or other series which have a deliberately pacey rushed episode so the whole town 's tale can be told , character by character.The tale is specifically concerned with Gene isolation and the resulting frantic scrabbling for patents , to keep ahead of the pack , or , the other side of the coin , sees the pack indulging in espionage , sex traps , wild claims of their own , desperate rubbishing of rivals ' claims whether valid or not , and then we see the actual state of play , wild claims aside.The story sort of livens up when we finally see the result of some of the research and experiments carried out over many years , with each passing year seeing more and more awareness of what 's what , what 's not , what can be achieved and what remains a pipe dream.To say more would be too much of a spoiler , not that the book overflows with seat-edge leg-crossing go-to-the-loo later tension and thrills , it does n't , but what more there is , should be gleaned from the book not from a review . Finally , I think it is fair to say Mr Crichton could not 'do comedy ' , the lighter moments are not well written , but again , that 's to decide for yourself .	-1
This is not a book written by Michael Crichton . I have read every single one of his books and nothing in this one is representative of his previous writings . I have read only one book by Richard Preston , and it was one of the best non-fiction books I have read in years : `` Demon in the Freezer '' ( 5 stars ) . Unfortunately , `` Micro '' does not do him justice either.Crichton always wrote in a believable manner . He developed his far out theses with lots of accurate details . His character development was such that you liked or disliked the players , but you were rarely ambivalent . None of that is in this novel . The detail errors just slap you in the face . Such as a botanist , herpetologist , plant chemist , entomologists all occupying the same lab space at Harvard ! This will never happen in a million years . They would be on different floors , different buildings . Then when one brother finds a micro airplane and calls the other brother , the response is `` this is an important application , bring it with you when you come to Hawaii . '' Yet the other brother was just down the road a mile at MIT . Must not have been that important . Oh , and the guy who can track cell phone calls and RECORDS their conversations ! Gim me a break , even Big Brother can not do that . And it goes on and on . The accurate details were not there to build a pseudofoundation for the plot . And the character development was non-existent . I had no empathy when key players fell by the way side . It was ho hum , who cares . Oh , and when did `` gone missing '' or `` went missing '' enter the lexicon of literate adults ? What happened to `` is missing '' or `` was missing ? '' Strange.No , I felt I was reading the script for a Saturday morning cartoon . Or maybe the next release of Toy Story . I was extremely disappointed in this novel . I 'll stick with another reread of `` The Andromeda Strain . ''	-1
I try to pick books written by well known authors so I can count on having a good read and not wasting my time . But the entire time I 've tried to read this was wasted . I quit , I give up , I 'm not even going to finish it . So my advice if you have n't read it ? do n't waste your time .	-1
I was n't too impressed with this book . maybe because the story was similar to the Disney story we knew . Maybe because there was a movie on it with poor reviews that I did n't watch . Maybe because the plot was lagging behind . It caught my interest for sure but did n't keep me excited for long ...	-1
This was a good idea . The Bracegirdle letters are the best part . Then the plot becomes boring , very boring and then deadly boring . The plot would have been better served if the novel had avoided the sexual incidents page after page after page .	-1
I 've only recently started reading Suzanne Enoch and , except for a couple of TSTL moments from various heroines , I have really enjoyed her style.This is an earlier effort and I think she 's learned a lot since writing Lady Rogue.The plot could take half the time to wrap up . Even though I like the leads and I like the way the heroine succeeds at seeming to be a young man ( especially when all the girls start falling for her ) , I was ready for the end about halfway through . If I had n't read so many other good books by Enoch , I might have stopped reading before the finish ~ which is something I rarely do.The story is about French spies smuggling weapons to Napoleon 's supporters pre-Waterloo . The premise has many holes and some character motivations are not sufficiently explained . There is a huge cast which can be confusing , especially when you add them all to the espionage plot.I recommend Enoch as an author , but I like her 'With this Ring ' and 'Lessons in Love ' trilogies much better than this one . Go for those rather than this one if you 're interested in some fun regencies by a typically enjoyable writer .	-1
Although a fan of Julia Quinn , her latest book THE LOST DUKE OF WYNDHAM did n't inspire . There is much attention on the confusion about the identity of Jack , but his hesitation about becoming a duke is not quite convincing ( it seems his main issue is that he 's insecure about his inability to read and ability to lead ) . The love story seems almost secondary to this confused identity-theme and the chemistry between Jack and Grace is weak . Grace might be a good person , but she is also somewhat dull and the more interesting characters are thus the supporting roles of Amelia and Thomas , who will be the leading lady and lord in Julia Quinn 's next romance MR. CAVENDISH , I PRESUME .	-1
If you loved the Bridgertons ' Series and love Julia Quinn as a rule , as I did ... and want to continue to love her-then skip this book as well as `` On the way to the Wedding '' . I never thought I would write one of these things but do n't waste your time with this book.BTW , what is with the disjointed look of the woman 's face on the cover , it looks like a very bad photoshop import . If Ms. Pottinger wants to continue to write then the publishers need to edit her much more closely . I do n't want to be mean , but this is just not a good book .	-1
Let me say up front , I do n't typically read this genre . So keep that in mind when you read my comments . Now for my comments : This was one of the hardest books I 've ever listened to . On more than one occasion I started to just give up and call it a loss . But I kept listening hoping it would get better ; it did n't . I purchased the book based upon its synopsis and other reviews . But quite frankly , after forcing myself to listen to it , I can sum it up by saying , this book was boring.The pace is too slow , and contrary to the synopsis , there 's no & quot ; earthly terror & quot ; to be found here . However , there is mystery but it 's no great mystery . And what there was , was unraveled so slowly that I really did n't care about the outcome . To top it off , most of the characters were n't interesting including the main one , Marianne . She was more of an irritant with her simpering ways , than anything else . The setting is dreary , and the story , yawn ... Rather than bash this book , I 'll end here and say this was definitely not my cup of tea . I prefer books that have either interesting characters and events , or action . This book lacked both .	-1

Dallas Willard desires the ethical teachings of Jesus to be taught to the nations so that social policy may be shaped and individuals conformed accordingly . Willard acknowledges that the Christian faith is currently out of favor with the world 's power brokers as well as with the post-modern man on the street . He therefore tries to reposition Christianity as a verifiable `` body of knowledge '' as opposed to mere belief . But Willard 's 20 pages of argument that God exists , 10 pages of argument that God miraculously intervenes in the affairs of men , and five pages of evidence for the Resurrection will hardly convince the skeptical , post-modern world that Christianity has now been verified.As an alternative appeal , Willard creates a synthesis between Christianity and the post-Christian worldview with his concept of `` Christian Pluralism . '' Here his message is that the Jesus described in the Bible is not the one whom the world needs to know , but rather , it is the `` Cosmic Christ '' who brings tidings that love is all you need . Willard equates the Cosmic Christ with `` agape love '' and proclaims that `` it 's all about agape love . '' ( pp . 154 , 187 . ) Willard states that eternal salvation is ascribed `` exclusively to the Cosmic Christ , the eternal Logos . '' ( p . 187 . ) Where the Bible appears to attribute salvation to the historical Jesus , Willard says this is only a temporal deliverance from physical afflictions such as lameness . ( p . 187 . ) According to Willard , `` the Cosmic Christ is a light that enlightens everyone '' and it is only through the Cosmic Christ by which a person comes to God . ( p. 177 , 187 . ) Indeed , a person who practices `` agape love '' can come to God through the Cosmic Christ , and be accepted by God , even if they have never heard of or believed in the historical Jesus of the Bible . ( p . 184 . ) By ascribing to the Cosmic Christ alone the power to grant eternal salvation and to reconcile men to God , Willard elevates this `` Christ '' above the historical Jesus described in the Scriptures . Consequently , when he says that `` the one we call 'Jesus ' is also the Cosmic Christ '' ( p. 177 ) , we are left to wonder what he actually means by the words `` Jesus '' and `` Christ . `` Francis Schaeffer 's admonition in his book Escape from Reason is needed now more than ever : `` I have come to the point where , when I hear the word 'Jesus'-which means so much to me because of the Person of the historic Jesus and His work-I listen carefully because I have with sorrow become more afraid of the word 'Jesus ' than almost any other word in the modern world . The word is used as a contentless banner , and our generation is invited to follow it . But there is no rational , scriptural content by which to test it , and thus the word is being used to teach the very opposite things from those which Jesus taught . ... . We have come to this fearsome place where the word 'Jesus ' has become the enemy of the Person Jesus , and the enemy of what Jesus taught . We must fear this contentless banner of the word 'Jesus ' not because we do not love Jesus , but because we do love Him . We must fight this contentless banner , with its deep motivations , rooted in the memories of the race , which is being used for the purpose of sociological form and control . We must teach our spiritual children to do the same . `` Escape from Reason : A Penetrating Analysis of Trends in Modern Thoughts ( Ivp Classics )	-1
If you want a book that is just for laughs , read away . If you are looking for great parenting info to help you be the best , caring mom you can be , run far from this book . It encourages you to be selfish and uncaring to the needs of your baby . Babies need their mothers . Good mothers do not need this book .	-1
An abbreviated review on Superfreakonomics because so many of the criticisms I levied against the first installment are equally - and , in many cases more - applicable this time around.Levitt and Dubner were too cute by half in Freakonomics , and here - and why not given the first book 's success in sales - they persist in `` choos ( ing ) ... to go for dust jacket sound bytes ... wind ( ing ) up with an entertaining , if somewhat misleading book . `` The criticism is crystallized best by a quote attributed to Gavin Schmidt ( NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ) in Drake Bennett 's Boston Globe article about the book 's critics : `` At a minimum , they 're guilty of extremely shoddy scholarship and overcredulity . At the worst , they think just being contrarian is much more important than being right . `` And that 's the problem . The book passes itself off as a more fun , more accessible kind of scholarship . But , scholarship is not about selling books and that is the only concern here ( though to be fair , I would be willing to consider an argument that the book could serve some purpose as a thought-provoking conversation piece ) . `` Pop science '' is filling book store shelves these days ( it started with Hawking , and has exploded with Proust was ... , Sway , and the collected works of Malcom Gladwell ) . The problem I have with Superfreakonomics and books like it is that the authors are passing themselves off as experts based on their academic credentials and then peddling research that would never pass muster among their colleagues.Until recently , this kind of work could only have been found in journals relegated to the nerdiest corners of college libraries , read only by those with the ability and understanding to critically assess the methods employed and to evaluate the validity of the conclusions touted . If pop science writing continues to follow the Superfreakonomics model , I would advocate a return to that state of affairs .	-1
I read Catch-22 since people I know said it was funny , a classic , and well written.The book was none of these things . The humor was very juvenile , not funny , boring , and very outdated-there 's an entire joke about how some character supposedly looks like actor Henry Fonda . If you were alive during WWII and in your late 70s , 80s , or 90s now I can see why someone that age would enjoy this book but the humor has not aged well at all.The characters were unrealistic , bad cliches , and bad stereotypes . The whole message of & # 34 ; War is bad & # 34 ; , bureaucracies get nothing done and make no sense , there 's hatred and bigotry in the world , etc . have all been drummed into our heads so much that it 's pointless reading this poorly written novel since the reader learns nothing new from reading this book .	-1
This book is geared for someone that has alot of free time to herself . Perhaps someone that is a stay at home wife or has retired and has all the time in the world to do Mariel 's suggestions . If you are busy with a job because you have to work like most people , than this book is not for you .	-1
I bought this book after reading `` Husband 's Secret . '' I thought that book was wonderful , so I had high expectations for this novel . Sadly I was disappointed . I think the most aggravating thing about it was the rapid switching between multiple characters ' points of view ( without identification at times . ) It was disorienting at times . Additionally , I did n't find several of the story lines very compelling . I 'd recommend one if Moriarity 's other works instead .	-1
I personally was very disappointed in this book . Being a fan of the Warriors series myself , and since i am in the middle of a bunch of friends who love this series , i have read all the Warriors books , and loved them . Of course , i thought this particular book would be just as good , if not better than the others . Erin Hunter has always progressed in her series , by making each book to come better than the others . So , with that expectation , i am 3/4 finished with the book , and still waiting for the excitement to come.The book seemed to be incredibly slow paced , nothing like the rest of the series . Jaypaw spends a lot of the time back in the era of his ancestors , which i found incredibly boring and unimportant . Also , the mountain cats could have been better described , all i got from them was that they worshiped their ancestors and looked up to Stoneteller ( their leader ) . Also i thought the point of the story was uninteresting , i might be a bit biased , since i do not care at all for the mountain cats , and this is mostly what the books about.During the most part of the story Jaypaw is trying to find his destiny and figure out why Rock thinks that the mountain cats are such an important part of it . That part of the story could have been much more well done . Pretty much all of the time Jaypaw is off on his own , trying to find out his destiny . All he does is stay in the background , looking for clues . And other other half of the time he 's having dreams . None of that was in anyway interesting to me . I had always been interested in Jaypaw , because he seems like the one who gets things done . But in this book , all he did was slink around in the back , absorbed in his own thoughts . Nothing gets done , and no crucial information is uncovered . The ONLY good part of this book is the last line , which of course leaves you begging to know what happens in the next book . I must hand it to Hunter , she knows how to hook you onto her series.This book was nothing like the other books in the series . It was a HUGE disappointment for me , avoid reading it , but keep in mind that it does have a link to the next part of the series .	-1
This novel is entertaining at times , a bit slow in other places ; but one thing it is NOT , and that is historical fiction . Imagine an author writing a novel set in the American West of the 1870s ; only instead of his characters riding around on horseback , they 're driving in pickup trucks . This is what Mr. Barone has down with the early Bronze Age.In the first 50 pages I encountered so many historical errors that it quickly became apparent the author did not do his homework . Simple things that any fan of ancient times would know , like drinking water straight ( it was always mixed with wine when possible , even for children , to kill the pathogens ) , the use of coins 2,000 years before money was invented , wearing sandals when everyone still went around barefoot , burning wax candles millennia too early , and perhaps most hysterical of all , the fireplace -- -something that did not come into being until Middle-Age Europe ! I do n't think Mr. Barone did any research on this era , but simply made it up as he went along . Perhaps he spent all of his research time studying ancient warfare instead ( which is n't exactly accurate either ) , but it really shows early in the book.These glaring errors soon made it impossible for me as a reader to envision the story as something that actually could have happened ; instead it becomes pure fantasy fiction and while I enjoy fantasy too , I was initially attracted by the historical aspects of this novel , and found myself severely disappointed . If you 're a reader who just wants a good story and does n't give a fig about history , than you might enjoy Dawn of Empire ; otherwise , look elsewhere .	-1
This book is so worthless it 's shocking that it got published . A lame loser who ca n't keep a job due to his rebelliousness and lack of interest in education travels the country washing dishes . What sounds like an interesting premise actually is n't very interesting at all . The dishwashing itself is dull after the first page because there 's not much variety to it , despite the fact that at one point a guy tells him `` dishwashing is like chess . '' While he acknowledges that dishwashers are the least respected of the restaurant employees , he tries to claim that they are `` the most important '' because the business would break down without them . ( Um , not really ! ) The main problem is that the book focuses on Jordan more than on his adventures . There are a lot of details about specific foods he eats out of the trash ( gross ! ) over a 15-year period . Though the book claims to be about all 50 states , in truth he spends a lot of time on a few select states while glossing over others in just a paragraph . And , **SPOILER ALERT** , he does n't actually finish his quest -- only doing dishes in 33 states ! ( Can you say false advertising ? ) The only interesting stories are about his time skipping from place to place in Branson and when he tricks the David Letterman people into having his friend appear under his name on the show ( both revealing his dishonest side , which occurs throughout the book ) .The author appears to have no conscience or redeeming qualities and some of the scenarios seem so extremely far-fetched that the book could be semi-fictional . It 's also difficult to believe that a guy with so little education could write as fluently as he does here ( if he is that good of a writer why is he wasting it on dishwashing ? ) . He looks down upon almost everyone he meets ( constantly slamming customers ) and finds reasons why he dislikes every job he takes . What could have been inspirational is instead depressing and reinforces the idea that only losers work the dishwasher . Do n't waste your time on this .	-1
The best word I could come up with to describe this book is ... blah.There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together . I would not recommend bothering with this book .	-1
I bought this book because it had been recommended by Planned Parenthood as a realistic depiction of teen-age sex life , plus the story included the protagonist visiting a PP clinic for birth control . As the mother of 12 and 14 year old girls , I thought it would be good to preview the book and let them read something gritty if it was actually realistic . However , I thought the protagonist was awful , a TERRIBLE example of how to live one 's life re : sex and drugs and school . I would not recommend this book to anyone except maybe someone who had been through the same kind of rocky adolescence -- certainly not someone entering adolescence ! I do not think this book is very realistic either , since the protagonist is supposedly a young teenager who goes out to all kinds of punk rock concerts by herself -- who lets their kids roam around like that ? who ever did ? ? Anyway , I did not like the book and do not see any redeeming qualities in it except maybe as a horrible warning .	-1
This is definetly not a book for emergencies ! It has scenario based short stories , which are sarcastic and irreverant.For example : Tips of death cult ettiquette ; Why knocking up a Brazilian Woman can save your life ; How to be 90 % certain you 'll escape canibals.Those are just a few titles from the 69 short stories .	-1
The first part of the book was exciting and had me thinking that this could be an interesting superhuman book.Then the clumsy writing , a bit of deus ex machina , and a deplorable hero got in the way.After the first 20 % I just wanted it to end , which it did , but unfortunately left the story open to sequels .	-1
Do not waste your money . This is an obvious PR effort and none of the recent news regarding the Prince shows up here - for obvious reasons .	-1
This book raises two important issues : 1 ) Do psychedelics help or hinder meditative or transcendental experience ? And 2 ) Did the Doors just suck and got lucky ( right time period , right demographics etc ) on a couple of songs ? My reading experience of this book could have helped by the subject matter written about .	-1
If I have ever read a book that I truly , truly did n't like , this would have to be it . The book is filled with overbearing descriptions that have little to do with the actual book , and the author rambles on and on about points that just were n't interesting to me . Also , for me , when I read a book , I read it to escape reality , not to bury myself deeper in it , which this book did . I did n't find the plot of it very interesting . I was bored by the time she was ten years old -- the characters seemed flat and she jumped from point to point without connecting them . It seemed like just a jumble of random ideas pasted into chapters in a book . Even my English teacher did not like this book , nor did any of my friends . I do not recommend this book .	-1
In this startling book , Paul Johnson claims to find fault with the work of many famous writers because , he says , their personal behaviour was less honourable than the ideas they created , developed or otherwise espoused . Well , gee , Paul , that 's an interesting tactic . On that basis , Christianity is to be despised because Jesus was rude to his mother ( or because He felt that His father , who after all ran the show , was n't there when He needed Him . ) Or you could take the same argument and reverse-engineer it , as it were . You could say that , because Adolf Hitler was kind to animals and scrupulously courteous to women , that therefore Nazism ca n't have been such a terrible thing after all . OK , granted that Hitler took a while to marry Eva Braun , so he was a bit of a cad about that , not to mention that nasty business with Geli Raubal . But Josef Goebbels and Hermann Goering were happy family men , were n't they ? Not to mention Rudolf Hoess , the commandant of Auschwitz during its period of greatest expansion . All great believers in hearth and home . It really clears things up when you look at it that way , does n't it ? One curious fact about this , as I say , startling book is that a striking number of the Intellectuals here displayed with their moral pants down are , goodness me , left-wing intellectuals . In fact , there 's scarcely a conservative to be seen . Hmmm . It does rather make you wonder about Winston Churchill , who was a lifelong Tory who , yes , helped to save Britain during the Second World War ( for which I am grateful to him , seeing as my mother lived through the same ) but who also happened to believe that Arabs were inferior races who did n't deserve to be treated as human . He also drank like a fish . Blimey . And yet Paul had made everything seem so clear . Now I do n't know _what_ to think ! The thing about this book that - now that I 've mentioned it - is actually startling , is that such an asinine , transparently foolish thesis got as far as being taken seriously by a publisher in the first place . Johnson is a right-wing bigot whose intelligence has long been corroded by his inability to appreciate any idea that refuses to serve naked power . Incapable of refuting the arguments of Marx , Rousseau and anybody else he disagrees with , he footlingly attempts to play the man instead of the ball by discrediting the personal lives of better thinkers than him . Thankfully for the rest of us , Christopher Hitchens beat him at his own game years ago , in a review of this book that told some stories about Johnson 's own personal behaviour that it would be impolitic to repeat here ( though you can read them yourself in Hitchens ' collection `` Prepared for the Worst '' . ) In the meantime , this is the usual collection of sloppy invective , gasbag harrumphing and hawkish platitudes that Johnson-watchers have learned to expect.I do n't believe that there 's a single `` intellectual '' , of any stripe , from Gandhi to Stalin via Noam Chomsky and Norman Podhoretz , who has n't done something that even their most faithful admirers could n't find objectionable . Thing is , Paul , ideas have a life of their own . It does n't matter a jot that the person who first had the idea farted in bed or borrowed a lot of money . A good idea is a good idea , and part of the responsibility of being an intellectual is to sort out the good ideas from the bad - and , in so doing , to determine the truth.Think how many birds might have found perfectly good nests in the trees that were chopped down to print this drivel . Ah well .	-1
I did not enjoy this book . If I had paid more than $ 1.99 for it I would have been upset.The author takes 40 pages of endless of description at the first just taking a bus ride home and going out to see an old friend of his deceased father 's . The whole book is like that.You have to skim quickly . Read a couple page of f the 20 page descriptions to set the scene and then skim to where the story actually moves forward . Skim quickly through more infinite descriptions and then get a few pages of story . Repeat pattern to end of book.I ca n't believe this book won the PEN/Faulkner award . I also read the `` Devil in the Grove '' about Thurgood Marshall 's early work with the Groveland Boys case . That was gripping . I could n't put it down.This book was 90 % florid descriptions and 10 % story . I do not recommend it . I only finished it because I felt compelled to , not because I enjoyed it or wanted to . Too bad . The essence of the Chaneysville incident is good . This book 's telling of it was boring .	-1
Let me just put it this way : I am glad that `` In Evil Hour '' is not the first Garcia-Marquez novel I had read , or I might not have picked another one up . `` One Hundred Years of Solitude '' and `` Love in the Time of Cholera '' are absolute masterpieces . I suppose that `` In Evil Hour '' was just practice for the young Garcia-Marquez ... I believe this was his first novel , and all great artists have to start somewhere.Basically , this is a story of a South American town that is being undone by the posting of 'lampoons ' . Martial law is declared , a fact that surprises exactly no one , as they have lived under tyranny and the empty promises of democrats their entire lives . It is a simple treatise on South American politics , and as such does manage to stand on its own , but it hardly seems that unique to me . Perhaps it was on the date of its original publication , circa 1960.The cast of characters is too large to keep up with , and really none of the characters are even overly interesting . While the reviewers on the back of this book called it `` dream-like '' , I would prefer vague and nondescript . From about page ten , the only thing I wanted to do was to not read this book anymore . I did manage to finish , but only becuase it 's an extremely short book.I give this book 2 stars , because we meet the fictional village of Macondo and Colonel Aureliano ( literary legends made famous in `` One Hundred Years of Solitude '' ) for the first time . And also because , hey , it is after all Gabriel Garcia-Marquez I 'm reviewing here .	-1
Why is it that so many travel writers pretend that travelling and writing is the last thing they want to do ? and that everywhere they visit they would prefer to be sitting at home , eating only familiar food and meeting only people they already know and understand well.I was told Bill Bryson was a gifted , lucid writer , but I am hoping this my first introduction to him was far from his best . He keeps acting like someone is forcing him to travel through small-town America and endure the culture shock ( he is from Iowa , but would very much prefer to be in England ) and constantly complains of the small-town Americans as uncultured , overfed boors . Now , I dont disagree entirely with his view of country folk - but that is how country folk are in nearly every country in the world , and Americans are actually friendlier and more open-minded than in many other countries I have visited.He also exaggerates his feeling out-of-place , suggesting that , for instance , unkempt Northerners like himself might get beaten up in the ( prejudiced , obviously ) South . Since I - a dark-skinned Indian - have driven through remote parts of the South and Texas - about the same time as Bryson did , this seems especially silly.Where he might provide some insight into rural American life or culture , he chooses instead for shameless praise of Britain or Europe . Sprinkled throughout , for apparent entertainment , are juvenile attempts at humor - usually references to bodily functions or stupid sexual jokes.The British - during the War - used to refer to Americans as 'Overfed , Oversexed , and Over here ' . Might they be referring to Bryson ?	-1
( Excelling deeply ) What can I say ? At times , she entered a make-believe world and began writing as if to tell some elaborate tale just to take up space . Then , she would be back to the present moment . I kept reading , but whenever she would go back to the elaborate allegories , tales , or whatever else she felt like delving into at the moment , I would almost get discouraged . I read this book because many people have presented Zora Neale Hurston as a great American writer . She is a great writer , but this book is not the read I was hoping for . I have written quite a bit , and unless you have written it is hard to explain how I know this , but ... .I could see her style change every time she ran out of quality words to write . It was like reading the writings of someone with dissociative identity disorder ( formerly called multiple personality disorder ) . I am not making light of mental illness , but that really is how the style was to me .	-1
I am very disappointed . I obviously ordered The Wit and Wisdom of WINSTON CHURCHILL , but instead received The Wit and Wisdom of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN . Could be a minor error , but it did specify on the order confirmation my original request . I would like to exchange the purchase .	-1
Those who enjoy reading about very eccentric , irresponsible and self absorbed people who seem to have difficulty relating to others , particularly their own children ... . the elder of which is referred to always as 'the child ' ... . might truly like this book . The writing is good , occasionally funny and paints a nice picture , BUT the author and her family are so unappealing that by the end of the first chapter I was ready to toss the book in disgust . Since I was stuck in an airplane waiting out a thunderstorm and had little choice , I read on ... . hoping it would get better . It did n't . After reading several books about people restoring Italian homes and making a life for themselves in Italy , I 've come to realize that the author 's personality must be tolerable for you or the book will not be . This woman is from another planet . I just ca n't warm up to someone who would endanger her children 's health , at a minumum , and seems to have almost no interest in them , except to chronical their exploits . Her husband is a real case , her daughter , 'the child ' , is following in Mom 's footsteps of crazydom . Only the little boy might have a chance at normalcy , but it 's hard to tell . Anyway , if crazy characters seem like fun , this may be the book for you . ( Italy , by the way , is only incidental in the book . ) If , on the other hand , you want sane , touching , funny , real people you 'd like to know and their very charming , very Italian story , ready The Hills of Tuscany by Mate .	-1
I should 've paid more attention to who the author was . She has the talent of creating a book without much essence and with tons of fluff . There are practically no ideas of what to say , just exercises of how to reach your own source of creativity and come up with the words . The whole book can be summarized in one plain sentence , `` Get yourself in the mood and let go of inhibitions . ''	-1
Before I get assumptive comments on this review : I have been married three years to the person I gave my virginity to . But her slut-shaming and guilting a client into being sorry about her abortion is n't cool . She just sounds like a bitch .	-1
Creativity is a very broad concept and bears on equally broad , elusive and poorly understood fields such as spirituality , philosophy and religion , and as such should be approached with humbleness . The author tries to over-rationalize something that , like faith , love and poetry , can not be grasped by the scientific method . Trying to squeeze that very thing that makes us humans into rigid , objective , artificial , methodological scientific research reduces it to a parody of itself . In the end , the author equates creativity with worldly success . He stands within one inch from concluding that creativity is The Art of The Deal . Nothing is said of the creative process itself , and only a very UNcreative person could have written such book.Very disappointing .	-1
I just could n't get into this . I love Kundera 's ideas and philosophy , but the storylines were weak . I loved The Unbearable Lightness of Being , so that may be why this was such a disappointment . I want to say it 's just because I do n't get it , but I 'm more inclined to think there 's just not much to get . Perhaps I 'll try it again some other time .	-1
This book provides a broad overview of some of the issues behind the Simplicity movement . The author , Cecile Andrews set up a number of Simplicity study circles near her home in the Northwest . This book reveals some of the factors that led her to become interested in Simplicity as well as her ideas of how Simplicity study circles might work . Much of the beginning of the book provides justification for adopting Simplicity . Andrews enumerates problems such as hyper-consumption , environmental degradation , and personal isolation . She also explores possible actions we could take to solve these problems , such as consciously building community with other people and the earth , finding ways to express our spirituality , and restructuring our economic system to make it more environmentally and socially friendly . In the last part of the book , she describes the idea of Simplicity study circles , the benefits that might be gained from participating in one , and how a study circle should operate . She also provides a 10-week study plan based on the earlier material in the book.Although I agree with the ideas in this book , I found the book rather disappointing in content . Much of the discussion is either so personal as to be hard to generalize , or else a superficial summary of other more substantial texts . For example , Andrews frequently refers to findings of Juliet Schor ; readers would have more material for discussion by reading Schor 's works directly . Some of Andrews ' suggestions for addressing problems are rather inappropriate . To draw attention to hyper-consumerism , she suggests surreptitiously clothes-pinning tags with messages like `` You do n't really need this , do you ? '' inside articles of clothing in shops . While I 'm all for trying to get people to become more aware of their needless purchases , I do n't think messing with the property of individual store owners is an acceptable way to go about the mission . Her suggestions for reforming our economic system would be great in an ideal state , but until we are run by a benevolent socialist dictator , I do n't think they can realistically be put into action . It would be better to focus our efforts on goals that are conceivably achievable . Overall , while I found the topic of this book interesting , I think there are numerous other books on the topic of Simplicity that are better implemented , starting with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin 's `` Your Money or Your Life '' . It 's hard to tell from this book if Andrews can take credit for originating Simplicity study groups such as those run by the Northwest Earth Institute . If so , she certainly deserves credit for her efforts in that area , but I do n't think there 's enough substantial material in this volume to use as background reading for an effective study group by itself .	-1
To begin with , a very nice premise . But Findley just does n't deliver . It 's not that I need every question answered after all life 's not like that , no reason literature should be . But a little more in the way of resolution would have been nice.Mr . Findley also gets too wrapped up with being a writer sometimes ... you know what I mean . You 've got an interesting idea now just tell the story .	-1
Above all , this book is a boring , bad read . Schom manages to turn one of the most exciting times in human history into a sleep-inducing , laborious , and moralistic piece of drudgery . His accounts of the Italian and Egyptian campaigns are fit for a Sunday afternoon librarians ' luncheon . The book is poorly researched , often going to secondary sources . Schom lacks any true historical sense , as he blunders past events whose significance escapes his good little democratic mind . The main virtue of this book is to show us a fine example of the democratic/petty bourgeois/moralistic fetishism with denigrating the images of one of history 's most magnificent human specimens . One can just see someone like Schom , a little dry academician condemned to eternal obscurity by history , getting off on showing Napoleon in as bad a light as possible . No wonder this book striked a chord with so many readers . There is nothing that little democrats get off on more than peering into the private lives and & quot ; lack of morality & quot ; of great figures . PS The reviewer below should look up & quot ; fascist & quot ; in a dictionary . He will find Schom 's historical methods fit the description more that Napoleon 's personality .	-1
The Bell Jar is a story of a teenage girl , Ester Greenwood , who dives deeper and deeper into depression , rejection & suicidal thoughts . The novel starts out with Ester 's internship in NYC for a magazine , all seems normal . However , when Ester returns home she is on a downward spiral , eventually going through with her suicide thoughts and ending up in an instutition.Not having suffered from depression and self-esteem issues , it was hard for me to relate to Ester and her troubles.The Bell Jar is a a very sad tale of depression , thoughts of suicide , belonging and self-worth .	-1
I bought this book because I thought it would be interesting to see critical comments of an American author of what people usually call & quot ; globalization & quot ; or & quot ; new economy & quot ; . None of these terms is well-defined and Luttwak adds another one to the list : & quot ; Turbo Capitalism & quot ; . I admit that as a European I have a certain prejudice , namely that American authors generally do n't understand too well what 's going on outside of the US - and this book is no exception to the rule . To give just one example : Luttwak states that American executives usually work hard whereas European ones spend a lot of their time at the Riviera with their secretary-mistresses . No comment . Even where Luttwak knows a little bit more about what 's going on outside the US , he oversimplifies things a little bit too much and he would have been well-advised to get rid off about 50 % of the statistics and data and to dig deeper into the remaining 50 % . However , the book offers some interesting views of today 's & quot ; global economy & quot ; and , in particular , of what it lead ( s ) to in the US . Many of the comments he makes are n't too unfamiliar for a European reader . Europeans still stick to their way of dealing with social inequality because they are convinced that it is the duty of the society to support those who are counted amongst the losers of today 's liberal economy . It is interesting to see how Luttwak tries to motivate this idea . So that 'd be one of my stars . The second star Luttwak gets for pointing out some completely obvious points which nobody really seems to care for . For instance , people claim that in the US many more jobs are created than destroyed . While that is true , an implicit implication which is usually made is wrong : Contrary to naive beliefs of many people ( and especially of European & quot ; New Labour/Third Way/Neue Mitte & quot ; social democrats ) , a worker who looses his job at , say , GM is NOT hired by , say , Microsoft . Rather , he is usually forced to accept another GM-like job for a lower salary . Luttwak gives some nice statistics which show this . I especially liked how he pointed out that white-collar workers earn less than blue-collar workers . You do n't believe it ? Have a look into the book !	-1
His view of God is fluffy and New Agey.His relationship booksI thought were bad enough but this book comes across as though he has some secret information about spiritual matters , ,not ! ! He repeats himself about getting connected with God , and to meit sounds more like `` God source '' as many New Agers say , ratherthan God.More like God source within you , eh , this is too much ! I agree with the other reviewer who said it 's about selfpromotion.Seems like that to me too.It 's kind of a funny book , ok for a good laugh I suppose but not for seriously lookingfor religion or God .	-1
What do I say about this overhyped waste of paper ? Well , the history , clearly , has been meticulously researched , and great pains have been taken to write the characters actions , etc. , around the known historical facts in such a way as to not mislead anyone . This is why I 'm giving this 2 stars , instead of 1 . I will give a point for good research . That said : I do n't think the characters are particularly well drawn , not even Sharpe himself . The 'villians ' in particular were melodramatic and unbelievable.I kept thinking that the whole thing read like an old DC comic book . Not that they were bad -- but they WERE simplistic , and so is this.I got sucked into this by a fanatic Sean Bean fan who made me watch several of these movies last weekend -- which has strained our friendship , let me tell you . I decided to read a couple of the books , thinking maybe there would be something more to the books -- those ridiculous movies , not even the substantial attractiveness of Mr. Bean could overcome . Alas , it 's clear to me now that it 's the attractiveness of Mr. Bean , and not the quality of Mr. Cornwell 's writing that have all these 'Sharpie ' people captivated . Imagining Mr. Bean as you read helps , but not enough . Not enough.If you 're looking for good information about the battle of Sera-who-sis and the Tippy-toodle , this might be the book for you . Otherwise , I recommend you give the whole series a pass . I say that having read the next two , and neither of them get any better . I refuse to waste any more time on this crap . I 'll re-read Patrick O'Brian !	-1
I was a big Far Side fan for years.Two of my favorite ones are where the T. Rex family are at the dinner table and one dinosaur says , & # 34 ; Hey ! I 'm trying to pass the potatoes ! My forearms are as useless as yours ! & # 34 ; And who could forget the cartoon with the caption , & # 34 ; What killed the dinosaurs , & # 34 ; and it shows them smoking cigarettes . I bought all the Far Side books and thought Gary Larson was the best cartoonist of all time ; I still do . I was very sad when he retired from cartooning.When I stumbled across this book while looking for a nephew gift , I got very excited by the reviews because I planned to read it before gifting it . After all these years of no new Far Side cartoons , I was going to read something The Master had written ! Alas , although the drawings are good and there are some cute inside jokes , I feel Mr. Larson has lost his edge , which is probably inevitable . The reviewers saying adults will love it are I guess even more hard core fans of Gary than I am/was . I did n't even want to gift the book , so it went to Goodwill .	-1
Did you ever have a fellow reading friend who kept recommending books you did n't like ? First you 'd read them and give faint , vague praise . Then you 'd read them and quickly change the subject . Then you 'd just pretend you read them . All the time feeling guilt and sadness ? This is how I 'm now feeling about the National Book Award Committee . I 'd already read three of the five finalists before tackling Paraguay , and had n't been impressed by or more importantly gotten enjoyment out of any of them . In fact , each one I 've read has been worse than the one before . So I decided to skip Florida ( I 'll pretend to have read it ) and jump to Paraguay , the winner . But instead of being the best , as winning the award might lead one to assume , it is the worst.Perhaps the fact that the publisher felt the need to identify the work as a novel in the title itself should have given some forewarning . The prose is not spare , sparse , crystalline , or minimalist . It is simply mostly flat and monotone , seldom evoking interest in either style or content . The structure , small vignettes taking the form of narrative , letters , diary entries , etc . adds no interest to the work and thus comes across as more lazy ( no desire to pen actual transitions ) than experimental . As a whole the work is episodic but the episodes are too often disconnected , too often perched at the same narrative level , too often voiced in the same tone . Between the flat-voiced narration , the seemingly random episodic structure , and the brevity of the separate narrative moments , it is difficult to work up much interest over what is happening or how it is told . And the characters do not save Tuck , as all too few are interesting in their own right and the ones who are tend to be small side characters who are too quickly discarded . Once you remove style , story , and character , you are n't left with much and this book was a struggle to complete , despite its slimness . Rather than growing accustomed to the style , I found myself growing more and more annoyed by it.Clearly the Book Award committee found something to like in this work , and people should keep that in mind , but no matter how hard I look , I simply ca n't figure out what it was . Even among the other nominees , none of which were particularly strong and whose nominations I also could n't understand , there were better choices for the award . And there were far too many books published last year not nominated that will better serve a reader 's time . Not recommended .	-1
If you 've read the very fine `` The Last Kingdom '' and `` The Arthurian '' series , you already know what an exceptional writer Bernard Cornwell is.So what happened with `` The Archer 's Tale '' series ? Repetitious , meandering , and downright boring , with Thomas wandering aimlessly about the story . Such a one dimensional character ! Bring back Uhtred ! Bring back Dervel ! Give us characters that jump off the page ! Take it from me , if you 've read `` The Last Kingdom '' and `` The Arthurian '' series , you will be bored .	-1
This is undoubtedly a better book than two stars , but that 's all I can give it , because that how the book was for me . Not being an artiste like Patti , I have a hard time getting excited about her scores of references to Rimbaud and other artists in ways that assumes the reader must know everything about them . Perhaps I could have learned something about them if Smith would have explained in all those references a little more about why or how Rimbaud et al related to what she was writing about . A somewhat comparable memoir is Keith Richards ' `` Life '' ( and yes Patti drops his name here too along with dozens of other musicians , poets , photographers , et al ) . Keith writes in detail about making music with other celebrities but not with a lot of jargon and in ways that fans can understand what he 's talking about and if he drops a musician 's name he explains what the connection is to that particular reference . Patti tends to just mention the names for the sake of mentioning the names . It 's not so much that she 's trying to prove how cool she is , but she just seems to identify so many things with her heroes without explaining why . And that for me is the problem with most of the book . Everything is headlines , there are few stories and they are short and similar and not particularly connected . There 's no overall story beyond that she has a long-term on-off devoted relationship to Robert . But I do n't really get a sense of who Patti is because she 's mostly an observer of all the stuff around her . She 's more the reporter than the main character of her memoir . It 's all about the cool places she went and the cool people she talked with . But few of these people last more than a few paragraphs and then it 's on to the next celebrity sighting and quote . And she describes them in ideal terms most of the time , seemingly reluctant to criticize anyone . As the book progresses Patti is devoted to her art , but does n't seemed to be focused on making any particular kind and the same goes for Mapplethorpe . They seem more wannabe artists trying to mix together stuff they find and photos into 3D collages . Kitsch , but artistic kitsch . I do get a sense of who he is , but I 'm not impressed . He 's mostly a deadbeat who she lets off the hook for getting any kind of real job because Robert is an artist and a regular job would n't fit his personality . Meanwhile it is n't till they 've been together about three years before he seriously tries to SELL any of all the art he 's making . And the same for Patti , but at least she maintains a real job in a bookstore.Smith certainly knows how to turn a phrase and her poetry background comes in handy in that sense , but too many of the phrases seem unconnected and hard to understand in context . They seem to come out of nowhere like poetry sometimes does . She has a great remembrance of physical detail , I 'm guessing because she kept extensive journals at the time and that works well for her in terms of memory , but works against her in terms of a story arc as the book reads like a collection of journal pages . So it 's a somewhat engaging read that never seems to go anywhere . She writes in an interesting way , there 's just no plot , no story . The characters are described well physically , but the conversations are snippets so we do n't learn much about them . And the characters just come and go . Besides Robert , they do n't last very long.The extended ending is done nicely and gives a better sense of who these two people were.So National Book Award material , I think not . Do the people who give these awards actually read the whole books or do they just go by number of celebrity sightings and artistic cachet ?	-1
The author of this Nobel Prize-winning novel was born in China in 1940 . After becoming a renowned writer both nationally and internationally , he went into exile , settling in France in 1987 . & quot ; Soul Mountain & quot ; was first published 3 years later in Taiwan.The leading character in this autobiographical novel is a writer who is considered persona non grata by the government . After being wrongly diagnosed with lung cancer , he sets out on a spiritual journey through China in the hope of finding his true self . These themes reflect the author 's own experiences . He was also wrongly diagnosed with lung cancer and left Beijing for political reasons to travel overseas . The name of the novel comes from the destination of a person the protagonist meets on a train . After this meeting , he is also filled with an urge to visit Soul Mountain , but does n't know how to get there . Instead he goes to a giant panda reserve deep in the mountains , visits tribal villages , and stops at an ancient city to muse on the great poets of the past . He also visits his childhood home on the Yangtze River only to find that it has been completely modernized.The message of the book seems to be finding contentment in our lives . The narrator encounters people satisfied with what they are , such as a ranger living peacefully in a remote area without any concern for money or prestige . He also meets a traveling monk who used to be a doctor before , and asks him why he became a monk.One of the tricks Gao uses is the ambiguous use of personal pronouns . He meets 'her ' during his odyssey , and enriches the narrative by telling her numerous stories , but who she is remains unclear . Because the narrator is on a spiritual journey as much as a physical one , we are left unsure as to whether he finally reaches Soul Mountain.Using the journey as a metaphor for life , this novel tries to explore many of the issues that face us in life . For some , this will fill a spiritual vacuum and seem very profound , but for others - especially cynics like me - this will seem as profound as a 528-page fortune cookie .	-1
As another rather sharp reviewer ( A. Ross ) has written , this very long book can be merely classified as strictly futuristic EXPERIMENTAL literature . It has no concise central plot , it can not be told in so many words and it has no point except that of prolonging an unending story in the guise of philosophy ... But what is the essence of this philosophy - I am unable to tell . The writing is vague , bland and unexciting , the events or happenings are forgettable and the book is by and large very unsatisfying . My guess is that had the author not received a Nobel prize the book would have been added to the gigantic heap of published and largely unread fiction . Since he has received a Nobel prize it is no wonder that many ambitious , tolerant and/or eager readers , with lots of free time to spend , have purchased the book and have read it or , perhaps , claim to have read it . I must admit that as a rule I respect Nobel prize winners and at times make an effort to read them ( Boell , Garcia , Kertesz etc . ) However with Xingjian 's mountain of a book I wrestled for a week or two and then put it down after 60 or 70 very dull pages . Unsurprisingly , in view of the above the majority of published reviews must originate with extremely patient , tolerant and undemanding fellow men and women readers who after investing much time and labor would rather praise the book than put it down . But I tend to hold the opinion that the large majority of those who tried to read Soul Mountain abided by the dictum of John Witherspoon ( 1723-94 ) : `` Never read a book through merely because you have begun it '' . And my guess is that these latter usually refrain from writing reviews ... Perhaps , I am an exception ...	-1
This is possibly the worst book I 've ever read all the way through . Poorly argued , poorly written , poorly sourced . Sloppy . Laughable . Error-ridden . The title figure of the `` Forgotten Man '' is a moving target through the book so that by the end you 're not sure who she even considers the `` forgotten man . '' It 's subtitled a `` new history '' but she never really spells out what 's `` new '' about it , not once making reference to most historians ' `` take '' on the New Deal and how her view is different . She should n't even call it a `` history '' - more like her personal musings . If her main point is that the New Deal did n't work that well and that we would 've been better off under Coolidge and Mellon , I think Robert Bartley and the Wall Street Journal were making THAT point back in the late 1970s and early 1980s , so there 's nothing `` new '' about that . She builds her story around unlikely heroes , victims , and characters of the time . She admires Calvin Coolidge , mostly for his ability to do nothing . She admires Justice James McReynolds one of the least-admirable justices in the Court 's history ; she fails to note the irony of the notoriously anti-Semitic McReynolds questioning the Schechter brothers on their kosher poultry business . She worships Wendell Willkie . Felix Frankfurter is the evil eminence-grise lurking behind the scenes pulling the strings controlling those naughty bookish intellectuals who want to turn the US into a Stalinist nirvana . She spends needless time on the forgotten figure of Father Divine , why I do n't know . She completely underestimates the psychological value of FDR 's leadership during the Depression . Her writing style is off-putting , feeling the need to give us the names of every steamship anyone mentioned in the book ever used to travel to Europe or back - perhaps she figured it would give this otherwise poorly sourced book an air of verisimilitude . She purposelessly notes coincidences of geography or states of birth of personages she 's talking about , in ways such as `` They had radically different economic philosophies even though they both lived in Massachusetts . '' She talks of American business leaders meeting in early 1940 trying to stop war in Europe from breaking out - sorry guys , too late ! I could go on , but the whole thing is just awful . Ca n't believe I read through the whole thing . Do yourself a favor and do n't do as I did .	-1
For 70 years , conservatives have hated Roosevelt and everything he stood for . Their loathing of the New Deal , however , is pure , elitist ideology . If the New Deal was so destructive and bad , then why were there 3 decades of unabated prosperity after 1945 ? Why have there not been any large-scale depressions since the 1930s ? Conservatives , moreover , hated the FDR administration for its eventual alliance against Fascism . Throughout the 1930s ( a dirty little secret today ) , right-wingers saw Hitler , Franco , and Mussolini as the lesser evil . They doggedly defended the Axis as a bulwark against Communism . And fittingly , they saw the New Deal as the first step toward Communism in America.So I 'm waiting now for a foreign-policy sequel to Amity Shlaes 's book , in which someone will argue that FDR should have sided with Hitler and fought the Soviets instead . It 's the next logical step and ca n't be too far down the road . Perhaps that could be Ms. Shlaes 's next project . I look forward to it	-1
Very boring . Not worth the purchase or even taking the time to review it . A thoroughly boring and uninteresting book .	-1
I was assigned this book for a class on Sex Roles in the Modern World . I attend a women 's college , despite the fact that I do n't like the term 'feminist ' , because , grammatically , it implies superiority . I term myself an 'equalist ' , and make sure I 'm aware of the difficulties both sexes face instead of cultivating a victim mentality.This book bought 100 % into the cult of the victim . The women in it were unfulfilled , angry , and spiteful . They harbored hatred towards the men in their lives , but never told them - just continued growing angrier and angrier as the men continued to cross never-defined lines . Like the woman in the open marriage who was so unhappy and unsatisfied . Just tell him how unhappy you are ! If he 's worth anything , he 'll realize that it 's not polyamory if only one partner is into it . If not , drop him and stop pretending . At the very least , stop whining about problems that you have never taken one step towards solving.Actually , that 's my biggest problem with modern feminism : we are raised with a victim mentality , and instead of fighting it , women who are supposed to inspire young girls buy into it completely . `` This woman did n't get elected because she 's a woman , not because anyone might have a problem with her politically . This woman was n't accepted as a firefighter because she 's a woman , not because she did n't have the physical strength to do the job . This woman did n't top the corporate ladder because she 's a woman , not because they found someone better qualified . '' It makes me feel sick that so many young women in my school believe that there is a boot on their face , shoving them down , and they are n't willing to do anything more active than complain . All this book was was women carping about how they are so entirely oppressed , yet they do nothing about it . If even one woman had stood up and said , `` I 'm mad as hell , and by God , I 'm going to do something about it ! `` , then this book would n't be such a wash . I felt drained when I finished reading . Drained and disappointed . Apparently we weak little girls must accept that boot in the face with nothing more than a wry observation . Where are the women who tell us girls to get off our own duffs , toss that boot aside , and climb wherever we want ?	-1
If it 's true that everything is good for something , even if it is a bad example , this book might by used accordingly , otherwise , do n't waste your time.Each chapter of this book is written by a different professional writer , each with a story to tell about her particular life , relationships , etc . I found it to be a disturbing and even appalling read on many levels . For one , these women are not `` typical '' in that they do not represent the rank and file of American women , wives and mothers , at least not the ones that I know ! They are professional writers who are urban , educated , liberal , and comparitively affluent . These women live and work primarily in academia . The book is a compilation of chapters in which these writers rant , whine , confess and obsess about their relationships , careers , etc . It misses the point of getting views from women of all walks of life and social status.I found this book offensive in that because they have , as writers , the platform to flaunt their deviance and dysfunction ( sexually , morally , politically , etc . ) , they play it off as normal and representative of the rest of us . Perhaps in their literary or academic worlds , they are the norm , but for the vast majority of us wives and moms out here in the real world , I do n't think so ! I got the impression that many of these women thought it was somehow a display of their writing prowess if they divulged more dark , freaky , wacko secrets and shocking confessions than their sister in the previous chapter , be it on their affair with another woman , a married man , or their open marriage.The Hannah Pine piece is particularly disturbing and I can see why she uses a pseudonym ; had her real name been used there would be no reason why this pitiful woman would not be carted off to the mental health ward . She writes of the affairs she and her husband have had with other people and her obviously unsuccessful , yet frighteningly denied , attempt to justify the affairs as anything negative or unhealthy , even priding herself on chosing to not be angry over her husbands habit of sleeping with other women . Afterall , that could put a damper on his lust and we would n't want to restrict him in such an negative and oppressive manner ... PUH-LEEZE ! ! ! ! !	-1
I probably echo a lot of reviews on Amazon when I claim that this book is treats the philosophy of Popper so lightly that there 's little mystery why books like this do not get written about modern academics very often . The authors do a number of things well : they portray post-war King 's College , they show how Wittgenstein 's students reverence for their teacher , and they illustrate Bertrand Russell off to the side , not being of much consequence . That being said , I really did not get a feel for what Popper and Wittgenstein were arguing about , what their lives ' works were , and after all these years , who turned out be in the right . If one wants to find out what modern philosophy `` is like , '' this book does not seem to be much help.This is an attempt to popularize a core conflict in modern philosophy , without all that bothersome thinking . I recommend Magee 's `` Confessions of a Philosopher '' or Scruton 's `` Modern Philosophy '' as alternate choices .	-1
The fact that Don Campbell , on the basis of someone else 's research , went out and TRADEMARKED the phrase & quot ; The Mozart Effect , & quot ; should raise some red flags in and of itself . It should be obvious that Campbell took a 1993 study ( that offered only the most tentative of conclusions ) and piggybacked it onto the LEGITIMATE field of music therapy , all in order to make a quick buck . It does indeed seem to be working , judging from the vast array of Mozart Effect items that are readily available for purchase.The entire marketing empire rest upon the fallacy that & quot ; listening to Mozart will make you smarter. & quot ; The original researchers reached no such conclusions , and have long since disavowed Don Campbell 's claims . The most that could be said of the original research was that listening to classical music ( in this case Mozart 's Sonata for 2 Pianos K448 -- - not one of his finer efforts , actually ) may have helped the listener relax , which in turn may have boosted short-term performance . The results were short-term and have been very difficult to duplicate , but this has not stopped Don Campbell from making all manner of extravagant claims , none supported by scientific evidence that bears up under close scrutiny.If you are dumb enough to believe the & quot ; Mozart Effect & quot ; claims , then you could listen to Mozart 24/7 for the next couple of decades without seeing any notable improvement .	-1
There is little to add to the other one star reviews already posted here . This biography of Charles Schulz suffers from several glaring flaws . The first is the biograher 's curse - that is the desire to destroy or bring down the person you have decided to dedicate years of your life to . I do n't know why so many biographers fall for this trap perhaps familiarity does indeed breed contempt or maybe , as Oscar Wilde knew , each man kills the thing he loves . Michaelis takes a thing of joy for millions , the Peanuts strip , and sucks the life and the love out of it in an attempt to show how `` Sparky '' was really a sad-sack . The second flaw is the author 's banal insight that Charles M Schulz is actually Charles F Kane . He warps his narrative to fit a real life into a fictional model.Save your money and your time and buy the collected peanuts instead those you will read again and again and they will make you happy .	-1
About two/thirds through this book I started to doubt its credibility . The contrast between the cold , distant and unloving creator and his much loved creations does make for an intriguing hook , but after a while I was thinking , come one , there had to be more to the life of Charles Schultz than this grim one-note depiction . Michaelis ' unrelenting and repetitive focus on bitterness and sadness made it hard for me to 1 ) stay interested , and 2 ) suspend my disbelief . Given the access Michaelis had to records , family members , and friends , it is disappointing that he has taken such a one-dimensional approach to his subject .	-1
When I heard the author interviewed on NPR I thought this book would be whimsical , fun , and informative ; it is none of the above . There 's a bit too much information about his parents ' austere form of parenting , his dysfunctional extended family , and the connection with the cartoons did n't occur enough to make the book a fun read.If you are a die-hard Peanuts fan , maybe you would find this interesting ; however , as one who is n't , but was willing to see what all of the hubbub has been about , I 'm still not .	-1
Have no idea why this book got so many high ratings . I never knew if people were talking to each other or just talking in their heads because there was absolutely NO punctuation . The story really did n't flow and was unbelievable . It seems like the author just wanted to print a bunch of Civil War memories and then add some kind of story to them . I 'm sorry I wasted money on this book .	-1
It 's only marginally funny in places . I think perhaps it might have overreached itself ( A Trek Too Far ? ) and is only occasionally funny . I loved the Dr. Seuss bit , though . . .	-1
You do n't need all these words in a book . Wait a minute ; this is only volume 1 . Oh my God ! !	-1
Unless you are a scholar who requires this book for research , do not buy it . The autobiography comprises only a small portion of this work . Furthermore , it is rambling and disjointed . Twain intended that his autobiography be extemporaneous or a recorded stream of consciousness and he succeeded . The reason I found this disappointing is that I enjoy learning how a person and their career simultaneously developed . An autobiography gives me an opportunity to have the additional insights provided by their private thoughts.I believe Twain was not as honest as he led himself to believe while dictating this work because he did not force himself to systematically review the parts of his life he might not have wanted to revisit . Often the parts of our life that are the most difficult are the most revealing .	-1
I was a kid , read The Alchemist and really enjoyed it . Next step I open this thing and had to put it down after a few pages . Tried more than once but it 's absolute rubbish . The prose , the plot , the characters , everything is painfully bad .	-1
This is really miss-titled . It is not a How to book . Rather it is a collection of stories , from Ms. Lener 's childhood , which kind of sort of related to dealing with someone where there is tension in the air . You may come away with a few useful ideas in getting along , but you will be underwhelmed.Actually it is a pretty good 50 page book , but the problem is it went on for hundreds of pages . Lots of words about situations , but little to take away .	-1
The pages are photocopied clumsily -- they have a grey , uneven background . Translation is out of date . Much better options out there !	-1
The beginning was good and fast moving . As I read along , it got harder and harder to stay with it . It got too & # 34 ; wordy & # 34 ; .	-1

I read this book when it was new , and found it entertaining . I did n't think much more about it after that . Then I came upon a reference to it in one of Gardner 's books concerning bad science . Looking back at it knowing so much more now , I agree , it 's borderline nonsence . E.g . electrons do n't & quot ; think & quot ; about making a choice about which way to go ; they enter into superposition .	-1
I was hoping that this would be a comprehensive home repair guide that would help me to handle some `` honey-do 's '' in our home myself instead of always having to wait for my husband to find time . As I browsed through the chapters , though , I found myself asking `` Someone needs to be told how to do THIS ? ? '' I mean , is replacing a toilet seat really that tough ? Do you need instructions on how to replace a furnace filter ? Noone would describe me as `` mechanically inclined '' , but those are things I could figure out without help ! Some of the little stories at the beginning of each chapter are also pretty condescending . For example , under `` Replacing a Receptacle '' , it says `` Do n't let this electrical repair jolt you into a frenzy - instead , think of this project as earning you bragging rights at the office cooler or in the carpool line . `` I wish the authors had skipped the cutesy stuff and just gotten to the meat of the topic.So , if you 're looking for a VERY basic home repair manual , this is probably OK . Otherwise , you 'll probably be happier with something more comprehensive . Check it out at the libary before you buy it .	-1
I am not a willfully blind , states-rights crackpot who accuses Foner of slandering classically educated Southerners.My complaint is strictly with the Kindle version . Of course , one expects some errors when a book is scanned for transformation into an electronic edition . I have read some Kindle books before , and noticed the occasional error -- usually easy to ignore and not terribly memorable.However , this book is downright difficult to read . `` Democrat , '' for example , if often rendered `` Democracy . '' I do n't pretend to understand the technology , but you would think that there would be some sort of spell-check involved . But no : `` precipitate '' is rendered `` precipitatate . `` Commas are routinely rendered as periods , and vice versa ; colons for semi-colons , etc . Perhaps most seriously , quotes almost never are ended by a quotation mark . There is one to start the quote , but then one must guess at when the quote ends . All this means that the book is quite often a pain to read.I realize I am the second reviewer to make this point ( I stupidly ignored the first reviewer who made the same criticism ) , but really , you should read this book the old-fashioned way .	-1
Was looking more for self help book , was n't interested in how this book was for our reading . But for another , the book may be helpful	-1
A beautiful description of two lost souls finding each other . The author wisely leaves the ` forever after ` to the reader ` s imagination .	-1
Kozol ought to take a trip in a time machine so he can visit the one-room schoolhouses in 19th-Century Middle America , or the overcrowded , impoverished Lower East Side of Manhattan , where Jewish immigrants lived and died in deplorable conditions beyond anything Kozol encountered on his many visits to contemporary schools.Back then there were no affirmative action programs , no bilingual language classes and only the most rudimentary teaching materials . Yet droves of students who came from those environments prospered and succeeded in all walks of life.Both they and their parents knew that the only way to climb out of their misery was through education . So they studied 12 or 16 hours a day . They had an innate impetus to rise above their origins.So why ca n't black students in `` segregated '' schools duplicate those achievements ? Is it because they spend too much time fretting about `` white injustice , '' slavery or discrimination , or listening to too much rap music that 's loaded with blame , self-pity and anger ? How about poor study habits , lack of parental discipline or self-discipline , or more important - self-victimization ? I 'm convinced that black anti-Semitism is based on jealousy and envy . Blacks in this country far outnumber Jews . Yet there are far more Jewish doctors , lawyers , businessmen and other professionals.The yearning to be educated comes from within . It does n't really matter whether the school is segregated or integrated . Kozol 's problem is that he 's focusing on the superficial trappings of education when in reality it 's what 's inside the individual that counts .	-1
The reason I 'm giving this book only two stars is because I did not really enjoy it . That does n't mean it is n't brilliant and intellectual and full of esoteric ideas and philosophical quotes . I just found it an ordeal to get through and ponderous as best . I pushed myself to stick with it , especially the first third of the book to get a handle on the three intertwining stories but even that was difficult because each of the stories was not that interesting . The language the author uses is so over-the-top and I felt he tried too hard to be witty , funny , stylistic ... whatever . Yes , there is a lot of info about the lead up to WWI and something things were interesting like Diego Rivera 's mural in Detroit .. but honestly , the photo of the 3 farmers so fascinating to two other men looking to find its meaning was a big stretch that did n't pay off in the end , at least not for me . It was so tiresome to wade through the weirdness of this book to try and extract a storyline . I understand that people loved it and it 's won awards , etc . I 'm sure I 'm not smart enough to get it , but it also did n't hook me enough to make me want to get it . I believe that storytelling should be something that engages the reader and takes them to places they 've never been before . This book went to some very bizarre places and I found myself kicking and screaming the entire way . It was n't for me , but obviously , from other reviews , it has an audience .	-1
I picked up `` Reasons to Live '' based on Chuck Palahniuk 's sterling recommendation in his book `` Stranger than Fiction . '' Hempel 's collection contains 15 short stories -- very short as the pieces average about 8 pages each.Her writing is very clever ( as promised ) , but left me uninterested . The tiny length of each story made the characters and their situations too opaque to care about . Hempel can certainly write a great sentence , but not a great story.One footnote : `` Celia is Back '' clearly mirrors a story Palahniuk tells about his own father . I must admit to wondering if some of the high praise came from personal association more than objective evaluation .	-1
I tried to read this book on three seperate occasion , several months apart . I have finally given up . I made it to page eighty or so this time and threw the book across the room in agitaion after nearly an entire page of rambling about the way the main character seperated her trash . Nothing engaged me in the story and I did not like any of the characters . My apologies to the author for the harshness of this review , but I ca n't change the way I feel .	-1
I did not enjoy this book . I judge a book , partially , by the distractions of the author 's writing style and errors . This book is one distraction after another . I had great difficulty keeping track of the story line . The characters were not admirable or intriguing .	-1
This was selected for our book club . While the writing style is very descriptive/flowery , I would not have finished this book if selected on my own . Left an unfinished feeling about the main characters that may have been the authors intent due to the `` unfinished '' nature of the twins life .	-1
I started this novel after reading Erdrich 's Love Medicine . While it is clearly not as lyrically written , it is more accessible , and I admired Erdrich 's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters . I never finished `` Beet Queen '' , quitting not that far from the end . When Celestine 's child turned out to be so impossible , it was the last straw . `` Beet Queen '' is just too determinedly bleak , to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here .	-1
I do n't care how respected this professor Krauss is or how many awards he has won , the physics information he presents in & quot ; Beyond Star Trek & quot ; is already out of date . In the past year , a mathematician named Oyiba has come up with equations for a Grand Unified Field Theory -- with math that has been approved by Harvard and MIT professors -- which would make most of the observations about the possibility for warp drive , telekenesis , ESP etc which Krauss makes obsolete . Although Krauss ' observations about the ships in & quot ; Independence Day & quot ; are accurate , as are most of his long explanations about gravity and the electromagnetic field that can incidentally be found in any good high school or college textbook , or his projections for the energy and cost it would take for a ship to go to Mars , his most essential claims are the ones which are already being found obsolete . Basically , Krauss claims that the energy required to travel faster than light , move matter by telekenesis etc . would have to be equivalent to some tens of thousands of suns -- which would be true were it not for this new Unified Field Theory which would make such things possible with *very little* conventional energy at all . He also smugly asks such silly questions as why a UFO would want to make sharp 90 degree right turns ( answer : why do n't you ask them ? ) . In an era when books like & quot ; The Day After Roswell & quot ; , written by the late ( and highly decorated ) Pentagon officialCol.Philip Corso -- with an introduction by Strom Thurmond , no less ! -- come out stating flat-out that most of our recent technology was indeed back-engineered from UFOs , you got ta wonder that *something* fishy is going on , and now that scientists and mathematicians like Oyiba are presenting us with information which would confirm our real X-Files , I think that one should read a book like & quot ; Beyond Star Trek & quot ; with as skeptical an eye as its author . In case you doubt me , I suggest you look up Oyiba 's work ( which is out there and for which he should be winning a Nobel prize or something ) .	-1
I could not really get into this book . I read a lot but it just was so laborious to read that I could n't get past the first chapter .	-1
I did n't care for this book overall . I found it to say many of the same things over and over , but in different ways , almost as if they were trying to simply fill-up the pages . Ditto for their use of examples of scenarios about some couples . I had to wonder if those stories were n't made up . One or two examples would 've been fine , but I really got tired of the & quot ; stories & quot ; about certain couples .	-1
I saw the advertisements for the play Wicked and was intrigued by the poster and the premise . So I took the opportunity to take a peek into our favorite Witch.Plot : Elphaba is born to a minister and an adulterous mother . Being green and intelligent excludes her from having a very normal life . She goes to Shiz University where she meets up with Galinda/Glinda and begins to fight against the dictatorial Wizard of Oz . Unfortunately , she is unable to perform her task and goes underground after her lover is executed . Events proceed until the movie `` The Wizard of Oz '' ( WoO ) takes over in the last fifth of the book.Good : Gregory Maguire is capable of writing in a manner that keeps you hanging on and wondering what is just behind the next page , even when he is in one of his political or religious rants . There were many times where I wanted to put this down , but something that Maguire would say would keep egging me on.The sections I most enjoyed were the first and second with parts of the fourth and fifth . The first section was an interesting way to begin , but as the story progresses , not much that takes place during this time that seems meaningful . The second section about Elphaba at Shiz University was especially good -- probably what I and others had hoped to see from this book . The pacing is good , the characters are pretty solid ( Galinda is well-written as a society girl , Elphaba as a social outcast and yet a dissenter , Boq as a typical college boy and so on ) , the events are quite exciting -- typical college life , Animal rights being revoked , a murder , and so forth . Although most of the events are never really resolved in this section , Maguire writes this section well enough that a person , such as myself , really wants to know what happens next . At the end of Section 4 , Elphaba reunites with her father and her sister , Nessarose , and reminded me why I was reading this book -- to learn about the history behind the Wicked Witch of the West . Section 5 continued this evolution.Further , Maguire has built this Oz very carefully , filling in intriguing details and describing scenes and incidents very well . His elaborate map is only one instance of this ; he also painstakingly describes Shiz , Emerald City , the trip to Vinkus , and other surroundings so that you are there where the action ( however small it may be ) is.Bad : As I continued to flip pages ( and there are a lot , mind you ) , I kept thinking and thinking and thinking ... what , in one short sentence , is wrong with this book ? Was is the characters , the plot , Maguire 's writing , the events ? When I got halfway through the book , I realized what the problem was : this is not Oz from the classic 1939 movie . This is Earth in some other reality . Countries experience extreme drought . Oz has destitute people . The political climate could have been America during an election . The racial segregation and civil rights movements are plum out of the 60 's . The dictator Wizard could have been Hitler , Saddam Hussein , or practically any other leader from history . College life is just like Earth -- sororities , fraternities , boys sneaking to girls , libraries , lectures , drinking . Homer went to Oz and wrote the `` Oziad '' instead of the `` Illiad '' . People are just like those on Earth , just from differently named cities/towns . Even the religions are practically the same ! Unionism is probably Christianity , replete with the zealots . Worship of the Kumbric witch may represent Wiccan . Heck , even this Oz has a Christmas -- disguised , not so cleverly , as Lurlinemas . Both are equally as commercialized . These uncanny similarities might not be so much of a problem , but I think most people wanted to read about Oz , not Earth disguised as Oz . I mean , that 's kind of what I had in mind when walking into this . If I wanted to read about despotism , about vying religions , about college life , a commentary against commercialism in holidays , I would have chosen a different novel than this.Further , this book is touted as analyzing what is wicked and what is not . Really ? I did n't notice . I mean , the characters did occasionally bring up the subject -- between pages upon endless pages about religions that are never fully explored , political viewpoints , Animal rights , and lots and lots of twisted sex between half-hearted characters . Where is the great debate about what is good and bad ? Where do we see that the line is blurred ? It appears for about two pages at the end , cloaked as it was behind all the fluff.And was there fluff ! Pages upon endless pages are spent talking about religions that have names and little else , politics that never do anything , and yards of unnecessary sexual situations . Many questions arise during this course but are never answered . What exactly do Unionism , Lurlinism , pleasure faith and others entail ? Where did they come from ? What function does the Time Dragon serve and why is it so respected ? Who is the Kumbric Witch and why is she respected ? What else does the Wizard do that is so bad ? Where did the terrorist come from and what happened to them afterwards ? Why do Fiyero and Elphaba fall in love ? What is the purpose of the puppet scene ? What happened that was so terrible at the Philosophy Club ? How did it impact everyone ? Are all the sexual scenes really necessary to describe what is going on ( especially since they are thrown in helter-skelter and just drag the plot ) ? Further , the characters are no where near what I have come to know them as and show little signs of being the people from the movie . How does Glinda become the sweet , good Witch of the North from a society diphead ? How does the Wizard appear cruel and immoral and yet is so kind and stupid around Dorothy ? And I thought he said that the people of Oz instituted him as Wizard , not that he came blazing with all guns on his balloon loaded and took over Oz . The Tin Man is said to have suffered from domestic violence -- something that is revealed in the last 15 pages of the book . And Elphaba herself comes across as pathetic , powerless , and unable to care for herself . How does she become the manipulating , fear Wicked Witch of the West ? As if this were n't bad enough , characters on the whole appear and disappear as if cars on a highway . In the beginning , we have Melena , Elphaba 's mother . But after section 1 , she dies , never to be heard from again . Galinda/Glinda appears to narrate much of section 2 with Boq , a good character that abruptly drops of the face of Oz . Then , section 3 segues into the viewpoint of super-duper minor character mentioned twice in the previous section , Fiyero , who suddenly and without good reason has an affair with Elphaba . And then I realized that Elphaba 's point of view does n't even appear until Sections 4 & 5 and even then only sparsely ( between Nor and Oatsie ) ! I 'm like , huh ? Is n't she the Wicked Witch of the West that the story is supposed to be about ? Why do we not get to see in her head until over halfway through the book ? Was Maguire afraid of writing from her point of view ? If this book is about the Wicked Witch of the West , why are more points of view about people other than the Wicked Witch of the West ? Relationships between above characters suddenly end up in something that was never expected or alluded to . Where did Fiyero and Elphaba 's affair come from ? She barely knew him in college , meets up with him because he follows her ( why , I have no idea . Did he have a crush on her in college ? I , for one , would have liked to know ) , talk a few times , and then have sex that is rather graphic and detailed.Other plot points are brought up ( Madame Morrible 's offer , Dr. Dillamond 's death , the resistance movement , the scene at the Philosophy Club , etc . ) but suddenly disappear , never to be heard from again . With the way the parts are sectioned , I get the impression that Maguire actually wrote several short stories and blended it into one anthology . I just wish he would have worked some more on the short stories -- they are pretty bad . The sections hop around in time , skipping over some really interesting events alluded to and concentrating on events that are really non-events.Lastly , once Dorothy arrives , absolutely none of the events you see in the movie occur . Elphaba does n't confront Dorothy in Munchkinland , she does n't bewitch her on the Yellow Brick Road , no `` pansies '' cause Dorothy and friends to fall asleep , no message above the Emerald City , nada . It 's like Maguire decided to construct his own version of the `` Wizard of Oz '' .Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence : Wow . The f-word is used -- did n't know they had that one in Oz ! -- along with da** , he** , etc.The sexual situations in this book are most definitely adult . Kids definitely should not be reading this . Some of the sexual situations : Melena commits adultery . Elphaba sleeps with the married Fiyero . There encounters are described rather vividly . The Philosophy Club includes a scene between a Tiger and a man that is very disconcerting . Sarima 's sisters are always vying for a man 's ( sexual ) attention . And these are only a few.Violence is comparatively `` mild '' . Elphaba bites off the hand of a midwife after she is born . People are out to kill Frex and his wife after a show from the Time Dragon . Elphaba joins a resistance movement . Several people -- an Animal , a young boy , Fiyero , and an old , sick woman -- are killed.Overall : So many people have reviewed this book both positively and negatively . So what can I say about `` Wicked '' that will be new or at least a different angle ? Probably not much . I found the book a letdown . What I had hoped to find was more insight into the Wicked Witch , but really did n't get what I wanted . Instead , I got a heap of depression ( better 'd get my Valium ! ) , more politics than a November election , characters that slip in and out of the story and do things that are never really explained , plot points that are really intriguing but are never explained or discussed again , and some of the best sleep I have ever had . At the end , I ask myself , `` Is this the Wicked Witch of the West ? '' Because the movie portrays her completely differently.If you are wondering whether or not to buy this book and want my opinion , here it is : Do n't buy . Do n't borrow . Just take out a pen and paper ( or a computer ) and write your own story about the Wicked Witch of the West . I 'm sure you can come up with something just as good or better than Maguire.Brought to you by*C.S . Light*	-1
I recently was able to attend a showing of the musical Wicked . I loved the musical , simply loved it . The soundtrack is now on my iPod as my exercise music , and I do plan to go back and see the musical again before it closes . The plot is neat , the connections between this story and the original Wizard of Oz story are fun , the music is wonderful , etc . I was even more excited when I remembered that this musical was based upon a book.I usually recommend that a person reads the book before viewing the movie or musical , but in this case , I am glad I saw the musical first before I read the book . I thought that this experience would be similar to reading and viewing The Princess Bride : the book contains much more information than can possibly be contained in a movie and almost enhances the experience of watching the movie.Unfortunately , in this case , I was sadly disappointed by the book . The plot is similar to that of the musical ; it is different enough to be noticeable , but not irritatingly so . I read some reviews on Amazon where other readers complained of more subtle differences : in the musical , Nessa is in a wheelchair ; in the book , she has no arms . Those mildly irritating differences I can easily explain away by the simple fact that anyone who can act and sing can do so from a wheelchair , whereas it would be slightly more difficult to simulate an armless person.The small differences did n't bother me nearly as much as the plethora of objectionable content and inuendo throughout this book . Unlike a movie or TV show , where you can change the channel or hit the `` next '' button to skip past objectionable scenes , it is difficult to discern where they start and stop in a book . And this was n't just one scene or two scenes - the book was filled with such scenes and references.My other difficulty with this book was the overall moral tone . In the musical , both Elphaba and G ( a ) linda are strong characters who make good choices and in the end choose to do the right thing even if it is n't the easy thing . In the book , however , the characters are all riddled with so many flaws and corruptions that I ca n't even root for the hero in the story . Elphaba and Glinda simply did not have the strong character in the novel that they displayed in the musical.If you are a friend of mine or a former student , please do not waste your time with this novel . It simply is not worth it . This is one of the few times when you will hear me say it , but do n't buy this book .	-1
This is the kind of book I am making myself read - and its not pulling me in . Its not a page turner.I had expected a book about the Wicked Witch to be deliciously evil - like `` The Devil Wears Prada '' or `` The Nannie Diaries '' . Both of those books were fast-paced and page turners , fun to read , and filled with fascinating insights of women we love to hate.This book is filled with strangeness . Its as if the author is creating his own world - like in `` Harry Potter '' or `` Lord of the Rings '' . The problem is that this world seems to have little in common with the world Frank Baum created in `` The Wizard of Oz . `` Sure , I know that Oz was supposed to be a strange and mystical place . I gave the author leeway to create a world for his characters . I 'm an avid science fiction and fantasy reader and expect that an author should do this in a gripping , draw you in and make you care about the characters and the story sort of way.I am on chapter four and do n't see myself finishing this book . Wish I could have liked it .	-1
I have been trying to finish this book but I just ca n't . Do n't like the setting , character development , descriptions , anything really . I knew it was n't the traditional story we know but it is just too dark and lackluster for me .	-1
I was the only one out of the five women in my book club to finish Wicked , and I advised them not to bother reading to the end . Gregory Maguire had such a clever idea to look at a beloved story from another angle - and he squandered it ! It felt like he was trying too hard to copy Tolkien in that you had to keep checking the map to look up countries and their inhabitants . He threw in weird sexually explicit references that didnt contribute at all to the story ( the one with the tiger was really weird and never explained ) .This book was a huge disappointment to a true Oz fan ( I have read many of the Oz books in the series ) .	-1
After reading all the great reviews about this book I was excited to read it . I love to read and have NEVER quit a book before I was finished . Let me tell you , with this one I was tempted.It just did not pull me in . I did n't feel the magic of the book at all . I did appreciate what the book was trying to do and at points I guess you could say it succeeded it but it was just SO slow . I felt like I was waiting for something to happen the entire time.I would n't reccomend this one . Sorry !	-1
I would not buy this book again . It over promised and under delivered . If you are looking for a clear direct and concise process ... keep looking .	-1
I 'm not going to go into a lengthy review as others have already done this . I 'm just adding my voice to the many that wish to dissuade you from wasting the time and money on this piece of junk . This writer has been really hyped by the bookstores as you see his Wicked and some other titles prominently displayed in bookstores . I 'd always come across his stuff , read the intro on the back and think `` Man , I think I 'd really enjoy this writer . '' I recently decided to read some of his work and I chose `` Lost '' as it was a ghost story and was around Halloween . I was really looking forward to reading this . Generally , I read a book in two days and I always finish them no matter how bad they are . I took me two weeks to read the first 100 pages , this book was very easy to put down and do other things like watch paint dry . I eventually said to myself , `` You finally found a book you could n't finish . `` There is something scary about this book though . It scares me that American writing has slumed to this garbage . This guy 's stuff is everywhere for people to buy , with it 's cool covers and stuff . I just worry that people are going to buy this crap and turn them off of reading	-1
This book is about the most dysfunctional family imaginable . I found it to be depressing and discouraging . If you are looking for a book with a satisfactory ending , this is not the one for you .	-1
Having enjoyed the author 's previous book , `` The Way Life Should Be '' , I thought I 'd read her previous novel . I see now that the author is very formulaic , same theme of starting over and pushing one 's comfort zone , similar types of characters . This time however , the plot of the book is much ado about nothing . I ca n't even see how the characters could be very absorbed in this mundane unfolding of family secrets . As a reader , I certainly was n't .	-1
They said `` very good condition '' . The book I received was NOT in very good condition at all - as they stated in its description . The spine was falling apart and I had to scotch tape it and the book 's cover the whole length as soon as I got it out of the envelope . The copy is so old that all the pages have turned an orange-ish yellow and because of this the ink on the pages has changed too and is so light you ca n't hardly read the type . VERY GOOD condition indeed . What a rip-off . I complained , of course . They tried to explain it away as it being `` Miscataloged '' . Well , what about the person actually getting the book off the shelf and putting it in the envelope to send to me ? Did this person not have eyes ? The buying public needs to know this stuff - that they do n't even look over the books that they sell , stick a Very Good condition label on everything and ship it out . If they 're going to do that sort of thing , then they have to expect poor ratings in the feedback . And speaking of that , I told them I would be leaving negative feedback . So when I got on the feedback page to do this , I typed in all the stuff you see here and submitted it . When it showed up , it was 5 stars with `` book in good condition as stated . Great seller '' and so forth . I tried 2 more times to upload this review/feedback and I got the same 5-star glowing review . So , the seller has gotten on there somehow and blocked me from posting the facts and will show the 5-star un-factual review each time . Actually , who knows how many negative feedbacks people have tried to post about this seller only to be converted to the 5-star great seller blurb each time ? `` Friendlybooksforyou '' - Devious and untrustworthy ... .BEWARE THIS SELLER .	-1
Let me start with this : I am not against sexist novels ( I 'm female ) , as long as it 's witty and written cleverly , I will read almost anything . This book is not really sexist , it is rather written too cheesy . The jokes are elementary school level , simple and not really funny . Not three stooges simple , which is funny , no , these are cheesy cheap romance novel level.The setting is dark and miserable , characters are uninteresting and again , cheesy . The more I read , the more angry I got , for reading such a waste of time . The author goes into the thousand details like 'she walked to the bathroom , opened the door , brushed her teeth , walked to the kitchen ' etc . etc.. So half of the book is bs details to fill the amount of words required to make it a book . It is horribly boring . Throw in a few side arrests which has nothing to do with the story , so that she can squeeze in some more words , and the reader is frustrated out of her mind.About the main story ; it is unbelievable and stupid . Her phone connection is cut by the murderer , so she can not call the police , then after 10 minutes struggle she succeeds to run to the kitchen and call the police . And dozens of more details like this where you want to grab your hair . I never read one , but I am sure even the cheesy romance novels are better written then this . I keep even the comics I buy , this is the first book ever I throw to the trash can . I am 47 and I have never threw a book in my life before.It is too cheesy for a mystery , too miserable for a romance novel , do n't waste your money on this .	-1
Glad it was free . Did n't get into it and struggled to finish it . It felt quite long and took forever to get going . Not enough character development and the writing needs to mature .	-1
The Eleventh Commandment belongs in Archer 's head , not on paperback . It 's poorly written with a washy protagonist , and an incredible villian . The plot is threadbare.For first time readers of Archer : Please do n't judge him on this appalling work , he is better than this .	-1
& quot ; A reader & quot ; on 5/26/98 has echoed my feelings on this book perfectly . I expected a suspenseful read with laced with vivid human drama ; I expected a & quot ; page-turner & quot ; . What I found was a true life event with far too much techno-talk and a story ( & quot ; the worst strom of the 20th century & quot ; ) that unfolded as fast as ketchup runs out the bottle .	-1
UGH ! ! Being an Archer fan , I expected so much more , but this one was plain awful . BEWARE , it may have been re-released in 2008 , but it is clearly an EIGHTIES ERA story . Pay phones and Rolodexes are a dead giveaway . The central figure , FBI agent Mark Andrews , is such a Barney Fife that he 'd have a hard time wearing the deputy 's uniform in Mayberry . Over and over again he ignores suspicious tails , marking it down to `` paranoia '' -- excuse me , but is n't that how FBI agents stay alive ? Story line is liberally biased and the end is a serious letdown . I hate it when the bad guys get away . Oh , and for those who care : Christ is a curse word at least a dozen times . Nice .	-1
This book had me right from the start . The story was interesting and I really enjoyed the whole family saga . Of course Jane and Nick were made for each other . Of course Jane and Nick were meant to be.And then boom the ending knocked me right off my seat and not in a good way . That 's all I 'm going to say . It 's up to you if you want to put yourself through the wringer this book turned out to be .	-1
Sometimes with a little more thought and editing an OK novel can turn into a better novel . I expected better . Leslie , the central character was not developed enough for you to appreciate the situations she encountered , especially dealing with Benjamin , the fine & sexy Construction worker . She meets him , briefly plays strong Sista , hard to get but looses it somewhere along the line when she becomes a tad to comfortable with his reasoning of why he lives his life the way he does.Then there 's Rachelle , who does the 180 % of Leslie and instead of opening herself up to men decides to finally leave all of that alone and to devote time to herself and God . In turn , she winds up meeting a very Special man without even trying . I personally was more attracted to Rachelle 's plight and bootstrapping rise to happiness.I only hope that the author has new insight into devolping her characters in her sophomore attempt . And that maybe she adds a little suspense or mystery to the already exhasted `` girl meets boy '' theme .	-1
Yawn , I ended up skimming it . Absolutely nothing new .	-1
This book was hard to read . Not because of length , but because it is unrealistic . This could in all honesty be related to the fact that I 'm not a cat lover .	-1
Even though I agree with a lot of Crichton 's political views ( and this book is highly political ) , the book 's world is a bit silly : All the `` pro '' global warming characters are steel jawed action heroes who kill without hesitation and can survive lightning strikes and multiple gunshots , and the `` anti '' global warming characters are simpering , lying , cheating wussies and scoundrels . Well , you do n't read a Crichton novel for character development and introspective dialog , and like other Crichton novels this one does have an interesting back story , good background research , and will make a profitable Hollywood action movie . The best part is the bibliography and the essays/talks in the appendix included the E-Book edition I read - if those are not included in the print editions look for Crichton on C-Span . He 's an interesting speaker , and not as politicized as this novel would have you believe .	-1
Michael Crichton novels are usually good for lots of action , entertaining techno-thrillers with a bit of substance , usually in the form of science . You can tell Crichton does research for each of his stories , enough to make them at least interesting , but not so much that it gets in the way of the story . Usually , that is.Unfortunately , the science impedes the story in 'State of Fear , ' so much so that reading it felt more like reading a term paper than a novel . The subject at hand in 'State of Fear ' is global warming ( or `` climate change '' if you prefer ) , and it is clearly a pet peeve of Crichton 's . I even agree with much of what he has to say . He spends much of the book trying to debunk popular thought about climate change , and he does a decent job of it , as far as that goes.But I did n't read the book for a treatise , I read it for some entertainment . I read it because it was labeled as `` ficton , '' but there simply was n't enough story here to hold my interest.If Michael Crichton wanted to write a book putting global warming to the test , then he 's more than welcome to do so . He 's written non-fiction before , and it was actually pretty good . But this was a novel , and as a novel , the characters were thin at best and the story was almost inconsequential . Crichton obviously put a lot into this one , but what he put into it was n't what makes good fiction.When I read a Michael Crichton novel , I expect a crackling good story above all else . If that 's one you 're looking for too , then you might as well skip this one . It 's just not worth it .	-1
Okay . I grew weary of all of the plot devices and the torturous machinations necessary to strand the people on the planet and to ensure that they could only escape via the Celestial Sky Scoop . Also , practically everyone seemed to be dumber than a box of rocks . I mean , at one point , one of the ship captains literally and seriously suggests that they could dangle a big rope from orbit to pick the people up . What the -- ? I know this preposterous notion was put in there so someone could smack their head and say , `` Hey , let 's use the remains of the space elevator ! '' but -- really , man . I just ... I dunno.Moreover , the author is still busily introducing new characters even in the last 50 pages , and almost any time someone new does show up , it 's so they can be made fun of , or so they can reflect on how worthless and weak everyone else is . Everybody on the ground seems to hate each other , and ditto for the groups in orbit . And most people divide their time between preening and posing , sniveling about how the rescue is a real burden on them because they have other places to be , or trying desperately to get some air time in front of the media . No firm POV character emerges , and of the handful of men and women that receive the most attention , none are very compelling or in any way admirable . It 's a secondary character who finally emerges from the fray as the closest thing to a hero , and in the epilogue , it 's revealed that he was pretty quick to take advantage of his new fame to land a high-paying gig and make some money , giving up the Academy and space exploration to become a desk jockey.Hey , I expect a little more of my SF . I want to read about at least a few heroic people , or at least flawed people who rise to the occasion . I 'd like to think that the folks of 2300 would be a little more excited about exploration and science and would be driven by something a little more noteworthy than the desire to be on a talk show or to get a pay raise . Out on the frontier , I want to see unique individuals who are there for fun and glory and for the thrill of it . I ... eh , the heck with it . This book is weak .	-1
I love Weis and Hickman ... ..at least I used to . The changing of historical dispositions for the races was the only inspired thing in this book . Its one of the few times I do n't want to read the sequels . I think its funny that the reviews are either great or abysmal and if you want to see for yourself , get it from the library ! ! !	-1
The characters were much too idealized for what at first seemed like it was going to be a classic Russian novel of romance in war . The `` perfect '' Alexander and the ever-naive , always giving Tatia became annoying though - particularly Tatia whose devotion to her sister and family eventually appears incredibly dysfunctional.Others have said it well : these two over shadow the rest of the story , including the historical content -- but take WAY too long to get together , while the reader suffers through a dance of emotional foreplay that becomes simply irritating . It 's Cinderella rescued by a prince all over again . Alexander may not be a prince but the author has made him as close to one as possible in the oppressive atmosphere of war . A prince with `` creme brulee eyes '' and a six pack , no less .	-1
This is definitely one of the very worst romance novels I 've ever read . It felt like a chore ... The only reason I was able to finish it was the fact that I had 12 total hours on a plane going to and from Europe.So the first 100 or so pages were spent , amazingly enough , describing Adriana & Colton 's meeting after 16 years of his absence . No action , just flowery , excessive , repetetive dialouge . 100 pages of tiny print . Let that sink in for a moment.When finally we got out of that hallway , I felt like I had acomplished some amazing task . I was hoping that NOW maybe the book would go somewhere ? Nope ! And it never really did ! First there was really no romance between our characters ... Even though the book summary promised that Colton would be our `` reluctant suitor '' he certainly was n't ! He began lusting over Adriana from the very first day , when he intruded in her bath and stands there staring at her for a good 10 minutes , then makes crude remarks to her when she wants him to leave . Oh , how romantic . Then we are reminded every other sentence of the fact that this happened , and just in case we forget , that Colton wants her hot bod.It was ridiculous how Adriana was so affected by Colton 's refusal to enter into a marraige contract with her when she was 6 . S I X. then about 50 or so pages are taken up with her lamenting and chiding Colton over his actions ... like her heart was broken.There was nothing likable really about either of our main characters . they were uninteresting to the extreme . Beauty was basically the only thing mentioned to redeem them ... I 'm sorry , but taking care of orphans and being a war hero are such cliched devices ... They get married about halfway into the book . From then on , we really dont ' see much of them . There , the story begins to drunkenly focus on some of our 'secondary ' characters , both unlikeable . Roger is so unrealistic , and it seems that his character actually changed since the begining of the book . Hmmm , as I recall , the very first sentence was of Adriana running playfully away from him and laughing , when later she claims she could never stand him ! and him being scared to enter due to the memory of Colton 's father ( who lived there ) even though later we learn it was he who murdered him in that house ! The whole plot device of the actress Pandora , Colton 's 5 second marriage to her , and the baby that she claimed was his but somehow miraculously was later proved to not be his , but a relative totally detracted from everything.Some ridiculous scenes I can remember from this book are : after Adriana is pretty much naked and was just almost-raped by Roger , Colton is left alone with her after he saves her , ogles her , and can only think of his lust for her . Wow.When Colton is shot and brought into a room , the butler Hodges starts talking to Adriana trying to make her feel better or something . It was a ridiculously long speech . I would love to type it up for you , but it 's like half a page long . See page 414 , about half way down ... If you were unfortunate enough to have bought this book ... well maybe you use it as a doorstop or cuprest or something.and yes , the author loves the word orbs . i also noticed she loves 'ensconced ' and 'chortle ' . and she seems to have a preoccupation with thin and slender fingers.I 'm sorry I wrote so much ... I 've never been so motivated to share with others the details of a book . consider it a warning !	-1
I 'm halfway through the book ( page 230 ) , and they still have n't gotten to the point of why Herculine was `` chosen '' or what special favor the incubus and succubus need to ask of her . There 's some interesting background on the Inquisition and the witch burnings , and then the author throws in some hermaphrodite sex ( ridiculous ) . I ca n't force myself to endure this book any longer .	-1
Although the mystery was interesting , I had a difficult time reading some of the outdated language . My initial impression was that it was to be similar to an Agatha Christie mystery , but there were so many lengthly descriptions of architecture , or streets , or interiors , that it was easy to become bored or even confused what these discourses had to do with the mystery . These lengthly descriptions did not advance the plot or illuminate the characters . In fact , as a & # 34 ; Lord Peter Wimsey mystery , & # 34 ; I was left wanting more information about him , but had to wait until practically the end of the novel to discover anything about the character . The difficult language made the mystery way too mysterious .	-1
Do n't waste your time on this one . Little mystery , much back and forth 'tween characters and not a whole lot else . I could n't finish this book . Try Shrouds of Holly , Deadwaiter , Christmas Is Murder ... to name a few . Least there 's substance and mystery in these .	-1
I am not sure quite how to review this book since I never actually finished it . It took me over a month to come within 150 pages of the end . I am not a slow reader and my interests are very broad . But I just could not bring myself to continue reading this book anymore . What is so frustrating is that I found the first book , Curse of the Mistwraith , so enjoyable ; in fact , I read it in two or three days . The concept of pure justice , as embodied in Lysaer , in contest with nearly pure compassion ( Arithon ) is an interesting plot.This series , The Wars of Light and Shadow , has garnered much praise for Janny Wurts both on this site and elsewhere . And while I agree with much of the praise for Curse of Mistwraith , the first installment , I must disagree for Ships of Merior . This book is very predictable . By itself that is n't necessarily a detriment . But it is also slow . It sort of wanders its way through the plot . Her phrasing is awkward at times . There does n't seem to be anything new in terms of character development . I was hoping to find out more about Dakar in this book . Maybe that was relagated to the last 150 pages I could n't make it through . His increasing bitterness and anger toward Arithon is , unless I missed something , inexplicable . And , predicatably , he keeps showing up at the wrong time and place to spoil Arithon 's plans . Maybe Dakar is Arithon 's albatross.Long books and series are the rage these days . Witness Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time series . Well written verse keeps the pages turning and the reader engrossed , no matter the length . But many authors just fill up space with words . Ships of Merior could have been reduced to about half its wordage and still conveyed the basic plot without sacrificing reader enjoyment.Despite this book I think Janny Wurts is a good author . In my opinion , her best work is the Rift War Saga parallel series written in collaboration with Raymond Feist .	-1
When I was a kid , I read this and loved it . That was a long time ago now . I think that the passage of a few decades and the more discerning pallet I have as a reader have combined to just destroy any kindness I have towards Lord Valentines Castle.First of all ... this is such a hippie story . Majipoor is this world with technology mostly existing in mid-evil levels . Yet it is filled with technology well beyond where we are today . The world itself is several times more vast than Earth . People can live here in normal gravity because it is a lot lighter than Earth . Many other alien races live here too . The entire world is ruled over by a single man . Lord Valentine.Valentine starts the book without knowing where he is . In one day he finds a young lad who becomes an apprentice . He finds a life calling 'juggler ' . and a soul mate in the form of a pretty follow juggler . They seem all ready to spend the next 200 years doing tricks when Valentine starts to remember that he is 'lord ' and something happened to him that was not right.This whole story was very booooring . Its heavy on humorless dry style . Its very serious . Valentine is a self important pap that deserves a good beating.Some books that are similar in style to this that I would recommend in its place would be 'the Kin of Ata are waiting for you ' and ... . hmmm	-1
In the latter part of the book , Marak wakens and has trouble remembering which passage through the desert he is on . That aptly sums up the plight of the reader . I forced myself to finish , because I kept thinking something would actually HAPPEN . The happenings in the book , however , given the context of endless desert travel , seemed contrived : dust storms ( of course - what else can happen in the desert ? ) ; childbirth ; Tain 's potshot ; running out of water/food ; desert predators ; they all seemed inserted just because something needed to happen . Compare , for example , to The Key to Rebecca , where the trek across the desert was brutal , but it was only a lead-in to the story , not the story itself . I also found the book depressing . The `` victory '' at the end was not an uplifting triumph , it was a non-event , framed by an apparent huge loss of life ( although we never find out how many perished ) . I did find the hermaphroditic tower of the cover art interesting , though .	-1
`` Titan 's '' initial concept is simple : Humans travel to Titan , seeking what they think may be some form of life.The book itself is much less coherent than that . Involving a poorly-conceived global crisis , based upon faulty understandings of American , Chinese , and global politics , the Christian movement in the United States government , and the book suffers horribly for it.Flat characters , a plot that develops much , much too slowly , and an over-large cast drag the book down throughout . Of particular annoyance to me was that Baxter includes an entire story-arc that adds absolutely nothing.The arcs are as follows : i . The mission to Titanii . An arc involving the Chinese astronaut Jiang Lingiii . An arc involving several supporting characters that bears little coherence , and adds absolutely nothing to the novel . `` Titan '' , weighing in at just short of 700 pages , could have easily been pared down to 500 , to give a better-tuned tale.Please do n't mistake me : I have no problem with long novels ; I 'm a big fan of Stephen Donaldson , and he is notorious for length , but this novel did n't need it . `` Titan '' , as a novel , may be a train-wreck , but as a piece of hard science fiction , it is spectacular unto the end . Of particular note , I found the `` think-big '' ending very interesting , philosophically and scientifically.I 've read Mr. Baxter before , and enjoyed him . Particularly , `` Manifold Origin '' and `` Ring '' , but I find myself reluctant to recommend this book to even the hard science fiction fans.Unfortunately , Ben Bova wrote this book , better . It 's called `` Titan ( The Grand Tour ) . ''	-1
Okay , at the risk of being lynched by an angry mob of LJS devotees , I just have to say that I did n't really care for this book . The first three were really good and although the ending of the third was sad , it was a perfect ending . It seemed in this book that LJS was trying to come up with a quick ending that everyone would be happy with because no one really wants the main character to die . I was pleased with the ending of the third book and I think that LJS should have left Elena in the next world where she belonged .	-1
I have read and loved most of Catherine Anderson 's books so when I saw this one I did n't bother reading the reviews or what the story was about I just bought it . I wish I 'd checked into it though because this was a strange and disturbing book . I do n't know how she thought a story about a woman who accidentally kills her abusive husband , hides his body in her rose garden and later falls in love with the bachelor next door would make a good love story . I especially found it creepy that after she marries the new guy ( he does find out about the dead husband and even helps her rebury the body deeper ) they choose to live in her house instead of his so they can stay close to where the body is buried . I did n't like the characters at all but kept reading because I was sure that the story would get better - it did n't . It was just too strange and disturbing to be at all romantic . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .	-1
This was a very tedious read . With all the intrigue in the beginning with the hero 's father and with the intrigue between the heroine and her brother , I expected a better book . But it all fell flat , instead it as a very slow and tedious read with a cowardly , self-pitying heroine and a hero who really did not do much to champion the heroine , because when her brother and he enemies went to plague her , they got their way and succeeded in tormenting her . The heroine was a shrew , stubborn and did nor actually do anything to help resolve her circumstances . The ending left much to be desired because it was abrupt and unsatisfying . I would not really recommend this book . It was a boring un fulfilling read ! ! !	-1
I mean we are n't reading fantastic literature here but it was like she thought `` Oh , 100 pages , I can only have 101 , I better shove 3 years into 2 pages '' It was really wierd .	-1
Two stars may be unfair , as I did not finish the book . But two stars may be more than fair because I COULD N'T finish the book . I 'm a fan of Orson Scott Card and Ender 's Game remains one of my all-time favorites . But this one never took off . Quite frankly I just got bored . I understand writing about the common man , but these people were just too common , dull , vanilla , Mormon , whatever . I 'll read scenes about mundane activity all day long if the writer gives me something to latch onto , but there was nothing here . I gave it about 80 pages , which is more than I normally give a boring read . It may have turned out to be a fine story ( Mr. Card is an old pro ) but I have too many books beckoning from my shelves . Best of luck with this one , I hope you all fare better .	-1
** This review , as well as many more , can also be found on my blog , The Baking Bookworm ( www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca ) .My Review : I downloaded this digital audiobook onto my iPhone based solely on the simple fact that I needed a light mystery to listen to as I drove back and forth to work and as I cleaned my house . I love 'reading ' hands/eyes free because it totally ups the multi-tasking that I do so love.This definitely was a light mystery - too light actually . Initially I liked Callahan and the secondary characters but I did n't feel like the author took them far enough . They felt muted in their humour , were n't interesting enough nor did they really add to the story . It reminded me initially of a very mild and meek Stephanie Plum but without the laugh out loud humour and strong cast of secondary characters that help to not only move the plot along but add a great dimension too . Callahan has the potential to be a good , solid main character but so far she comes off as bland.The mystery itself was just okay . I realize this is a 'light mystery ' but it still has to keep me guessing and unfortunately after about half way through the book the pace really lagged . There were a few red herrings thrown in to attempt to keep the readers ' attention away from the real culprit . But , at the same time , so much attention was given to two specific characters that I knew right away that they could n't possibly be the culprit because it would be too obvious.Lastly , I 'm not certain that people who live in Georgia or Mormons will enjoy this read because it felt like the author took many stereotypes of the South and the Mormon religion . These clich & eacute ; s included including the use of the 'N word ' ( which I abhor ) several times and portraying Mormonism in an unflattering light.Overall , I was n't impressed with this book . I initially chose it for a light read but also based on the fact that I recognized the author 's name ( Mary Kay Andrews also writes under the pseudo-name Kathy Hogan Trocheck ) . Unfortunately choosing fairly blindly does n't always work out for the best.My Rating : 2/5 stars	-1
As I said to my father when we were discussing the Starbuck series , & quot ; Ah well , at least we can rely on Bernard to give us a good battle & quot ; .The Starbuck books are good , and had anyone else 's name appeared on the cover they might even qualify for an excellent rating . But they 're not worthy of Bernard Cornwell . The problem really is Nate , the lead character . Or maybe it 's with me and my dear old dad : neither of us can get a handle on him . Nate Starbuck 's a ditherer who is also a fine leader . He 's certainly confused morally . His position as a Northerner in the Southern armies was n't all that unique as to raise as much rancour as it does ... Not the best book Cornwell 's written , by a long chalk . There are only two bright spots : the battle scenes , which are vintage Cornwell ; and I love the appearance of Sharpe 's son . I 'd love to know a lot more about his adventures ! No - give the American Civil War / Starbuck series the elbow , and write to Bernard Cornwell asking for more Sharpe.Or pretend to yourself that someone else wrote the book ... You 'll enjoy it a lot more .	-1
I 'm a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he 's created and the incredibly intelligent books . While I greatly enjoy the book itself , I was highly disappointed with the ebook because it is missing numerous pages in the version for the iphone . Unfortunately I passed the deadline for a return . Missing one or two pages is not appropriate but not a big deal . There were at least 4 places that were missing 4-6 pages in the iphone version .	-1
Same type of book she regularly authors . Not particularly engaging . I 've probably read my last book by her for a long time .	-1
Though I think OSC is a good writer , I was surprised at this book . For a good Christian and family man , this book was very sensual and disturbing . There was graphic sex and other things a good writer should not be writing about .	-1
This book was written by the Orson Scott Card who wrote Saints , not the one who wrote the Ender Wiggins series or the one who introduced us to the Maker . If you love the ruthless logic of Bean ( in Card 's latest winner , Ender 's Shadow ) , or the wit of Lovelock , or the compelling alternate universe inhabited by Alvin , you will surely be disappointed with Homebody.Homebody was written by an author well outside his lyrical or logical core . The characters are well-considered and true to their natures , but none of them are people you 'd want to have a conversation with , much less live with for the length of a book . The characters are deliciously flawed , but Card seems unable to find the hook needed to make us care.Card 's obsession with loss and the grieving process led to a couple of extraordinary works ( like Xenocide ) and a couple of literary duds ( like Lost Boys ) . This definitely falls into the latter category . In the process , he 's trying to write into genres where his style and abilities are ill matched . He 's successfully equaled or exceeded the masters like Clark and Heinlein in future-fiction that captures the imagination . He 's done a good turn matching Lewis and Zelazny by creating Alvin 's magical reality . But , when it comes to a good ghost story or a contemporary supernatural tale , Card should leave it to King or Koontz.If you want a ghost , pass on Card ; if you want Card , one of the country 's best living authors , try a different title .	-1
The main thing I want to post about this book , is the fact that the heroine is feeding a stray cat Snickers bars and Coke . Chocolate is toxic to dogs and to cats and authors should not print this type of potentially harmful information just to be 'cute . ' I have written Lisa to get her comments , but she has yet to respond . Anyone else out there who loves animals and dislikes irresponsible authors ? Overall , my opinion of the book was fair . I found it silly and not really suspenseful .	-1
Leaving aside the stock characters and the childishly simplistic politics , since these are pretty much standard for the genre , the big problem here is that there is no compelling forward movement to this story : It 's a series of set pieces , starting with irrelevant activity aboard an aircraft carrier ( irrelevant because the carrier soon vanishes ) and including episodes in an Iranian navy yard and the Bosporus straits that could easily have come from entirely different books . The main character jets around the world a lot in an effort to make this all cohere ; the narrative logic , though , is less that of a thriller than of a detective story , yet without the thing that gives a detective story its urgency : the need to prove a case . ( As this book takes pains to make clear , the US military can inflict & quot ; justice & quot ; upon whomever it wants without proving anything , and even without having identified the right culprit ; so why spend hundreds of pages detailing its evidence-gathering efforts ? ) The one and only potentially interesting female character appears for a grand total of about 5 pages , and while , again , I expect novels like this to be male-dominated , the author loses a chance here to add an element that would interest even ( or especially ) his mostly male readership .	-1
Several reviewers have pointed out the chief positive feature of this book : it may make you disrespect Mr. Darden less.I had hoped to get more insight into the famous glove incident . The account herein may be exactly what Darden 's reasoning was . If so , more 's the pity ! Darden did not want to let the Dream Team run a scam so he ran it for them ? Good thinking ! Dershowitz 's account of the glove incident , baffling though I find that account , is superior : F. Lee Bailey impugned Darden 's manhood and Darden , like a rube , fell for it.Of course , the glove demonstration did not much impress anyone ( including the jurors , I suspect ) beyond showing that the Amateur Hour had returned to television.Darden 's rank speculations about Simpson 's motives are no compelling in this book than they were in the trial.In sum , read this book if you would understand just how incredible the prosecutors were .	-1
The only people who might gain from reading this book are those interested in the publishing industry and analysis of the minimal requirements for publishing thrillers . `` Mistaken Identity '' will show that those elements do not include the following:1 . Correct English grammar2 . Correct usage3 . Interesting characters4 . Believable situations5 . Believable behavior6 . Greater-than-one-dimensional characterization7 . A grasp of non-standard or non-prestige English8 . An ability to allow the reader to trust the author 's depictions of professional behaviorThe only manifest requirements are ( a ) the ability to mix stereotypic characters in soap-operatic situations with ( b ) a `` mystery '' that simply operates by witholding explanation until the end of the book .	-1
How I wish the characterizations were better . Bennie is unbelievable as a lawyer taking one week to prepare a case for murder that happened one year ago . Her boy friend is unbelievably blah ... its unbelievable that Beanie cut her hair with a nail sissors and it looks cute ... Mary is unbelievably terrified by a murder that happened one year ago ... Its all unbelievable and Bennie seems foolish and inane to the nth degree ... and I never found out why the Judge was also a crook ... was he greatly enriched ? ? ? Lou Jacobs rings true as does Judy the associate from CA . How about Scotoline kills Bennie ( how about calling her Beanie ? ) and promotes Judy to top dog . Or just incapacitates Beanie , like put her in the hospital . yeah .	-1
Meticulously researched ! ! ! There is almost nothing in this book that appears to have had any research since I know that anything I would know about is wrong in this book . It amazes me that anyone can rate this book at more than 1 star : there is no detail on submarine operations ( could be in an office building for all the detail ) , the characters are flat , there is almost no suspense ( predictable : the Americans will be successful ) , and the Americans are portrayed as unprofessional , murderous thugs ( megalomaniacs risking WW III ) ; as bad as books have portrayed the Nazis and terrorists . Finally the Russian would have to have the collective IQ of Forest Gump not to be able to figure out that there was something strange about Americans on their tour ships , and not be able to provide an excellent case that the Americans were responsible for criminal activities.The hypothesis of the book , which is Americans to risk a nuclear attack submarine and WWIII to sink a few updated 1980 's design Russian submarines ( designed for export ) is preposterous:1 ) The Chinese could easily block the Taiwan Strait with either their air force or surface navy since it is off the coast of China.2 ) The Americans would not even consider bringing American carriers anywhere close to the Taiwan Strait in wartime since an American carrier has such stand-off range that one could stand safely hundreds of miles off the coast and still provide air cover over all of Taiwan.3 ) American surface antisubmarine forces could easily defend carriers in blue water , making any attempt to attack the much faster carriers suicidal , not to mention the 100 nuclear attack submarines that can provide additional screening.4 ) The antagonism the Americans would incite would almost eliminate any support by the Chinese and Russians in the UN and world affairs in general.5 ) The Chinese currently have 10 Kilo submarines , which has caused little uproar.6 ) Iran is supposed to have several Kilos , which would be of much more concern to the US due to the strategic nature of the shallow gulf.7 ) The Russians are much more of the threat with advanced submarines since they could use them to much more effectively to close off not only parts of the Pacific coast , but the European coast.8 ) If a single American submarine , Colombia , could so easily detect and kill the Kilos ( even under heavy escort ) , as this book portrays , how a few can be much of threat to the powerful US Navy.Then there so many blatant errors in the book it is almost phenomenal:1 ) The loss of a research ship in suspicious circumstances would have caused the Navy to do a thorough search , not just send a single ship , due to public outcry . Not to mention satellite surveillance.2 ) Why `` liquid crystal sails . '' Was he thinking carbon fiber ? 3 ) A conventional submarine would make a long distance cruise snorkeling . They can cruise much faster snorkeling ( over 10 knots ) than underwater ( 6 knots ) . Also they would still require significant time snorkeling for the long process of to recharge batteries.4 ) It the Kilos where being escorted , they would be close to the surface , not 200 feet underwater : they could be better defended , they are new which implies they will have teething problems , and they can travel faster.5 ) A 4 ' or 6 ' hole in a Kilo would not sink it immediately since it has many water-tight bulkheads that would remain closed except for movement while dived , especially at depth.6 ) US and Soviet nuclear submarines are constantly operating under the polar cap ( here they are safe from surface attack ) . What was wreaklessly dangerous was moving through the unmapped fiords with a such a massive ship ( 33 ft draft ( surfaced ) , and the displacement of a WWII light cruiser ) .7 ) It was criminal to risk an important mission by coming up in the ice of the Artic to report status , and more irresponsible for the captain to risk the boat when the ice became dangerous . A loss of a nuclear submarine would have been far worse than losing that chance to kill the Kilos , which could be killed later.8 ) There is an ELF system ( Seafarer ) used to communicate with submarines underwater . Thus an American submarine does not need to surface to receive transmissions , and in a covert mission would only surface if absolutely required.9 ) A submarine sticking anything out of the water close to naval ships would be giving itself immediately away anywhere close to enemy naval surface ships ( true since WWII ) . Interesting that at one point the Columbia is detected at periscope depth a distance from the Kilo escorts , but later is able to initiate an attack by periscope.10 ) It is unlikely the US would ever dedicate a nuclear submarine to black ops , especially since submarine crews consist of the cream of the US Navy . Also the US would keep attack submarines stationed off the Russian Pacific coast to keep watch on SSBN activity , so silly to use the Columbia when there are submarines in position.11 ) If the Russians were truly concerned about protecting against an American submarine , they would include at least a couple of attack submarines with the force , which are the best defense against American submarines.12 ) The US would never consider using use special forces ( SEALS included ) for an undercover mission ; they are trained for covert missions.13 ) Three men in superb condition on a tour boat full of American tourists would stick out , especially considering that most of the American tourists on these tours would be older . More sensible to send in ordinary looking couples.14 ) Any mission such as the one to get and hide the canisters in a short period of time would have been prepared for by simulating the mission . More likely , undercover agents would have been positioned in the area , and provided with significant amount of time to retrieve the items , and then be there to assist the team sent in to destroy the barges.15 ) The large barges would have sunk straight down into mud just below their hulls , not turn over , especially since these oversize barges would hit bottom before being close to capsizing ( no reason on dredging a canal deeper than it has to be ) . In addition , they would have little freeboard . Also , submarines are extremely tough to withstand tons of water pressure . Assuming they did roll off the barges ( unlikely ) , there would have been almost no damage to the hulls ; thus easy to repair . More likely the barges would suffer additional damage.16 ) There is no way four SEALs in the peak of condition could ever pass for cripples , let alone geriatrics since they would have way too much muscle mass ; Academy awards are given for good makeup that will pass for old on the screen , and this is with hours of work.17 ) It would have made a lot more sense ( and be safer ) to airdrop a SEAL team to set up hydrophones in the fiords , and to scout the island.18 ) Why would an Australian ever dream of flying in an American skipper he does not personally know to just transport a boat from South Africa to Australia ; Australia has long tradition of sailing.19 ) Why is it different sinking a surface ship . It is still cold blooded , premeditated murder . If nobody knows , what difference does it make ? If the US can destroy Kilos deep inside of Russia , and under close escort , why not also go after the active duty Kilo ; this would have been much easier . Further , why not destroy the whole Russian and Chinese fleets since the US seems to be able to destroy a few Kilos with Russia and China knowing the culprit and they are unable to do anything about it.20 ) The operation the US executed in Russia required involvement of an awful lot of people , to fill places on the tour ships , and to provide a route for the SEALs out of Russia . Any organization that figured it could succeed in such an operation operates with dangerous optimism.21 ) The Chinese would have been dumb to send a brand new submarine on a long mission since this is asking for a submarine disaster ( new boat , new crew ) .22 ) SAM missiles are Surface to Air missiles , not Surface to Surface . The Chinese boats are not equipped with SAM 's , and their power would be limited since they are only intended to shot down fragile aircraft.23 ) How come all the American researchers survived the attack on the Chinese base , but apparently none of the Chinese did ? ? There are also a multitude of other issues with the book . So much for expecting a well researched book from a British Isles author . Maybe he publishes in the US about the US because he could not sell this crude to British publishers .	-1
If you can buy it at the supermarket , chances are you 're going to get a pretty standard plot line filled with cliches . Gaffney delivers all that and little else in this very familiar book ( been there done that ) . Yes , breast cancer is a terrible , terrible disease . But its devastating effects have been written about so much better so many other places . You just KNEW that in a group of women , one of them is bound to have breast cancer and deal with it nobly and with grace and without the upclose and horrific aspects of chemotherapy ( other than a single night of nausea and some hair loss ) . I did n't feel anything when this character appeared other than fully manipulated by the author.You also could just guess from the opening pages the defining aspects of each of these characters ' lives from issues about children to emotional abuse and failing marriages . There was absolutely nothing new here . In addition , I found little difference between each of the characters ' supposed chapters other than the chapter headings.If you liked Beaches and/or if you are a fan of this author , you may fully enjoy this book . But if you 're looking for a good read about strong women , you wo n't find it here .	-1
Just finished this book ... and boy , was I disappointed ... I was bored with the storyline after a few pages but kept plogging along , thinking it will get better shortly ... Was I wrong ! I was a huge fan of Siddons but after this one , no more ... The characters are totally shallow & boring ... the ending is fuzzy and at that point , I really did n't care who lived or not ... .Save your money Siddons fans ... .You will regret buying this !	-1
This one was n't as funny as the others have been . This story was more somber , but still enjoyable to read . I have never gotten boarded reading these books I have really enjoyed them all so far . I 'm off to the next one ! : )	-1
This book is incredibly tedious and boring . Very little movement in the plot ... in fact on page 78 I still have n't found the plot . lots of descriptive narration , lots and lots . Wish I had read customer reviews before I bought it .	-1
This was the first book I 've read by this author and I had a difficult time finishing it . To be fair , in essence there was nothing wrong with the writing , but the storyline just did n't interest me . The love connection was unbelievable and Letty offering herself as `` payment '' for Murphy 's mercenary services was off-putting to me .	-1
It seems lately , that the new historical romances coming out , leave so much to be desired . This could have been a great romance story , but again , it missed the mark . Kidnapping and love and the same boring story line is all this book has to offer . Too much of the same old thing without interesting characters and no great love developing between the characters . Too many unimportant characters and not enough written about the main characters and their true feelings for each other . Just my opinion .	-1
Not one of her better books , I 'm afraid . I 'm a big fan of her earlier series , but this one does n't measure , I feel . To be fair , it may just be that it 's not part of that original series , which I really enjoyed .	-1
I remember the hype about this book back when it came out . All the celebrities were prattling on about it , how it changed their life , how it had so much meaning for them . Right there I knew I did n't ' want to read it , just like `` The Secret '' which came out several years later . Anytime billionaire Oprah tells you a book is `` life changing '' , you might want to hold onto your wallet - I 'm still trying to recover from `` The Road '' .Nevertheless , a friend gave me this book and I happened to fish it out of my to be read stack before going on vacation recently ( everything else in the stack was too heavy for pool-side reading ) . So I figured , how bad can 160 pages be ? Well , the book is easy reading at least , but the opportunity cost was the opportunity to read something else ( anything else ! ) which might have held some real meaning , unlike this pseudo-spiritual collection of clich & eacute ; s.As I said , the one blessing of the book is that it 's easy reading . I breezed through the book in a matter of a couple hours . There 's nothing to slow you down along the way - no plot , no character development , no poetic language to savor . Admittedly , there is a very mild St. Exupery flavor , but it 's so contrived and watered down that it 's like the difference between freshly squeezed orange juice vs. TANG . Of course , given the popularity of artificial flavoring , it 's not surprising how many people rave about this tasteless book.There is the same sense about this book that there is about some modern art . A sort of , `` you 're kidding me , right ? '' You find yourself wondering how someone got away with it , how they duped that many people and how they made that much money doing so . Is throwing a bucket of paint at a canvas really `` art '' ? Worth millions of dollars ? You have to wonder whether the perpetrators - the artists , authors , etc . - are really in earnest , or are they aware of the wool they 're pulling over our eyes ? Perhaps they actually are in earnest , but you may be left waiting for that small child to call out the obvious nakedness.This book ca n't really be taken seriously . It 's just a constant hammering of obvious clich & eacute ; d Messages dressed up as Wisdom . It 's always darkest before the dawn . Follow your dreams . Let your heart be your guide . It 's not what one puts into one 's mouth that defiles it , it 's what comes out of the mouth . Recognize any of those ? But no , I 'm sure Coelho came up with those all on his own.And , of course , the crowning Clich & eacute ; of the book is the biggest whopper of all : `` when you want something , all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it . '' Right , just the other day I was thinking how much I really wanted a Bentley and , funny thing , when I got home , there was one parked right there in my driveway . Since then I 've wanted a million dollars , a big mansion , lots of friends and worldwide fame and - poof - the universe has granted them.Okay , no , not really . But even if we set aside material and obviously shallow wants , it 's clear that the universe does not always - or even usually - grant us our dreams , even if we really , really badly want them and pursue them fearlessly . Millions have suffered and died , heartbroken and penniless , in pursuit of failed dreams . This sort of `` think it and achieve it '' mentality is not only foolish , but also rather dangerous . It places all of the blame for failure on the person who has already failed , thereby compounding their misery . It 's like faith `` healers '' who blame the parents of a dying child for not having enough faith , when in fact less faith might have led them to pursue medicine instead . It 's easy enough for already successful people to believe this sort of mentality has been the source of their success and riches , but for most of us , Lady Luck and circumstances do n't favor us the way she favors Santiago the shepherd boy or Oprah the miracle billionaire.Books like this one , `` The Secret '' and others are n't merely silly , there 's also an insipid element to drawing unsuspecting people into their `` think and be rich '' mentality . People end up spending money and effort on these doomed pursuits of treasures and happiness only to end up despondent and feeling betrayed ( while missing the real treasure and happiness of life , which is the work we put into it ) . Life is n't actually simple or easy , it 's complicated and difficult . `` Self-help '' does n't consist of getting people to ignore that reality , but rather to help them face it and live it on a daily basis .	-1
I ca n't add much to the other negative reviews other than to reiterate what a pitiable waste of trees and time this book is . I choked my way through it because I felt obligated to fully understand the depth of its failure . It is grandiose in its attempt to be profoundly simple , like a pompous man at a coffee shop who talks loudly about his own generosity.There 's nothing wrong with people who find inspiration here , but this book unequivocally shallow and twee . If you really love Thomas Kinkade , The Alchemist is the book for you .	-1
A badly written ( I had the displeasure of reading it in Portuguese ) cheap philosophy for those who like easy readable books for the beach . Coelho is the most overrated author since mankind has discovered the written word .	-1
I have never before written a review that is anything other than glowing , since I would much rather promote a book than tear one down . That said , this is probably the only book that has ever come highly recommended to me by which I have been painfully disappointed.I have no problem with simplicity : in fact , I think that is precisely what a lot of modern literature is missing . However , there is a distinct difference between simplicity and such directness as to insult your reader 's intelligence . To use such lofty-sounding phrases ( really just variations on overused sci-fi/fantasy terms like `` Destiny '' ) as `` Personal Legend , '' always capitalized , and always stated instead of demonstrated , is really nothing more than lazy writing . It 's a basic rule of fiction : show , do n't tell , but you 're always being told EXACTLY what you 're supposed to take from each episode . Yet , even in spite of the flowery language , one is left with only a very vague sense of the purpose of the story . The characters are soulless , aimless , and dull , and there is absolutely no sense of inertia in the book.In short , The Alchemist is probably the most overrated book to ever grace the Bestseller List .	-1
I was desperate to read something for a loooong train trip , so I borrowed this from my mother . Well , I had no other book on the train and nothing else to do so pretty much read the whole thing . I say pretty much because I stopped with about 30 pages to go . I got to the end and I just felt disgusted with the writer and with myself for reading this book .	-1
I ca n't believe I watched this movie ! After the horrors of Columbine and now Sandy Hook . We wonder where people get these ideas ! ! ! The parents of this child were they so oblivious to his problems ? ? The mother was n't but why on earth who she take no action . This was sickening This boy was so screwed up from birth . I ca n't believe that the parents did n't do anything to help this kind out he was so sick . It was not so fictional . Sick people get their ideas from videos and murder games . Appalling . The movie was well made but ... ... Sick and disturbing given the times we are living in now and what 's happpening .	-1
I read the great reviews of How to Seduce a Duke and decided to purchase this book . I wish I had n't . The heroine , Mary , is fickle , silly and worst of all bland . The male lead , Rogan , is completely forgettable . These two meet when Mary poses as a statue in a garden . When Rogan touches her to see if she is real she slaps him soundly across the face . This happens one other time too . I have never been overly fond of any heroine who hits people.There is a mystery surrounding Mary and her three sisters which was boring and really took away from the story . Supposedly , the three girls are of royal blood . They are being sponsored in London for their first season by guardians who at times are amusing but also very scheming.There is very little character development . Rogan and Mary go from hating each other to a sudden tryst in a carriage . Mary is petulant and stubborn and oblivious to her feelings for Rogan . She claims she is in love with Rogan 's brother but there were no sparks between them and very little dialogue to convince me that she had any true romantic feelings for Rogan 's brother or for Rogan for that matter . Rogan was supposed to be a rake but there was no evidence of this . Usually Avon publishes good novels . This unfortunately , is not one of them .	-1
I did n't like this book . I only read it half-way through so maybe I 'm not being fair . I did n't like the subject of the story nor did I care for some of the language in the book .	-1
Is Jaimie Lee Curtis published because she 's good or because she 's a celebrity ? Half her books would n't have made it past the slush pile . Ms. Curtis , try submitting an unsolicited manuscript with a pseudonym . Take a look at what happens . It will be good for you to feel like the rest of the struggling writers who do n't make it past the first reader because the author 's name is not recognizable . Up for the challenge ?	-1
Lady Charlotte Hughs has a scandalous secret . By day she 's an ordinary Lady of the ton but by night , she 's the infamous Lottie English . A celebrated opera singer loved by every hot-blooded male in London , especially one in particular . Colin Ramsey , Duke of Newark , has been in lust with Lottie since he first saw her on the stage three years ago . Now he finally decides to make his move . But its Charlotte ( Lottie ) who has the ace up her sleeve . She proposes that if Colin wants her , he has to wed her and fund a trip abroad to so she can sing with the masters in Italy . Will Colin agree to such a bargain ? Will Charlotte get out of it what she really wants ? And what of all the 'accidents ' happening in the theater ? Ashworth ( author ) just killed this one by expecting too much from a historical romance reader . I can accept one or maybe two unlikely events in a book but this one seems to be bogged down with many . First of all Charlotte is an Earl 's sister and he knows of her alter ego . True that he condemns her behavior but he does n't put a stop to it ? ? ! ? ? ! Second , Colin waits THREE years before he makes his first move to bed Lottie ? ? ! ! What ? -did he have to work up the courage ? Third , why would Colin even agree to marry her ? Why could n't he just blackmail her into an affair by threatening to reveal her identity ? And why would she be upset that he wanted to marry her for Lottie and not for the real Charlotte ? Hellllooo ! He did n't marry you for your brains honey ! And she 's actually shocked and saddened that he does n't want the world to know that his wife is an opera singer ? ! ? ! And the list goes on and on.It just does n't make any sense at all . I liked the overall premise but it just did n't work . If you really want to read it then save your money and get it from the library that 's were my copy 's going .	-1
First , as many have pointed out , there is no proposition , notorious or otherwise in this book.There is very little dialogue , plot or common sense either.The first half of the book is excruciating as we become all too aware of how acutely AWARE Ivy and Garrett are of each other . The author goes on ad nauseum describing their sense of each others presence and the physical and mental distress/arousal being near each other causes them . Amidst all this angst there is precious little actual conversation which brings to mind rather ridiculous scenarios of them mutely containing their feelings as they sit and stare at each other like a couple of owls in a tree.Eventually they have sex and you would think they would actually discuss this ridiculous and convoluted mystery they are involved in but of course they continue to defy logic and common sense and hold things back from each other.Frankly the mystery is the only reason I finished the book , having little respect for two such clueless and obtuse characters . However , the mystery is chock full of holes and loose ends and in the end makes hardly any sense at all.SPOILERS : Two points being , if Garrett is Lord Rye and requested Ivy investigate the house , why does he continuously ask himself why she is there ? ? Duh , because you ( under the guise of Lord Rye ) asked her . There is no indication at the beginning of the story that Ivy has any solid concern for her brother just a niggling doubt about his whereabouts then a little bit of concern as she senses his call for help in a dream , BUT then we find out that out of the blue she says she is being blackmailed to find the diamonds to save him . Really ? ? ? When did that happen ? And poor crazy Desdemona is so intent on finding said diamonds to restore the fortunes of her family yet never bothers to search Benedict 's pockets ? Even more strange she has the tiara the whole time and does n't even consider selling it to raise much needed funds for her family ? ? Nor is it ever explained why Hermione hates Lord Rye so much . What the heck did he do to her ? Or to any of her family for that matter ? The whole thing makes no sense and the characters actions make even less sense.Was there even an outline for this book or did the author make it up as she went along ? ?	-1
I was really disappointed by this book and had hoped for more . The character with the most depth was the dog . The main character 's motives were hard to predict or understand and she lacked depth ; I expected more from a character who is supposed to be a psychologist , especially since the author is one herself . The plot was mostly boring since it revolved around the inner world of the characters , but because the characters were simplistic , the plot felt flat . What a bummer !	-1
This book was too drawn out into wordy descriptions of things that went nowhere . The storyline was constantly being interrupted with useless segways of unneccesary babble . Felt like the author had ADD and couldnt keep focused on the plot/story . Im going back to reading James Patterson books . He gives the right amount of details yet keeps the drama constantly interesting and intriguing . Wish I hadnt wasted my time or money on this book ! ! !	-1
I purchased this book because it came recommended from Amazon . I found the idea of this kind of story to be interesting but the plot just fizzled . I did n't like the main character - which made it difficult to get through the book . At the end I was disappointed that I had spent the time reading it and also the money on this book .	-1
I listened to this in audio 3 times and each and every time I have no idea what I listened to . I 'm deleteing it . When a book is so boring and confusing that I do n't even realise that I have my headphones on , and I have n't consciously listened to anything ... it 's bad .	-1
I did not get very far into this trite book . From the first chapter I disliked it . We are taken to the scene of a possible attempt on the US President 's life but right at the fatal moment the chapter ends . Then we are thrown back in time by 1 month . This is just such an obvious and stupid way to create suspense . I think the author may have seen too many Hollywood action shows . Or maybe he is hoping for a TV contract .	-1
Did n't like it . Could n't finish . Hard to get into . Depressing account based on what I read . Would not readily recommend .	-1
I do n't know why , but I could not get into this book . Maybe I will give it another try someday .	-1
I spent a few weeks in New Orleans when in my early twenties . Had a great time . Reed brought back for me some of my memories of the that city and the South.Trademark humor ? But this seemed to me all too much a silly book about remodeling . I suppose most people are reluctant to describe their remodeling experiences . Poor Eddie , I wonder if he realized what having a writer like Reed as a client might lead to . Having survived a remodel , I can sympathize with what Reed went through but it seems to me she 's taken it beyond comical extreme . True , one can be stuck with a choice of contractor , true one can exaggerate for effect , true Reed has a flair for writing - but are n't there better books about Katrina , about remodeling experiences , about New Orleans ? It seems Reed has come closest to providing a feeling of the latter : I suppose I 'd need some good booze in hand to be able to decide . The impact of poverty and of crack makes its way through : that Reed did n't choose some enclave instead to live in says something for her and this book .	-1
I LOVE Carl Hiaasen 's work so , when Tim Dorsey was recommended to me as a Hiaasen-clone and I had already finished reading everything Hiaasen had ever written , I literally dropped everything I was doing and rushed to my local bookstore . There were about 6 or 7 Dorsey choices , I ended up with Florida RoadKill.Admittedly , Dorsey is trying to channel Hiaasen . He even mentions him outright , along with others ( James Hall , et al ) in Road Kill ... as either homage or possibly even a bibliographical footnote.The problem I have is , while Hiaasen 's villain 's bizarre deaths seem truly justified throughout his novels , Dorsey 's murders/deaths to villains and numerous bystanders , would be defined as absolutely , violently gratuitous . I am by no means a prude , but even I blanched at the shotgun blasts to the neck , the Barbie doll down the throat , the lethal alcohol suppository , or the `` Fix-a-Flat '' murder , etc . It gets old -- - reeeaaaallly fast.Also , even with Hiaasen 's over the top satire , he always stays within the realm of reality . Even if just barely . Dorsey instead will often boil over into outright silliness . Like when he 's describing the drug cartel 's last place in the drug cartel world . This particular drug cartel was voted : Most likely to be extradited . Now I 'm not saying this type of writing is n't humorous , it 's often downright funny . The problem is , with this type of blatant wink-wink to the reader , it completely shatters any sense of verisimilitude and belongs in a satirical newspaper article , not a novel.Dorsey 's attempt to paint a broad sense of Florida also gets rather tiring . In order to accomplish his descriptions , rather than weaving them seamlessly throughout his story , he portrays one of his `` heroes ? '' as a Florida history buff and another pair of his characters as a driver/navigator team , reading a book on Florida as they travel . This enables Dorsey to painfully describe Florida landmarks right out of the pages of a travel book , along with build dates and historical characters and events . After a while , it feels more like you 're being manipulated rather than told a story.As other reviewers have commented , there are a ridiculous number of characters , and Dorsey expects the reader to remember a minor player that he mentioned in chapter 3 , when he meets his demise in chapter 25 . I often found myself flipping back 200 pages just to re-read who did what or what had happened.Finally , and this is the main problem I have with the book , is lack of empathy . Any good novelist will create a lead character that his reader 's will empathize with , and care about what happens to . I appreciate the use of an anti-hero , meaning a protagonist who we all love , but has major character flaws . Perfect examples of good anti-heroes are the two in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . After all , they 're both criminals , felons even , but we loved them , because they were just two likeable characters that had obviously chosen the wrong career path in life.But Dorsey , for some bizarre reason , does n't really settle on a lead character for quite some time . Without trying to bore you , there 's Dave and Sean and Veale and Serge and Coleman and Saffron and Sharon and Susan and Dar-Dar and , literally another thirty or forty characters . I kept reading , playing along , waiting for Dorsey to show me which one I needed to empathize with.When I finally got to the end of the book , and realized that ( and I 'm still not sure about this ) SERGE was the main character ... I almost became physically ill . While , Dorsey may have envisioned Serge as his lovable , oft-misunderstood anti-hero , there could be nothing farther from the truth . Serge is actually a sadistic , narcissistic yet self-loathing , HIV-infected , hateful , despicable , mass-murderer . NOTE TO DORSEY - An anti-hero is allowed to have major character FLAWS but that is not the same as being a MASS MURDERER ! I realize that not every book should have a happy `` Hollywood '' ending , but this piece of scum gets to murder whomever and whenever he wants , and yet not have to face justice in the end . Dorsey theoretically might argue that he 's keeping Serge alive so that he could serve as the bad guy in his next book , a la Hannibal Lector , but remember , Hannibal was always seen as the arch-villain in Thomas Harris ' books , never as an anti-hero.Because of the aforementioned problems , reading Florida RoadKill might have you laughing at the sometimes-humorous prose , but you 'll probably ultimately wish that you had n't traveled down that road .	-1
Evil stalks the Aisling heirs ... and now Leona Chablis must battle the monster that has menaced her family for generations . Her sisters , Tempest and Claire , have already seen just how malevolent the curse against the Aisling family is . Owen Shaw appears to be a knight in shining armor , but can Leona truly trust her heart to him ? And just what is wrong with his sister , Janice ? FOR HER EYES ONLY ends the trilogy first begun in At THE EDGE and continued in A STRANGER 'S TOUCH . I thoroughly enjoyed AT THE EDGE and have only reluctantly finished the series due to my disappointment with A STRANGER 'S TOUCH . Sadly , FOR HER EYES ONLY continues the haphazard , almost chaotic pace of the second book.The subplot involving Janice should have been mesmerizing , especially against the backdrop of good versus evil . Instead , the arbitrariness of the villain detracts from the story as it 's as if he magically shifts from one person to another . It 's also not even remotely believable that someone with as strong of psychic powers as Leona could be deceived over and over again . Worse , the insanity of the villain descends into a sheer quagmire of confusion and the outright ridiculous.FOR HER EYES ONLY ends a series that debuted with such promise . Unfortunately , it did n't end the same way.COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES	-1
I always found James Patterson 's novels lacking in depth and dimensionality . He has , like a fish upstream , spawned careers by his many co-authors , and I suspected that their books , too , would lack that spark that ignites a really good read . Nevertheless , HarperCollins , apparently trying to figure out the e-book business ( shifting from trying to gouge Kindle readers to offering free samples from selected authors ) decided to `` sell '' Dark Tide for `` 0.00 '' ; intrigued by the synopsis , I bit . The book is OK , not great , and I suspect that I will not buy another by Andrew Gross.Why will I not buy another book by Andrew Gross ( even if `` priced '' at 0.00 ) ? Here 's why . Dark Tide 's plot is pedestrian -- an almost write-by-by-the-numbers exercise . How many books are out there where the protagonist has done something horribly negligent to destroy his or her family and is now looking for a `` new life . '' Add Dark Tide to the list . Even with that in the hero 's past , however , both he and the reflection/love-interest , whose husband has done something horrible to destroy his family , are one-dimensional.Why ? It seems to me that the really good books of this and related genres ( books by Nelson DeMille , William Lashner , `` David Stone , '' Alex Berenson , Josh Bazell , Brian Haig , Vince Flynn , David Chacko , Robert Reuland , Jeffrey Stephens , and the like ) have characters who have something to say that is both clever and deep and often witty . Sadly , Gross 's characters do not , and that 's the difference .	-1
Andrew Gross did SOMETHING with best-selling author , James Patterson , but having read all of the latter 's and this and one other of the former , I am wondering what it was.Those books with Patterson 's co-authors have been very disappointing.Even as Patterson was going farther and farther afield of his best-selling works he was beginning to - supposedly - 'mentor ' co-authors.None really works on the same level as Patterson 's earlier novels , which were so good they could be made into exceptionally good movies.Now , it seems that Patterson 's sole goal is to publish more and more fiction than Stephen King . Too bad , King at his VERY BEST , could not write a book that lived up to his fawning reviews.I will not repeat the specific problems others have described . I would just suggest you find a master of the craft . I would also suggest that Gross try Romance novels ; he seems to have that rare perspective for a male author : an average woman 's yo-yoing emotions.At this point , I can only recommend less prolific authors such as Michael Connelly , Robert Crais and , still , John Sandford .	-1
The writing in this book is just horrible . Two particular lines really stood out as illustrative of the low quality of the entire book . `` His bones became rigid . '' Really ? Try and imagine life *without* rigid bones . It would be somewhat difficult to walk around . `` His blood became ice . '' That must have been very painful and deadly ... It 's just sloppy , sloppy writing and editing . Any author worth his advance would n't write something like that , and any editor worth his salt would n't have let it pass his desk.As a Kindle freebie , it 's nearly worth what I paid for it .	-1
This book started off well -- poor seamstress inherits a huge fortune but must marry to keep it . Sexy , pretty nice Duke needs money badly & thinks she 's cute . Bits of the story are good -- the antagonism between the Duke & his neglectful mother , the Duke 's internal emotional instability until he meets the heroine , the heroine 's practicality & attraction to the Duke . Where it falls down is all the other parts -- a labored attempt to cause them to separate over a misunderstanding , rediculous relatives who try to get the girl to marry their son so they get to keep her inheritance , random appearances from some `` friend '' from another book I assume was written before this one , and the whole `` Oh , he does n't love me so I wo n't marry him '' routine . Get real ! I ca n't see any girl living in poverty who suddenly inherits a huge pot of money being willing to give it up because the dude she was going to marry did n't `` love '' her . Yeah , right . I 'd be willing to back to being a poor , dependent relative or a virtual slave in a dressmaker 's shop to being fabulously rich & married to a totally sexy hunk . Be willing to skim large parts of the book , and it 's not too bad . Read it for a totally encompassing experience & you will be throwing it at the wall .	-1
According to this book , George Tenet never did anything wrong.Two months before September 11 , 2001 George Tenet met with Condi Rice and many others on the National Security Council . His thesis : Osama bin Laden is looking to attack the United States . What did the White House do about it ? Nothing . George Tenet and the Intelligence community were sounding the alarm bells and nobody was listening . After all there was far more important things to do : attack NOW for boycotting companies that were anti-women , faith-based initiatives , mortgaging the country 's future so that everybody could get $ 300 back from their taxes and making secret deals with oil companies behind closed doors . So , George Bush 's White House did nothing and let bin Laden attack the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.Well , thanks Mr. Tenet we already knew that . What we really wanted to know was answers to certain questions . Did you say the intelligence to attack Iraq was a `` slam dunk '' ? What have you done about rendition and water-boarding ? Were you complicit in such acts ? How did you think there were 100 to 500 tons of chemical and biological agents in Iraq , when in reality there was none ? How did the 16 words get into the State of the Union ? To the first question apparently he said that . He also feels that it had no bearing on whether we went to war . While I do accept that , you were obviously wrong . From Bob Woodward 's book we see that the problem was that even the President of the United States thought the evidence was thin . So , instead of perhaps trying to verify the intelligence estimate , Mr. Tenet said : `` It 's a slam dunk ! `` The second and third question , he completely ignores . No talk of secret camp or sending people to get tortured by other governments . There is no discussion of the CIA 's stand on torture ! Not one word . While I may be able to accept that the CIA 's censorship department nixed anything about it when reviewing the book , such a complete omission is unforgivable . Such actions relate to how the CIA and George Tenet have helped the White House erode the Soft Power of the United States that George Bush ( 43 ) and Bill Clinton helped to build since the fall of the Berlin Wall.The fourth question : apparently its only an estimate based on the available data and everybody knew it was not enough to hold up in say a court of law . What ? George Tenet let the Secretary of State go to the United Nations ( an organization the Bush administration was trying to bully into action ) , and say that the best guesses of analysts who had never been to Iraq were facts ! They were not facts ! The fifth question has an easy answer . George Tenet did n't do his job and let subordinates do it . It 's that simple , the Director of Central Intelligence did not read the speech.Then we get into two other things that I did not have questions about until Mr. Tenet wrote this book . How did he meet with Richard Perle and discuss Iraq on September 12 when Mr. Perle was stuck in France until the 15th ( remember planes could n't fly ) ? It seems inconceivable that anybody would confuse the 12th of September with any other date . I good and well remember what I said to people on the 12th . I admit I may get the 13th and the 15th confuse . It just seems like he his deflecting what blame is his by trying to show that the neocons wanted to attack Iraq from the beginning . Well , if you did n't know that , you do n't pay enough attention anyways.And , did Mr. Tenet ever really do his job ? It seems every time there was something really important for the CIA to do , George Tenet put John McLaughlin in charge . At the principals meetings ( SecDef , Secretary of State , etc . ) , the deputy director , John McLaughlin , represented the CIA . At the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing to discuss the National Intelligence Estimate ( the slam dunk ) George Tenet did n't even go ! Who went ? That 's right , John McLaughlin.Basically the gist of the book is that George Tenet never did anything really wrong ! ( He admits that he did not do some things , but , has what he actually thinks are reasonable excuses ) . And when the stuff goes down - John McLaughlin was in charge . Therefore one is begged to ask the question . If you were so bad at this job , Mr. Tenet , why was n't John McLaughlin just made Director of Central Intelligence.The fact is , it seems that Mr. Tenet is a well qualified bureaucrat and diplomat that has no business being the man who must tell truth to power . From September 11th on he is a member of the circle as opposed to the fact-based critic of the circle that the CIA is supposed to be . Again and again he says its policy makers jobs to take the intelligence and make policy . But , it was your job to tell them when they were wrong . Mr. Tenet : you failed miserably . You failed to read the State of the Union address which made the President lie to the world , got a CIA agent outed and Scooter Libby sent to jail . None of this would have happened had you read the damn speech.As far as the quality of the book is ? It reads like a journalist 's book . Captain Harlow must be an excellent writer and I would like to read his novel `` Circle William . '' The pages flow well and the pre-9/11 life of Mr. Tenet is both informative and interesting , however , after reading the remainder - it might all be lies or excuses too .	-1
Is this a joke this is a terrible attempt at a novel not worth reading in the slightest sense of the word	-1
I read Heart Shaped Box first , and did n't love it , but I am such a fan of Locke & Key that I wanted to give Joe Hill another chance . I 'm sorry to say this book was only slightly better . The idea was there , and it was a great idea , a truly original story . However , it was so poorly executed . He may as well have titled this book `` Flashback '' because that 's what 70 % of the book was , unnecessary flashbacks . I understand a quick blurb about how someone got messed up , and quick moment to explain how you met someone . But the flashbacks were so often and so long , by the time we got back to the story I 'd have to flip back a few chapters to remember what was going on . It was too much , and not needed to propel the story . If you tell me a character was in love with his girlfriend , I believe you . There 's no need for chapter after chapter detailing their entire courtship to prove it . In the end , the storytelling was weak and took me too far out of the actual plot . Excellent idea , horribly laid out , and an ending so weak that it felt like his hand cramped up and he just wanted to quit typing , so he ended it . Usually when a book drags like this one did , I 'm relieved when it 's over , but this book , somehow , managed to make me long for an ending , but then disappoint me with it when it came .	-1
I really wanted to love this book and I did for the first half ! But then things got too weird , which would still work if the author tied everything together at the end . But he did n't ! If the end of a book is great it makes up for some short comings during the story . Just turned out to be dumb ! !	-1
The lead story ( Best New Horror ) was solid , but after that , yawners , making one wonder how they got by the junior editors except with Daddy 's help .	-1
I really enjoyed the beginning of this novel , the setting and the details of the role of women . Then , something happened . The heroine began to act like an idiot . She blames herself for not loving her husband -- but he never courted her , was off in Africa or Greece or in the midst of an intrigue . Then she falls in love with him after he dies -- neurotic . THEN she ignores the clues from one man and accepts the worst about a man she has no reason NOT to believe and trapses of to Africa with ( SPOILER ! ) the bad guy . WHY did n't she go to Greece as he husband suggested ? Never answered . She had little motive for much of what she did , just bounced around from place to place . I really wanted to love this series because I adore historical suspense , but I do n't want to spend more money to be so disappointed .	-1
A sadly undereducated woman I lived with for a short time ( thanks be ) urged me to read this ... .thing . I already knew Bach was a writer of garbage , so I protested that the book would probably be precisely the sort of sloppy , gushy junk that this very bad writer had been writing all his life . I ca n't give you a technically `` fair '' review , because it did n't take me very many pages to feel something akin to a diabetic coma coming on from this perfectly awful overdose of over-sweet goo ; his books are shameless slosh , and the cloying sweetness should attract only ignorant readers and flies . I felt disappointed that my companion understood so little about good writing , and about me.Sorry , folks , but I do not read very far into any book that continually insults the reader 's intelligence . Now there will be -- well , there already are -- many reviewers here who will blame the reviewer for the bad review , instead recognize that Bach is the literary equivalent of a ham . This is a book that entirely indulges the writer and insults the intelligence of the reader . Bach is a hack writer whose chief interest is strictly focused on himself , rather than on anything of value . The only love affair in this book is the one the author has with his own gormless babbling . This guy is the sort of boor you meet every so often -- a bumptious , ego-maniacal , sentimental boor without so much as a single idea worth putting on paper . He is just bilking the sentimental and the insipid with this and other stupendously bad books . He is the proof of H.L . Mencken 's comment , `` Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people . '' Or of any readers . anywhere.Anyone who has read any of his books and likes them , clearly has a deficiency of good taste , as well of any comprehension whatsoever of what makes good writing or good story-telling . So , please , do n't blame me for Bach 's embarrassingly goofy writing nor for your own lack of taste and judgement with respect to literature . Those who like him , and who are represented heavily in the majority vote here , write about him as if he had actually impressed anyone who is not grossly sentimental , and , in terms of literature , utterly ignorant . He is in a class with the schlocky Rod McKuen , grinding out unspeakable garbage for unspeakable Philistines . `` Bad taste is the only sin . '' ( Voltaire )	-1
I finished the book last night , and the story left me with one question , `` what was the point of the whole thing ? '' . It took 700+ pages to reveal the murderer who then is n't brought to justice . I realize that justice is n't always served in reality , but that 's the thing with fiction . It is n't reality . If I want a story where the murderer is n't necessarily caught , tried , or convicted , all I have to do is read the newspaper where the entire situation is explained in 700 words . I also did n't see the point of Daidre and her story , other than to fill up 100 pages that could have easily been edited out of the book.Of course , I still do n't understand the point of killing off Helen in the previous book in the series , but this entire book seemed pointless once I got to the last page.It seems pointless is the overall theme of this book , and if that continues to be the case with Elizabeth George 's books , I think it will be pointless for me to continue buying them . I would n't recommend this book to anyone other than die-hard fans , and even then , I 'd hesitate.Hopefully the next book will be better .	-1
Devlin does n't really delve into the mythology surrounding her series vampires . It 's unclear whether or not her story is set in an alternate real-world universe , or if vampires are considered science fiction . Rene is a human , but he knows that his police partner , Chessa , is a vampire - he says it very matter-of-factly , which lead me to think that vampires are just a given in the world Devlin has created.This is the first book in Devlin 's ` Dark Realm ' series ( currently with six books ) . I do n't really know how she managed to make a series of this book - because there is so little explanation about the universe she 's writing . I 'm not particularly interested in reading any more of Devlin 's books , because I was outraged by her writing ... I was honestly quite sickened by ` Into the Darkness ' . Natalie rapes Rene , and is utterly unremorseful , even unaware that what she 's done is wrong ( or maybe it 's Devlin who is unaware ? ) . Her vampire ` pheromones ' act as a sort of date-rape drug , and a covenant of older vampires kidnap Rene and chain him to a bed for Natalie 's feeding/sex pleasure . First , Natalie has sex with Rene while he 's still unconscious . Then when Rene does wake up he tells Natalie he does n't want to have sex with her - he points out that he is chained up and ca n't fight her off , he also mentions that her pheromones act as a sort of ` Viagra ' on him , so that while he appears willing , if he was able to resist he would not choose her . Natalie disregards his protests on several occasions . I was completely shocked and disgusted . Devlin writes these rape scenes with such disregard to the deeper implications - I think Devlin herself is of the same mind as Natalie , believing it 's not rape if the man 's body reacts willingly ; -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- '' Raped ? '' Soft laughter gusted against his lips . Her smile was easy , not the least ashamed . `` Maybe at the start , but you wanted it . You came for me . '' Her eyes narrowed , and she inserted a hand between their bodies , pushing it down between her legs . Moist , succulent sounds followed before she brought her fingers up to paint his lips . `` Wan na taste how hard you came ? '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- If those sex scenes had been turned around , and it was a woman chained to the bed while a male vampire rutted away I do n't think this book could have , in good conscience , been published . I kept waiting for Devlin to write a moment of clarity for Natalie - a piece of inner monologue in which she is completely disgusted and ashamed of herself . That moment only comes ( in a small dose ) because Natalie 's vanity is wounded by Rene 's admission that he would n't choose her and guilt-ridden by her actions .	-1
Sad to say this is not our usual Allende . The subject is fraught with violence and inhumanity . These are not admirable people . Their motives and actions reek of shallowness , self-serving , and ubridled egotism . Ines is a remarkable woman , but she canot be divorced from her time and place.Allende 's narrative skill and characterzation are not up to par.I will still look forward to her next book .	-1
Before assuming that this is a good book because it got so many five star reviews , please read the comments that I and the other one-star reviews have received . We are bullied and attacked because we request some justification for believing this author 's claims.I considered removing my review because I am not in the business of fighting with zealots , but allowed it to stand because such a review would have been helpful to me . Other reviewers may not want to deal with a bunch of name-calling because they expressed their opinions , hence the preponderance of five-star reviews.I honestly thought that this was just a terrible book . It resembles nothing quite so much as the long-winded ranting of a person with a mild case of paranoid schizophrenia . The author never provided any objective evidence supporting his claims . Period . Apparently , that does n't matter so much for some people . It matters to me . I very politely asked for some sort of evidence in support of the claims the author made , receiving a virtual assault and battery for my trouble . Please read the comments , and if you are disturbed by this sort of bullying and abuse on Amazon , please mark my review helpful.Here are a few of the responses I received : `` At this point , I believe you are simply a troll . This is a waste of time . Ive heard all this before and would prefer to help others in this regard -- I will NOT argue about scientific evidence . '' `` I do n't care if someone does n't believe , most do not . It 's when they ( disingenuously ) use the `` argument '' that demands physical proof ; then I know they 're basically trolls . Same as people who do n't believe in God without physical proof , then they say God could n't exist without such proof . '' `` Unfortunately for morons like audiophile , they think science always means something they can directly touch or see ( as if that would always even be proof in itself ) . '' `` It 's actually funny that we made a troll go away so fast . a testament to our skills . D. Keene and wanners defeat the troll . yeah ! `` According to those who attacked me in the comments section of my own review , I am a troll . They make incorrect assumptions about my character and view of science , then conclude that I can be dismissed on the basis of their own inventions.Ultimately , I found the behaviour of the commenters to be quite revealing , and supportive of my claim that this philosophy is complete bunk . Advocates of this book seemed to cling to their dogma with an almost psychotic fervor , reacting aggressively against any presentation of doubt , as if questioning the premise they hold dear would somehow cause their belief system to crumble . It is a weak philosophy that can not tolerate scrutiny . And this is a very weak philosophy.Do n't waste your time or money on this book.Here is my original review : I was excited to read this book because of my strong belief that alternative treatments such as proper diet , sufficient exercise and emotional well-being are critical to good physical health . I 'm a vegetarian , I have a supportive social network , and I believe that it 's important to walk in a natural environment every day . I am in the choir , and even I got tired of the whining . Further , I read a lot of made-up stuff about psychosomatic illness that seemed to be just plain hokum in the 150 or so pages I choked down in combination with how the author feels that everybody in `` the medical community '' is out to get him for his `` revolutionary ideas . `` About the fifth or sixth time the author said something like : 'I know that `` the medical community '' is going to jump all over me for saying this , but ... ' and then say something completely banal like people in pain are in emotional pain , too , I had enough . Sarno 's assertion that physiological problems can be influenced by emotional issues is not a breakthrough . Caroline Myss ' 1996 `` Anatomy of the Spirit '' explores fully what Sarno only swirls around , toilet-water-like , but never manages to actually say.Perhaps Sarno is a great guy and has really helped people feel better , but that does n't mean he can write worth a whit . A well-written non-fiction book states clearly what it plans to say , the points it will address , and then elaborates these in detail in its later chapters . This author starts out by describing his trials and tribulations in getting `` the medical community '' to accept his trivial and throwaway epiphanies , and the book never really seems to go beyond that.This is a book for people who want to have a big jeer at `` the medical community '' that has failed them ( hey , it happens ) , or people who enjoy believing in conspiracy theories so that they can sit alone in their apartments watching TV without feeling bad about it . If you are not in one of those two categories , there is nothing for you in this book.Read capably by Paul Hecht .	-1
I found this book while searching for funny books to read . A book based on the trials and tribulations of a postal carrier seemed like the perfect subject for hilarity and hijinks , but the first 28 pages of this book could be summarized as `` an alcoholic complains about his postal job . '' Maybe I did n't give this book enough time , but I feel like something should catch me and pull me in within the first 25 pages . This book did not.If you 're looking for a funny read I recommend Funny in Farsi , Me Talk Pretty One Day and Bitter is the New Black .	-1
I heard an interview with a man who recently released a documentary about Charles Bukowski . I got so enthused I bought several of his books . Almost all of the reviews I read were glowing . & quot ; LIFE CHANGING ! & quot ; & quot ; MASTERPIECE ! & quot ; & quot ; AWE INSPIRING ! & quot ; Well , it was inspiring , but I 'm not sure exactly what it inspired me to do . I read this book and felt nothing . No , I take that back . I felt like I was totally & quot ; not & quot ; getting the point or the genius . I did n't like the characters . I did n't like the story ( I 'm a government employee and I could n't even relate to it ! ) . But , I persevered and finished the book . Only to be left with one burning question ... .HUH ? Seeing as how everyone seems to love Bukowski , I 'm trying another one of his books . I 'm giving him another shot . But I 'm just not feeling it . Maybe it 's a male/female difference of perspective . I just do n't know .	-1
One of the worst books I have ever ret was so bad that I quitreading while only half way through the book . I do n't care how often boys jerk off or what they think about while doing this.I am an avid reader , and I must say that no matter how bad a book reads , I do n't stop reading the book . This book is a first for me - that I could n't read any more than half . It had no redeeming qualities .	-1
I can handle depressing books . I actually steer away from anything too frothy . This one , I am afraid , would depress a circus clown after his best stage performance . Dark . Sad . No uplifting moments . I finished it , hoping it would have some redemption at the end . Wrong . Went from depressing to clinically depressing .	-1
This book was n't for me . It was boring , trite , and repetitive . If your thing is mindless romantic pulp fiction then I guess it would be okay . It is n't so much that I disliked this book I simply felt like I 'd read it many times before . I 'll say this much for Rachel Gibson , she has found her formula and she sticks to it . If her books or those from writers like her are your thing then you want be disappointed .	-1
Not impressed with this book at all . There is some good advice in it , but the good stuff you will also find in other books . There is also some really bad and seedy advice as well . They details guide to style was a much better read and had in my opinion better advice .	-1
This book tries very hard -- too hard -- to be cute . It seems like every page is an inside joke for the benefit of the author and her friends -- things like animal/human names , stuff on TV , etc . Writing is clunky , and story is disjointed . Tedious to read aloud . Lacks real joy . Not recommended .	-1
If only I could & # 34 ; exchange & # 34 ; this book for something else . I loved the first one , and was so excited about this book , but it really is not a great book . I 've found myself confused with these nastier fae and I just ca n't get myself to go past the first few chapters . The book has been sitting unfinished for over a month . I just moved on to a different series . I wonder if I need to finish this one to go on to the next in the Wicked Lovely series ? ! Maybe the third will be as good as the first , because the second stinks to me ! ! ! !	-1
If you are considering this book STOP ! Better to buy Mending The Past & Healing The Future With Soul Retrieval by Alberto Villoldo . I bought both books at the same time . Sandra 's was painful to read ; I had to force myself to finish it . Sandra thinks she can do `` what no mere mortal can '' . She tells you stories of healings ; with no reference points or verifications . She could have made up every `` example '' . Like a 1960 's book before publishers required actual facts . Villoldo on the other hand explains in great detail the why , where and whens of `` soul retrieval '' . Sorry Sandra , but the jig is up . Good luck and I think you need to go retrive that part of your sould that threw honesty out the window !	-1
Nothing very new here except a few tidbits to spice up the narrative . A very anglophile analysis , with a near endless amount of second guessing of all the players .	-1
Observant & average-looking heroine has written in her journal about her unrequited love for her BFF 's older brother since she was 10 . She is shocked that Hero kissed her even though it was mostly due to his anger with his recently deceased wife . Hero is shocked at his behavior as well , given that he 's never looked at heroine other than as a longtime family friend . But hero finds himself becoming more drawn to willing heroine . Their attraction eventually ends up in a consummation but hero leaves the next day but promises to marry heroine esp if she finds herself pregnant . Heroine accepts his proposal , even though she knows he proposed only out of duty . But she wishes he married her for love & her wish becomes more & more evident to both of them during their marriage , placing the pressure on hero to figure out what he 's going to do about it.Like the other Quinn books I read recently , this book was not too exciting . Quinn does write well enough to capture my interest & not tempt me to skip pages . But the pace of the story & romance lagged & the intensity of emotions b/w the main characters was missing . Yes , heroine is described as desperately longing for hero for years but it did n't show in her demeanor or behaviors . Heroine was emotionally passive . Hero was more emotionally intense but his obsession & desire was focused on his deceased wife & his strong feelings for heroine were guilt & confusion . I pitied the heroine at 1st & then later I got tired of her doormat behaviors & thought she was pathetic . She was settling for hero 's crumbs & hero settled for heroine out of duty & guilt . Not very romantic.Read only if can stand heroine pining for & pursuing reluctant hero .	-1
I was excited about this book because I thought it was going to be something from Julia that was different from the Bridgertons . Which Julia has n't done in a long time . I agree with the other reviews that her last offerings of the Bridgertons were not very good . But the old Julia books I would sit and read in one sitting . I have had this book so a few weeks and I am still having trouble of finish it.The story does n't ring true and I could n't help and think that these plot line are very similar to some of her other books . Enough already of the hunting lodge.If you have never read any of Julia 's books try some of her old stuff like Minx or To Catch an Heiress .	-1
I am extremely bummed about this book . I loved the Brigerton series and was hoping for more of the same with this one.I found that Miranda and Nigel/Turner were extremely immature and acted more like bickering teenagers than adults . *Spoiler* I agree wholeheartedly with Phillipa J 's review . The part that really bothered me , so much so that I have n't even read the remainder of the book , is the totally blase approach to Miranda 's miscarriage . I mean what the heck ? ? And the description ? `` ... I bled and then I was n't pregnant anymore . '' It was the most astounding thing I 've ever read and the fact that it was supposedly not worth mourning over because her mother had told her those babies were not meant to be ? I would never have thought Julia Quinn would write those words and I was so disturbed by the complete lack of feeling on Miranda and Turner 's part ( and Julia 's ! ) that I have n't picked up the book since . And honestly after reading all of the juvenile dialogue between the two of them , I really ca n't say that I 'm sorry . So disappointed ... ugh .	-1
It is hard to write this negative review without revealing the plot for those who may choose to buy and read this book.Mr Impossible was my first book from this author and was a delightful keeper of a read . This one , had some delightful moments , and the characters were rather appealing , but then the author lost me with a plot twist that simply did not ring true to the period . Living in that world with rigid regency mores it was just unbelievable that a Marquess ' daughter would do what she did , and still more so that an Earl would lend countenance . Luckily this was in the end , but my disbelief totally ruined the book for me . The UNbelievable plot totally took the book out of time and place , in fact would not be out of place in a contemporary novel . The response to a teen pregnancy by the dad when he found out , felt like a very rushed and hurriedly written scene . And accepting a 10 year old brat as their own grandchild without a pause ? Very Very contemporary . Unhesistating acceptance by extended family and friends was even more out of time.As a pro , I really did love how this pregnancy shaped the character of the heroine and set up the romantic tension .	-1
Reviewers Kavity Killer and Jeb Brown speak for me . I personally could n't force myself though to the end . The opening with the cat is a bunch of bs obviously written by someone who 's never had any experiences with cats.Here is the opening paragraph : '' I used to have a cat , an old fighting tom , who would jump through the open window by my bed in the middle of the night and land on my chest . I 'd half-awaken . He 'd stick his skull under my nose and purr , stinking of urine and blood . Some nights he kneaded my bare chest with his front paws , powerfully , arching his back , as if sharpening his claws , or pummeling a mother for milk . And some mornings I 'd wake in daylight to find my body covered with paw prints in blood ; I looked as though I 'd been painted with roses . `` I 've had 30 ( plus or minis ) stray cats in my life and no one in his/her right mind is going to allow one to dig in and `` make bread '' anywhere on their body . CATS HAVE CLAWS . Very sharp needle claws . Razor blades on the tips of every one of their cute little toes.When my cats jumps off the window perch onto the foot of my bed in the middle of the night it , a lot of the time , jerks me wide awake . Just imagine one jumping directly onto your chest ! ! ! And why didn't/does n't she get the poor thing NEUTERED for cripes sake. -- -- -- Skimmed the rest of the book . Found nothing of value . From what I read it was just a meandering pointless walk in the woods . Maybe it 's because I 've done a lot of backpacking through out my life and Annie 's walk in the woods is just too cute .	-1
First off I began listening to the audio book with no expectations , not knowing anything but the title . I was reading this book for my book club and prefer to go into books blind ready to see the world of the author . I chose the audio book as I have some travelling to do and enjoy a good read while driving.The Author is very talented at painting masterpieces with words . I will give her that much . I journeyed along with her reliving my own wonderment with nature from my childhood . That listenting experience was delightful for the first two chapters ... then , the descriptive painting became somewhat tiresome due to no fault of the reader whom I enjoy listening to . After starting to doze in chapter 6 ( I was a passenger at the time of Chapter 6 ) I had to take a break ... my brain was numb ... I was bored to tears ... and had to find something else to entertain me ... . and keep me awake . My brain needed more than Annie Dillard and her Pilgrimage could possibly give me . After arriving at my destination and suffering from insomnia I experience while travelling ... this book afforded me much needed sleep . I now keep it loaded on my ipod ready for sleepy times.It is way too descriptive ... repetitive and makes me want to sleep ... even in the book form ... as I had to try reading it ... nothing made it any better . The blathering continued even in the printed form ... blah blah blah ... In a nutshell , this book in either form is a cure for insomnia .	-1
This book could have been better if not for the constant yammering about how much smarter the young author was than everyone else . Every chapter opened with some sort of praise for his intelligence and groundbreaking work.Do n't get me wrong , I think it had some interesting correlations and theories , but I also felt like I did n't come away with anything . Every time someone talks about this being an economics book I want to point out you learn nothing about economics . You learn about a bunch of very specific theories ( although some have been written about since this book was published like the point about a pool being more dangerous than a gun . ) It 's clear this book was written to appeal to the largest audience possible . Feel free to read it- it is a quick one- but also remember that if you go looking for strange correlations like these , you 'll certainly find them .	-1
Perhaps I am doing something wrong with the font size . The bolded words mentioned in the text are not bold on the Kindle . The tables do not work in the Kindle format.Can I get my money back ?	-1
The concept of the book is excellent despite the distorted picture of this as a popularized view of economics in action . It has to do with economics what a newspaper article of dubious accuracy has to history.The principle of using economic analysis methods to examine social behavior is hardly new . It 's been part of the social sciences for years . What 's not always been done is to use it to examine ideas in new ways -- which Freakonomics sets out to do . But just as the title is written to grab your attention , so is the manipulation and skimming of data . This is akin to pop psychology , and just as unsatisfying.Swimming pools are more dangerous than guns ? That 's true , sort of . So what . One is an accident . The other usually is n't . More Americans will die by gunfire this year -- any year -- than were killed in the World Trade Center attacks . Using the book 's logic , someone could probably justify an invasion to the United States to confiscate guns ( I would n't suggest it ) .. There are some realities . In areas with high crime rates , almost no one will die in a swimming pool drowning and many will be shot to death.One study that this book cites on one aspect of gun violence is accurate so far as it goes , but it is a selective reading that ignores that same reports countervailing statistics . You have to find the full report and read it to understand that it is n't as cut and dried as this book 's superficial analysis , some of which can be overlooked if it was the beginning of a serious study instead of a Wall Street Journal column or highly compensated book . Most of the analysis in Freakanomics is dead end . Are abortions related to a fall in cime . Perhaps . but I do n't think anyone is going to mandate abortions as part of a crime control program.Gun issues do n't concern me directly , but it is in that area that I find numerous studies that are on their faces ridiculous . One is cited here . More carry permits reduce crime ? More guns will reduce public massacres ( the notion of a marksman being there to plug the shooter ) ? Capital punishment is a deterent ? The trouble with these analyses is that they are n't really analysis ( and Freaknomics steps into this arena in this and other areas ) but statistical data gathered to justify a conclusion already reached . Statistics that reflect what may seem to be a reality in many places would not reflect the reality of others . More guns in NYC ? Most people would prefer to take their chances with a low murder rate than to have some vigilante gunman start shooting in a crowded subway car.The United States has more murders per capita by far than any other western nation . By gun , knife or baseball bat . But most of ours are by gun . We have more police shot and killed . We have at least two states with prison populations that each exceed the prison populations of all of western Europe combined . We have more people in prison than many countires have as population . We have tens of thousands of people in prison for murder or other violent crimes . Other countries far fewer ( per capita or absolute ) . Despite the talk of growing crime in Britain or France or other countries , murder and serious violent crime are not going up that fast.What none of these people do is to compare the United States with other countries in a way that makes sense , rather than just comparing statistics in isolation . We have a pretty good infant mortality rate . There are a number of countries that have substantially improved on our figures . How ? Why is the murder rate in the United States consistently higher than , say Britain.To make statistics meaningful , you need an adequate sample form an appropriate population . Our murder rate locally for the last five years is 0.0 per 100,000 . We 're an island in a sense , just over 100,000 . So if some guy went nuts in a shopping center and killed 10 people , the statistical percentages wold make that look far worse than the singular act that it is . What we consider a minor episode of mass violence can drive up the statitics in another country by an astronmical percentage because that act is so rare . Despite decayed urban centers , the New England area has overall a far smaller murder rate than the deep South or Southwest . Why ? You 'll note I 'm offering no answers.But how many crimes committed with stolen or `` borrowed '' guns are the result of insecure storage . There are endless issues raised by superficial data . Freakonomics is superficial headlining of statistical data that may or may not mean a thing . Try the stock market always goes up in Presidential election years ? Maybe statistically , but do n't bet the house it 's going to be true next year . Or the other way around.And why is it that crime is declining faster in states with a low and declining population than in those that have the most . Do plea bargans create more crime ? Apparently not . If you believe the part of one survey quoted here , you might consider that it also correlates gun murder and murder rate to NRA membership . There is clearly no direct connection between NRA membership and murders . How is that explained . Actually the study attempts to do that since the NRA commissioned the study .	-1
This book presents some odd ideas and entertaining notions ; however that 's about the extent of its use . It purports give freaky explanations to some interesting national trends while leaving looming national economic emergenices unexplained , nor does it offer any suggestions on how to deal with these problems when they break over our heads like the Biblical 40 days and 40 nights . What of the Federal imbalance of income and payout obligations ? This is estimated to be between $ 64 trilion and $ 97 trillion . The crime rate is down due to abortion ? That 's arguable . The disappearing middle class ? What to do about the cheapening of America ? MultiMillion CEO 's with Golden Parachutes stock prices & uuml ; ber alles , and the employee/serfs who work for peanuts ; in fear of outsourcing by the corperation in search of cheaper and inferior products ; downsizing and benefit withdrawal for the sake of the bottom line only ? Nothing new in this book . This author is no rogue .	-1
The premise was interesting but there were several flaws . The villian was not really cruel just greedy and opportunistic and really did n't have many moments in the book . John the hero was ok but really really bland . There was noting memorable about him . Elizabeth the heroine was so annoying I did n't like her . She kept whinning about her people and protecting her people and would not listen to anyone about anything . She did n't want to listen to John , had no respect for him as a man and a knight . If she would have just listened to him and trusted that he knew something about how to deal with the situation instead of insisting on doing things her way the story could have been better . Instead we had to read page after page of her pretending to be a maid so she can help her people but she never did anything to help them . Lord Bannaster never killed anyone or threaten her or her people with force . Common sense should have told her to escape as the maid go to her powerful neighbor who was fostering her sisters to ask for aid . But she was so paranoid ( to a certain extent she had some valid concerns for not trusting men ) she really thought walking arouund as a maid could solve her problmes . So I read 350 pages of Elizabeth and John going back and forth as to the best way to free her . If John was half the man a knight should be he would have done what knew to be the right thing and Elizabeth would have had to grow up and realize that she was n't as smart as she thought . What John saw in her I 'll never know . They never had any `` get to know you '' time and I could not see how they fell in love .	-1

I 'm a huge fan of Carmindy and was excited to get my hands on her book , but after reading cover to cover I 'm pretty disappointed . She gives some good tips , but nothing is a new take on makeup ( except putting lighter shade of shadow in the crease instead of medium shade ) . Her directions are not terribly thorough and do n't offer many different ways to do each look , or variations on brushes and techniques to use . She offers only two product options for each look in the back of the book and most of the cheap options are really hard to find with no resource page in the back .	-1

If you are looking for holiday cheer , this is not the book for you . Light on romance and somewhat sad .	-1
I have enjoyed J . A. Jance 's Joanna Brady and Ali Reynolds books and her previous Brady and Beaumont book . That said , this was a disappointment . There was little suspense , as others have said , and I could n't believe the end , which just sort of petered out . I listened to the audiobook and was sure that had to be another disc because nothing was resolved . It was just as though the book had reached X number of pages and had to be wrapped up . Perhaps , there will be another that picks up where this one left off , kind of like the planned Harry Potter 7A and 7B movies . That would be the only explanation for the dud of an ending .	-1
Having loved her first two novels , i was surprised at how shallow and cliched this one is . Readable ? Certainly . But barely anything more than that .	-1
Allow me to state that just because I did not like this book , I did recognize that some passages were beautifully written . Some phrases were quite lovely , as well . Example , `` confetti of noise . '' I liked the manner in which this was first utilized . Later on in this book , however , we had more `` confetti '' on snow , etc . Editors should have picked up on this . Another annoyance , for this reader , was the improbability of characterizations . When Lake meets Piper , she exclaims , `` My real name is Piper , can you imagine ? '' Okay , I may not have gotten this verbatim , but the point is clear . One is easily drawn to Cornelia . She is so likeable . The romance between husband and wife was nice to read , as well . However , the book just did not work for this reader . I , too , like some other reviewers did not understand the sudden bond between Piper & Cornelia . I felt that this book became a contrivance . Basically , this genre is not my taste . However , readers who enjoy this genre will , most likely , be drawn to this book . I 'm not sure if this is `` Chick-Lit '' or not . I did like `` Good In Bed . '' That was well written , funny and heart warming . `` Belong To Me '' was like a rather bad fairy tale . Not recommended for serious readers -- sorry folks ! !	-1
Yet another investment genius has discovered indexing again for the first time . Thirty years after John Bogle began banging on this drum ( back when it was , in fact , a new idea ) all of the genius wannabes are coming out of the woodwork to proclaim their discovery . There is nothing new here.The book is so dumbed-down that it is almost funny . The average length of each chapter is about three pages , for those of us with short attention spans , I suppose . There might be a market for it among people who have never heard of investing before . It would not be a terrible read if you have never heard of any of the investing terms , like `` stocks '' and `` bonds '' and `` interest '' . The ideas are clearly presented.. over and over again . The content of the book can be written in one sentence , `` Buy index funds and accept what the market gives you and you will do better than most . '' Beyond that , it is a monotonous repetition of the same mantra throughout .	-1
After reading Sara Gruen 's Water for Elephants and Ape House , I really expected much better . Her heroine Annemarie was such a train wreck that I found myself either embarrassed for her or just plain annoyed at her as she bungled her way through this novel . It was difficult to feel any sympathy for her and Sara did a poor job of developing a relationship between her and her new-found replacement for Harry , her beloved horse who died in the accident . Granted , I listened to the audio book version , and the actress who read it was overly dramatic and very harsh sounding throughout , so perhaps I 'm being a little unfair . I found myself just wanting to tell this woman to go get some therapy before you totally destroy your world and everyone in it . It was n't a fun read , just disappointing and irritating . Sara obviously improved with experience .	-1
I want to offer a different perspective on this book , one that I do n't pretend is the only one and is of limited utility to people who typically read books like these and not an outsider like myself . ( Likewise , given that you 've likely read some of the other more prominent reviews , I do n't feel a need to give an overview of the content . ) This book has a lot going for it -- fairly well written , an engaging style , etc . -- but ultimately I found it hypocritical . Cialdini obviously is deeply ambivalent about the methods he describes but does n't own up to it . On one hand , he is antagonistic toward people who use these techniques , even suggesting not tipping a bartender who ` salts ' their tip jar , but he makes a living teaching them to would-be marketeers . This makes for an erratic book , one that is a roadmap on how to get short-term compliance against people 's own self-interest yet one that also preaches against such things . I wish Cialdini had faced this squarely . It seems like he is going at it at an angle in the epilogue and seems to want to make a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate uses of these techniques but it 's less rigorous than the rest of the book.Mainly what I 'm left with is a better understanding of why I am so often on-guard against strangers anymore : I have so often had the experience of having people hawking goods or seeking donations try so many of these approaches on me that I assume that everyone engaging me in public or cold calls me is on the make . As such , books of this ilk are corrosive by corrupting norms of discourse amongst people in public .	-1
Following the logic that ghost stories are creepiest when read aloud , I listened to an audio version of Ghost Radio . I later found out that the physical copy of the book has illustrations scattered throughout the book , and I 'm disappointed that I missed them.Joaquin and Alondra are the hosts of `` Ghost Radio '' , a Mexican radio program . Listeners call in and share their stories about the paranormal and the scary . It 's wildly successful ; so much so that Joaquin is given a chance to bring the radio show Stateside . His return to Texas , however , is bittersweet ; memories of the deaths of his parents and his best friend haunt him . Or is it more than mere memories ? Joaquin finds himself being drawn into the ghostly world described by his callers , and seeing specters of his own . But is Joaquin really being haunted by the dead ... or is he just losing his mind , snapping under the pressure of work and suppressed traumas ? The best parts of this book by far were the stories told by Joaquin 's callers . Most of them were very traditional ghost stories . A dead relative appearing before a caller after he 'd passed away , or a girl trying to see the image of her future husband in a mirror at midnight - that sort of thing . But they were articulated so well on the page - and read perfectly by Pedro Pascal on the audio track - that it was like listening to ghost stories around a campfire , wonderful spooky entertainment.The main story with Joaquin and Alondra did n't flow so smoothly . The narration constantly jumps characters , which would be difficult enough to follow since each switch is n't clearly delineated . To make things even more confusing , the perspective also changes irregularly ; Joaquin might be narrating in the third person for a few pages , only to suddenly change to a few paragraphs in the first person . It 's very choppy , and at times nearly impossible to tell who is speaking . Gout also tries to weave Toltec mythology into the story , but it always seems very forced . I think he is trying to use the idea of living in dreams to partially explain the world of ghosts ... but it is n't clear at all.The first half ofGhost Radiois significantly better than the second . Joaquin seems to be losing his grip on sanity , and it 's definitely reflected in the structure of the book . By the final third , though , the bizarre , disconnected imagery is overwhelming , and the final conclusion did n't seem to pay off as I had hoped . There are some promising passages here . I loved the short stories called in to Joaquin 's radio show - I almost wish Gout had written a collection of spooky short stories instead . I think it would have been so much better than this convoluted novel .	-1
If I could have given this book NO stars , I would have . Like most of the other reviewers here , we own and LOVE Pinkalicious ! Naively , I assumed this would be a book about a girl who loves purple ( the way Pinkalicious loves pink ) . I was shocked to discover it is actually about peer pressure and `` mean girls '' who taunt and tease a little girl for loving the color pink . Reading words like `` ugly , '' `` stupid , '' `` passe , '' and `` putrid '' to my 3 and five year old daughters made me sad -- when I realized what this book was , I simply made up ( nicer ) words just to get through it . Now I am throwing this book away . It 's a shame , too , because the writing is clever and the illustrations are adorable -- but my kids do NOT need to know about these things yet . My older daughter is old enough to understand `` teaching tools '' that show us how NOT to behave , but my younger daughter was just sad and confused . ( `` Why are they being mean to Pinkalicious ? ? ? '' she wanted to know . Why , indeed ! )	-1
Got to chapter two and bailed . Poppy is an immature BRAT and Fletch is a dope for marrying a woman who did n't even like to kiss . I came to Amazon to see if it was worth reading any further , and my instincts seem to be right . A big miss . I wish I could get my money back .	-1
I just do n't know what this book was . Maybe it had some literary bent about which I am unaware , but it was not my cup of tea . I read the first chapter and thought I was really going to like this heroine and that she was going to be clever and intelligent . Regrettably , the story just seemed to go downhill from there . The `` ruse '' lasted too long and the story was muddled with lots of conversation that I think was supposed to be clever and humorous , but was n't . The points made through the obsessions with chess and the Game seemed trite . It all just appeared so insincere , and I was not entertained by it . I liked the first and last chapter and the epilogue . It 's too bad that some of what existed in those pages was not entwined with the rest , because it would have been a more enjoyable read . I 'll be interested to see what others think of this . Did I miss something ? I believe I 've read just about all of Eloisa James ' books . Many I like . As I put on a 5-star review on another one of her stories , I think that many of her books are better than her reviews have been , with the exception of a couple . I , however , thought this one was pretty awful . In many of the conversations when the characters kept talking about being bored , I could n't help but wonder if the author herself was n't bored , because I sure was , right along with the characters .	-1
Having read both books , I got ta wonder why Susan bothered ... she came to the match late , copying Coulter every step , even the cover and resorts to the antics she accuses Coulter of , but just does n't do it as well . Coulter offers an entertainment option with some points with solid information ... sorry Estrich fans , but , if you really dig into what the two ladies have to say , Susan is disappointing . I had hoped for something better than a copy cat trying to make money by clawing at Coulter . Estrich has to have some of her own brains , given prior accomplishments , and it 'd be great to hear some solid work from her , something backed by solid facts , not her version of how she 'd like others to see it . This work is a gimmick meant for making Susan some fast cash and not worth your time .	-1
I 'll admit that I 'm not a fan of Anne Coulter , but Susan is not exactly a great alternative either . I did n't finish this book , but I tried reading one of Anne 's books and I did n't finish that one either . In the last year I have become cynical of politics in general . Right-Wing and Left-Wing pundits are too focused on annihilating each other . And the battle seems to continue with this book to it 's predictable counter arguments and smearing of Anne Coulter , not based on her politics as much as personal attacks . Which is basically what politics is . You can skip this and basically watch the pundits slug it out on cable news networks . Save your money .	-1
Most boring book I have ever read in my life . If I used this book on my employees they would probably all quit . I like to use old fashioned ways of appreciating my employees . Especially the older ones that have stuck with me for years .	-1
My wife picked up this book in the hope of fooling our kids into eating more vegetables . She tried the inexplicable chocolate-spinach brownie , but the recipe failed for the following reasons:1 . The brownie texture was wrong . The surface of the brownie forms a shiny , mucousy layer that looks a bit like Freddie Kruger 's skin in the `` Nightmare on Elm Street '' series.2 . While I had long been of the opinion that nearly anything can be made to taste good as long as it is smothered with enough chocolate , I am sad to find that I have been wrong in this belief . While the brownie looks like it should taste good , it has a strange metallic flavor . My mom thought it tasted like we had put some kind of fruit in it , while I thought it tasted like a tray of brownies that had been stored alongside some rotting vegetables.The sad thing is that the overall idea is pretty good . Try replacing the spinach with zucchini , which already has a solid track record as a dessert ingredient.Meanwhile , I 'm off to cleanse my palette .	-1
The idea is good , and the recipes sound good , but they just do n't work out as stated . As a long-time cook , I have had to `` save '' every single recipe I 've made . I still use this book for ideas , but have adapted the recipes to the point where they are no longer recognizable as the ones in the book . The only recipe I did n't have to adapt so far is the chocolate brownies with avocado .	-1
If there was a zero rating option , that 's what I would give this book . I have tried five recipes and they are all really bad ( terrible tasting , take way too much time to make ( steam , puree , hide ) and end up in the garbage after ) . My kids love mac and cheese but I do not think they will touch them again after the eating the ones I made using the recipe in this book . UGH ! ! ! ! Do not waste your money .	-1
It is really very hard to understand how these editors have managed to survive their own ineptitude . These stories are cliche efforts by minor voices in science fiction . As a reader I feel deceived , robbed , and worst of all , bored . If I were a top notch science fiction writer ( Brin , Card , etc . ) I would be pissed . Calling this the `` best '' of the year is a gross insult to the truly talented folks working the field . For someone new to the genre it would be very likely to cause them to decide SF is not their thing . Criminal neglect . I gave it two stars rather than zero because there are a couple of good stories by real SF writers ( why did those authors allow their stories to be published alongside hack amateurs ? ) MOST IRRITATING is that the editors have the gall to tell us , in the preface , that they have careful chosen only true science fiction stories , rather than crossing the line into fantasy . If you ca n't fix it , lie about it ... .	-1
Bernard Goldberg is still searching for his beliefs -- at least as far as any coherent social/political philosophy . He has at least learned to recognize the foolishness of the left when it comes to economic policy , the defense of the nation , and some of their coercive utopian ideas.However , he does n't understand Ronald Reagan 's philosophies and devotes an entire chapter to making that clear . He is unable to depart from the elitist view that anyone who doubts his Religion ( an unwavering faith in wild improbabilities and hostility to the concept of a Creator ) is unable to function in our technological society . He never explains the myriad of scientists and engineers who doubt his Atheistic religion , but could dance rings around him discussing , say , digital multiplexing.He has n't yet developed a positive philosophy and perhaps that will come . I listened to the audio version and felt like I was listening to a whining Andy Rooney monologue . He deserves credit for at least realizing the lunacy of the left in this country -- no mean feat for modern journalist . Perhaps in a few years he will have developed a consistent mature view of things.In the mean time , skip it .	-1
After reading `` No One Heard Her Scream '' I had hoped the next effort was more than mediocore . Not so ! With essentially the same plot as the first book , ( over testosteroned dark eyed hero with ultra hard body raised by gangsters but somehow completely innocent and female cop so brash and aggressive as to be nerve racking ) only the names and locations have changed . This book has nothing to offer unless you are into the plotless erotica of the romance novella . Ms. Dane needs to stick to the strickly romance genre and not delude herself that she is a mystery writer . Personally , I could n't finish the book..wish I could get my money back .	-1
You might ask , & # 34 ; Why two stars ? & # 34 ; Two stars , in my own personal rating system , means I finished the book but did n't really like it . I almost quit reading when Ms. Siddons stated that someone way howling like a & # 34 ; tomcat in heat & # 34 ; . Female cats come in heat , not toms . Where was the editor ? He or she must have been a city person.There are too many words . Again , where was the editor ? Clearly , half of this tome could have been omitted . Plan to skim if you do read this book.Which brings us to the main characters : Shep was a wimp ; his parents were evil ; Lucy , plain crazy ; her mother was evil . In fact , the only characters I liked were the Camerons.I saw that Justin Beiber wanted to buy a house on Peachtree Road . The residents do n't want him there . If he had read this book , I 'm sure he would n't want to live there !	-1
This book would make a great short story . I ca n't imagine being very interested in his philosophical discussions with himself . The running of the restaurants , the interplay among front and back of the house is fun to read , but apparently he ( and presumably his editor if there was one ) either did n't have enough similar material , or he assumed we wanted to know about his inner turmoil . The book felt disjointed to me , but I did finish it . I would n't recommend it , however . ( I have worked in restaurants , and find it surprising that after so many years the author could n't come up with more compelling stories to fill this volume . Not looking forward to his next book . )	-1
I enjoyed the authors other books , especially Lucia , Lucia . I was hoping for another good book with a strong character , since the last book Rococo , was a let down also . I purchased it on my Kindle and could n't wait to start it . Then I noticed it became just pages and pages of details , and not enough story . Details about leather , shoes , sunsets , scenery , streets , it went on and on , and I had to skim some pages , because it just got too much.With all that money the grandmother could get for the building , why could n't Valentine just open her own business somewhere else ? Financial freedom , to start somewhere fresh , advertise , but no ! A simple solution to the story 's on and on problem .	-1
I bought this book based on the twin facts of glowing Amazon reviews and that it was recommended based on my reading history . Historical fiction is a particular favourite of mine and it was with great anticipation that I started reading The Shoemaker 's Wife . At first I thought the stilted prose , the two-dimensional characters , the awkward dialogue will eventually taper out and the story will blossom into what all the five- and four- star glory promised by the reviews . Sadly , this did n't happen.Trigiani spends a lot of time talking of the minutiae of rolling pasta , boiling gnocchi , and braiding ropes of mozzarella , and not enough on her principal characters who are left helplessly lurching from situation to situation . There is no seamless story line here , no smooth transition between the different stages of the characters ' lives , they are left semi-formed and this leaves the reader feeling unanchored for the entire length of the novel.This concept had so much promise . Trigiani could have made this story into an epic saga detailing the lives of early Italian immigrants to the USA . Instead , its a poor , half-baked story with no single theme centering it . Sorely disappointed .	-1
Not enough twists in the story . Read like a biography . A long and boring read . Not impressed by this author .	-1
Just tried this author . I wont ' make the mistake again . The book was rather short . I flew through it . The characters were n't fully developed and that no depth to them . The heroine was a little twit and the hero was not likeable at all . Barely a plot and it did n't truly have an historical feel to me . I do n't like too much history but the entire story took place either in her house with her family or his home.Try Sylvia Day , Sharon Page , Lisa Valdez . Much better writers for this type of historical fiction .	-1
Sorry , I just did n't connect with this book.Did n't end up getting much out of it.Read a couple of chapters and gave up .	-1
Reviews I read about Now You See Him were great and made me want to read it , but it 's actually quite boring . Its saving grace , perhaps , is that Eli Gottlieb 's writing style is somewhat like Ian McEwan 's writing style ; both write beautiful sentences , so good you want to read them twice.However , Gottlieb differs from McEwan in all else . Although McEwan 's stories sometimes start out slow , they always go somewhere , make you want to keep turning the pages.Gottlieb 's Now You See Him seems to be about a well-known author who gets writer 's block and ends up killing his girlfriend , a successful author , and himself . But the rest of the book goes on and on in boring detail about how this affected his family and friends , about the narrator 's marriage problems , and about the narrator 's past and present experiences with the dead man and the dead man 's alcoholic mother . BORING !	-1
I waited to buy this book , knowing that I was n't emotionally ready to read it . I eventually bought it when I bought W. Nack 's Ruffian book and the book about Secretariat 's groom . I read the other two books first , and then the Barbaro book . The Barbaro book is littered with mistakes . The editors did an extremely poor job . I realize that casual horseracing fans will probably enjoy the book and wo n't notice the errors , but there is sooo much missing from this book ! I was extremely disappointed in this book . It is not a worthy remembrance of Barbaro , his connections and the fans worldwide who followed his story .	-1
This is a very wordy book . He needed an editor . Examples are n't relevant to today but base information would be . Very boring !	-1
This book is marketed towards 6-8 year olds , but the stories are waaaay too troublesome for most 6-7 year olds and probably many 8 year olds as well . The cover looks cool so of course my 6yr old son chose this one from the library . It was n't until I was reading it aloud to our 6yr old and 4yr old that I stopped mid-sentence realizing the girl 's head would FALL OFF . Talk about nightmare material ... no wonder so many children have nightmares and worry needlessly about things they should n't have to worry about . The stories themselves are good for about ages 9 and up which is why I gave this 2 stars . It certainly should n't be `` An I Can Read Book '' though .	-1
When I was a child , radio advertisements for a certain corporation had a jingle that said the product was so inexpensive because of , '' Low overhead , Low overhead ! `` This book appears to have been written on low overhead and , apparently , minimal interest in the subject matter . First , the hero is introduced as Lord Dominic Lacey . Shortly thereafter , he is Lord Lacey . Then it appears that he is the heir to a title . Now the heir would not be `` Lord Firstname Anybody , '' because that was a style for a younger son , so he has to be Lord Lacey ( presumably the next lesser title in whatever his father 's string of titles may be ) .That 's aside from all the rest of the improbabilities.It 's not kind to say that a book is awful . Nevertheless , as a warning to other readers -- this is a very poorly written , improbably plotted , and quite horrible book .	-1
I just finished Sophie Jordan 's One Night With you and I have to say I am a little disappointed . I really enjoyed her first two books and was really anxious for this one , but after reading it , I have to say it did n't live up to the other two . I think the best way to describe it is to say it left me with a rather depressing feeling . I really did n't like the heroine Jane . I could n't get a good handle on her . I do n't know if it was her rather lackluster name or what , but she just seemed old to me . Her horrible first marriage was described over and over and after a while , it just was too much . She seemed like such a pathetic creature -- her whole family was rotten and it just depressed me . Her life after she found Seth again was n't a whole lot better . There were just so many unlikable characters in this book that there was n't any relief from the bad feelings it evoked . I did like Julianne and Gregory 's story , but it really did n't amount to a lot.A lot of readers like books because of their feelings and the way the book makes them feel . A recent book I read that left me with such a happy feeling was Once a Rake by Rona Sharon . Even though that book dealt with unpleasant issues as well , it did n't depress me like this one . I finished that book with an uplifting feeling . Not so with One Night With You . I felt sad reading Jane 's story and was sort of glad it was over when I finished it . I 'm sad to say this book will not be joining Sophie Jordan 's other two books on my keeper shelf . I would n't want to revisit this sad story again . 2 stars for Jordan 's writing skills .	-1
Ann Patchett has obviously written ( or read ) too many screenplays and tries to interlace an incredible set of situations and characters , that could easily be translated into a TV movie . I use the term incredible in its literal sense as it is just that , there are way too many kinks and unrealistic facts stacked on high to hold your attention for a credible story in my opinion . I found myself having my appetite wetted and then left hungry for more information as each more unlikely turn of events transpired without depth or explanation . The idea of the story is sound , and the boundaries and inner workings of families thrown together in tragedy promises much but is tepid overall.I could n't get the `` yeah right ! '' voice in my head out of the way to enjoy the text or characters which whilst not larger than life , were too good to be true , certainly in how they become intertwined as the story unfolds . The heart of the story revolves around an affluent successful white man and his mixed race family , their fights , victories and supposed emotional engagements and triumphs , but just does n't work . You could close your eyes mid way through this book and see this played out on in a Hallmark movie . Imaginative movement in ones mind from page to screen may not be a bad thing , but it seems to be what preoccupied Ms Patchett whilst writing this novel . I hate to write negative reviews and I have not read any of her other works , but to be honest am not endeared to try at this point with so much other choice available . 2 stars	-1
Well , since I wrote a review for this book over a week ago and it still has n't been posted , I 'm going to try this one more time.This book was not good at all . The situations were over-the-top , the characters had no chemistry at all , and it was just downright unbelievable . I know , it 's romance , but still . In the , what , 1300s , the hero and heroine meet in a meadow and make out . If it had been a contemporary , might have been able to handle it . But , the heroine had previously fell on rocks and was bruised up . Then they ran into each other and fell off their horses ( so more bruises and the hero hit his head and passed out for a few minutes ) . So basically two people ( one being a sheltered lady of the house with no idea of sexual matters ) covered in bruises and blood , stiff all over from injuries , but remarkably feel good enough to do it in the meadow . And did I mention she had no idea who he was or what his name was . Yeah . Okay . And that 's just the first couple of chapters . It gets even better . With the wicked stepmother and the traitorous friends , it 's just a barnyard of laughs.I 've got to say I am very disappointed in the author . She has been a favorite of mine over the last few years , but the last three historicals ( including The Brat - ugh - and Love is Blind ) have just been downright bad . I think that she 's so focused on that vampire series ( which I have read two of and was not impressed with either ) her other genre , and the one she 's best at , is suffering . If you want to read one of her good books , check out The Chase or The Switch .	-1
This review is going to be very short because it just did n't do anything for me . I love reading storys about kidnappings and crimes and hearing survivors storys . This story was n't told from the victim Natascha 's perspective and instead told from two journalists perspectives , which made it feel very cheap in the respect that I feel like a lot of the aspects of the story were made off assumptions and here-say instead of factual information.Because there were two differenet authors I felt like a lot of information was repeated and irrelavant at that . I feel like the story would have been better if told from her perspective or at least with one authors voice versis two.This book just did n't kept my attention and was very mundane unfortantally ...	-1
The author must not read these reviews , because she has Goldy doing even more of exactly what readers have been complaining about in every book . Unless the author has read the reviews and decided to serve us more of what we hate about the series . Not only was Goldy a huge busy body again , telling Tom what to do and say every chance she got , but did it all while acting like she was ADHD , as one reviewer stated . She acts like the sheriffs department works for her and they should do her bidding , and that every crime is hers to solve because she knows someone involved . Good Grief ! This is all very annoying . Why does she waste time catering , she should just put on a uniform , join the police department , and be done with it . That will probably be how the series ends - Goldy with a gun in one hand and a food item in the other ! The convoluted plot was all over the place which required page after page of synopsis at the end - half of which I skipped because I no longer cared by the time I got to the end . Goldy has become extremely irritating and not likeable anymore at all . I wo n't be reading any more Goldy books .	-1
Predictable . The first few books in her & # 34 ; Goldy & # 34 ; series were entertaining and easy reads . This one was a chore to get through due to the repetition , predictable plot and lack of new ideas . Davidson should re-think her & # 34 ; Goldy & # 34 ; series , move on to another character , or consider a respite in her writing . Maybe a hiatus in her writing would provide her with new ideas .	-1
Although this book was very well written and well put together , I was a bit disappointed as it seemed more like a `` commemorative book from the show 's production . '' I would have liked to have read more on the histories of the individual games , and of course more on the Barker 's Beauties . I do n't think I saw any mention at all of Holly and Dian , and maybe it 's because of the issues they had with the show , but to me it seems I 'd much rather read an unauthorized tome if that 's what it 'd take . They 're just as much a part of the show 's history as Plinko or Bob himself .	-1
Firstly , I was very surprised to see that this book achieved so many 5 stars in the reviews . The first 70 % of this book is taken up by Slash telling us how much drink & drugs he can consume , & how often he consumed it . This book gets real interesting around page 300 ( Hardback ) when Slash starts to tell us about the break up of Guns N ' Roses & how the relationship with Axl started to deteriorate . For me , this was where the details started to get good . Slash does not share with us any other of the interesting details that he experienced . Yes , he tells us he got paid & yes , he tells us he got laid . So what , is n't that something all 'Rock n Roll Stars ' do ? Tell me something I do n't know please Slash . The bottom line here is that I would rather listen to him that read about him . Buy Scar Tissue instead , much more interesting details in there .	-1
This is a book with an astounding subtitle that does not convey what the book is all about . Then again , it is impossible to glean what the book is about from reading it . Authors Rimas and Fraser never put together a coherent theme supported by facts and narrative about any one subject -- rather they flit from subject to subject , situation to situation as if as soon as they find something out , they throw it in . Neither seems to know much about dairy farming or beef ranching , and there is a curious mix of journalistic headlines and reports with interviews of British Empire cattle ranchers ( the Masai in Kenya ) and information from some British agencies concerned with beef and dairy production . Then they spice up their disjointed vignettes with silly little `` Culinary Interludes '' containing recipes and comments on various foods.I would have given this work a `` 1 '' rating except for the fact that there are a few nuggets of interesting and valuable information buried in the incoherent text . The story of the longhorns and cowboys was interesting , except that there is a British and Eastern Elitist condescending and inacurate treatment of the American cowboy . But the Masai rancher is ennobled . Why ? This book was given to me for Christmas by well-meaning friends who knew I am a beef cattle rancher and thought it might be interesting for me to read . Unfortunately , it missed mentioning ALL my major issues as a cow-calf rancher without feedlots . For example , that no human being has ever died in the US from Mad Cow disease . Or that there is a bill in Congress currently to levy a tax on every rancher of $ 85.00 per head for beef cattle and $ 150.00 per head for dairy cows . This is sponsored by environmentalists and vegetarians who want to fine us for cows ' production of methane gas from their fermentation of grasses ( actually all ruminants do this ) -- no doubt a horrible environmental hazard . Or that we 're supposed to implant tracking devices in our animals for the government ( another non-funded mandate ) to track in case of Mad Cow , anthrax , or other problems . Or that the use of corn for ethane has driven up the spread the feedlots need to make a profit , thus driving down the price of prime feeder calves to less than eighty cents per pound when the break-even for cow-calf operations is about $ 1.46 per pound ( say goodbye to beef , Alice . ) Or that we ca n't afford to feed our cows and calves supplemental grain ( corn ) . Or that the increased price of diesel and fertilizer prohibits us from fertilizing our fields or using tractors to maintain out farms and ranches . Or that etc , etc ... Like I said , the authors seem to be totally out of touch with the beef industry while it is seriously threatened.I suppose the next governmental action will be to prohibit the slaughtering of cattle like they have the slaughtering of horses . That little decree saddled ranchers with the cost of maintaining their horses until they die naturally instead of being able to sell them for dog food , etc . Of course , one can still ship horses to Mexico where they will be slaughtered in conditions unregulated by the omniscient Federal Government . Meanwhile we give billions of taxpayers ' money to bankers and Wall Street moguls to maintain their life styles . Sorry , I guess I went on a rant ... .Finally , I was surprised to see the large number of reviews on this book , particularly the high rating ones . I would not have thought the book would have generated much interest among people not involved in the cattle and dairy industries . There is a story to be told about cattle in history and at the present , but this book definitely is n't it.I recommend the reader pass on purchasing this book .	-1
Before purchasing this book , I read some of the mixed reviews on amazon.com , so I did n't have particularly high expectations going in . At the same time , I remained hopeful that there would be something of interest in this book . However , as I suspected , and as the reviewers already stated , this book was a little disappointing.Basically what the author does is spend the whole book trying to build a case as to why it could be possible that people will eventually have sex and develop relationships with robots . Chapter by chapter , he tries to assemble the different pieces of the argument : humans have relationships with pets ... humans have relationships with AI robots and computer simulations such as Tamagotchi , Furby , AIBO , and KISMET ... humans use machines ( e.g. , vibrators ) and sex dolls for sexual pleasure ... attitudes toward various sexual practices ( e.g. , masturbation , fornication , homosexuality ) have evolved over the years . Put it all together now : in the future , there 's a good chance people could develop relationships and have sex with robots , and we 'll be cool with that.As other reviewers already stated , he does not raise any ethical questions about whether this is a good idea or whether this is where the human race should really be headed . It seems that these types of questions were beyond the scope of this book . But even for what the book is , I kept waiting for it to get better , but it never really did.If you 're looking for better books about the interaction between humans and computers/robots , you 're better off reading `` Alone Together '' by Sherry Turkle or `` The Shallows '' by Nicholas Carr .	-1
I have been losing patience with Peter Robinson 's Inspector Banks series of late , and unfortunately , `` Bad Boy , '' the latest entry , was no exception . I thought the book started well , with an interesting set-up and some actual tension , but then somewhere along the way the storytelling slackened , and I stopped caring how things would turn out , particularly for Banks ' dim-witted daughter ( although there was never much doubt in that respect ) . Banks , as a character , is practically non-functioning , except for an odd 10 page expository section in which he regurgitates plot points that we , the reader , know from already having read the book . Perhaps Robinson felt the need to have Banks actually DO something , given that this is a Banks book ; whatever the reason , it 's redundant and unnecessary.To be fair , there was a nice surprise towards the end of the book , and I was heartened by Robinson 's return to a less complicated plot structure ( the last Banks novel was an unfortunate m & eacute ; lange of spies , international terrorism , murder mystery and romance ) . That said , I wish `` Bad Boy '' worked better than it does . As an entry in a series that has long been a favorite , it 's wholly insignificant .	-1
I believe the description of this book calls refers to it as a collection of science-fiction short stories , and was suprised and disappointed that mostly what the book contains are more what I would consider to be just dark fiction . While the book contains a pretty big selection of stories by quite a few award-winning authors , I just found the subject/content to be much darker than anything I was looking to read and did n't enjoy much of what I did . It was also my first exposure to Austrailian literature of this nature , which judging from some other reviews is typical . This particular genre is n't to my tastes but that does n't mean there are n't some good stories in it . I would just like to advise that the stories are all pretty dark and not to go into it expecting sweet little fairy tales !	-1
This book was just sad . Spencer is a good writer , and there are many wonderful rhetorical flourishes and sharp insights delivered in a couple swift images . But overall the book is a train wreck that takes too long to come and is never resolved . It 's like Spencer just got as tired of writing the book as I did of reading it , and stopped in the middle of the story . There 's nothing deep here , and certainly nothing profound about his venture into interracial romance and interracial politics . It was all quite obvious . Most disturbingly , the only characters that stayed `` in character '' for the entire book were the book 's protagonist , Daniel , and the caricatures : his parents , Hampton , his childhood friend the cop . The other main characters -- Iris , Kate , even the children , Nelson and Ruby -- slide in and out of their personalities , making it impossible to feel that they are real people . The theme of the book , like all of Spencer 's work that I 'm familiar with , is obsessive love , but here we do n't even get to see it happening to Daniel : we are told from the outset that he 's experiencing this THING , and that 's that . Weak .	-1
I love the supernatural tv series , though at times it can be a bit dark with the violence scenes . This is the second book from the supernatural book series , and surprisingly it 's even worst than the first one . At least in Witch Canyon the author did n't start making rather wild assumptions about the characters . I think anybody who watched the tv show knows Sam 's too much of a trauma character to start saying good things about their father unless it 's to make Dean feel better . The main female oc added in this book was too mary sue . The main guy oc Pym annoyed me especially . If you like the show do yourself a favor , do n't read any of the books . I also really hated the Roxy case and Manferd . Also the author used outside information involved in the tvshow that the characters themselves do n't know about . The author has Dean talk or think about the Reaper from when he was in the hospital , but after Dean wakes up he does n't remember anything from when he was sleeping . The author should have watched the tv show .	-1
When I purchased this book I thought I 'd be reading a love story . Wanting to hear about Natalie I read the whole book but found it to be crude and gossipy . I do n't recommend it .	-1
The most horrible ending to a story one has ever had the displeasure to read . The whole book was slow , but i stuck wth it hoping it would pick up . What a monumental waste of energy	-1
The beginning of this book should have made me stop reading , but I 'd brought it on a plane . Poison , with tragedy to follow . I found the book a mean-spirited look at humanity , and do n't care a whit whether it follows a Hamlet-like plot , it 's just plain wrong . Why had Claude spent `` too much time '' in small spaces to sleep indoors ? Was he in prison ? Perchance for murdering someone initially with his mysterious bottle of painless , non-detectable poison ? Why did Edgar return ? Let Claude get close ? How `` convenient '' was that hiding place for the `` juice '' ? Was there no media at all in this time period ( not ! ) so that Edgar 's savior would find out who he was ( maybe he 's the most incurious man in the world ? ) . Character development in this book was terrible , the Doctor sketched in as a mass of contradictions , humanitarian , but Claude 's friend -- or gulled by him -- but willing to sell out for money , greedy . And the father of the `` ox '' , dumbest son in history , writ large in size , but his father portrayed as if a small man , somewhat fragile perhaps ( implied , not said ) . The narrative falters at every turn , and I simply do n't understand why anyone would call this abomination a 'best seller . ' Maybe best 'sellout ' would be more accurate . I read to the end only because I forced myself , then threw the hand-me-down hard-cover in the trash . Heed the warnings in many of the other reviews . I almost did n't write this one , because there are so many others . But I felt compelled . One cheap trick after another , with a bad , bad ending .	-1
I really , really wanted to like this book . I kept waitng for it to get better , but it never did . Just when I thought it was making sense , it turned vague and colorless . I just did n't get it .	-1
I had expected a really good summer read . This is not it . I do n't know how this book got promoted the way it did . The Steven King rave made it sound irresistable . He even wants to reread it . Another thing , he had several editors working on this . What does it say about them ? This book is pondering and really a rough go . I am actually surprised that it got this far . I think it is all about promoting something . It is like going to a movie that a lot of money was spent promoting and then finding out it was not worth watching . I wonder how long it will take for word of mouth to catch up to this book . I ca n't imagine this book having a long shelf life on the best seller list . I expect I will later see it for sale marked down to $ 3.00 at the major book chains .	-1
Somewhat depressing . I expected a better ending and agree with an opinion piece that says Oprah over-looks more worthy books .	-1
Some aspects ok , but buy and large a disjointed mess . Ending was all over the place ... .author struggled with a conclusion . Very depressing storyline .	-1
*Note : this review contains spoilers , so if you 're dying to read this book -- though I wish you would n't -- do n't read on yet . *The breezy prose draws you in , and at times , this novel almost reaches a level of insight about being a sexual assault victim . In retrospect , the `` almost '' makes sense , because the big twist is that , surprise , the alleged victim is really just a delusional liar . I can not think of a more destructive message , especially since `` You lie , or at least are remembering wrong ! You wanted it ! '' is already the overwhelming response to survivors who come forward . I shudder to think of readers who *are* in the YA range and do n't know enough about rape culture to not internalize the promotion of the shut-up-because-you-probably-weren't-REALLY-violated trope.Nearly as horribly , Touch sets up a yes/no paradigm in which an `` Okay '' means there is no fault , regardless of the bullying and coercion that can ( and DID ) go on . No , the only enemy in this story is ... the feminist ( natch ! ) stepmom , who , apparently through a Jedi mind trick , forced the protagonist to make up these silly stories for her own evil , women's-rights agenda.And if you 're reading this and are angry , having enjoyed Touch 's readability , please do n't respond with , `` This is just one story of one girl ; Prose is n't saying ALL victims are just liars ! '' The fact is , this is NOT just one story of one girl ; it 's one well-promoted , eye-catching , deceptively sexily packaged offering amongst the very paltry collection of YA books which dare to discuss sexual abuse ... and the victim is a delusional liar . It 's also one dangerous , antifeminist mess .	-1
[ ... ] Touch had a very edgy and gripping premise that really made me want to pick it up and read it . However , I find this totally irrelevant as I felt the actual story carried it out very inadequately , failing to meet it 's potential.Maisie , though she could at times be funny , was not a very likable character and I felt totally detached from her and her story . I hated the fact that she did n't try to take more control over her life and what was happening to her . And yes , her step mom was a pain , but she still could have tried to make things work between the two of them a little better . Also , the way she kept changing her story was annoying . I can understand how at first she wanted to say nothing happened . What I did n't understand was why she did n't just tell the truth after that . She only caused herself a whole lot more trouble by lying and making things out to be worse than they were . Another thing , why did she just let the guys touch her like that when she knew she did n't like it ? She did n't even bother saying no . Maisie should have had more respect for herself than that and as a result , I found it hard to feel any kind of sympathy towards her.I feel the story would have been a lot more believable if the three guys had n't been her best friends . Maybe it is just me but it seems hard to believe that four kids would grow up together , having always been best friends , and then as soon as the girl of the group grows boobs , things change SO dramatically . I can understand her and Shakes getting kind of romantic , I actually liked that . However the whole part of where her other two guy 'best friends ' get jealous , grab and fondle her boobs while Shakes sits by and does nothing , and then spread nasty rumors about her is so unrealistic . Not saying it could never happen , because after all , stranger things have . I 'm just saying that it seems so forced and very improbable . Touch did atleast have a good overall message about lying , why some people do it , and what happens as a result.Then there were the flashbacks . At times I felt like I 'd read the same thing three times because of them , being more disruptive than anything . And speaking of disruptive , the poor syntax and numerous typos made this book even harder to get into . I am fully aware that the copy I read was an ARC , however it read more like a rough draft then something that was only one step away from being a finished copy.In my honest opinion , the ending was the redeeming quality of this book for two reasons . One , because I actually liked the overall ending , including the fact that Maisie finally realized and told the truth . And two , for lack of a better way of phrasing it , because it was over and I could move onto something else.So as you 've probably already figured out , this is not a book I liked or will be re-reading . Would I recommend it ? Uh , no . If Touch had been written for me I would say it was a waste of time and paper . However , it was n't written for me and so long as there is atleast one person out there who enjoys Touch , or any other book , it was anything BUT a waste.So it was n't for me but who knows , maybe you 'll be one of the people who likes it .	-1
The heroine is ridiculous and I have no sympathy for her or the mess she makes for herself by oversharing online and having no respect for others ' privacy . I have enjoyed many other books by this author but had to stop 3/4 of the way through this one , I was too annoyed .	-1
I too have bipolar disorder , and was disappointed by this book . It was really hard to follow . I ended it feeling helpless and panicky . I found it very triggering .	-1
They might have produced this gobbler , but it 's hard to believe that Russell Banks did . Boy , I wish I had read the Amazon reviews of `` The Reserve '' before I picked it up at my neighborhood bookstore . On reflection , even the cover illustration and descriptive notes are hokey and completely misleading.I kept thinking that this novel of cardboard characters , acting out some kind of mini class war in the mid-1930s , would take a turn for the better , as it was written by the usually terrific Russell Banks . Well , it just does n't happen that way . The melodrama and series of romantic cliches just keep rolling until the author appears to have run out of steam and just stopped writing.The best parts of the book ( where John McPhee might have come in ) are the descriptions of the Adirondack landscapes that were , at times , pretty good . Otherwise , this is just a misfire that is hopefully a rare mistake by a really good novelist .	-1
Wow , is this book a poor introduction to Russell Banks . I 've never read anything by him before , though I tried in vain several times to borrow Cloudsplitter from my local library ( it was always out on loan . ) I had heard that Banks was a master novelist , a major literary figure of our time , in the same pantheon as Hemingway and Fitzgerald . Well , if Hemingway had written scripts for Ed Wood and Fitzgerald for Carmen Miranda , I could believe that to be so.This book is so trite , the dialogue so stilted , and the adjectives at once incredibly numerous and entirely predictable , that the result is a feeling not unlike eating three Big Macs . The main characters are cut from stock : a ca-raaaazy socialite whose mama and papa are filthy rich ; a predictably handsome , womanizing , left-leaning , `` square-handed and broad-shouldered '' artist who flies biplanes for fun ; and a backwoodsman who 's as honest as he is stupid . Oh , and he 's handsome , too , and virile as all get out . If this sounds like the makings of a good novel , then push aside the Harlequin Romances and buy this book . In fact , some readers like a predictable , trite book now and then , and I do n't deny I occasionally pick up old books by unknown authors just to see what amused people 100 years ago . If you 're looking for the modern equivalent , in literary merit , of Trail of the Lonesome Pine , this might be your book . If , however , you expect more from a writer with the reputation of Banks , skip this .	-1
`` This Book is Overdue ! '' is a paean , sprinkled with doses of humor , that does n't do much to either educate or entertain . The ugly truth is that librarians have largely become replaceable by computers , especially the Internet . Researching a topic or finding a book is much , much easier today than when tomes such as the 'Index of Periodicals ' were like gold . Patrons can also easily reserve books and check availability without leaving home . Librarians today mainly occupy their time responding to people too lazy to look things up themselves on the numerous terminals available in any library ; worse , instead of reinforcing the ease of doing it themselves , the librarians reinforce their bad habits and still do the research for them.As for cataloging , that 's contracted out . I often receive new books for review and have offered them to my local library before the even had a copy - they refused , saying they already had a contract to buy and catalog all their books and my donations did n't fit in ! As for book checkout - it 's 'do it yourself ' now ; late-return fine warnings and fees are handled by other computers . All those 'information-hungry ' patrons on library terminals - they 're mostly doing email , romance searches , or playing Internet games , and do n't need any help . So , let 's break up the gaggles of gossiping gazetteer etc . guardians , reduce the number of librarians across the nation , and use the savings to buy more books and pay their outside contractor to catalog free donations .	-1
I had never read any of this author 's previous books or I might not have been so lost in reading this one . Every book should be able to stand alone though even if it is part of a series . That is how you gain new readers after all . I got this book because it sounded something like Carl Hiassen 's books in write up . They are nothing alike . I was lost from page one and stayed lost the rest of the way . It is mostly dialogue and usually I would be all for that but sometimes a description comes in handy . The characters jumped from spot to spot and then other characters were introduced and they were jumping all over the place too . I felt like I had traveled through a time tunnel and landed in a Cheech and Chong movie . Everyone in book either seemed to be stoned out of their head ( personally I think you would have to be stoned to even understand the language ) or drunk . I had trouble figuring out plot because the characters rambled so much ( like they were out of their head ) . Their language is deplorable . If you deleted all the foul language there would n't be any dialogue ( that would be a plus in my opinion ) . I thought this book might be more for men only so asked my husband to read it also since he loves Elmore Leonard , Carl Hiassen , etc type books . He hated it too . From page one I felt like I had wondered into a room where a conversation was already in progress and I never figured out what was going on . If I had liked the characters , I might not have found it so boring , but they all seemed like total losers and druggies . If you have been a fan of this series from the first book though , you might like it . But , hey , read the book for yourself . I 'd be happy to be proven wrong on this because I absolutely hate doing a bad review . If you read it and loved it , then review it so my review will get swallowed up in all the good reviews . If I could think of one good thing to say about it , I would do so . I read a book a day but I wo n't be reading any more by this author , that is for sure .	-1
I hate this book.I 've waited months for a new discworld novel . I want to know if Carrot is ever crowned king , if Moist marries Miss Dearheart , what new title the Patrician will burden Sam Vimes with , and how Tiffany will cope with the Baron 's son when she becomes the witch of the chalk.Instead , pseudo-historical philosphy . Fhew.In addition to being a disappointment because it is n't a discworld book , this book is just plain hard to read . I could n't find anything to make me like the characters enough to care what happened to them . Oh , another discourse on Darwin ? yawwwwwn . Gods real or not real ? yawwwwwwn . Could we have more plot , less philosphy , please ? I understand that Terry Pratchett has been diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer 's Disease . Is that the explanation for this book ?	-1
This should have been called The Gaudi Code , as it is a clone of the famous Dan Brown ( e ? ) bestseller . If you want to know more about Gaudi , but are too lazy to study real literature about him , of if you enjoy endless riddles that can only be solved by the protagonists , this may be for you , though the storyline is predictable and lacks credibility . For me it lost all attraction when the puzzles could only be solved if the two heroes confessed their never-ending love for each other .	-1
Someone else who gave this book only two stars nailed it right on the head . This book is n't remotely close to being a guide to anything except the biggest names in the fashion and beauty industries . Even more disturbing was the fact that every store or business mentioned is prominent in either Paris , Rome , Milan , or New York . Merest mentions of L.A. and no mentions whatsoever of Chicago ( which , while not a fashion mecca like the other cities , being the 3rd largest in the USA you 'd think would warrant at least an `` honorable '' mention or something ) . If you 're someone who recently won the lotto or inherited a hill of cash and wants to know how to spend it , by all means , purchase this book . Otherwise , do n't bother.PS -- I would n't have bothered to purchase the book at all except I could n't open it without removing the shrink wrap used to protect the flocking on the front .	-1
I love the idea of using Godron Ramsey recipes in real life . But here is the big issue with the book : the recipes are so complex and call for outrageous amount of ingredients . If you are not a professional cook and do not cook on a regular basis - you will be lost .	-1
I was very disappointed with this book . Speed reading people ? It was simplistic and if you think about it , common knowledge . I took speed reading people to mean apparently much more than what was presented . The book has a chapter on detecting deception - it elaborates on spotting nonverbal cues that someone is uncomfortable - thus , possibly lying . What is presented is simplistic and obvious . This book is disappointing and a waste of money . The only benefit I can see from it : it is ideal for someone who has had limited interaction with other people . For example , someone who has cut himself off from human contact from childhood into adulthood .	-1
I was very excited to get this book when it came out since I am a big fan of Dot Benton Frank 's work . While this story does invoke the beautiful images of South Carolina coastal life - the charm of many of Dot 's other books is missing . I could not wrap myself around much of the reasons behind the plot of the young southern girl fleeing her home town and everyone she loved . It seemed rather two dimensional to me . It also seemed far fetched that the secret she left town with would not have been revealed to her loved ones much sooner . I did n't relate to this character or cheer her on or feel particularly sorry for her either . This is a very different reaction I had from my sentiments towards most of Dot 's other main characters . I do look forward to reading more of Dot 's books but I hope that the plots do n't seem as forced as this one did to me .	-1
Thanks to the title , I picked this one up for a laugh . I wish I had n't . After 191 pages I could n't stand another pointless moment of it . I had suffered enough already.Acevedo 's writing is too bad to even be considered ridiculous - I 'm surprised he even managed to find a publisher .	-1
Chopra is adding to the Bible in this book and will receive judgment by God one day for his lies and deceptions . The contents of this book are not in the Bible and Chopra is teaching another Jesus . Chopra does not like the Biblical Jesus but likes his own Jesus whom is not the one in the Bible .	-1
Ah yes . Another late Victorian cit heroine who refuses to marry her member-of-the-nobility swain ( who proposes to her after a night of hot sex ) because he tells her she has to stop making sponge cakes in her corner pastry business in order to become his Marchoness . His marriage offer becomes yet another of those oppressive masculine power plays that the heroine has to righteously fume about for a whole chapter . Yeah , I bet this happened all the time in 1890s London.The genre 's historical romance , Ms. Guhrke . A woman in 1890s London ( or 1890s Outer Mongolia for that matter ) would have jumped at the man 's offer , especially because ( so you tell us ) she 's wildly in love with him . If you think woman should n't give up their careers when they marry fine , write a novel about it , but set it in a time when the concept does n't come off as preposterous.Oh , and spare us the PC `` teachable moments . '' Write a story that entrances , enthralls and moves us -- and not to disdain .	-1
I 'm utterly disappointed . I ca n't believe how ruined this book is because of its rushed ending . It left EVERYTHING to be desired and even a tad more ! I seriouly doubt that the book has been entirely penned by LLG since she proved big times that she is capable of much , much better than this *mistake* . The story had potential but somehow got crashed in the process of recreating the proud attitude of Mr. Darcy . Big , big faux pas , IMHO.I give this book two stars and for the solely reason that I 'm a major LLG fan and am very confident that her next work will make up for this one that in my eyes is *incomplete* . Never before has a book left me so frustrated and kind of angry . : (	-1
the book meant well but , it was a lot of double talk , a book should be enjoyable and put together with other people in mind meaning the people that took an interest in the subject author was trying to convey .	-1
I 've never read a Zukav book before , and after suffering through this one , it 's likely I wo n't pick up his books again . Zukav 's book on spiritual partnerships and becoming multi-sensory is just poorly written and lacking in depth . I found the book so unappetizing that my eyes just did n't want to stay on the page . He basically takes you through territory others have traveled more skillfully ( like Caroline Myss ) and more elegantly . Zukav tends to write in generalities and never explains his concepts at all -- he just assumes you know what he 's talking about . And if you did , then why waste your time on this trite little book ? In other words , you learn very little about a true spiritual path . Zukav will no doubt delight those who have yet to read spiritual writings with any rigor or depth . For me , this is a book that did not need publishing , much less take up a few hours of my time . My spiritual partnership with Gary Zukav is now officially OVER !	-1
Time to retire . I have long been a fan of Raymond Feist , but when a series is dead . It is dead . This series lives on its characters now , not on any plot device , or story , or interaction between plot lines , for all basic plots are now the same.The last series the characters defeat the worst evil imaginable that threatens them in the worst horrific way , and then a new series starts linking the characters together again . This time the evil is worse than the previous evil and it will result in the same total eradication of all life.That device is now done to death again . ( SPOILER ) But this time he at least kills some primary characters . The problem I have here is the is main hero has become virtually immortal because Pug , the magician , remains in all the books . That takes us away from something that Feist is good at , developing new characters . But what he also needs to do is develop a new world.Then he runs into the problem of having all characters together at once . Ever have a party in your living room ? Does everyone stop talking and just listen to one speak ? Usually it is small groups of conversation , but for Feist he does not really capture how to relate this , often bringing all the characters together and then we have the repetition of information since characters he has arrive at different times . Soon we have hear the characters tale so many times that we jump ahead since why waste the effort to read it again.Then should other characters arrive just after that one has told his tale , well a case in point , Pug has some of the new good guys together when his old friends Tomas shows up . We already know why he is showing up , and Pug and others have eaten lunch , but we waste a few moments as Pug offers Tomas and his companion a meal . Did we need that ? Does it add to the book or again slow us up.Feist may be well sold in the field after all these years , assigned to an editor that just rubber stamps his work . But this is really getting sad.When will the next generation take over ? When will we have just a regular evil that is hard enough to deal with like a war between nations , rather than something that is going to once again eradicate all life on Midkemia unless the Superheroes of the Planet ( His Conclave of Shadows ) rides forth once more.Unless you are a dies hard fan of all things Midkemia , read a snyopsis . There is less than 100 pages of entertaining material here , the rest is just a rehash of his warm fuzzy friendships that a reread of Magician will be much better use of your time .	-1
When Raymond Feist wrote the Riftwar Saga in the 1980s it became an instant classic and established Feist as a modern fantasy master . Feist has dabbled in an out of his Midkemia world over the years but with the release of `` Rides a Dread Legion '' , the first book of the Demon War Saga , it promised a return to that world and Feist 's greatest character , the master wizard , Pug . While the series got off to a solid start with the first book it all comes tumbling down in book two.Feist seems to have put very little effort into book two of the series , taking the approach of throwing as much against the wall as possible to see what sticks . There are so many characters , so many factions , so many plots that even long time Midkemia fans will be confused . When you add in all of these diverse elements to a book that is ONLY 302 pages long you know you 're in trouble . And this is n't even a `` packed '' 302 pages . Just the opposite , in fact ; the book is printed in a large than usual typeface . I compared it to a juvenile fantasy book I had nearby and the typeface was the same size . Here 's the difference : while that book ( also a hardcover ) is $ 9.95 , this one is almost three times as much at $ 27.99 . Ouch ! There 's little character development so if you 're not coming into the series with a familiarity with Midkemia you 'll likely find yourself lost.As to the story , after the destruction caused by the invading demon hordes , Pug has rallied the troops as it were , including his surviving son , Magnus , two renegade Star Elves , the necromancer Amirantha , a roguish spy name Jim Dasher , and Sandreena ( think female Paladin ) . Together they have allied with the Conclave of Shadows to try to stop the legions of demons that are led by Dahun and the mad wizard Belasco . Belasco is about the only interesting character in this story and that 's only because he is VERY evil and completely nuts , making him unpredictable . In the first book , Feist spends a lot of time on the Star Elves who fled their world to escape the demon hordes . They settled in Midkemia but their fate is basically forgotten about in book two.At best you have to say that Feist was just `` off '' on this book . At worst it was a lazy and over-priced story . Keep delivering books like this and Feist 's books will be coming out in mass-market first .	-1
I was intrigued by the topic , impressed by the writer 's credentials ( Professor of History at Baylor university ) , and duped by the 4star average rating . While the book includes many interesting tidbits , the writing meanders horridly without clear destinations , jumping forward and backward historically , geographically , and thematically . As a member of academia , the author 's shortage of documentation and was nearly criminal . Far too many statistics and historic claims were offered without references . Chapters three and four were well written . The rest was a mess , but worth trudging through for interesting historical nuggets every here and there .	-1
The same over and over..not a great read . Purchased one for my friend and myself . Should hav eread more on the reveiws	-1
Mr. Kreidler opens his book with a six page description of a home run . This is worthy of comment in itself . Anyone can describe a home run in one page , or even a single sentence , but to be able to devote six pages to it is an accomplishment to be admired . Unfortunately , the rest of the book does not live up to this early promise . Problems are apparent from the beginning . The sentence structure is difficult at times . Some are almost magical but others leave you reading and re-reading , trying to make out who is the subject of the sentence , or what , exactly , is taking place on the field . Who is doing what to whom ? Baseball is an easy thing to love . It is in our blood from the time we are little . If Major League Baseball has become jaded and bloated on its riches , and shown disdain for what is sacred , Little League Baseball is untarnished , without taint and innocent of the sins of its bigger brother . But Mr. Kreidler somehow manages to make the game uninteresting and the youngsters who accomplished so much , unsympathetic . I found it hard to care , as I read , what happened . There is no magic in this account , and there should be.I suppose my expectations were unrealistic . I looked for the poetry of Bull Durham or The Natural . If you look for the same , you will not find it here . This is more of a wordy newspaper article than the work of near-poetry the subject deserves . I hope you will get more out of it than I did .	-1
This text is so foreign that it is hard to read . The story line is extremely abstract and based on a fictional language from a fictional world , that is very difficult to decipher , despite the deliberate attempts to define the terms . Actually I gave up reading it because there did n't seem to be a story line . Not to my taste at all , I will try reading it again over Christmas break and see if I am missing something , but the incredibly technically dense and obscure style is very hard to dig into and the characters are very difficult to get at all attached to .	-1
This is the first time I 've read a book by this author . If this is any indication of the rest of her books I think I 'll pass . The characters went back and forth over the same issue throughout the entire BOOK it was so annoying . I think so much more could have been done with this storyline .	-1
This story had a great beginning . It had a great idea of a story . It had the promise of some really likeable characters but the writing never was there to pull it off . There were story inconsistencies , misunderstood phrases leaving me confused over who knows what . The heroine was over done a bit . I really wish the writing would have been close to readable .	-1
Started out to be really promising and I wondered which direction the author would take the widow.About just over half way through I started to get bored , and by the last page I was very disappointed .	-1
I almost could n't even bring myself to give this book a review . It 's not that I totally disliked it , but it definitely falls short . How do you go from Bridgertons to such an unremarkable , poorly titled book ? It 's not like it was running too long and she could n't fit more of a detailed back story for these characters . If you have n't read a Julia Quinn story before , do n't start here .	-1
Hard to believe this is the same writer who wrote `` Wonder Boys '' and `` Summerland '' . The characters are dull and the plot non-existent . The lead character , Archie , is not likeable and his wife , Gwen , is even worse . She is a midwife who has a huge chip on her shoulder and complains about how doctors do n't respect her craft , after more than one trip to an emergency room when her 'patient ' nearly dies during childbirth . ( Note : Women and babies die not infrequently during childbirth and not all doctors want to perform a C-section to make money . Mostly they perform C-sections to save a woman and child 's life , those horrible money-grubbers . ) There are also a lot of commments about how easy all white people have it , cuz the world just hands us everything on a platter , right ? Gwen complains that white women only have to kiss up to The Man if they feel like it , while black women have to do it all the time . News to me , but I guess I should start mouthing off to my boss and see how that goes.There is a long cast of characters , none of them interesting in the slightest and the story dragged on and on , to no point.I gave up after three chapters.Someone needs to tell this writer that everyone word he puts on paper is not precious , as he has really lost his way .	-1
I very much enjoyed `` Kavalier & Clay '' , so I was very surprised that I hated everything about this book . The plot ( s ) seemed confused and sometimes petty . The characters do n't seem real to me . I guess most of the characters are supposed to be black , but it seems to me that in order to be politically correct the author never makes the characters ' various races clear . I think that before ordering the book I read a review that questioned Chabon 's credibility with respect to writing about black characters - and I would agree with that observation . I just did n't like anything about this boring , petty book . After reading about 100 pages - I gave the book to Goodwill .	-1
Chabon is , hands down , my favorite author . But Michael , where is the audacious courage behind writing Kavalier and Clay ? How about the Yiddish Policeman 's Union ? How about the national pastime treasure of Summerland ? Those were all beautiful and daring stories . I could not find the same in Telegraph Avenue . Perhaps it is an homage to his adopted home town but I hope the next one ranges back out into the wider worlds and beyond .	-1
Every Michael Chabon book I have loved . So i anxiously awaited this newest one . However I was terribly disappointed with this book . The plot develops very slowly , and he seems to be writing words for the sake of words . One sentence went on for over ten pages . Just had trouble liking this particular work of Chabon 's .	-1
I wanted to love this book but it just did n't do it for me . I just found it hard to relate to the characters or the culture of the book . I actually could n't even end up finishing it . The premise seems good and I usually like books that explore different cultures , but for some reason I just could not get into this book .	-1
I liked the concept of a story from the dog 's point of view . However , this guy had more than his share of bad luck .	-1
I had a hard time getting into this book . It felt like it dragged at some parts , and I did n't really like the main character . The writers version of vampires is quite different then what is written about today . They are very violent and only think about killing people and their own kind . They do have small feelings of love but very rarely , I was looking for more romance . It is a very action packed novel so it kept me on the edge of my seat , it just did n't have enough romance for me .	-1
Luckily this was a library book . I would not have been happy if I had paid good money for it . Does Ms. Oats know that it is Americans that buy her books ? Or do n't , as the case may be .	-1
At first glance after briefly skimming through 'Brocabulary ' it seemed like it might have potential to be a fun read . After further reading deeper into the book I realized that this was nothing more than some immature goofball 's thinking he 's a tough guy . Now , not to get off on the wrong foot , I 'm a very liberal minded person & have a great sense of humor . I not the kind of person to get turned off from a conversaion/movie/book just because some choice language is thrown around . In fact I hate those overly preachy people who just want the world to board itself up duct tape everyone 's eyes , mouths & ears closed . This book however is just plain dumb though , not only that but degrading & offensive as well . The book list 's terms & definition 's that I really ca n't imagine anyone under the age of maybe 10 would even use . The other stuff is just re-used garbage that was funny & talked about a decade ago . You 'll basically wind up reading through this book & hate yourself afterwards for precious braincells waisted just to get down to this schmuck 's level of intelligence . Seriously , the author of this book is probably one of those greasy , nerdy guys who tries to pick-up 16 & 17 year old little girls because no women his own age will give him the time of day & only having friends on one of those weird cyber life simulators . I 'm sure we 'll see him pop up on Dateline 's next 'To Catch A Predator ' if we have n't already . Without further ado , here are a couple of examples taken from various chapter 's of the book just to make sure you realize how horrible this book really is.Chapter 1 - `` Brommunication '' '' Guynamic - The dynamic between bros '' Chapter 2 - `` Barticulation '' '' Gramouflage - Something used to camouflage a gram of coke '' Chapter 3 - `` Player Palaver '' '' Drillosophy - A philosophy about drilling chicks '' ( Had enough yet ? I know I have ) Chapter 4 - `` Banguage '' '' Doorizontal - Doing it up against a door '' Chapter 5 - Hocabulary '' '' Crampage - A rampage brought on by PMS cramps '' Okay , that 's about all I can stand of this goobery turd . This Daniel Maurer is just a complete waste of a human being & a great dis-credit to the whole male sex in general . Bottom line is , I 'm a guy that 's had great success with women & am married now , but I 'll tell it to ya straight all anything is this book is gon na do is get you laughed at . Anyway , this book was given to me & even as a free read the only thing it 'll be good for is starting a fire . My best advise would be to burn this book & just end the author 's career now before he has the oportunity to dumb down any other readers . DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ! ! ! ! !	-1
Prepared to receive an honest overview of what went wrong with our system was my first mistake in purchasing this travesty . Dick Morris is no different in print than he is when spouting regurgertated rhetoric on tv . If he intended on proving that many years in Washington and `` supposedly '' good judgement does not a President make ; than he did just that . On the other hand , if he wanted to make a point that less than two years in Washington does not a president make , he did that too . So , after reading this I 'm back to square one . Do I want to go with experience ; which led us into this mess or do I want to chance on something new ? I 'll take the new . I 've had it with so-called experience . Right now I 'm experiencing paying too much at the gas station and too much for this book !	-1
After reading this , extreme disappointment.No need to rethink heaven , hell , Gospel , Judgment , Salvation from God 's Wrath , Resurrection , Great Commission , Restoration of Davidic Monarchy by His Majesty King Jesus the First.Desperate need on part of author to re-read the Bible with a new optometrist : The Holy Spirit and a Large Print Version.Sola Scriptura Satis : Scripture alone is sufficient without baggage of rabbinic 1st century judaism scholarship informed by 21st century revisionism.Please examine Peter 's and Paul 's sermons in Acts carefully to refute all the author 's premises and departures from Biblical Gospel.PICO - Preclusions In Conclusions Out .	-1
I ran across this series two weeks ago , and began reading it then . I found the first book to be entertaining , and a fast read as it was hard to put down . I immediately read the second book after finishing the first , and then read the new book as soon as it came out this week.Since I 've read all three over a short period of time , all are fresh in my memory . The third is not as good as the first two , in my opinion . I did n't like the ending and the origin story was weak . Also , one thing I did n't like about any of the books is that it seemed like a zombie novel as much as a vampire novel in some respects . The mass infections and the apocalyptic spread of vampirism seemed more like something you would see in `` The Walking Dead '' or `` I Am Legend '' than in a story about vampires . I 'm not a fan of zombies , so it was disappointing to me to see this angle in a horror novel.The series reads almost like it could be the basis for a script for an action/horror film , which del Toro is known for . That is what the prospective reader should keep in mind . There is lots of action and that keeps the plot moving . But the plot is superficial . Do n't expect any deep thoughts here , again just like the typical action film.This is decent but there are better books out there . If you want action with some horror mixed in , go watch one of the films in the Blade series . If you want a good book , look elsewhere .	-1
I enjoy following archaelogy and classical Greece and Rome and picked up this book expecting to be enthralled . What a disappointment ! While the blurbs make it sound like a true-life thriller , it reads more like an unedited and overlong article in Archaelogy magazine . Slow , boring , and more than a little confusing , this book does n't live up to the blurb.Pick up something like `` In Search of Troy '' instead for a true classic of the genre .	-1
The police procedural is an established genre . Many authors have created notable police procedurals , including Ed McBain and Michael Connelly . Alafair Burke brings a female sensibility and protagonist into this genre , one largely populated by men . Her Ellie Hatcher fights to make it in what has been a man 's world . And she 's quite the fighter._212_ , Burke 's third novel , finds Hatcher wrapped up in a case of a bodyguard found naked and dead in the bed of a wealthy Donald Trump clone . The murder intersects with the online stalking of a college coed , leads to multiple bodies piling up around NYC , and descends into the sex trade.That 's about all you should know . Unfortunately for _212_ , that 's all there is.Where _212_ exists in the realm of police procedurals is strictly low in the middle of the pack.PROS : * Burke can carry a story . Her writing skills are above average . ( Her father is crime novelist James Lee Burke , a nice writing pedigree to have . ) * A Stanford Law grad , Burke served in Oregon as an assistant district attorney , so she brings insider info to her writing . * Burke bases her writing on real cases , which provides an element of `` ripped from the headlines '' immediacy to her books.CONS : * _212_ suffers from meandering . It 's not as straight ahead as other police procedurals , and there 's a sense as if it 's a step or two away from falling to pieces because the internal structure is weak and out of balance . * That basis on real-life cases makes it feel like a bad episode of another piece of fiction that often tried to track reality , _Law & Order_ . The novel 's source cases are not startling enough to warrant becoming the bases for this novel , and one wonders if Burke could have dreamed up a more compelling story without referencing such tired real life sources . * Dull ? Oh , yes . This novel was only interesting as long as the Internet stalking continued . Once that line went dead , so did the excitement in the novel . Readers will feel as if they have read this book before -- MANY times before . * For what it is , _212_ is WAAAAAAY too long . * While something resembling characterization showed up in the novel , there was n't enough to be notable . Everyone is a type , not a living , breathing person . You would expect a female author writing a police procedural to give us more of a look at characters ' inner lives . If anything , Burke gives us less . * Readers will start making accurate guesses as to where the novel is going far too early on . That Burke does not deviate from or add to those guesses makes the inevitability of this novel a crime . Nothing surprises except how unsurprising it all is . * The author leaves her authorly fingerprints all over the novel , with clumsy reader manipulations piling up everywhere . Some plot points are so strained or developed so late in the book they become deus ex machina stumblings that beg for disbelief . Worse , if an author is going to descend into deus ex machina , at least make the manipulations intriguing and give the reader a twist or two . That Burke 's machinations are boring and exist only to tie up plot points , and clumsily at that , leaves the reader stunned at the hamhandedness of it all.In short , _212_ filled this reader with regret for picking it up . Completely unoriginal , it told the old , old story and did nothing new with it . If Burke had written it in 1930 and not 2010 , it STILL would have been old news for the day.As it is , _212_ accomplished one task : It gave me ample reason to cross Alafair Burke off my reading list .	-1
I found this series seriously depressing . This 3rd book just cemented that feeling . I hate to slam Hobb for being too realistic in her writing ( especially since this is about DRAGONS ) but this ( and her other books in this series ) is just depressing and not what I am looking for in fantasy.I thought the Liveship Trader series was great . Ditto for the first 3 in the Farseer series and first 2 in the Fool series . However , this one , like the Soldier Son trilogy just bummed me out . Other than the sections which deal are written from the perspective of the dragons , this series really was n't worth the time . And the dragon 's perspectives are depressing , too , but so well-written I just could n't resist them.Anyhow , I do n't want to say much and spoil things , but I do want to say that I did n't get any joy from reading this book .	-1
I 've loved Francesca Lia Block 's books since junior high . There 's something so magical about them ... sometimes , when I ca n't sleep , I 'll pick up one of my old favorites and read through it until I drift off . But , much to my dismay , I have n't loved any of her more recent offerings.Pink Smog is a bit better than some of Block 's other newer books , like The Frenzy and Pretty Dead , but they still fell short of her earlier works . I ca n't say for sure , but often wonder if I 'd like them better if I was n't so attached to the original Weetzie Bat books and others , like Echo , Wasteland , and I Was a Teenage Fairy . The only way I can describe my attitude towards these newer books is in terms of an individual who 's a huge fan of a band for years , but is hugely disappointed when the band releases a new album and it has a completely different sound that ever before.Basically , I ca n't say whether Pink Smog , itself , is good or bad ... all I know is that it is n't as wonderful and fantastical as the Weetzie books I know and love .	-1
I bought this book thinking this would be like Water for Elephants . So its my own fault for purchasing this with preconcieved notions . I made it about a third of the way through the book . I just could not get into the story line . I became bored and then found myself starting to skim . Once I did that I decided not to finish the book .	-1
Way too predictable for my taste . It was ok , but I was definitely disappointed after reading such great reviews about the `` twist . '' Glad this book is `` gone '' from my Kindle . It wo n't be long till it 's `` forgotten '' from my mind as well .	-1
I have been reading a lot of novels and history and found the book most interesting.I can not recommend this book nor will I read others by this author because of the Author cursing the Lord with all his characters . It seems ironic that there are many good thoughts and questions as to which sides of battle that the Lord is on and in the same breath the Author Curses the Lord.Obvioulsy he lives and thinks like this also . Its time that he grows up makes Peace with God.Maybe he is struggling and this is his way showing it.I would recommend that the try to draw closer to the Light than to dwell in eternal darkness .	-1
Not sure why this book is on so many best lists . It is sure to be a better movie . I could n't stand any of the people , even though I sympathized with the children . Would like to discuss with someone who liked it , but have n't found anyone yet .	-1
25 short stories written by Lawrence Block when he was around 20 years old are the backbone of this book , they were written in one sitting so are referred to by the author as `` one night stands . '' Most of these have an almost high school feel to them an are less than entertaining . Three approximate 50 page stories are included , one is good , one is fair and one is not so good . Block developed into a powerhouse however this should be for his most hard core fans only , seek out `` The Mammoth Book of Private Eye Stories '' instead .	-1
I had expected this to be a relatively fast-paced & # 34 ; swords and sandals & # 34 ; story in the class of Cornwell , Turney , Scarrow , and Peake . Instead , it is a rather slow moving story with , for me , too much detail regarding clothing , surroundings and other non-essential things . By the time I had finished reading the description of the garden I had forgotten why the character was there in the first place . It is perhaps a good depiction of the life and surroundings of ancient Rome , and in the future the characters will surely be developed in more detail , but it did n't move fast enough to make me want to stick with it . This is one of the very few books I did not finish .	-1
This book was very different from what I expected which is n't , in itself , a bad thing . It is well-written and has good characters but I just could n't seem to get into it .	-1
I actually never finished this ... not just because of the amazing differences between the first two books and this one , but because of what the series reminds me of.Here 's my main fault with the series . And if this was on purpose then i apologize and i will finish the series : While i was in the middle of reading the book a friend of mine mentioned shows she used to watch when she was younger , one of the shows mentioned just happened to be Buffy the vampire slayer . I happened to be reading a part of the book when she spoke . The scene was some type of departing moment between Cat and Bones.Now me i immediately stopped reading once i noticed the similarities . I got severely annoyed once i realized Bones = Spike . So i could n't get myself to finish.I would n't say not to read the book ... Someone else might be able to tolerate it . I just could n't .	-1
I loved the premise of the book - research what scientists , spiritual leaders , philosopher 's , etc . have to say about happiness , and then put these insights into action over the course of 12 months and see to what extent your life is better . Cool ! The problem is Gretchen Rubin and more specifically the cushy pedestal from which she writes . She 's obviously quite smart , has made some good decisions in life , and perhaps is even a decent human being . But the fact is , her life is nothing like 99.9 % of ours ; our spouses do n't have millions of dollars , we ca n't just quit are jobs to `` be ourselves '' , and we do n't have hours of leisure time per day to experiment with what makes us happy . She is an anomaly - and good for her ! The problem is to write a happiness guide for the masses from this pedestal is not just oblivious but downright offensive .	-1
The title sounded promising but I soon realized that the content would only be interesting to the 20 to 40year old group . I would recommend this book for only those under age 40 . If you do n't know how to be happy by that time , you never will and you certainly do n't need this book !	-1
Blah , blah , blah . . . twice this book has made it into my home -- once from our public library by my choosing -- another time from a friend whom thought that I might find it interesting . . . . When resolutions need this much explanation , it is no wonder that so many individuals find it difficult to follow them throughout the year . . . . I 'll just write my own and follow them -- and never burden a friend or anyone else with this waste of trees .	-1
Called it quits on this one 150 pages in . I gave it a long rope because I more or less enjoyed the first book of this series , & # 34 ; The Breach & # 34 ; . The author no doubt has a flare for the sci-fi , thriller genre - he 's an expert at creating the hook at the end of chapters , pushing you to continue . I think those looking for a fast-paced , no frills good time will get into this one easily . It 's a bit of a guilty pleasure in that way , sort of the book equivalent to a Duane Johnson film.For me , this one just felt too empty to invest any more time into . Though Lee 's books excel at several of the essentials for a good page turner , he also overlooks aspects that I 've come to count on to keep my interest , the most vital being that of character development . Lack of character development became most apparent with this second installment , when another major female character was introduced , who , other than a different physical description , seemed to very much resemble the lead female character . The chief protagonist remains the only well developed character in these stories . Another issue that baffled me with & # 34 ; Ghost Country & # 34 ; is the lack of an introduction to a solid villain even halfway through the book . We all need characters to love , but we also need those we can hate . Frankly , this book provides neither .	-1
Sarah Langan is a talented writer but a so-so storyteller on this venture ( `` Audrey 's Door '' is her third novel ) and although I 'm new to her , I 'm left with no desire to read her other work . Oddly enough I felt this book was beneath her capabilities . Several critics ' reviews have compared her work to that of Stephen King . Being a King fan , I think the comparison is unfair ( to King himself ) in addition to being grossly inaccurate.The book is overly long at 412 pages and could 've used a more rigorous edit . The story sidelined one too many times into unnecessary detail about a minor character ( said-character 's personal tragedy was irrelevant to the plot and seemed a waste of pages ) with Langan serving up a cut and dry ending that does n't do her story justice . Most of all , her tale of a cursed/haunted building with a portal to an alternate universe is just plain strange . I 'll concede that books in the horror genre sometimes need to be weird , but `` Audrey 's Door '' just did n't hit the right note of creepiness for me , its somewhat stringent and succinct prose never inducing me to pull the covers up to my chin at night , fixating on the shadows in the corners and wondering whether those very shadows would slither out to come get me . That is what horror books should do , in my humble opinion.They should also offer an impetus to keep reading with a thrilling plot . For me , the read was perfunctory instead of enjoyable - I just wanted to get it over with . A good book should get the heart pumping , work up a mental appetite , make the eyes and the mind hunger for more pages ; Langan 's execution proved a literary famine time and time again.On the plus side , there is no tripping over complicated language , no drowning in description or overuse of metaphor , making the read easy but , alas , unremarkable.Bottom line : Dissatisfied , but did n't hate it . Langan is obviously talented - anyone who reads her will know it instantly . Where she fails here is in her idea and her execution of it . Seek other horror fare if you want a good scare and if you 're looking for someone like King , then read King . The guy 's like Coca-Cola - you ca n't beat the real thing .	-1
I started out thinking The Lace Reader had great potential . The plot line had an aura of mystery combined with Salem witches and lots of psychic readings of lace . Right up my alley . But then it started to slog along . Was Eva dead or was n't she ? What made Lyndley commit suicide ? And why the heck would Sophya change her name to Towner when Sophya is so beautiful a name ? I kept reading even though many of my friends told me to stop . `` If it 's dull , give it up . There are plenty more interesting books to choose from , '' they said . Normally I would have taken their advice but in the name of my greater cause I felt I had to keep reading . The author took too long to answer all my questions . And when she did , they were n't answered in a satisfying manner . For those of you who still want to keep reading I wo n't give anything away . The characters should have all been committed to the mental institution for good . They had issues far beyond any human capability to understand . The setting was the only real thing in the story . The Lace Reader left me cold , and unsatisfied with the outcome.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short	-1
This book is not Wally Lamb 's writing but an anthology by young women . Good stories but for a young audience .	-1
This book was definitely not his best work . It was slow , meandering , and was glad to be finished with it at the end . His other books were much better .	-1
Lowell USED to be an automatic buy for me , I was happy with her romance novels , now that she 's entrenched in romantic suspense I have become less and less enamored of her work . This is another St. Kilda consulting thriller with Grace , the former judge and husband Faroe having major parts . The books hero , Mac , and heroine , Emma , are former military and CIA agents respectively . Both have become very disenchanted , to say the least , with working for the government . Mac handles boats and Emma , now working for St. Kilda , has been investigating the disappearances of yachts . The romance in Lowell 's thrillers is very formulaic and not the main drive of the story . Though it takes place around the San Juan Islands do n't expect another Love Song for Raven . If you are happy with espionage ( I got bored and started skipping large chunks ) and are happy with a quick read ( the action takes place over a week ) and like to learn about boats , fuel , lines , diesel fuel , docking etc . this might be the book for you . Lowell 's quippy dialogue is still here in spades and it 's what kept me reading the book . Emma is strong , resourceful , and bad ass . Mac , tortured by scenes from Afghanistan , squashes his flashbacks and gets on with his life.I suppose I like some of Lowell 's earlier books better because they are more character studies , and also deal a bit with the landscape . Here it 's all about the boat and the characters are rather cardboard .	-1
Lots of characters to keep track of - sometimes too many . Lots of separate plots . Would have preferred a more straightforward story .	-1
Elizabeth Lowell is one of those authors that , to me , can capture my interest right at the first page of her books . Her books would grab me in and wo n't let go so they are usually my ` all-nighter ' books . The fact that it took me more than a week to finish this book since its release says a lot at how hard I had to force myself to finish reading , to make sure my guess at who the bad guy was is right at the first chapters of the book . THAT 'S how predictable the story was.Do n't get me wrong , the characters were not bad as individuals especially the main characters . The heroine is a true modern woman with her own job that she both enjoyed and love . She does not take crap from anyone but also has first class manners to boot . That goes without saying that she is beautiful and rich as well.The hero is your modern day warrior who can survive both in the concrete jungle of cities and of the wild . He has high connections in the government and private and even in the not so legal side of the law . A typical alpha male who is both a gentleman to his lady and a formidable warrior to his enemies.They sound great , right ? And honestly they are main characters I would pay to read . Unfortunately , the whole story is 95 % dedicated to Mayan facts , legends , history , and cults that the romance between the main characters did not have a chance to be explored . They get to know each other by how much they know about Mayan facts , their conversation is 98 % Mayan tidbits , and hunt more Mayan artifacts on their ` dates ' and talks to dealers both shadowy and not . It 's not that I did not want to be educated about Mayans but if I want that I will pick up text book , not a romance book . I do not even mind having histories integrated on a story I am reading as long as it does not overshadow the romance factor ( like the intricacies of banking and gun-running in Innocent As Sin , or the cutthroat world of art collectors in Blue Smoke and Murder and a lot of her other books ) . In this book though the Mayan info did cast a dark and long shadow over the magic between the main characters.It does not help that the story or plot is a predictable one , which I would n't mind as long as I can read some new twists but no , it 's just more and more Mayan facts . The main character 's inner musing/monologue about how much they are attracted to the other started to get me into the romance part , unfortunately they became old as they are repeated again and again throughout the book.In the end the book tells about a brilliant Mayan archeologist who is blackmail by her handsome student for her knowledge . Her life gets in danger and the handsome warrior will save her from her evil family . Along the way they talk and breathe Mayans , artifacts , cults , and more Mayans.I do n't know why this book did not do it for me because I would have thought with an academically strong heroine and a strong hero who is not intimidated with her knowledge I would enjoy this book but somehow it really lacked the magic of romance for me.Sigh , I just wish for more of Ms. Lowell 's St. Kilda series . At least they never disappointed me .	-1
As a long time fan of Loretta Chase , I had high expectations for this book . Instead I found a boring book that had me eager to get it over with . With two very interesting leads , this could have been so much more , but there was no plot , no buildup , no sexual tension , no good villian , no good conflict . Any problem was solved in about five minutes by either the heroine or the hero and then we just waited for the next episode . I felt the author was bored with the whole thing and just wanted to get it over with , and that is the way I felt reading it .	-1
The story is told by Jay Handler , a successful doctor , who flies across the US to be with his brother Charlie after his nephew kils himself . Evan was 21 , suicidal and bipolar , so it seems a straightforward case for the police . However gradually Jay starts to think that perhaps there was more to Evan 's death than everyone has realised and that the death may be connected to events in Charlie 's past , when Charlie spent time with a Charles Manson like cult in the 1970s.I have read and enjoyed other books by this author , but this one was a disappointment . The story develops without much pace or tension and at times becomes repetitive - for example , one character recognizing and saying exactly the same things in one chapter as another had two chapters earlier . The author also spells out everything out for us , not giving the reader any chance to make connections for themselves . He even abandons the first person narrative for occasional chapters to make sure that we 're not missing out on what anyone is thinking.It 's an easy read , in the Harlan Coben/Greg Hurtwiz/Linwood Barclay mould , but not as good . No big twists ( except perhaps at the very end ) , no plausibility , no urge to keep reading.This book has been published in the UK under the title `` Killing Hour '' . It is the same book .	-1
I have always loved Andrew Gross 's books but this one is very difficult to get into . There is no excitement and I have wanted to put the book down and read something else . The only reason I keep reading is I payed a good price to have this downloaded to my Kindle . If I could get my money back I would . Sorry Andrew but not half as good as your last two books .	-1
Maybe because the author is Australian and I did n't understand some of the references , but I did n't like this book . I guess I am looking for some ordinary folks who lost weight , to be inspired by them . Not some world traveling girl.Anyways , I did n't make it thru the book , I had to put it down	-1
Parts of this book were very entertaining , clever and endearingly faithful to the Superman/Barman mythology . A great deal of this book , however , read as if it were targeted to 10 to 12-year olds . It felt as if the author used a ball-peen hammer to make certain statements which were clearly obvious ; many of these attempts were painful to read . It became increasingly uneasy for me to continue reading this book ; it read as if there were at least three authors who collaborated on this book - and who decided to forego utilizing an editor .	-1
Wow , do not buy this book please . Worst plot , worst man main character , and worst treatment of a women I have seen . Move on to a different book .	-1
I thought the story was actually interesting and well written . I thought the characters were better written than a lot of books I have read . I purchased the book on discount about $ 3.43 at Walmart . However , my objection to this story is not what I think most will say . Most people just believe that witchcraft is just a fantasy and not real . Then my thoughts are for the impressionable teens reading this line of stories , looking for power in their lives . The problem is that when you play around with witchcraft just like with seances you are playing with demons . Demons do n't play they destroy and oppress . When you dabble around then you are inviting them into your life even if you do n't believe in them . There is a spiritual realm and you are messing in it . I am the kind of person who will always give a person the benefit of the doubt . I do n't believe L. J. Smith is deliberately trying to encourage young people to play around with witchcraft . That being said I would not recommend this series to anyone . Other than the theme of the story I would give this four stars . Because of the potential damage to a young person or any person being damaged by dabbling , I will only give this two stars .	-1
Lackluster , contrived , forced , reads like a college student with pretentions . Some old manuscript from college days ? In any case , it does not live up to the Sonambulist in any way .	-1
I ca n't believe that someone would say that there is no hell.Jesus talked about the reality of the fact of Hell . We may agree on different angles or interpretations in our understanding of it , but I just leave this with you . Our Lord spoke about it in a very unfunny manner . He wept over communities going to judgment . He prayed in Gethsemane with strong crying and tears because He knew about all these realities for which He has provided a way of escape.All in this book is very hard to believe , from the moment on where he made certain statements , I felt guided from God to put this book down and not read it to the end .	-1
RUNNING FROM THE DEVIL has some decent action scenes , but it really does n't possess the qualities that I look for in a good novel . By which I mean this book has a severe lack of interesting characters . The storyline involves too many people and none of them are the least bit developed . Most of them lack personality and color ; their dialogue is limited to describing what 's happening around them . The result is a rather bland reading experience , despite the multitude of shoot-outs and explosions and chases.I think this book 's author is obviously an intelligent person and her writing style is both clear and crisp . She 's also done some interesting research on the nation of Colombia and its political relationship with the US . But in the end , this novel is little more than a long action scene . The writer has potential , but she offers nothing new with this particular effort . There 's little that distinguishes it from the multitude of cookie-cutter action novels that have come and gone over the past thirty years.As a result , I would n't recommend RUNNING FROM THE DEVIL to a reader who 's already familiar with the tropes of the genre . If your reading time is limited , there are much better options out there .	-1
Dancing to The Precipice , The Life of Lucie de la Tour du Pin , Caroline Moorehead ; HarperCollinsPublishers ( orig. , Britain , Chatto & Windus ; 2009 ) Post Note ( 12/18/12 ) : Memoirs of Madame de La Tour du Pin [ Henrietta-Lucy Dillon , 1770-1853 ] ... ( 1913 ; 1969 abridged edition , edited & translated by Felice Harcourt ; with an introduction by Peter Gay ; 1st Am . edition 1971 hardcover , The McCall Pub . Co. ; Amazon review , `` Superb , '' sent / accepted 12/18/12 ) Please read this , before going on to our contemporary & vastly inferior biography - in every respect - of the above author , published in 2009 : `` Dancing to The Precipice , The Life of Lucie de la Tour du Pin , '' by Caroline Moorehead ... *****Is it possible that in the past decade , Caroline Moorehead & her editors read Adam Lehner 's `` An Antidote To ` The Elements of Style ' `` ( The New Yorker , June 4 , 2001 ) - & thought that it was literal advice on how to write coherently ? If so ... who wants to call Harper , to tell them that it was a satire ? Lehner : `` The reader of the 5th edition of ` The Elements of Style ' will find many of the rules changed from previous editions ... here are some of the new principles of composition : '' 1 . Use ` the fact that . ' Healthy writing is unfocussed & blithering . A sentence should not be trimmed of unnecessary words ... 'The fact that ' is a particularly salubrious expression , & it & similar phrases should be [ used ] ... whenever possible . `` `` The fact that , '' `` not only ... but , '' & `` not just ... but for '' appear dozens of times in `` Precipice '' ( I quit counting after 300 pages ) . '' 2 . Employ fancy words . `` Author & editors apparently rebelled against this edict & generally employed words that even we non-publishing types can define without difficulty.But Moorehead 's sentences ( in which multiple commas abound ) do somewhat conform to Lehner 's rejection of the idea that `` the paragraph should be the basic unit of composition , '' since many of `` Precipice 's '' sentences are actually larger than paragraphs ( three of them are larger than the state of Texas ) . '' 3 . Write with nouns & verbs & adjectives & adverbs & superlatives & vocatives & dangling participles & gerunds & nonrestrictive elements ... '' Judging by what was published , I suspect that the author & editors understood this to be an emphatic endorsement of `` anything goes '' - the component parts of which form a constellation of incorrect verb tenses , confusingly ambiguous simple & reflexive pronouns , redundancies ( verbosity ) & non-sequiturs.Lehner , incidentally , failed to indicate any interest in the idea that histories provide historical dates ( `` May 16 , 1791. '' ) . This may be why on any given page in `` Precipice , '' you have to flip 20-30 pages forwards or backwards to discover or recall what year it is , in the narrative . ( HarperCollins ' editors also need to double-check dates . The American Revolution ran on for eight years , not `` four . '' And the year in which the war between England & their former colony formally ended was in 1783 - not 1793 . ) Let 's skip to Lehner 's `` 5 . Qualify . Qualifiers suggest equivocation ... '' This is an advocacy of hedging that Moorehead & Co. embraced wholeheartedly.The words `` seemed , '' `` appeared , '' & `` perceived '' appear so often in `` Precipice , '' one now feels positively alienated from the once-reasonable premise that historical facts are factual. '' 6 . Do not underwrite . `` Four hundred & thirty-six pages later ... *****Seriously , this is a great story about a very remarkable person ; it deserves to be promoted & read ... after the manuscript has been whipped into shape by competent , conscientious editors.Until then , it 's just another flimsy summer beach book - which everyone will have plenty of time to read now that Oprah is off the air , for now , at any rate .	-1
I think Hamlet 's Blackberry , just as the three books I recommend , treat an important subject , but too wordy , too repetitive and not useful enough.If you want to read about : - how screens are changing society and our children read : Alone Together : Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other- how normal people are trying to get back to real life : The Winter of Our Disconnect : How Three Totally Wired Teenagers ( and a Mother Who Slept with Her iPhone ) Pulled the Plug on Their Technology and Lived to Tell the Tale- how your brain is getting mushier and more shallow due to screen time : The Shallows : What the Internet Is Doing to Our BrainsWe spend a better part of the last century to get away from the conveyor belt , just to voluntarily place ourself in front of the digital conveyor belt .

I want to start off by saying I did not finish reading this book . I got 13 chapters into the story and just was not interested enough by the content to continue . I once received a rejection letter from Marion Zimmer Bradley that told me , `` if there is a plot somewhere in here , I fail to see it . '' I treasured that letter because she was right . There should be a discernible story from the outset . You can not just have character , no matter how compelling , wandering around from thing to thing . There has to be something that holds the story together.The plot starts off with a woman being burned at the stake for being accused of witchcraft , just to be `` rescued '' by a demon at the expense of her soul . The cost of this exchange is that she is gifted with ageless talents and skills such as speed and strength which she has to use to kill targets that Rabishu ( the demon ) selects . After a period of time she grows weary of the constant killing and decides she wants out of the contract but does n't want to be subjected to eternal damnation for the evil she has done . Fortunately there is a clause in the contract she signed with Rabishu that says if she saves the lives of as many people as she killed before , she can go to the equivalent of paradise . It took a heck of a long time in the story to get to this point . The kicker is that during this period she is mortal now and could die before she completes her goal and if she dies she becomes Rabishu 's plaything.Okay , fine . We have a character with some motivations . But where is the plot ? Do n't hold your breath.Suddenly the book takes a turn and she is focused on solving a murder of two programmers and that is where I lost interest . There is no continuity between her goal of saving lives and this murder . I mean they are already dead so how can solving the murder help her towards her goal of saving lives ? Plus she has this extravagantly reinforced suite at a condo with an arsenal of weaponry that is more suited to assassination and spying than saving lives . It ceased making sense to me , especially when the idea that she longed for a `` normal '' life of love and children was brought into it and interfered with any sense the story seemed to have in the first place , which was little enough.Unfortunately the character was n't sympathetic enough , nor was the premise of the story line believable enough , to get over the rough spots . The author just did n't get to the point soon enough to maintain my interest . In the end , this was a character in an internally inconsistent setting , left in search of a story . Just goes to show , it takes more than a snappy cover to make a good book . Pass on this one . With any luck , Dakota Banks will pick up a copy ofStory : Substance , Structure , Style and The Principles of Screenwriting . Until then , I 'll just shudder at the memory of this disaster .	-1
It is always interesting to see when an author tries to bring something new to the realm of urban sci-fi/fantasy , particularly when they bypass the more traditional vampire / werewolf genres . In this book , the author 's main character , Maliha Crayne , wants to redeem her soul after selling it to an ancient Sumerian demon and acting as the demon 's assassin for several centuries . The premise was promising , with a character who suffered and was unjustly put to the torch by angry villagers , who trades her humanity for the right to continue to exist . As to be expected , her servitude begins to wear on her over the years and she decides that she wants out of the bargain , no matter the cost.The problems I had with this book that caused me to rate it so low start with the fact that the main character has absolutely no personality . After hundreds of pages , I never got a feel for her . The author attempted to cover up this lack of personality by randomly going back in time to provide history about how she met some of her assorted friends , none of whom were particularly well defined either . Dakota Banks never seems to quite get the idea that simply having background material for the character does not really make her more likable , deep , or even interesting . Overall , Maliha was just a very wooden character who could do lots of neat stuff . Also , it is never really well explained how the main character is so ridiculously wealthy ( she is posing as an author , but has enough cash sitting around to give a hundred thousand or so to her doorman every year for not asking questions ? Really ? ) . The relationships with Maliha 's friends are every bit as shallow as the characters themselves , the action sequences are a bit Jame Bond'esque ( the main character seems to have unlimited resources at her disposal , which kind of takes the fun out of it ) , and the villain , while menacing , tends to lean towards random actions rather than having an actual plan . Overall , I found myself hurrying through the end of the book to move on to something where the characters were a bit more flushed out and the story was a little better developed .	-1
I really did enjoy this book , but I am disgusted that it is being marketed as a Young Adult novel . There are two very erotic scenes , and one use of the `` F '' word . I do n't even think the `` F '' word was being used during Dickens ' time . Shame on you Mr. Gaiman for marketing smut to children .	-1
Sociopathic college kids , guilty & unhappy adults , psychotic little girls , murder , secrets , suicide , lies , ghosts , revenge ... ..this novel was too much . I usually love this author 's work , but this book was a frustrating mess . I resent every hour I wasted reading it .	-1
Brian Kinchen , a tight end and long snapper , leaves a career in professional football after not being picked up and teaches at a Christian school in his home state of Louisiana . One day a few years later he gets a call from the New England Patriots in the middle of a season . They need an experienced long snapper for their upcoming playoff run , and offer Kinchen a tryout . Brian , looking to his faith for guidance , eventually gets the job and lives the dream at age 38 of getting a second chance at football and playing in the Super Bowl.For those who do not know , a long snapper is a football specialist who hikes the ball during punts and field goal attempts during games . It is a skill not many possess , and is much more difficult than it sounds . During critical moments , the entire game literally is in the hands of the long snapper . One poor snap at the wrong time in a game and the ball can go sailing past the punter or holder , leading to a deciding score by the other team . As the Super Bowl approaches , Kinchen develops a bad case of the `` yips , '' so familiar to many golfers who suddenly develop problems sinking the shortest of putts . It is a mental block , and Brian tries everything to recover his lost form , eventually trusting in his faith in God and the power of prayer.The Long Snapper is readable enough , and you genuinely want things to work out for Kinchen . He sends fun and inspirational videos back home to his students during the football season , and he describes in detail an often forgotten and yet critical position in the game of football . The story suffers , however , from long passages where Kinchen `` testifies , '' professing his faith in God . There is nothing wrong with this if you are a devotee of faith-based literature , but other readers may want to look elsewhere . Author Jeffrey Marx , who won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting , has put forth better efforts .	-1
It 's only in the narrow context of these events that Dells ` moralizing offers any revelance.The author may just as well have said it is what it is and saved the reader a lot of palaver .	-1
Two or three times a month I receive requests to do book reviews on a blog that I manage . Depending on the author , publisher , and/or book title I sometimes say , `` sure '' and other times , `` not really interested . '' A couple of weeks ago I said `` sure '' purely on the book title . The book was `` If the Church Were Christian . '' However , it was the sub-title of the book that intrigued me , which was `` Rediscovering the Values of Jesus . '' I was n't familiar with the author , who was Philip Gulley , but I was in agreement that we need to `` rediscover '' the values of Jesus.The overall premise of the book is that the church has lost its way . The author believes that the picture of American religious life is one of disillusionment . He contends that it is difficult to see many similarities between the church 's life and the person of Jesus . He unpacks this thesis in 10 chapters , each beginning with the words ; If the Church were Christian . . .1 . Jesus Would Be a Model for Living Rather Than an Object of Worship2 . Affirming Our Potential Would Be More Important Than Condemning Our Brokenness3 . Reconciliation Would Be Valued over Judgment4 . Gracious Behavior Would Be More Important Than Right Belief5 . Inviting Questions Would Be Valued More Than Supplying Answers6 . Encouraging Personal Exploration Would Be More Important Than Communal Uniformity7 . Meeting Needs Would Be More Important Than Maintaining Institutions8 . Peace Would Be More Important Than Power9 . It Would Care More About Love and Less About Sex10 . This Life Would Be More Important Than the AfterlifeSo far so good . ( Except that I would have tweaked a couple of the chapter titles . ) I am pretty much in agreement with the author 's assessment of the institutional church in America . There is much about the life of the church that has strayed from the teachings of Jesus.However , I found most of the examples the author uses to highlight just how the church has strayed less than helpful . He seems to conjure up the most extreme examples of fundamentalism in the church to make his point . For me , the numerous stories illustrating the worst of evangelical Christianity became tiresome . Furthermore , I did n't find it to be a fair or balanced approach to criticism.Most troubling , however , is the Jesus the author describes , particularly in the first two chapters , is really no different than any other `` religious '' leader in history . For example , in the introduction , the author expresses doubts about the divinity of Jesus , saying that Jesus was a Jew `` who did not see himself as divine . He saw himself as a rabbi , probably a prophet . '' If this is the case , then the author could have just as easily sub-titled his book , `` Rediscovering the Values of '' Buddha , or Confucius , or Gandhi , or the Dali Lama , or maybe Yusuf Islam ( a.k.a . Cat Stevens ) ; - ) Bottom line : Does the author present legitimate problems in the current state of the church in America ? Absolutely . Does he do so with a sense of fairness , or evenhandedness that is helpful ? I for one , do not think so . Does he provide a way for the church to be empowered ( biblically and/or theologically ) to move in the right direction ? Based upon the author 's view of Scripture and Jesus Himself , I would say no.While others have obviously found Gulley 's writings to be helpful ( as noted by the other reviews of this book ) , I believe a reader would be better served by reading a book like `` Death by Church : Rescuing Jesus From His Followers '' by Mike Err .	-1
It 's no secret that the Church has its issues , its deep divisions , has hurt and alienated many , and carries a history marred by many a questionable event . I appreciate the honest hearts of seekers not afraid to ask hard questions and delve into murky areas ; there are many fine books by such brave souls . This is not one of them.Though well intentioned , the author appears to have thrown the baby out with the bathwater - literally . Generously wanting to be all-inclusive , he disregards or outright discards every fundamental tenet of Christianity , resulting in a faith that is kind , welcoming and entirely purposeless . It has no strength , foundation or guidance to offer because it stands for nothing and is going nowhere . You do n't have to be Christian , but if you want to be an agnostic or New Ager just confess to it and do n't try to warp Christianity to fit your own invented definition.Regardless of what facet of this title drew your attention , there 's a better book out there to address it - skip this one !	-1
One of my fellow vine reviewers wrote about this book : `` I seriously doubt that readers who begin this book will actually complete their reading of it . It is a jumble of unconnected thoughts and very dubious history . `` That about sums it up for me.I battled through the first two chapters , but it was just too tedious to go beyond that.It was neither entertaining nor informative until that point . The author merely puts forward his own opinions , assertions and conclusions , which might be enough for a casual discussion with strangers at a local coffee shop , but is certainly not what I expected from this book . That would be more facts than unsupported opinions and the occasional personal anecdote.Maybe this project , to put `` The Atlantic '' into written form , is just too big for only one book . Maybe this needs to be more of a life-long effort than just a few years of sketchy research pressed into 500 or so pages.The most interesting aspects about this ocean are surely already covered in other books in more detail and with better research.Also , I found his writing style to be ... well , pompous , not unlike a Fraser-Crane-Clone . He uses big words , and complicated sentences , where simple speech would have served the topic best . He meanders around the subject , only brushing is core slightly , many times , and he is also obviously very much in love with his own intellect and ability to awe with his wordsmithing abilities.All in all , this book is not what I expected and was tedious to read . I rather stick with specialized literature on the topics regarding the Atlantic , which really interest me .	-1
I did not enjoy this book . It was confusing and difficult to follow . I hope the movie was more clear .	-1
I really disliked this book , and it was a plot that has been told over a dozen times . What a waste of money and time ! ! Basically this is about Andrew , an ex military , ex US Marshall who lost his wife , and is having difficulty coping with reality , so the institution that he is placed at puts on this elaborate scheme to restore his mind.Lots of boring twists .	-1
Total garbage ! I stopped reding it halfway , got tired of all small talk and not having a direction . Didnt want to waste my time reading all garbage so at the end we get a Hollywood style surprise ( OH , WOW ) . It is defintely written to be made a movie and not a book .	-1
I 'm a little baffled by all of the adoring reviews this book has received . Yes , `` Shutter Island '' has a twist ending , but you can see it coming from a mile away ( particularly if you grew up watching endless reruns of `` Twilight Zone , '' `` Thriller , '' and `` Alfred Hitchcock Presents , '' as I did ) . To make matters worse , it is n't a particularly well thought-out twist ; there are loose ends left dangling everywhere.I was also thrown off by Lehane 's numerous anachronisms . The book is supposed to be set in 1954 , but there are references to items made of plastic , contemporary phrases like `` anger management issues , '' a discussion of the hospital 's `` electronic security system , '' etc . Silly me -- I thought these were CLUES that the story was n't really taking place in 1954 at all ! Turns out Lehane is just lazy . `` Shutter Island '' is an enjoyable pool or airport read , but that 's about it .	-1
It is , I guess , brave of the author to try something different , especially since he probably got a big boost in name recognition after `` Mystic River . '' And , if you 've never read his other books , especially the Kenzie-Gennaro detective novels , which are as good as any in their genre , you may find this diverting . I 'm afraid long-time fans will be disappointed because I do n't think `` Shutter Island '' works on a number of levels . Readability is a problem - it feels like Lehane had a hard time with this . The plot jerks along with numerous stretches where nothing much happens . None of the characters , including the protagonist , is very interesting , and the final plot revelation , instead of providing the heart-pounding `` Oh my God ! '' moment the author expects , instead evokes more of a shrug and a `` glad it 's over '' feeling . I almost think Lehane was trying to write a 21st century `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest '' but this does n't even come close . There are a million better books vying for your attention .	-1
I did not like this book anywhere near as much as I 've liked Lippman 's other novels . She states that this is the most personal book she 's written , setting it in the area she grew up in , and I think the plot suffers for it.The story follows the adult versions of childhood friends Gwen , McKey ( nee Mickey ) , Tim , and Sean , awkwardly brought together after the death of the boys ' younger brother , Gordon . They are all keeping a terrible secret , which is supposed to be revealed to us in drips and drabs along the way , both through the present and the past.The point of view jumps from character to character , which does not bother me at all . However , during the parts from the point of view of the children , the point of view is an unspecified `` we '' . It 's not like it 's one of the children and it 's a simple switch to first person - it 's apparent that it 's not any particular one of them . Those sections drove me crazy , and completely distracted me from the story.The plot meanders along , and really struggled . By the end , it was difficult to muster any strong emotions about the `` big '' secret . It felt like Lippman really wanted to use this setting , but had a hard time finding a story to go along with it . I think she was too close to it .	-1
This book is poorly organized , poorly edited , and reads like a long newspaper article : high on sensationalist language but low on solid content . The author seems to have picked up snippets of information about the Chinese Communist Party during his time as a news reporter in China , but has not done systematic research on the Party . It feels like the superficial reporting that comes from a foreign reporter on a limited period assignment who does not understand the language or the culture in which he is reporting .	-1
Jeff Jarvis is obviously in love with Google and all things Google . In fact , in the world according to Jeff Jarvis we would all do well to discard every and all business models and follow , lock-step in the Google mode.In short , this is one long love letter to Google . If Google were a human being , Jeff Jarvis would be the stalker.While there are many things that Google does right and can be both helpful and beneficial to mankind , there are many areas in which it needs to improve or , at least , be more respectful . However , in this book , Google can do no wrong.Worried about your privacy ? Pshaw . Google just needs all that information about you in order to organize itself better to serve up more relevant results for you . Tired of seeing ads everywhere ? Hey , that 's how Google can give you what it does for `` free '' ( and provide some income for the masses who serve up their ads ) .It 's well written and simple to follow . As long as you know you 're reading fawning hype for Google , you 'll be OK .	-1
For me , the main character does too much thinking and pondering ; and not enough action or plot to keep this book interesting .	-1
The title is misleading . My guess is that it was an advertising gimmick in order to have the title rhyme.Any one who is already familiar with Thoreau will find nothing new here . Which begs the question ... Who was this book meant for ? Someone not interested in Thoreau ? But why would a non-fan buy this book ? ? Simply put , the best way to know what Mr Survivalist meant to say would be to read his body of work .	-1
I 've enjoyed every D Brown book . Up till now . I find myself jumping ahead and skipping pages out of boredom because the description goes on and on and on without needing to . It is as if there just is n't enough of a story there to fill up a whole book so the 'details ' are expanded to the point of being redundant . I hope this is n't a pattern and just a one time stumble because i used to really like his novels .	-1
I was really looking forward to this book . I thought the concept had a lot of promise . Unfortunately , for me , it did n't deliver.The book feels to me like it was written by an 19-year-old male , and that may be by design , because that 's certainly the narrator 's perspective . I just do n't have any interest in what a 19-year-old male might find interesting or humorous.In fact , I did n't find anything interesting or humorous in the book . I found the writing weak , and attempts at humor contrived.I did give up after page 100 , so maybe it got better . I just could n't get engaged enough to keep going .	-1
Definitely not my genre ... hope the guys like it . I do not & # 34 ; see dead people & # 34 ; and do not like them walking around in my novels .	-1

Plot Summary : In this convoluted plot , Jacobin De Chastelux has an evil Uncle who treated her like a poker chip and lost her at cards to Lord Storrington . Jacobin flees her Uncle 's house and poses as a male French pastry chef within the Prince 's household . Meanwhile , Storrington is plotting to lure the evil Uncle to his doom , and he chances upon a male pastry chef who will serve as bait for his glutinous enemy . Storrington hires Jacobin , and he quickly sees through her disguise . There are innumerable knots , kinks , tangles , and twists within this plot , and I 'd need a whole lotta space to explain it all.Thankfully I do have a few nice things to say about this book , which makes me glad , because overall it was not good . While tipping my hat in acknowledgement that this is a debut novel by a new author , this book can not compare to a historical romance written by a seasoned pro such as Lisa Kleypas or Madeline Hunter . The plot is a steaming pile of overly complicated conundrums , and the author was clearly in love with the foodie side of the story . Too much in love . I enjoyed the pastry chef tidbits , but I think it took the focus from the romance . More on that later.The good news is that Jacobin 's character was spot on perfect . She was a wonderfully complex heroine , and her English and French halves created interesting conflicts . She lives with the English , but she 's not truly one of them , and taken within the historical context of the book ( after Napoleon 's defeat ) , Jacobin 's defensiveness is convincing.The bad news is that Lord Storrington was a kaleidoscope of the least desirable character traits I 'd want in a hero . At some point he was either weepy , gullible , arrogant , selfish , or rapacious . Even after getting to know Jacobin and her true story , Storrington uses her as a stake in a card game with her hated Uncle . He was a man-boy full of maudlin self-pity with nothing left over to spare for Jacobin.This is why the romance failed to ignite , because I ca n't get excited for a hero like Storrington . There were also some missed opportunities to build up the sexual tension ( in the only ballroom scene , they never dance or speak ! ) , and too much time is devoted to ancillary characters , like Storrington 's sister , or to details about making pastries . Ultimately a romance needs to focus on the romance first , and everything else should be icing on the cake .	-1
I picked up a copy in the airport and was ready to throw it away before we 'd taxied to take off , but I had nothing else to read other than the SkyMall catalogue , ( which might have been more entertaining ) .Unbelievable characters , improbable plot , poor grammar . ( It 's `` ensure '' , not `` insure '' -- no-one in this book is selling insurance ! ) Sorry , `` Booklist '' , but no . Jack Reacher does NOT have competition here .	-1
This one looks like a self-help book but is n't ; it presents itself as a serious study on the problem with modern marriage , but is n't . It 's kind of like a long , drawn-out Ladies Home Journal article ( but without the benefit of tasty recipes on the next page ) . There is a wonderful scene in the movie `` The Ref '' where a marriage counselor asks Kevin Spacey : `` What do you want from the marriage ? '' and he replies : `` I want to stop talking about it . '' After a few chapters of reading this book , you just want to stop .	-1
Although this one is n't quite as bad as the teen edition ( & # 34 ; I Ca n't Keep My Own Secrets & # 34 ; ) , it 's still pretty bad.Fortunately , it 's a quick read , and the design of the book is good.A & # 34 ; memoir & # 34 ; is normally considered to be a remembrance that 's communicated to others because it 's interesting.However , the contents of this volume is better described as a terse litany of regrets , or compact versions of the worst thing that ever happened to a person . Some are actually quite disturbing , made even more so by the lack of context ( other than a few pages of notes at the end of the book concerning a few select entries ) .Many of the & # 34 ; memoirs & # 34 ; are written in third person -- not first -- making them seem more about other people than about the author . In fact , rather than & # 34 ; six word memoirs & # 34 ; , most of the contributions could more accurately be characterized as & # 34 ; six word confessions & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; six word advice & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; six word mottoes & # 34 ; , or & # 34 ; six word epitaphs & # 34 ; .	-1
This arrived on my Kindle the day it came out ( March 15 , 2011 ) . I was excited though I had been disappointed with this arc , line of the Vampire Diaries , whatever you want to call it ... The Return stuff ... Still it was the Vampire Diaries and aspects of it were okay here and there . I 'd still read them quickly . Give them the benefit of the doubt . I 'd hope L.J . Smith would re-find her Vampire Diaries groove.Nope . It 's taken me until today ( June 16 , 2011 ) to finish it . That 's bad , I never have that issue as I only buy books I think I 'll at least like a little . I ca n't give this line within the series credit any longer . There were fewer and fewer clever aspects . More and more bad , unreadable aspects . There were story lines within it that seemed rushed and all over the place when they should have been slow and carefully explained and others that seemed to have a billion details for no reason as there was absolutely nothing going on.I do really really hope L.J . Smith finds whatever is broken here before working on her other series . I was anxious to read the next Night World , even with how disappointed I 'd been in the last few Vampire Diaries she 'd written . After this one ... Ugh , I 'm way more nervous about that . I can only hope that she had gotten burnt out on this series / was being rushed due to the tv show causing a new interest in these books / something . I know she was `` fired '' from this series . As much as I hate to say this , being these were her babies , it 's the best thing to have happened to them . The Stefan 's Diaries series which was written by someone else is so much better - to the point I stopped reading this to read it and several other books before dragging myself back to this one as I felt I HAD to finish it just because I 'd bought it and it was the Vampire Diaries.If you 're on the fence about this one - skip it . It will surely be recapped in the next book and that will be written by someone else.The only reason I can even bring myself to give it the 2 stars is because somehow in this mess there are a few really good 5 star passages ... mixed in with a mostly 1 star book . Had those rare sections not been included , this would be a very very rare 1 star for me . As it is 2 stars is rare for me and with how much I love this series I hate doing it . I just ca n't stretch the credit for L.J . any longer , sorry .	-1
I borrowed the book on Prime because we 're visiting Ireland this summer , and I thought it would be an interesting read . It is a lovely , sweet , and well-written novel about a young American woman who visits Ireland after the death of her mother and a nasty break-up.The characters , while likable , are a bit cliched , but the plot moves at a good pace . So why did I give up on it ? While my mom would love this book , this is just not my style . Fans of romance novels and Christian novels will like it .	-1
One more book -- well written , yes ( hence the two-stars ) -- trying grimly to make the case that hard work is everything , talent almost nothing.And yet , Ashkenazi Jews , at mere 0.1 % of humanity , win 15 % of ALL Novel prizes , a 1/3rd of Pulitzer prizes , etc . etc . How come ? Do Ashkenazi Jewish students really work so much harder than , say Vietnamese or Chinese American students ? Even if they do , the sheer higher number of Oriental students would have led to much higher Nobel prizes for them . ( They do get quite a bit as it is ; but not nearly in the same proportion as do Ashkenazi Jews ) Or can it be -- shocking ! -- that genius is innate ? Of course , not all geniuses are Jews . Gaus , Riemann , Ramanujan , Poincare , Ssun tzu , Sophie Germain , Flaubert , Nabokov , Ssu ma tzien -- geniuses are everywhere . But hard work does not a genius make . Anyone who claims otherwise does n't know the difference between a real genius and a ping-pong champ.It is interesting , though , that the argument on the other side is made by Steven and Sudan Pinker -- who thereby are tagged as right-wingers . The Pinkers claim that some qualities are indeed innate , and that , contra Gladwell and Syed , genius can not be attained by hard work alone . It may be unfortunate , and unjust , but it is nevertheless a sad fact . Not everyone is a seven footer , and not everyone has an IQ of 190.Yet the Pinkers ' common-sense claim somehow offends the masses , who prefer to be told by Gladwell and Syed and their ilk that , if they ( the masses ) only practiced long enough , they , too , could compete with anyone , anywhere , in anything . Yes , in Chess ( and in math , and in Physics , and in literature ) with humanity 's giants.Bunkum .	-1
The author claims to be a `` minister-teacher in ... Christian ... thought ... . '' [ pg . xi ] and dedicates his book -- originally written in 1968 , when he was probably in his 20 's -- to the Fillmores , the founders of the Unity School of Christianity , and his teachers . So a 'Christian ' cult births a Unity Minister who gave birth to this work . Here we have -- per Christianity , which he espouses -- '' the blind leading the blind . '' And how can I say this with any authority ? Because the Apostle Paul wrote the Book of Colossians , in part , `` to refute the heretical teaching { that } one could achieve perfection ... through levels of wisdom in spiritual mysteries ; '' ( Key Word Bible ) the very subject and premise of this book ! For 30 years I , too , was persuaded as to 'the deity of man , ' the 'Christ Consciousness ' movement { in its various forms and names ) , and that , `` The message of the Gospels has been misunderstood . They have been made to appear to say that Jesus was really God taking the form of a man ... . '' [ pg . 8 ] You mean like : `` In the beginning was the Word ... and the Word was God ... .And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us ... .Jesus Christ . '' ( John 1:1,14 , 17 ) ; that 'misunderstanding ' ? Not only did I believe such things , 2x I had an 'out of body ' experience and 2 other times I experienced 'enlightenment ' i.e . conscious oneness with existence . That 's why I was 'caught ' up in such things for 30 years ! I tasted the poisonous fruit and it was 'heady stuff ' , but it was n't truth . For though made in God 's likeness i.e . with a spirit , we are neither gods , nor God ! With that background , reading through the first 13 pages did not fool me that I was treading on `` Holy ground . `` Jesus , the one the author claims to admire , said that if one would n't believe him when he spoke of earthly things , how could they believe him when he spoke of spiritual things ? Mr. Butterworth proves himself untrustworthy as to mere 'earthly things , ' { matters one could check out } 9x up through page 13 ! ( on pages vi , vii , ix , 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 ) For example : he writes , `` the greatest need of all persons is ... divine Sonship , '' [ ix ] thereby deifying man . Then he refuses to capitalize [ signifying deity ] 'Son ' -- even though the Bible does -- in his rendering of , `` Thou art the Christ , the son of the living God . '' ( As the Christian comedian Frank Peretti quipped , `` Everyone gets to be God but Jesus . `` ) I dislike long critiques , so I 'll end with this perspective : `` There shall be false teachers among you , who shall bring in damnable heresies ... .speaking evil of things they understand not ... .These are wells without water ... . For ... they speak great swelling words of vanity ... .While they promise liberty , they themselves are servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought into bondage . '' 2 Peter 2:1 , 12 , 17-19.I 've been in this long enough to know that -- along the way to Truth -- everyone will believe what they want to . But do n't call it 'Christianity ' , as Butterworth attempts to do . I have a term for teachers such as him : Bible Monkeys . For what does a monkey do with a Bible ? Answer : anything he wants .	-1
I have read about one-half of this book and do not expect that my finishing of it will change my low estimation of it . The writing is little above good high school writing , the analysis is thin to the point of being non-existent . It is possible that sportswriters are too close to the steroids era to be able to see it with any depth or profundity.As a piece that informs the reader about Roger Clemens the book succeeds after a fashion , although there is not much excitement in the prose . I read a newspaper column , written before The Rocket was implicated in steroids , that suggested that he be ranked as the greatest starting pitcher of ALL TIME . But this author has little or no sense of Clemens 's place in the overall history of the game of baseball , other than to offer up the inevitable comparison with `` flamethrowers '' such as Nolan Ryan.If you are a fan of Roger Clemens , read this book . Otherwise I can see no good reason to waste your time .	-1
Why is it that books are getting apparently easier to market ? A bad read and I did not enjoy it at all .	-1
Cute book however the repeating of each day gets very old . It 's a cute light read when you 've run out of books to read . Other then that however read Shatter Me instead ! ! ! !	-1
The concept of this book is a good one . The author seems talented . But there was just something about this book I could n't get into . Maybe because I was listening to the audio book version . The author 's imagery is beautiful , but sometimes it just seemed to much . I did like that she starts with a main character and really established the character under the government thinking and then to show how the character 's thinking changes . But overall I found it just too slow and to forced .	-1
THE LANGUAGE WAS A LITTLE RAW IN MY OWN OPINION . THE NEED FOR OBSCENE LANGUAGE IN LITERATURE IS SO UNCALLED FOR . OTHERWISE WHEN YOU GET TO THE HEART OF THE BOOK IS GOOD .	-1
Tilly Bagshawe needs to leave Sidney Sheldon 's name and books alone , because all she is sucessfully doing is tainting the legacy of the late great author . If there was a zero star , that is what I would give this nonesense .	-1
According to Steve Harvey , all atheists are idiots.I normally do not give such biased reviews , but I can honestly say I will not read this book simply due to him parading his stupidity on national TV , and publically bashing atheists . Also due in part to the fact in this book he even suggests women do not date atheists ... He 's a real prize	-1
When I got to the end of this book I said , `` something 's missing '' and realized that one person came through `` Game Change '' unscathed : Michelle Obama . All of the other campaign '08 characters ' poor behavior/shortcomings/personal warts , etc. , were highlighted and yet there was no mention of Michelle 's frequent & offensive public comments about her husband and his shortcomings . Back then even Chris Matthews was shocked at her nasty remarks about her husband and asked ( on `` Hardball '' ) if possibly she was just jealous of him . Immediately after this she disappeared from the campaign for a few months and when she returned it was with a new and pleasant attitude . The authors sure did n't miss mentioning when any of the other spouses behaved poorly . Other than that , it 's an ok read and provides a pretty good description of how grueling a campaign can be . As other reviews have pointed out , `` Game Change '' makes it all too obvious that we need a better system for finding good candidates and enabling them to adequately show the voters their beliefs and goals .	-1
I thought the plot of this book had a lot of potential . `` Devious con artist survives a murder attempt but has no memory of either her would-be killer or her past wrongs . The truth is revealed through a combination of her slowly returning memory , the recounting of events by the possible suspects and the discoveries of the investigating police officer . '' Sounds great , right ? Only trouble is that the main character was given absolutely no emotion . Perhaps this an intentional effort to portray Margot as a cold & calculation sociopath but frankly it made me not care one bit about her or which of the people with good reason to off her actually did the deed . The other characters were equally disappointing . Even after they knew the evil she was capable of , they continued to fall for her . Good thing this was a short book . That much quicker I can get to forgetting it .	-1
Not very practical . Could n't find more than two or three recipes I would use . My daughter-in-law who loves sandwiches did not like this book either .	-1
I was looking forward to reading this book after reading the Amazon.com reviews and Mr. Carlo 's website As most people that order this type of book I am a amateur `` mob historian `` I was born and raised in Brooklyn and I am also a Martial Artist . This book is poorly researched and as others have stated poorly written . The pivotal points of Mr. Pitera 's life are glossed over as if he is a minor player in the book instead of its main subject . One obvious question I would of liked answered is what style of Karate did Mr. Pitera study ? this is an important question and one that should of been stated up front , since Mr. Carlo stresses the affects martial arts had on Mr. Pitera 's life and how Mr. Pitera emerged as a `` fire breathing dragon '' from its training it would have been helpful to know the style he studied . ( there is more than one school or style of Japanese Karate ) Also , Mr. Carlo can not decide if Mr. Pitera is a disciplined samurai or a serial killer , he shifts viewpoints every other page and sometimes combines them . The style and substance of this book leaves me with two conclusions : Mr. Carlo needed to quickly publish this book and because of time constraints did very little research , or Mr. Carlo is very much afraid of Mr Pitera and does not wish to offend him .	-1
Picked this book up after reading another book by the same author . I had misgivings after the first book , but I thought this one would surely have a plot ... it was about the end of the world , for pete 's sake ! But no such luck . I do n't mind character-driven stories , but there was no story there ... none . This read like a book by a Very Important Writer , meaning someone in grad school told this author that she would be a Very Important Writer , so plot and pace did n't matter . It was simply terrible . I could almost overcome the lack of plot and action if it had n't been filled with so much ham-fisted symbolism . The death of Joy , for one . Killing the Golden Goose , after being hammered with the fairy tales from the first page . The shearing of Sam 's golden locks . The wings over her heart . Really ? While I do think this author has a lovely way with words , she needs to go back and take a look at other important parts of story-telling , namely plot and pacing . It 's good to be a Very Important Writer , but it also helps to be a Very Good Writer . Just my .2 .	-1
`` Crazy for the Storm '' is the only book that I have returned to Amazon in many years . The language is uncalled for and it is sexually explicit to the extreme . It definitely is not a book that I would want my family , children , or grand children to pick up to read in my home . X rated books should be explained in advertizements . Not a worthy buy .	-1
steven is a charming and entertaining chap with a great story to tell , but there are just way to many pages of garbage here to make this an enjoyable reading experience . it 's for die hard fans only . it could have been titled steven desperately in need of an editor or a writer who can construct a book . it looks to me like it was rushed out to capitalize on his American Idol stint , and only just made it too . J-lo has a number one hit single and now steven 's topping the best seller lists . product placement is working a treat . save your money on this one . if you are looking for a good rock'n roll memoir Keith Richards book is much better .	-1
Steven Tyler 's `` Does the Noise in My Head Bother You '' was the drug-filled , curse-filled , rather incoherent rambling you might expect . I 've liked Aerosmith since the 80s , and enjoyed the relatively few times in the book where he 'd link a song 's lyrics to a story he just told . While the majority of the book is told in chronological order , he 'll take tangents that are sometimes hard to follow . Then the anecdote abruptly finishes and he 's back to going about wherever he left off from.I was rather surprised he skipped over the whole Run DMC version of `` Walk This Way '' as I believe it was the primary reason for the band 's renewed success . Had talked very little of `` Permanent Vacation '' or `` Pump '' -- two of Aerosmith 's greatest `` comeback '' albums -- and spent far more time on later releases , which were n't up to par IMO.Tyler 's certainly talented and I enjoyed listening to the narrator read the book as he seemed to be having a ball reading it . But in terms of the flow and some of the content covered , it was disappointing . After several stories of going into rehab , falling off the wagon , going back into rehab , falling off the wagon again ... well ... it 's the `` Same Old Song and Dance . ''	-1
This book reads like it was written by a beatnik influenced rock and roll star who used to trip on psychedelic drugs : Steven Tyler . If it was a painting it would be the loudest and largest piece of modern abstract imaginable . Tyler is frank and unguarded in his writing and shares many interesting details of his life and behind-the-scene events with his reader . However , because of the writing style , the book is difficult to read and may induce headaches.If this is actually how Mr. Tyler 's mind rockets along when he is awake , then he is indeed a mad genius and may have been self-medicating when indulging in drugs.Do not read unless you are big fan and are willing to slog through the writing style .	-1
How do you rate a well-written book that has a very bad plot ? Tobias Hill is obviously a very gifted writer . His command of the language is impressive to say the least . The imagery is beautiful , metaphors are effortless . Just a few subtle strokes is all it takes to set the mood for any given scene.Unfortunately , all the skills in the world could not save this book . Simply put , it 's boring . The narration crawls and meanders pointlessly for far too many pages . There are characters that do n't serve any purpose in the plot . There is the setting , Sparta , and non-stop mentioning of its culture , traditions and mysteries , which turn out almost completely irrelevant to the actual plot . The excerpts from the PhD thesis written by the novel 's protagonist are interspersed throughout the chapters . These also have nothing to do with the story , although ironically , they are one of the most interesting sections of the novel to read . It takes two thirds of the book to finally build up some semblance of suspense , but then comes the anticlimactic ending , and any hopes for a satisfying resolution of the plot come crashing to the ground .	-1
I 've enjoyed all of Robert Greene 's works so far . This one sucks . It resembles a bible , with gold-edged pages and a flexible pleather cover . It 's much shorter than his other books , which were about kings , generals , politicians , etc . who shaped history . This book is about a rapper . I understand the 48 Laws has become popular among the prison crowd . Mr. Greene must see a market for his writing in this low-life , criminal , street garbage . He does n't burden them with too much history or culture in this one . What a huge disappointment .	-1
How Jesus Became God does not have [ The Book of ] Revelation in the index or in the Table of Contents . For many Christians Jesus is elevated to God in the Book of Revelation.Second , Jesus becomes God at a time when Vespasian becomes a God , when Titus becomes a God , and when Domitian tries to become a God but the Senate passed Damnatio Memoriae on him ( nevertheless , Domitian is immortalized as Lord God in the Book of Revelation ) .The Christian Trinity was invented to put Jesus on a level with Jesus 's Father notion of God . And because Jesus said he would send an entity as satisfying as himself , the Holy Spirit , if you 're going to make Jesus equal with God , the Holy Spirit has to be part of the new Christian notion of God , the Trinity.Coming from an author who wrote about the historical accuracy of Jesus , Bart Ehrman must realize the Roman Empire , the influential context of Christianity 's nebula ( where stars are born ) , had a trinity in Vespasian , the father , Titus , the son and Son of Man , and Domitian.Jesus becomes God over the Roman Empire not until Emperor Constantine ? Jesus would need to become God when the Gospels , the Letters , and Revelation are written.I 've found the book incapable of explaining in a commendable way How Jesus Became God .	-1
The worst book ever . Not sure what made me buy it , but I hated it . Would not recommend it or ever read it again .	-1
I have been a fan of Joyce Carol Oates for many years and when I see she has released a new book , I 'm there to get it . However , Zombie left me chilled , and not from the dead bodies that seem to surround Oates ' protagonist -- so unforgettable I 've forgotten his name -- posing as a mild mannered young man , with a record , trying to fool mom , dad and grandma while he searches for the perfect , lobotomized love machine to spend the rest of his life with while holding down a job as the handyman at his parents ' rental unit.I can understand even a well-known author trying to get on the zombie train , but this novel was beneath Oates ' significant talent and weirdness .	-1
Save your money .

I 've read ( and own ) every Christopher Moore book and at least LIKED them all . Until this one . The story reads slow and heavily , tending toward too much detail on irrelevancies . I could n't even finish it because I started feeling like I wanted the time I 'd put into it so far returned to me .	-1
Looking for the usual adventure of the folks at Pine Cove in the Big Sur ? Not in this book . The typical humor is not there . I gave mine away to the local library before I finished it . This is sad because I have everything else Mr. Moore has published and have read and re-read the humor books until the pages started falling out .	-1
While it 's very clever to write a book that combines two major Shakespeare plays , an Edgar Allen Poe story and a molesting dragon for good measure , the cleverness can get very wearisome after a time . This book has some great passages and entertaining bits , but even in its finest moments , there is this underlying self-indulgence where you feel the writer smirking and going & # 34 ; Is n't this the most clever thing ? & # 34 ; That would n't be so bad , but there are points where the clever becomes & # 34 ; clever & # 34 ; and it seems like the kind of witticism that would be employed by teenage boys . In fact , at least half of the dialogue sounds like a teenage boy trying come up with new ways to swear at people . When you have characters from Othello and Merchant of Venice speaking the original Shakespeare dialogue , it 's usually best not to comment on it unless you have something truly interesting to say . If Shylock is giving his & # 34 ; do we not bleed ? & # 34 ; speech , no one wants to read another character responding with & # 34 ; let me test that theory & # 34 ; and acting threatening.This is an interesting book and for some , it might be an entertaining lark . If you still respond to & # 34 ; Romeo , Romeo where art thou Romeo ? & # 34 ; with & # 34 ; I 'm out there in the rose bushes . Could you let me in before your dog gets me ? & # 34 ; and laugh at the joke , then this is the book for you . Otherwise , you may either enjoy it as fluff or roll your eyes so much they bleed .	-1
I love reading novels set in places and cultures completely foreign to my own . I love reading about people ( both real and fiction ) whose lives are vastly different from my own . I love novels that give me a sense of place . I was expecting this novel to be one of those novels . However , I was disappointed . I found this book to be a challenging read for a number of reasons.When I first started this book , I found the characters to be engaging and interesting . But as the book went on , I found myself getting more and more bored . I found myself caring less and less what happened to them . Many of the characters in this book seemed flat to me . The reader is given a glimpse of the person 's life , but not really much insight into the person 's reactions and feelings to the event . Also , I found much of the story to be rather mundane and even boring at times . I believe that fiction is supposed to help you escape and give you the chance to experience from another person 's perspective.But probably the biggest complaint that I have about this book is the shifting point of view . That is one thing that really bugs me when reading fiction . Call me lazy , but when I read fiction , I do n't want to have to struggle to figure out whose point of view I 'm reading . I had to do that with this book . I had to keep interrupting the story to flip back to see whose point of view I was reading . In my opinion , this book would have been much stronger if it had been written from Jo 's perspective . Instead , the reader gets bounced around way too much . Another thing that really bugged me is that often there was a lot of overlap . So you would read the story from one person 's perspective , and then a short time later , read the same story from a different person 's perspective . I found that to be very distracting . For me , it was simply too much work reading this book . I finally gave up and quit . I read over half of the novel , but I just reached a point where I had no desire to read any further . That is not something I do very often . I do n't think I will be reading any of this author 's other works .	-1

First off , I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Jeaniene 's other books . Her Cat & Bones books are especially good . Being introduced to Vlad through her previous work has really built up my anticipation about getting to know him better.I had a hard time reading this book . This is not the Vlad that was so intriguing in the Cat/Bones series . He 's like a completely different personality . His relationship with Leila is not fleshed out . He came across as incredibly arrogant and repulsive . I was n't so thrilled with Leila either , who was weak , immature and did some really stupid stuff . ( Sure , Cat was immature at first , but we got to see her character develop , and with Bones ' guidance and maturity it all gelled nicely . Not here . ) Sorry , but the bit when she went clubbing - when she was allowed to go clubbing while her life was in danger , was ludicrous . This , after Vlad arrogantly assured her that `` nothing bad '' would ever happen to her while she was under his protection . I scoffeth ! He seems pretty incompetent for such a badass vamp . Credibility wanes.I had a real problem with Vlad being able to read her mind , too . This totally takes away all her privacy and leaves her exposed at all times . It removes the element of mystery . It detracts the personalization of Leila 's character . Things move too quickly . There 's no slow 'getting to know you ' , no real 'thrill of the chase , no romantic suspense , etc . To make matters worse , even despite the fact he 's totally in her head , it does n't feel like they make a connection beyond the physical . When things got intimate , it felt more like porn than romance , because it was n't based on anything . yawn ! Also , his dare for her to go out with other vampires under his roof was ick-worthy , and the results totally predictable.I do n't like the storyline either . It 's ponderous and lacking.I highly recommend all of Jeaniene 's other books , but not this one .	-1
I have to say that I have n't finished this book and will come back and edit this review when I have finished it . What I can report is that it is the second book in a series called the `` Scandalous Lady '' trilogy . It is meant to be a stand alone book , but I have found it to be so confusing , I have stopped reading it and will go back and read the first of the series , In Pursuit of a Scandalous Lady .	-1
I love romances - I read tons of them , but I find myself really confused by the glowing reviews for this book . I could n't like the male lead - man I ca n't even remember his name- yikes . I kept thinking , if this guy loves and respects her , why is he moving so fast ? I mean really - their first kiss he is groping her like a drunken frat boy . Ugh . Love is more than sex - and I just never saw the love part well developed here . That and the spy stuff was just silly - the father was supposed to be the `` spy trainer '' but somehow it 's delegated to his daugher who he supposedly loves and wants to protect , but sends her around unchaperoned with a bunch of rowdy men , hmm . I was actually reminded a lot of the Johanna Lindsey books I loved when I was 13 - but as a grown woman , I need something a bit deeper .	-1
I only read Regency era and half of this book was modern . the mainauthor ( Kathy Maxwell ) writes regency so I was fooled into thinking I would like all the contributing authors . Not so .	-1
I 've read a lot of books in the last few years on simplifying your life , minimizing possessions , and cutting down on clutter , and this is one of the less inspiring and helpful . I also found the premise to be a gross mischaracterization- by no means does the author live with only 100 possessions . He does not count any shared possessions toward his list of 100 things , and counting an entire library 's worth of books as 1 item seems to me to be cheating at his own goal from the outset . Why set an arbitrary goal like this and not follow it ? It is somewhat interesting to be privy to the thought processes and rationalizations that go into deciding what to keep and what get rid of , but this is not enough to sustain a whole book . The reearch about shopping habits and American consumerism just feels like padding . There is strong Christian theme to this book , which may make it more appealing to some and off-putting to others . In the end , this book feels like another one of those gimmicky author tries- to- do -something- for- a- year- and- writes -a -book -about- it projects that I usually like but in this case just did n't sustain my interest for a whole book . This would have been best left as a blog.This may inspire some readers , but other books are more informative , insightful , and entertaining.If you 're looking for a similar but more successful book , try `` Not Buying It '' by Judith Levine .	-1
Alex Rodriguez was one of 104 major league players who tested positive for steroids in baseball 's first-ever drug-testing program in 2003 . It was supposed to be a confidential test . But his test result was leaked to the media , and now Selena Roberts has used that tidbit to launch her 15 minutes of fame . If I was Major League Baseball I would make finding that leak a priority as it conveniently leaked just one name on the list . It smells like a vendetta and Roberts book reeks of it . Why in the world would anyone write a book that could be so damaging to a person without malice in their intent ? Okay Alex was wrong and he apologized for it so let 's move on except now we 're back in the controversy again . This book will garner an outpouring of support for Alex . This book was wrong from the start . DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK . IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING A CHARACTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AND THE GREEDY MOTIVATION OF A HORRIBLE SPORTS WRITER .	-1
I read `` A-Rod '' because I wanted to learn more about him now that he has been caught doping a second time . I had high expectations since Roberts worked for Sports Illustrated at the time and for the New York Times before that . Clearly , Roberts deserves credit for nailing A-Rod for using steroids the first time , and she has done a lot of reporting . But she and her editors violated the basic rule of journalism : show , do n't tell.Instead of making her case through her reporting , Roberts had to tell us repeatedly that Rodriguez is self-centered and cares only about his image . By the final third of the book , Roberts ' antipathy towards Rodriguez became too much for me.She needed a good editor . Which is a shame because the book could have been so much better .	-1
I love the show . Well I loved the show but after a while it 's kind of slowing down to me . Like the series is too stretched out . I got bored trying to figure out who A was so I stopped watching the show and gave the book a shot . The book moves way too slow for my liking . If you like the show though I 'd say it 's worth a shot .	-1
Very simple writing , characters not very likeable . Needed much more local color . I love southern settings but this one was not described in enough detail . Overall a disappointment	-1
I really wanted to love this book . When someone is as passionate about a subject as Asimov clearly is , you would like to join them in that enthusiasm . But this book turns out to be tedious , repetitive , and just no fun . Asimov has a clear position on wine : `` Ignore ratings , laugh at tasting notes , drink wine and enjoy it ! And search out interesting wines '' . But it is hard to make those precepts last a whole book . But , by repetition , Asimov makes it last at least 2/3 of the book . The remaining 1/3 was far more interesting : his career , his relationship with wine , his adventures . I think if the book had simply been a memoir of his life in journalism and with wine , with a chapter on his view of enjoying wine , I would have loved the book . As is , I hit the halfway point and was tired of him lecturing me on the same points over and over again .	-1
This book might have been better if the author had concentrated more on his patients and less on himself . More than half the book was about how he felt , how he reacted . Some of the cases are just silly . For instance , the naked lady who stood on her head did n't have a mental health problem . She was a diabetic who had not eaten . As soon as she drank some OJ she was fine and realized that she was in the ER , not at home doing yoga .	-1
Although it held my interest , I read technical reports as part of my work . I did not find this book any more thrilling than that . The story line is a contextual ploy to explore the post-Soviet corruption and return to a KGB oligarchy under Putin . It is largely a third-person personalized account , of someone investigating a story , rather than telling the story directly . There is little action , and it seems dry - more like a police report telling what happened - rather than having a skilled story-teller illustrate it and bring it to life .	-1
Many people have already written about the errors -- in my reading , one error per page is probably about right . Many of these errors are stunning . Most could have been avoided by some careful research or peer review before publication . I have the Kindle version as well as the Audible version , and there was obviously no quality control in the audio recording as well . A narrator is not born with the knowledge that military systems are referred to as `` Mark 14 '' or `` Mark 11 '' instead of sounding out the MK of the nomenclature as `` emkay '' . Obviously no intelligent editing of the narration .	-1
I wanted to really like this book , but honestly she just had way too many characters and was trying really hard to develop them all . And , in the end , the outcomes were all far too clich & eacute ; d in each storyline .	-1
This is an unfortunate book because it could have been much better . The author , a distinguished professor who has won writing awards , apparently froze when it came to dealing with a highly emotional subject . Rather than bringing us into a tragic and wrenching situation with insight and depth , he steps back and relates his story with good grammar and too much distance . One of the major tenets of good writing is the phrase `` show , do n't tell '' . Mr. Rosenblatt tells and rarely shows . I suspect that some of this is deliberate , to protect the privacy of his family , who are all undoubtedly suffering . I also believe some of it is inadvertent - having assumed a professorial air , he continues it with more comfort than he would have achieved if he had dug a little deeper . In brief , the memoir relates how he and his wife move in with his son-in-law to help raise their three grandchildren after the unexpected death of his daughter . Without going beneath the surface , though , the slim volume reads more like an extended essay along the lines of `` What I Did on My Summer Vacation '' , only this title is `` What We Did After Our Daughter 's Death '' . I do n't expect to wallow in sorrow , but the tone of this book is so dry it jars . I would n't be surprised to learn that Mr. Rosenblatt wrote this as an exorcism for himself . I hope it worked for him , but it did n't work for me .	-1
Only a romance in hell , this creepy one-note novel is a waste of time . On and on with & # 34 ; Daddy did n't do it , & # 34 ; please . I loved The Falls and Gravedigger but this was rancid drivel .	-1
Wow , I was hoping to find something a little more substantial in this book.Maybe this stuff worked in the 1950 's with a large mostly male workforce , but I 'd have a hard time seeing it being effective today.With section headings titled : '' Denial is n't just a river in Egypt '' And advice like `` Why are n't you working on Sunday 's '' or `` Why are you playing golf '' Or broad summary statements such as : '' Let your competition play golf while you stay in the office stealing their customers . `` Oh..how `` rose colored glasses '' that sounds.This book does n't balance modern motivational techniques with concrete business advice.With younger generations entering the workforce all the time , this information becomes more obsolete and more `` square peg in a round hole '' ... it just does n't fit .	-1
Thumbs down for plot line and delivery . Given the plot line , the story could only go so many ways . Sadly this one was predictable and the delivery was not that interesting or clever . Too many inuendoes about the characters resolved late in the book . The hasty wrap up was sappy but the most enjoyable . I did like how the characters ended up and in the end found the dad 's to be the most believable . You can have my ticket to the movie - not even sure I 'll Netflix it .	-1
I totally agree with `` riverscircus '' perfect review . The lady definitely knows her Crawford ! I agree that the photographic elements of this book are absolutely appalling , including the book 's cover ( I know exactly what website it was snagged from ) . The photos inside are of ghastly quality , pixilated and blurry . But more important than this , is that most aspects of Crawford 's life and career are merely glossed over in a paragraph or two . There simply is n't `` enough '' in this book . As others have stated , very little is new information in this book , and what IS new , is almost totally irrelevant.I was wildly excited about this book before it arrived ( due to the author 's good reputation and because I thought it would bring new insight into the woman known as Joan Crawford ) , only to discover it was half as long as his book on Marilyn Monroe , who lived half as long as Crawford ! The book reads like thrown-together-facts taken from , at times , dubious sources , and tossed out to the book stores .	-1
I have always been a fan of the old movie stars from the 30s , 40s and 50s and enjoy reading about their lives.But Spoto 's bio is so trite and silly it 's annoying at times.As a gay man , Spoto seems to always be looking for the gays in Joan 's life -pointing them out and spending more time on them than on Joan i.e . the hairdresser Sydney and Billy Haines and his significant other.Also the pictures -- -- OIY -- -the pictures . Spoto really should be ashamed ! He should have either withheld the grainy bad ones , found better ones or not moved forward with the book at all.There are NO pictures of Joan as a baby , as a toddler , as a young woman ! She was born in 1906 and the first picture of her is in 1922 -wow ! We have several unnecessary pictures of her husbands and loves yet NONE of her most famous movies including my favorite Possessed , Humoresque and The Damned Do n't Cry.I 'm sure Spoto put this sloppy thing together to make some money and return to his lover in Denmark . Honestly - pass on this slop .	-1
I 've been a Ted Bell and Alex Hawke fan since his first novel , Hawke , and have increased the ranks of his readership by recommending his books to others . I was excited to see that there was finally another Alex Hawke book to add to my collection , and I could not wait to read it . And then I could not wait to finish it because it was such a disappointment . I found myself wondering if his publisher is too cheap to provide him with an editor these days because the book reads like a rough draft . I lost count of how many repetitive words there were , or poorly constructed sentences . One more edit would have done this book a world of good , but I 'm not sure if it could overcome the silly plot.Though it uses world terrorism as a springboard , the story operates under the assumption that American readers are immensely invested in the British Royal Family . In past outings , Alex has saved the world from megalomaniacs , but this time , someone is out to get Prince Charles , and for some reason , they need to combine international leagues of terrorists to pull it off . In place of any sort of intrigue , the author instead twists real life tragedies into his plot , including the fire at Windsor Castle and Princess Diana 's death . While a somewhat clever device , it falls flat in what is supposed to be an adventure novel , and it became yawningly obvious after the first event.Ted Bell writes good novels for juveniles , but unfortunately , some of that flavor seems to have seeped into this series . I have long loved Alex Hawke and the other characters who appear alongside him in these books , but I had to force myself to read this messy , poorly edited novel with its ridiculous plot . To my chagrin , this series seems to be headed south . I 'll give Alex Hawke one more chance ... but will do so with reservations .	-1
I have really enjoyed the Hawke series of books . I noted in Tsar that suspension of disbelief needed to make it even remotely plausible was getting way out of line . With this book it has gone to the completely absurd to where the book is not as enjoyable as some of the previously more realistic works from Mr. Bell . I get that the plot lines have to stretch the realm of reality often times to seem fresh , but this is just so out there . It is clear to me Mr. Bell did a great deal of research into the field of singularity , and while it is an interesting topic , I believe it simply went too far in this novel to the point it could n't be taken seriously . A phone call with music , and suddenly top scientific minds commit unthinkable acts of terror ? I also have gotten to the point that I simply can not even take Hawke 's background and heritage seriously any longer . An MI-6 agent whose family left him a fortune that enables him to have his own personal G5 , and his own operating budget within MI6 that is equivalent to the entire MI6 budget itself ? Come on . Then there is the plot , the villain in a flying wheel chair , the underwater computer , the parallel universe nonsense , mind control , etc ? Much of this book can be summed up in one word : absurd.I will add that I really did enjoy the last many chapters of the novel . Once the computer was done , and villain in his flying wheel chair eliminated , I felt like the naval battle was incredibly well done . Upon reflecting further on the book , I would n't say it was a total loss because there were many thought provoking tings as well as some really great , and realistic action over the last 10 chapters . I do still look forward to the next Alex Hawke book from Mr. Bell . I think my initial thoughts were a bit hasty , and upon thinking about it a bit I would give it a rating of `` okay '' . There are some great moments here , but some of the ride to along the way to get to them was a bit more painful than I would have liked .	-1
I was expecting more from this book given when it takes place , the location and the very promising start . It fizzled very quickly as the setting and time were pushed to the background and instead a predictable plot ( even in pre-war Hungary , it is the evil businessman taken down by the intrepid reporter ) and shallow , barely likeable characters dominate the story line . The little reference to Bernie Gunther was a cute touch but also reminded this reader that Zsygmund Gordon is no Bernie Gunther and Mr. Kind of has a way to go to master this genre .	-1
Men like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday have become the mythic heroes of the America West , and the gunfight at the O.K . Corral has passed from mere historic event into the land of legends . Yet the women who accompanied these men have largely been forgotten . Josephine Sarah Marcus Earp , Wyatt 's companion of nearly five decades , was a Jewish girl from San Francisco . In her youth , she landed in Tombstone , Arizona and met the love of her life . Together with Wyatt Earp , she traveled all over the country in search of new opportunities , from the Gold Rush boomtowns of Alaska to some of the greatest cities in California . During her lifetime , she frequently lied and changed the story about her background , making it difficult to trace what truly happened , but Ann Kirschner 's access to new primary source documents allows this biography a fresh new take on the life of the companion of one of the Old West 's most famous lawmen.Josephine 's story is undoubtedly a fascinating one - but unfortunately , it is n't told here . For example , the first chapter of the book , `` A Jewish Girl in Tombstone '' , focuses almost entirely on the Earp brothers and the drama that led up to the infamous O. K. Corral gunfight . Josephine is mentioned only as speculation - she `` may have '' and `` could have '' done many things , but exactly what she did remains unknown . This pattern continues in later chapters ; in the chapter about Wyatt 's time in Alaska we learn much about the history of the boom town Nome and Wyatt 's business adventures , but frustratingly Josephine remains in the background . It is n't until Wyatt Earp passes away that Josephine finally becomes the focus of her own biography - and by then , she has become a cantankerous old woman scrabbling for money and trying to preserve Wyatt 's heroic image while obscuring the more salient details of their past.Sometimes it seemed like the author was trying to force Josephine into prominence in situations that she did n't seem especially central . In the introduction , Kirschner writes , `` The Gunfight at the O. K. Corral was a love story , fought over Josephine Marcus '' and `` ... the [ shootout ] where the central character was Josephine and the prize was love ? '' But in the chapter that wrote extensively about the O.K . Corral incident , there are a myriad of reasons given for the gunfight , and the 'love story ' seems relatively minor in the sea of political and personal grudges.It may be that there are too many divergent tellings of Josephine 's life , since she frequently lied about her past , or it may be that information about her just is n't available . She is not the star of her own biography - once again , it is her fate to be overshadowed by her famous lover .	-1
Slightly boring , it was difficult getting through the whole thing . Only finished in hopes it would get better . Love the show version	-1
What is up with these Vegan cookbook authors creating recipes with nothing but processed , store bought , already packaged meat ? What ever happened to Seitan as a meat alternative , and how to make Seitan at home ? These authors are missing the point when creating these cookbooks . People want recipes with ingredients that are simple , reasonable and easy to come by . Making Seitan at home saves you lots of money and its a really versatile meat alternative that you can create to taste like any meat you want , just like tofu . It 's almost like these authors are partners with these packaged meat companies , helping them out by putting their products in the cookbooks . I think a lot of these authors are too lazy to do their research and give readers what they are looking for , but yet they jack up the price of their book !	-1
The ideas are solid but the execution is weak . It 's the kind of thing you 'd see in a magazine article , not in a full price hardcover book . It 's more like an outline than a fully fleshed out and thought-out , well-written book . Yet the subject matter is relevant and certainly of wide interest . That 's why it was a disappointment . I really wanted something more solid from this .	-1
My hat 's off to Gary for running such a lucrative scam , but this is less a book than it is a really long bumper sticker you ca n't wait to stop reading . If you think anyone 's going to pay you to blog then you 'd better stay in school and learn how to write a heck of a lot better than this guy 's editor .	-1
Because , if we 're honest , The Incredibleswas really for the adults , with its styling from the Golden Age of Comics Books , not to mention the midlife crisis story arc.Illustrator Jake Parker did n't work on that Pixar masterpiece* , but his artwork is easily mistaken for it , and packs the same two-fisted punch of innocence and arrogance . * A September 4th review from the Los Angeles Times mistakenly credits Jake Parker with The Incredibles . Presumably the reviewer confused him with animator Bret Parker ( no relation ? ) who has worked on a half dozen Pixar films.Novelist Michael Chabon 's text is suitably juvenile , yet the Pulitzer Prize-winning author is not beyond criticism . My own sensitivities demand at least mild indignation at the unnecessary inclusion of negative exclamations ( `` What the heck '' and `` Shoot ! '' ) . The story seemed a little short , and the reveal was obvious even at mid-point ( `` I 'm going to tell my mo -- '' ) . Most critically , Chabon misses an opportunity to portray the boy-as-superhero as doing anything superhero worthy in his real life . Surely even a day in the life of a normal boy would present ample opportunities to do a good deed ? I ca n't find anything to complain about the artwork . Parker 's work offers many hidden treasures that will continue to delight on subsequent readings , even if the story plateaus . The final two-page spread is my favorite , where we see hints of the fantasy , both in his sister 's drawings and also his own shadow , the latter a reverse from four pages prior . ( Look closely . ) Jason Kirkfield , Vine Review , September 26 , 2011	-1
The first ten pages are funny . After that Its unlikable characters stuck in a ridiculous plot . Seems out of date . Had a hard time finishing this book .	-1
Reading James Rollins gives one a tremendous experience of deja vu . These adventures seem to be cobbled together from everything and everywhere in a hit or miss way that keeps the reader asking himself if he 's read this before . Well , he has . Probably in childhood adventure stories and all the modern thriller writers . Only it 's all been done better and it 's all been done to death . While this `` writer '' may have a following , I prefer not to read light thrillers that should have footnotes giving credit to other source material . Maybe something original would be nice . All authors build on the work of others but they all do n't borrow as blatantly and produce epics like these in a by-the-numbers method on an assembly line .	-1
Good premise to begin but this got more and more out there as it went . I 'm sorry I continued to devote time to it so I could get to the finish -- it was wierd , unbelieveable and amaturish . Do n't bother with this one .	-1
This story starts like so many other teenage novels with a girl who is desperately in love with her boyfriend . He , of course , dumps her and she 's completely heartbroken . She 's taken in by a group of girls whose sole purpose is to break boys ' hearts using `` magic '' that is n't really magic at all-more like just their opinions and dating advice , and not good advice at that.The story itself is predictable and unoriginal . The protagonist is annoying-she cries every other page and as she gets `` stronger '' she just turns into a whiny teenage girl who is n't ever truly happy with anything . Overall , I 'd say , skip it-it 's nothing new and definitely not good compared to a lot of the other teenage novels that are out there !	-1
My daughter loves Pinkalicious . These stickers are very cute and faithful to the Pinkalicious books . But , these stickers are hardly reuseable . They tear easily , they curl up and do not re-stick very well at all . My daughter has a couple of Melissa & Doug reuseable sticker sets and colorform sets and these products are far far superior in quality to the Pinkalicious set .	-1
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ( LOL ) ! ! ! ! The story goes that Pinkalicious receives a pair of ice skates as a surprise gift , but instead of being thankful , Pinkalicious does n't like them . After all , they are n't pink ! They are plain , boring white . So what does she do ? Get pink marker and color all over them . She does not get reprimanded for this , although you can tell the mom is n't pleased by her facial expression . By the end of the book , the mom apologizes for her original dislike of the defaced skates and says that they are perfect . If I bought my child clothing or shoes and she marked all over them ... well ... it would not be okay . Additionally , in the book when the pink comes off the skates , it makes pretty swirls all over the ice , and the skates themselves end up being a beautiful pattern of swirls . Quite unlike the mess of stained EVERYTHING that would happen with marker bleeding everywhere , not to mention that any pair of skates colored by a small child are going to look hideous . We used the book as an object lesson of what would happen if my kids EVER marked up their clothes/shoes , what they might do if they did n't like the color ( first express thanks and appreciation for the gift , then ask if it comes in other colors ) and finally , it was a lesson in recycling.This book gets two stars from me only because the words were the appropriate level for new readers . The plot , however , gets zero stars . Kids do n't need to read stories where the protagonist does awful things and then gets rewarded for it .	-1
I like the Pinkalicious books but was very disappointed in this one . I come from Regina , Sk. , Canada and have skated a great deal . Skates do n't get wet when you skate and they do n't leave pretty swirls in the ice . Water does when it is fluid but ice is a solid and when you are learning to skate and falling on the ice , you would leave blotches not swirls .	-1
After reading this book I am going to seek out all of the less favorable reviews on Amazon before I purchase my next selection . I am amazed at the rave reviews of this book ... . it has too many characters , a confusing storyline and an unbelievable ending . I expected much more for my money .	-1
This book received great reviews all over the place , and I 'm really not quite sure why . Setting most of the action in a sort-of-like-the-Cinque-Terre-but-not kind of town was a lovely idea , but it did n't really work . The Italians did not ring true . Nor did the idea of Richard Burton tooling around with someone else who was not Elizabeth Taylor . That said , here 's hoping Hollywood 's snapped up the rights , as it 'll make a lovely movie . In fact , it will probably make a better movie than it did a book .	-1
After reading this book , I can see why Michael Crichton never had it published during his lifetime , and let it simply waste space on his hard-drive.The characters are flat , the events of the story are rushed through at times and bloated at others , the women are useless save as sex objects ... I would spend more time breaking down my critiques on this book , except that I feel I have now spent more time reviewing the book than Crichton spent writing it , which is really too bad , because Crichton , at his best , was fun and filled with helpful facts . He is neither here .	-1
I thought that it would be a great piece of historical romance but there was n't much to the story . I did n't like the characters at all you could n't relate to them . They never tell you who they are nor what they are feeling . I was annoyed by them and could not gather any feelings for them at all.Hal is assigned to Cyprus and takes his wife and girls along with him . An insurrection breaks out and he and his men are put in an anti terrorist role.While Hal is off fighting and running the men , Clara is home afraid and wants him to protect them . Hal wants to be there for his family but never communicates with them . Their marriage begins to crumble and neither of them communicate anything to the other.Hal is told of some bad things that happened between his men and the natives . He arrests them but in the end he is made to look bad to his superiors and his career suffers . All the while Clara is with the girls who get sick and she has to care for them on her own.Clara gets pregnant . He sends her off to another city which is safer . She makes a friend . He writes to her and she never writes back . She changes her mind and writes him but he is too overcome to read it.There are several family Crises . But in the end nothing is wrapped up and the couple still have some world class issues in their marriage .	-1
Typically , Mr. Martini writes books that I really enjoy reading . I am convinced that Mr. Martini did not write this book . From the beginning , the story lacked cohesion and sense . I started the book over , convinced I had missed something - but I really did n't miss a thing . The plot was n't thought out , and there was all sorts of dangling nonsense everywhere.I wo n't be surprised when someone finally comes out and says , that this was co-written or ghost written by somone other than Mr. Martini !	-1
I am a huge Steve Martini fan and have been thoroughly enjoying the ongoing saga of Paul Madriani , but this one was different . In this story and the previous one , Martini has added a love interest that I find stupidly silly . The dialogue between Paul and Jocelyn to be fatuous and wholly unnecessary ; I find it distracting from the plot of the story and ruins the story all together . At times , I stopped , closed the book to the front cover to confirm who the author was.Come on , Steve , kick the girl to the curb , grab Harry Hinds and Herman , and go catch the bad guys ! ! !	-1
$ 14.99 Kindle price ... why ? ? ? For what ? Paper ? Ink ? Labor ? WHAT ? ? ? ? Obnoxious Kindle pricing deserves an obnoxious review . SHAMEFUL ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The title says it all : gossip . It reads like a second rate version of & # 34 ; Sex and the City & # 34 ; , or again like a blog for women with a lot of money , and not much to strive for in life .	-1
I 'd planned on skipping Hidden and after finishing it , I wish that I had . I read the first two ( and ultimately the third ) of the Firelight books because they were simple , easy and light -- the break I really needed from my hectic college schedule -- but at times , I found them to be incredibly infuriating and monotonous . I 'd told myself that I was n't going to spend the money on Hidden , that I did n't really need it and truth be told , I did n't really want it , but I broke down ... unfortunately.My greatest problem with Hidden was not the huge problem I 'd had with Firelight and Vanish -- Jacinda 's repetitive and dull narration . Hidden 's real problem was that it did n't serve as the finale I 'd hoped for . We find out what happened to Jacinda 's father , but justice is never truly served . We never really understand what motivates the enkros , who have been the real `` bad guys '' through the series , or what makes them different from the hunters . Jacinda also spends the majority of the climax unconscious , which is n't entertaining and also feels like a cop out on the author 's part.The book 's final moment left a lot to be desired as well . It was all too easy , as if nothing from the past two books had mattered . As a reader , it felt rushed and overly convenient . I wo n't spoil anything , but there is a lot of hand holding and oh-my-goodness are n't we all appropriately happy despite everything that has happened type moments.My last problem was that I did n't think the novel had enough explanation . There were a lot of things I 'd forgotten in the year since I 'd read Vanish and a lot of things were just thrown in there as if I would remember them and then I was struggling to catch up . I do n't think occasionally throwing in a modifier or explaining a situation really hurts a story , and I know that it would have helped me as a reader . I 'm sure that some people would disagree on this point , but I know that I was struggling to remember finer plot points from the two previous stories.2 stars for the series , barely 1 for Hidden .	-1
This is the selection for 50 % of our elections ? Are you kidding me ? I recommend reading `` Going Rouge '' the nightmare book is more accurate as to what a disaster she will be in office . This country is pathetic . People parroting `` She is really down to earth . '' You are all maniacs that like this woman and nobody when I ask them can correctly identify 5 true points that qualify this woman to run for more than dog catcher . We will not get what we deserve if the village idiots in this country are not thinned from the herd real quick .	-1
Nicolle Wallace , the senior McCain campaign adviser , has responded to Palin 's ugly accounts of the McCain campaign in `` Going Rogue : '' . In a nutshell Wallace has said that Palin 's book is based on fabrications . In short Palin is a liar . Palin is the woman that could see Russia from her house ! Remember ? Now , Palin is blaming her clumsy behavior and laughable guffaws on others . It was McCain that brought Palin onto America 's political stage . Instead of thanking him Palin turns on him like a snake . First it was the liberal press ' fault . Now it 's the McCain Team 's fault . I do n't care if Palin is the princess of FAUX News . Those that drink the Rush Limbaugh koolaide are infatuated with Palin ; but , the possibility of having this unqualified , unstable and untruthful person in the White House should send chills up the spine of all Americans who can think .	-1
Riffling through this book only reinforced the view I had of Sarah Palin . Shortly after Palin was thrust onto the national political stage by the old and reckless McCain it became clear that she was an utter farce . There is no substance to her whatsoever.Count me among at least 25 % of Republicans who will not vote for her no matter what . While conceivably she could win the GOP nomination , it would be inconceivable if she did n't lose the general election by a landslide . Sarah , take all the moola you make from your magnum opus and retire from politics for good .	-1
About five minutes after Sarah Palin burst into the 2008 Republican National Convention , I recognized her as an airhead . After all , I am a high school teacher with 35 years in the classroom -- I know a ditzy cheerleader type when I see them . This is exactly the book one of my airhead students would have written . Shallow , empty , whiny , poor little me.A friend bought this book , told me I just had to read it , and loaned her copy to me . I read it . Thank goodness I did n't waste my own money on it .	-1
The question is not how the author of `` I know this much is true '' wrote a book like this , that 's easy Two or three hours to kill , a long plane ride etc . This book hopefully did n't take lamb more than two or three hours to write . The question is why would a great author like this write `` Wishin and Hopin '' ? A social experiment to see how many people would buy something this boring ? Write a book that Khaled Hosseini ( Kite Runner ) would n't steal all the themes from ? ( that 's my guess ) or to see what he could write in a weekend.At any rate it is a very disapointing effort from a great writer . Re-read anything else by Wally Lamb instead of this book . You will be happy you did .	-1
Cookie cutter Wally Lamb . Flashback style without compelling characters . Annie is central character but the rest of the family 's issues distract rather than enhance her story line . What to the initial story withe the Jones brothers . I was disappointed	-1
A Harvard trained theologian reflects on her current inability to believe in G-d , the history of her relationship with G-d and religion , and her life choices , interspersed with bowdlerized versions of the image of G-d as discussed in the works of some of the great theologians she must have read during graduate school.It 's painful to me to be this critical of a memoir that obviously reflects something the author feels deeply about , but to read yet again that a missing sense of self-esteem from childhood caused the author first to seek refuge from the pain of her life in religion and then to struggle with the frameworks in which she found it is neither new nor surprising . That the organized Christian denominations are filled with people who seek to put G-d in a box is also no new message ; neither is the claim that a lot of people who work in religion are hypocritical or not especially self-aware ( this is a problem with humans in general ) . Nothing that the author writes is particularly introspective beyond a very superficial level : that she encountered pain as a consequence of existing and that her experiments in religion were not able to help her address this problem for long . That she skirts whining about her suffering seems more of an accident than anything else . I wish she had paused in writing to think a bit more about her context in the world and herself in relationship to others besides her family and lover -- she had an episode as a TFA instructor in a poverty-ridden neighborhood in Compton that would have born more detailed analysis as to what the problems were that underlie her world and her psyche . Doing so with a bit more self-criticism would have made this book more interesting to read . One suspects that this book will embarrass her in about ten years .	-1
To each his own . I found this to be nothing more than a story , a legend put together by someone at some time between the 2nd and 5th centuries to fill in details of an already made up story ( the account of the Magi in Matthew ) . No historical interest whatsoever . But if you like a good legend , then I can see why you might enjoy this one.If you are looking for any historical connections or `` real '' explanations for the original of the Magi story in Matthew , then you wo n't find it here.The author 's introduction is n't all that interesting either . It basically goes through a summary of the story itself and then talks about what little is known of its origin and how he went about finding that small amount of information .	-1
This is the worst book I have read in years . Thank goodness I borrowed it and did n't buy it . O'Reilly is not a good apologist for the right , he is an embarrassment .	-1
Bill O'Reilly 's ` Lincoln ' book banned from Ford 's Theatre because of ` mistakes'By Steven Levingston , Saturday , November 12 , 5:40 PMOf all the places you 'd expecco-author Martin Dugard have displayed a serial disregard for historical fact.For a purported history of the assassination -- an `` unsanitized and uncompromising ... no spin American story , '' as the authors put it , `` Killing Lincoln '' is sloppy with the facts and slim on documentation , according to a study conducted by Rae Emerson , the deputy superintendent of Ford 's Theatre National Historic Site , which is a unit of the National Park Service.Other Lincoln experts also have sounded off . In a review published in the November issue of `` North & South -- The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society , '' historian Edward Steers Jr. cites many instances where the book strays from documented history , then asks , `` If the authors made mistakes in names , places , and events , what else did they get wrong ? How can the reader rely on anything that appears in ` Killing Lincoln ' '' ? By taking on Lincoln , O'Reilly and Dugard have set themselves up for avid scrutiny . Few presidents , indeed few subjects , are as voluminously researched and fought over as Lincoln , and have as many amateur and professional specialists eager to display their startling command of minutiae . Steers notes that more than 16,000 books and articles have been written about Lincoln , with more than 125 volumes on the assassination . Oddly , he adds , only eight of the assassination books have been written by professional historians , leaving the field , in his view , to be trampled on by amateurs like Reilly and Dugard.Eric Foner , a history professor at Columbia who has written about the Civil War , Lincoln and the South for 40 years and whose latest book , `` The Fiery Trial : Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery '' was showered with awards -- the Pulitzer Prize , Bancroft Prize , and Lincoln Prize -- said he had not read the book in question . But he noted in an e-mail , `` I would not be surprised if there were historical errors as [ O'Reilly ] is better known as a TV polemicist than as a scholar . Of course many people outside the academy have written about Lincoln and the assassination , but all sorts of unproven theories about it abound and one would hope that any writer would make use of all the relevant sources ( and avoid historical errors ) in writing about the subject . `` `` Killing Lincoln '' has no footnotes . An afterword on sources lists `` books , websites , and other archived information '' the authors consulted . But to Steers , the list is inadequate , leaving out important primary documents . `` The authors have chosen to write a story based . . . [ on ] a few dozen secondary books that range from excellent to positively dreadful . . . [ with ] no vetting . . . treating them as equal , '' Steers writes . Among the criteria that earn a book a place in the Ford 's Theatre store are that it is `` historically accurate . . . has relevant citations [ and uses ] primary resources with documentation , '' Emerson notes in her report.Some of the errors in `` Killing Lincoln '' are minor . According to Steers , the authors misidentified theater owner John Ford 's chief carpenter as James J. Clifford when his name actually was James J. Gifford . Emerson found that the book was wrong on the number of times the play `` Our American Cousin '' was performed at Ford 's Theatre before Lincoln saw it on the fateful night . In the O'Reilly-Dugard tale there were eight previous performances ; in reality , there were seven.The authors demonstrate their carelessness in an array of other slip-ups . The farm of Samuel Mudd , the doctor who was convicted of conspiring in the assassination , was 217 acres , according to Steers , not 500 acres as O'Reilly and Dugard write . Some errors may have sneaked in because the authors applied a lazy modern eye to history . By a 20th century mental reflex , O'Reilly and Dugard placed President Lincoln in the Oval Office -- every living American knows that the president holds important meetings in the Oval Office . But Lincoln ? Impossible . The Oval Office came into being in 1909 during the Taft administration.Some in the online world have taken the opportunity to equate the errors in the book with O'Reilly 's bombastic TV persona . When a discussion on the Civil War Interactive DiscussionBoard turned up some gaffes , a contributor who goes by the name Cogswell Pepperbox chimed in : `` Wait , what ? Bill O'Reilly playing loose & fast with the facts , promulgating errors without sourcing ? Shocking . `` What most irks Steers is the book 's portrait of conspirator Mary Surratt , which sacrifices truth for drama . O'Reilly and Dugard write that when she was n't on trial she had to wear a padded hood that disfigured her and made her claustrophobic ; that she was `` sick and trapped '' in a cell that was `` barely hospitable '' aboard the monitor Montauk ; and that she had `` a haunted , bloated appearance '' because of the experience . To which Steers replies : `` None of this is trut to find Bill O'Reilly 's new history `` Killing Lincoln : The Shocking Assassination That Changed America Forever , '' Ford 's Theatre -- the site of the dreadful act -- should rank right at the top . But you 'd do better to search for the bestseller on Amazon because it has been banned from the theater 's store.The crime ? O'Reilly and hise . Mary Surratt was never shackled or hooded at any time . She was never imprisoned aboard the Montauk . . . . This mischaracterization of Mary Surratt is unfortunate , and helps to perpetuate the myth of her innocence and her brutal treatment at the hands of the Federal government . `` The sales of `` Killing Lincoln '' attest to the fact that TV celebrity and strong storytelling trump accuracy . Since its publication the book has been riding at the top of the bestseller list , and soon after its release O'Reilly signed a contract to write two more books , one of which will be another presidential history.For all his criticisms , Steers praises the narrative as a `` pleasant read '' that is `` well written and flows ... rather nicely . '' He seems more disappointed than indignant over its failings . `` Had the authors done their homework and made use of the available sources of primary documents , they would have written a book much closer to actual facts . They missed a golden opportunity . ''	-1
Pinheads and patriots . We all know which category Bill O falls into . Try as he may , he just is not clever .	-1
Although the subject is interesting , and something I knew nothing about , I thought the story was predictable . I certainly respect the research and the effort that went into bringing this story to us , however .	-1
This book felt so incomplete it was n't funny . It was very frustrating leaving relationship question marks left and right . Wade starting to say something about sex and was interrupted leaving you wondering did he mean with him or Trent . I 'm really starting to lose interest . The reason I started reading this series was because of Ivy and Rachel , once they kept hammering into my head that she will never want to have a sexual relationship with Ivy I started to wonder why I was still reading this series . Also there has been no mention of Rachel actively working on how to save Ivy 's soul.A little reminder to the author , we have n't lost focus maybe she should check her focus and the plots that are being forgotten .	-1
I was really looking forward to my advanced copy of this book through the Vine Program . I love this series . However , the anticipation was for naught . The book was slow and I found myself barely skimming large chunks to get to the better stuff . However , the `` better stuff '' was few and far between . Phin is a back story character introduced in book 3 of this series . He should have stayed a back story . His character is flat and silly . Bryn 's history is barely touched on leaving the reader to wonder why she is the way she is . You would have to go back and re-read the other twelve books in the series to refresh your memory since the author does gives bit and pieces of Bryn 's past in older books . However barring that one is left trying to make sense of something that can not be made sense of in this one book . It is definitely not a stand alone book and you would have to have read the previous books in the Love at Stake series to make heads or tails out of this story . If you 've read the other books and remember the back stories you 'll probably enjoy this book . If you 're new the series do not start here -- go back and start at book one . And for those that read the series but are n't die hard fans you 'd probably be better off skipping this book as well as waiting for the next installment , you might have better luck .	-1
The main reason I could not enjoy this book was because of my unfamiliarity with or aversion to many of the heroines discussed . As a child , I did not have a relationship with the likes of Jo March , Anne of Green Gables , or Mary from The Secret Garden . Nor have I developed an appreciation for romantic 19th century English literature as characterized by Bronte and Austen . Unlike the author , I have not repeatedly immersed myself in the familiar titles she references . The only chapters I could really identify with were the ones discussing A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and To Kill a Mockingbird . I disliked Little Women , I had to read Their Eyes Were Watching God as a college assignment , and I completely skipped over the chapter about Claudine.In general , though , I felt the author wrote this book for herself to justify why these authors and characters mean so much to her . Though she does identify the correlation between the author 's lives and the subjects they wrote about , there is nothing groundbreaking presented here . It is really just a compilation of general knowledge and plot summaries . I really do n't see other women picking it up to acquire life lessons or to discover hidden meaning in the books discussed . While I understand her emphasis that it is important to find escape in reading , I do n't think a majority of readers can relate to the author 's need to revisit these books again and again .	-1
Absolutely no scholarship , just one opinion after another , with some actual dates , and a lot of made up `` facts . '' The author ca n't go a single page without injecting an opinion as a `` fact . '' I was looking for a brief history of the United States and thought this book looked good . I started it once , made it about half the way through before I gave up on the author , and years later picked it up again , thinking it could n't be as bad as I remembered . This time I made it about 2/3 the way , but ended up throwing the book away so no one else would get suckered into wasting any time on this steaming pile of stuff . It reminds me of a Peanuts comic I once read . One of the characters asks Lucy how she knows all the obscure facts that she is spouting . Her response is `` I make them up . '' The author of this book ascribes intent to parties that are long dead , and gives no authority for any of his opinion except the opinions of other like minded haters . You would have to be an idiot to take this piece of hate speak seriously .	-1
This book is sad in more ways than one.Farrah is chasing life and it seems like at least someone in the medical field should have said enough with the procedures , let 's focus on making her more comfortable while she is still here . I ca n't help but wonder if the doctors , here in the US and in Europe , saw dollar signs when they saw Farrah . All of those painful procedures must have cost a bundle.In my opinion the book is 2 stories intertwined into one . Farrah 's story of her doctor visits and procedures and Alana 's autobiographical story . You sure do learn a lot about Alana Stewart , i.e . her relationships , her children and their issues , her health , her financial situation , her love life.And one ca n't help but wonder if Alana thought that the release of this book will help aid her financially . After all , through out the book she is expressing concern about her financial situation . Shocking , right ? I mean this is suppose to be about her life , love and friendship WITH Farrah . The only glimmers you get about the two of them together are brief narrations of pictures , of the two of them , that are scattered through out the book .	-1
... it 's not worth the 7.99 you shell out . Normally , I enjoy most DBF books . But Caroline Wimbley is simply an awful heroine . There she is , judging her nieces and sister-in-law as trash ; while she sleeps around more than they do . What lends this character her meant-to-be-accepted without question , high moral ground ? Nothing . The way she treats and speaks about her nieces is appalling . What adult picks on kids to make themselves feel better about their own messed-up life ? Caroline Wimbley does ; but readers are supposed to accept this as rational behavior because it 's The South , 'eah ? At least , rational behavior from a character that is painted to be entitled to their nastiness.Honestly , take a pass on this book . I dislike heroines that are n't meant to be the anti-heroine , but still are - as long as you suspend your disbelief . There 's nowhere to slot their personalities.DBF should have known better than to revisit the least likeable character she 's ever created .	-1
I would give this book a -0 had it been available . The previous book & this one are not of Frank 's previous quality . I may try one more & if there 's no improvement I wo n't be buying anymore . What 's happened to the once wonderful books produced by Franks ?	-1
Weird . Disconnected . Blah . Never got to know who Cary Grant . Not a love story . I managed to finish though it was hard .	-1
I find it interesting when a non-Mormon attempts to write about the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . I 've seen mixed reviews about this book and I was interested enough to check it out of my library.The novel is mildly compelling , but the characters are one-dimensional and the story was somewhat contrived . I do think the persecution and mob scenes were accurate , and the conflict that Mary Rose and Bronwyn shared as they struggled with polygamy was believable . I do n't think that any woman asked to practice plural marriage would automatically accept it unconditionally . However , there are multiple sides to every story . Those early saints who practiced polygamy did so because they believed it to be a commandment from God . Those who entered into it with a spirit of obedience and love seemed to be blessed . Others struggled with it and to say that everyone had a positive experience with polygamy is as incorrect as portraying all polygamous marriages as miserable . The LDS church discontinued the practice a hundred years ago and it 's in the past , but the fascination and negativity remains.I appreciate that Diane Noble did her research and documents it . Still , there are inaccuracies and I would hope that those reading this do n't take it as a completely accurate portrayal of the LDS church at the time.I did n't hate this story , but I did n't love it , although it was fascinating . I will admit to being disappointed in some of the discussion questions at the end , as many are negative towards the LDS church . For a different perspective on a polygamous marriage and one based on factual history , check out Season of Sacrifice by Tristi Pinkston.I will probably read the next two books in the trilogy , just to see where Diane Noble goes with this story , especially after the family arrives in Salt Lake City . I simply do n't see her having Mary Rose accept this lifestyle .	-1
I was so looking forward to reading this book and was quite disappointed . While the author did a great job of introducing the characters , their actions did n't stay true . For Harmony to have left her religious community as she is unhappy with who she wants to marry is quite believable . However , for her to throw away all her religious upbringing to fall into bed with a sperm donor romeo was too far of a stretch . I also found the switching back and forth of the narration between the twins confusing . Not a keeper .	-1
Man oh man this book SUCKED big time . I remember really enjoying McCafferty 's writing style in her Jessica Darling series , so I assumed that I would like this book as well . After all in one of the publicity videos McCafferty promises that readers will laugh throughout the novel . I think it is safe to say that both McCafferty and I have never been so wrong in our entire lives . Ms. McCafferty I only laughed once . Epic fail.The premise is interesting and if delivered correctly , could make a decent series but the delivery fell extremely flat with the exception being the last twenty pages . Seriously nothing worthwhile happens in the majority of the novel and then all of a sudden crap hits the fan . If you think that is going to bring readers like me back for round two with `` Thumped '' you are sadly mistaken . Since the Darling series was so good I will pretend this little mistake never happened and wait for you to redeem yourself.The characters are hardly developed throughout the novel . The dialogue is shallow and uninteresting . The writing is painful to shift through . Books like this give me hope that maybe someday I too can become a published author . Overall I feel incredibly let down and so very disappointed.To anyone who is thinking of picking up this book , do yourself a favor and forget it even exists . Seriously .	-1
Maya and her family have moved to Paris for a year , because of her father 's job . Maya and her younger brother James are soon introduced to a variety of unusual characters . But most peculiar of all is the old house with a salamander on the door that seems to move . Maya discovers that she has relatives in town with many secrets . And one is the Keeper of the Cabinet of Earths , but the cabinet seems to want Maya for its new Keeper.I really wanted to enjoy this one . But the Cabinet itself and the plot line were hard to grasp and not explained well enough . The saving grace for me was the characters . Maya and her cousin who is almost invisible , her friend Valko , and the mysterious rich elite who do n't seem to age - these engaging characters kept me involved in the story . This bizarre tale of magic and immortality may appeal to its target audience of middle grade readers , but it the strange plot fell short for me .	-1
I really wanted to like this book but I just dislike plots where the hero lives the heroine at the alter . I expected a grand passion of him coming back just for her proving this time he really wanted her not his dreams but this book was a let it was mostly about him getting the funds for his dreams . I never thought the hero love the heroine that much and felt this book was dry . I 've read previous books by the author I expected better not this tepid plot with unlikable characters .	-1
The heroine in this book was one of the most unlikeable characters I 've ever encountered in a book ( she was a chain smoking manipulative witch ) and I spent the part of the book I could stomach ( she was so unlikeable I could n't finish the book ) hoping the likable hero would actually end up with someone decent . I usually really like this author , but this book was a waste of paper and time .	-1
I thought this might be like the Kim Harrison series or the Charlene Harris series . It 's not even in the ball park as far as I 'm concerned . After a couple of chapters I just gave up . It was just too boring to waste time on . Do n't buy it if you are a fan of Harrison or Harris books because you will be disappointed . If you just like paranormal stuff , no matter how unbelievable it is , then you might like it because the author writes well enough .	-1
Had some high hopes for this book . So disappointed . The author is so annoyingly naive , so `` I just know that every event in my life happens because the world revolves around me '' , so very child-like ( but not in a good way ) . I 'm going to donate to Salvation Army . I do n't tolerate this kind of fluff at all .	-1
I have spent a week trying to read more than a few pages of this book without falling asleep and I 'm just going to give up . Clearly there is at least one previous book in this series . Unlike other books in series which ususally can stand alone if read out of sequence , I think one really needs to read the first one or ones before trying this . There are so many characters that make little or no sense in here otherwise . ( At least I assume they would make sense if one reads the preceding books but I am not interested in even going there . ) Beyond that , I have to admit to not being a fan of vampires , the supernatural or `` esp '' kind of powers much less ancient secret societies of them in fiction of any type . Finally , this was just boring and I could not care one bit about the main characters . Nothing peaked even my curiousity to find out how their lives work out . Its rare I can put aside even a poor book without finishing it , but this one is getting deleted without a regret .	-1
Sorry but it was just too far-fetched for me ! There 's a word in French : invraisemblable . It means not believable . Plus the dialogue was so predictable , it was boring .	-1
Caroline Preston seems to be adept at collecting ephemera that call to mind certain periods -- in the case of this book , the 1920s . But a lot of pretty pictures do not a novel make . As one reviewer pointed out , the actual text of this `` novel '' might consist of five ( maybe ten ) typewritten pages . The rest of the book consists of vintage memorabilia : photos , ticket stubs , advertisements , collages , etc.The actual narrative concerns Frankie Pratt , who is graduated from Vassar and then decamps to Paris by way of Greenwich Village to pursue her ( pipe ) dream of becoming a writer . She falls in love ( she thinks ) , falls out of love , lives in Paris in the requisite garret , manages to meet James Joyce and edit some of his work ( though she does n't seem to comprehend any of the modernists ' work ) , frequents romantic Parisian cafes , then heads home to New Hampshire to assist her ailing mother where she meets someone and again falls in love.And that 's it . Apart from the evocative photographs and illustrations , there 's nothing new here . Frankie is not an interesting character , nor is anyone else . Nothing interesting happens in the book , which can be read in a couple of hours -- or skimmed in a lot less time . It 's a good-looking , well-produced volume , but pretty forgettable . It might appeal to the young adult market and serve to introduce them to ex-pat writers like Hemingway and Fitzgerald , who make cameo appearances in the book . But a novel ? Not in my estimation .	-1
As an avid reader , I like to treat myself to a little teeny bopper novel every so often . After recieving this book from a friend on a promise that I would enjoy it greatly , I began it and was instantly HORRIFIED by its writing.The book revolves around a whiny self entitled & # 34 ; alien & # 34 ; with no real name other than Number Four . He is being followed by another race who want to kill him for no reason other than to take over their planet , which is pointless because they killed it already anyways . He 's developing super powers called & # 34 ; Legacies & # 34 ; , a weak way to make him & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; than people.Of course there 's a girl and her evil ex , and she 's completely useless other than following him like a lost puppy . I do n't think she was productive to the story at all . The ex is your typical raging idiot who does n't care abut anything except sports.The storyline was weak and the author ca n't write anyways . It may have been different if the writing was half decent . In short , do n't waste your money . I 'm a 14 year old girl . Trust me .	-1

This book has some interesting features , and many people will find it exciting , but I 'd like to know who edited this book . I ca n't believe the number of errors in it , beginning with constant use of the adverb _then_ as a conjunction . It 's NOT a conjunction . Kind of icky overall .	-1

My review is not of the Bible itself , but of the Kindle format . It just does not work . It skips pages , inserts pages where they do n't belong , and is very difficult to navigate . I downloaded it in the hopes of lightening my load when attending my seminar , not wanting to lug my heavy study version of the NRSV , but this is not the answer . It 's as if you had a stack of loose papers and they all got scattered all over the ground by the wind . I just did n't want to go out and buy one more Bible ( in this case , a paperback )	-1

What 's to like in this book ? Nothing . Awful parents , bad language and boring . The kids would have been better off in social services . I kept waiting for it to get better and it did n't . I started reading this on a plane on my Kindle with the large font but I turned it off because I did n't want anyone reading this trash over my shoulder . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Dennis Prager believes himself to be an intellectual and a moralist when he is neither . He is only intellectual to someone who has never met a real scholar . His manner is pleasant and civil , but his thought is nasty and threadbare . He is violently anti scholarship , constantly attacking college and university education , something right out of the classic fascist playbook deliniated by Dr. Lawrence Britt . Most of his arguments begin with `` the left says ... '' and are based on a straw man premise . The left is apparently anyone who does not entirely agree with him . He claims to be a moralist , yet is quite comfortable with waterboarding . He claims to care about people , yet airs cigar ads on his program . He constantly touts Prager University which is dedicated to two beliefs : that education is only about profit and that cheap , jejune five minute on line courses are substitutes forfour years of real scholarship . His writing style is simplistic , preachy , and poorly reasoned . Save your money . If you really want conservative literature try something by Russell Kirk or William F. Buckley . Those two were true intellectuals .	-1
I 'm not a werewolf fan , so when HarperTeen ( via NetGalley ) sent me the ebook , I was intrigued about 'Once in a full moon'.It was such a disappointment . I believe this book was an immitation of a bad fan-fiction story.The writing was poor for YA adult book ; the descriptions were incompleted , I lost the track of the history so many times ! And please , do n't say it was because of me.I was so bored through all the book . I do n't know what 's going on with me ; I had read GREAT books , so when I try to like this kind of mediocre plot , I fail.And the , 'Oh , he 's a werewolf , he 's in front of me and he 's SO BEAUTIFUL ' part ? Come on ! I 'm so , so sorry .	-1
I often find myself damning Harry Potter and Percy Jackson as much as I love them it makes life hard for other fictional characters to even try to compete . Sadly these characters did n't have a chance . There was very little if any character development in this story ( and there were only three characters to speak of ) .Our community was lucky enough to host Bruce Coville a few years ago . My daughter often quotes him as he talked about a character that was in peril ... `` and he 's barely holding on to the edge of the cliff by his fingers then he faaaaaaallllllllllllllls doooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnn ... . but nobody cares because he 's a jerk '' Which is an excellent way to illustrate my point . If you do n't care about the characters then you wo n't care what happens to them . Which is exactly what happened with my daughter and I and this story .	-1
This review is for the Audible.com edition , not the book itself . I purchase four or five audio books a year and via this one , learned what an ART reading a book out loud really is . Whoever the narrator is for Island Beneath the Sea , she does n't have the art and the narration is entirely distracting from the book itself . You can painfully hear her ee-nun-see-ate each and every syllable . What 's worse are the accents -- all come out a sort of suth-en drawl , despite the book calling for Spanish , Cuban , French , city Creole and a country Creole patois ( all mentioned in the story itself ) . There is no voice distinction for the characters , so they all muddle together . I understand that this book is great when read , but in my experience , skip the Audible edition .	-1
This useless waste of paper makes me long for the intelligent woman who wrote The Beauty Myth . What happened to her ? ! It seems like she has been struck down with the same insanity that seems to be afflicting Germaine Greer of late . There is so much wrong with this book , I do n't even know where to start . I want to say this is the worst book I have ever read but the middle section just saves it from being this . If Ms Wolf had stuck to a literary analysis of vaginas she would have been safe . She clearly knows her stuff in this regard but science is definitely not her forte . Her hypotheses do not hold up to even the slightest critical thinking . She admits to not knowing things I did when I was twelve and I am no genius . She states early in the book that women 's genitals are all wired differently then goes on to presume we all want the same things from sex . The section that sums this book up nicely is the place where she states that when people use offensive words for vagina it causes women 's brains to shut down ? Really ? I think you should probably go find someone to scream the C word at you for a couple of hours before you attempt this text because the only way you could possibly enjoy it is with you brain completely off line .	-1
Book was extremely slow developing . It was boring from start to finish . I kept reading expecting the suspense to build at some point to no avail.No more Lisa Black reading for me .	-1
If I have read a more boring and predictable book I surely ca n't remember it . I plowed through this book to the bitter end hoping for something that would make this chore of read worth it ... I was again disappointed . This book was a total waste of time . Try Black Cross by Greg Iles or most anything by that author . Also , good is Vertical Run by Garber , the Unlikely Spy by Silva , books by Vince Flynn ...	-1
OK , first of all this is not a barbecue book , it 's a book on char-grilling foods . And by char , I do n't mean charcoal , I mean throwing meat onto a fire until the surface is briquette black . The recipes are all contrived , pretentious , and aimed at `` foodies '' who spend two thousand dollars on a grill thinking that spending more money makes food taste better . Do n't waste yours on this book ! Addendum : Someone commented that they felt I was exaggerating when I called this book contrived and pretentious , and not for those interested in real barbecue . Please take a look at who raves about this being a great book : New York Magazine and National Public Radio . These are not , to my mind , great bastions of barbecue knowledge and culture . Pretentious ? You decide .	-1
I 've read all of Crighton 's books , and seem to be the only one who did NOT enjoy this one . The characters are blah and WAY TOO MANY . Even though the story line is somewhat interesting , it just drags on and on to a final ridiculous conclusion . Sorry folks , in my humble opinion , this is one you can avoid and not feel badly about doing so .	-1
One of the first basic tenets budding writers are taught is to avoid introducing more than two or three characters in the first chapter of a novel . These are the characters readers are introduced to in Chapter One of 'Something Old , Something New ' : Lily Fontaine - main female character , engaged to TrentMarie Jefferson - Lily 's godmother , lady friend of Leo BrownCassandra - Lily 's deceased motherDavis Fontaine - Lily 's 24-year old sonDevon Watkins - Lily 's 9-year old foster sonWilla Mae - Devon 's deceased grandmotherTrent July - main male character , engaged to Lily , Mayor of the Town of Henry Adams , KansasMalachi July - Trent 's father and restaurant ownerTamar July - Trent 's grandmotherBernadine Brown -Lily 's employer , Malachi 's lady friend , owner of the Town of Henry Adams , KansasLeo Brown - Bernadine 's ex , Marie Jefferson 's gentleman friendBarrett Payne - USMC retired , married to SheilaSheila Payne - Barrett 's wifePreston - foster son of the Payne'sLeah Clark - friend of PrestonGary Clark - Leah 's fatherReggie Garland - town pediatricianRoni Garland - Reggie 's wife , profession R & B ; singerZoey Garland - Roni and Reggie 's daughterJack James - schoolteacherRocky Dance - restaurant manager and cookRiley Curry - former mayor , gentleman friend of EustasiaGenevieve Curry - Riley 's ex-wifeCletus - 600 lb . killer hogEustasia Pennymaker - Texas millionaire , Riley 's lady friendCliff Dobbs - Genevieve 's gentleman friendThe reader needs a roster to keep track of all these people .	-1
and that was just in the first few chapters since that 's all I read . I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and thought this could be similar- a fun , quick read . However , as a Christian , I was so appalled at the idea that Peter , the rock of the Christian Church , would ever condone/encourage/participate in child sacrifice . Just bizarre and sick . I 'm no scholar nor historian , but I have never heard of such a thing being condoned in Judaism . And before you mention Abraham and Isaac , he did not kill Isaac- God send a ram in his stead . I literally felt so uneasy about having this book in my house , I threw it in the dumpster . Bleh .	-1
I love reading but this book is just boring . The review by B. Frey & # 34 ; nevermore & # 34 ; is great , I should have read it before purchasing this book . I do n't care about the characters , the plot moves too slowly . I am at chapter 25 which is 43 % through the book and just can not convince myself it is worth my time to continue with it . And this from someone who reads 2-3 books a week .	-1
What I Liked : 1 ) The idea . There was a lot of promise with this idea . Wren has already discovered that she has these powers , and used them to bring Danny back to life when he died . So , technically , he 's a zombie . He 's not a `` braaaaaains '' zombie , the undead , nonetheless . But because he can think , it makes for an interesting story about how Wren can go about maintaining this secret life that she 's creating with her undead boyfriends . 2 ) The entrance of Gabriel . On the surface , he was there simply to expose Wren to herself , letting her know what it really was that she 'd done , but there was a deeper meaning to it . He was teaching her that she can move on from Danny 's death , and have a real life , something she 'd never have as long as Danny was around.What I Did n't Like : So much of this book was just , generic . Like there was some formula for a YA book being followed . Boy dies , girl brings boy back to life , new boy comes in ... I was disappointed in the way it all unfolded . It just felt like it was following a set pattern , with no surprises.Overall Thoughts : Amy Garvey had a good idea here in Cold Kiss , and her writing style was very understandable . It was exciting to see someone who started off as broken as Wren begin to heal as the story progressed . However the storyline felt too simple - it could have been any character , in any setting , making the exact same motions . I think that as Miz Garvey develops her writing more ( particularly in the YA genre ) , we 'll see even more creativity , branching out from the YA fiction formula . I 'll be looking forward to seeing more in her recently released second book of the series , Glass Heart .	-1
This is a basic little love story , but it 's really no more than a short story . There 's no plot , no emotional development , no humor . While there 's nothing wrong with Debbie Macomber 's writing , there 's nothing particularly engaging about it either . Truthfully , it felt as if I was reading a story in a woman 's magazine , rather than a book I 'd be willing to pay $ 17 for .	-1
The first few pages were witty - but it soon became a huge bore . A quote I love and find very accurate & # 34 ; The louder he spoke of what an honest man he was , the faster we counted our silverware. & # 34 ; Generally , those that proclaim to be funny ( especially when hiding behind a pen name ) generally are not funny . And the more this book tried to be funny , the more it became aggravating. & # 34 ; Stanley Bing & # 34 ; is living in an elitist bubble - an a world where people say , & # 34 ; Brilliant idea to write a book ! Are n't you clever ! & # 34 ; and then behind the author 's back , people roll their eyes.The one redeeming page was on 4-5 - the list of people who never received MBA 's but went on to become successful . After that , it was simply one long unfunny book .	-1
Dennis Lehane has to lose Bubba , a homicidal maniac with the depth of a cartoon character . And while Lehane may know Boston , it sounds like he 's never been beyond Route 128 . No one in Western MA refers to Boston as 'downtown ' ( as the amputee at the motel does ) . I 'm not a big fan of detective fiction , but I followed this up with Robert Parker 's 'Small Vices ' , another detective yarn set in Boston . I found Parker 's book to be superior in execution and pacing .	-1
Some writers are able to seamlessly weave different storylines and plots together . Ruth Rendell and Kate Atkinson , to name two of my favorites , do this so well . Unfortunately , Alafair Burke does not possess this gift ! After finishing this book , I still am not sure how all the characters and plots fit together ! In addition , the characters were impossible to care about or believe in , as some other reviewers have mentioned . I liked the original premise , where a woman goes to work and finds her workplace ( an art gallery ) dismantled and her employer murdered . The author seemed to get sidetracked by other irrelevant plotlines and awful characters ! My first book by this author and probably my last !	-1
It 's not really fair to call Hannity fans lemmings , they are mostly good-hearted partiotic-sheeple who are following a false , ( phoney ) , shepherd.Not that Sean is n't sometimes right . Good guy , Zig Ziglar once said , `` You can find a good bisquit in a dumpster , but , that 's not a good place to look for one . `` I 'm writing this review hoping some of his fans will google : Freedom Alliance scam , and , Alex Jones.If after persuing those you are still Hannitized , then , there is NO hope for you ...	-1
I will give this book two stars for its ' repeating rightwing/republican talking points . I can see Hannity will use the same talking points to attack the President in '12 and he did in '08 . In the beginning of the book Hannity ties President Obama with Rev . Wright . Rev . Wright is one of those individuals who supports black empowerment . Hannity blames Wright for Wright 's position that the struggles of groups in the bible ( mainly the Israelites ) is most like African Americans of any groups.I believe Wright is correct . Blacks in this country had ancestors who were slaves and then suffered under segreation for 100 plus years . I am not stating all the problems in the black community are because of whites or racism . Of course not , that would be far too simplistic . But , if you are someone like Wright who wants to make the black community better , then this analogy by him on the bible and how the black community was oppressed makes a great rallying cry because the Israelites of the bible eventually arose out of their bondage as blacks did a century and a half earlier.Hannity attacks a number of people with connections , no matter how loose , with President Obama . This is an old tactic , used by Hannity 's probable hero , the liar and bully Joe McCarthy . Yes , Obama served on a board with Bill Ayers , but so did a number of republicans . If those republians ran for public office , do you think Hannity would attack them for serving on a board with Ayers ? If so , can I sell yu a bridge in Brooklyn ? Let 's talk about Hannity 's connections with a Neo-Nazi called Hal Turner . Now , I am not stating Hannity is a neo-Nazi . I am sure that he like most Americans is disgusted by that organization . But Hannity welcomed Hal 's calls even after Hal the Nazi stated if it was n't for white people that blacks would `` still be swinging in trees in Africa '' , according to a `` The Nation '' article . Hannity did n't even cut Hal off after this extreme racist statement . Hannity even denied knowledge of Hal Turner when asked about him , but after lying about it , later admitted that yes he knew him . In fact , he had talked to the nazi off air in a much friendly manner then President Obama had after did with Bill Ayers.Later parts of the book include the idea that if you do n't believe in what Hannity , Palin , Beck etc believe in then you are n't a real conservative . See , if you want lower taxes but you do n't believe that same sex marriage is a threat to America , you are a RINO or `` Republican in Name only . ''	-1
There are some great ideas in this book , but overall it was difficult for me to get into it . I was n't too fond of Diana Butler Bass .	-1
After having this book show up in `` My recommendations '' back in March , I started a discussion based upon the distasteful jacket cover . At that time , the contents of the cookbook were NOT available to preview online . So to those who have commented that this is no place to review a book based upon it 's cover , following is my update.Quite a few of the recipes look like some that I would like to try . Others , not so much . The cookbook contains recipes for dishes made from seafood , poultry , veal , beef , pork , a variety of vegetables , and other not so common meats . So based upon the previewed content , I had revised my rating to three stars from one star . However , as I continued to read , I came across a gratuitous `` f '' bomb dropped in the last paragraph on page 4 of the introduction . Why was that necessary ? First I 'm assaulted by a dead pig on the cover and then foul language in the prose . Why could n't there have been a live pig on the cover ? All of us meat eaters know what we are eating ? Why was it necessary to have a dead pig with painted toe nails on the cover -- as was pointed out by another in the discussions of this book ? I do stand by my original comment that the jacket is in poor taste . There are so many other ways that the publisher , author , cover designer , etc . could have conveyed that the whole pig is used in this cookbook ; if that is what it was meant to convey . ( That was not my perception at all . ) I have a library full of hundreds of books on many subjects ; all types of cookbooks , baking , novels , autobiographies , gardening , health , hobbies , etc . because I like to read , garden , and cook . If a book comes with a jacket cover I like to save the cover because it is part of the appeal of the book for me and it helps to protect the book from spills , scratches , etc.I can only recall a few reviews where people provided a positive response that they actually found the cover appealing . Maybe many do n't care and that 's fine . But for me , I would lose my appetite everytime I picked up this cookbook to prepare anything from it.I 'm not a chef . I 'm an ordinary person who likes to cook and entertain . I do handle larger cuts of meat and poultry that I cut up myself . I 've cleaned freshly caught fish . However , I have never killed an animal to eat . I do n't believe that means I am out of touch with my food as few have continued to repeat as the reason I find the cover distasteful . It just means that I 'm a lover of life and would like to have seen a kinder approach to how the animal was portrayed . I see nothing positive about a dead pig being draped across the shoulders of the chef . As someone said , the dead pig was simply `` shock value '' meant to help sell the cookbook.This is America , the land of free speech and the right to express an opinion . So for those of you who are unaffected by the cover , that 's fine and I happily accept your opinion . For me , I would have considered purchasing this book if it had been released with a different cover . So that says , I 'm willing to spend my money for a product with positive merchandising . I am not willing to spend my money on a product that carelessly displays a dead animal for commercial appeal.Finally , it 's a cookbook that parents may want to share with their children . Drop the gratuitous foul language . It has no place in a cookbook .	-1

Okay , I 'm a big dork for YA paranormal romances ... but this one is a bit much . The dark and brooding hero admits to being `` obsessed '' with the main character , Kate . After only knowing this guy a short time she ends up at his house and finds a picture of her by his bed ... and this does n't bother her too much . In what reality is this kind of behavior romantic and swoon worthy ? I think this depiction of `` love '' sends a really bad message . Because my advice to any girl who found a guy ( no matter how good looking ) standing outside of her house staring up at her bedroom window night after night is to run ... and run fast.I 'm not sure why authors feel the need to describe love in such an unhealthy way . While the concept of this book is interesting , it really falls short with an undeveloped relationship between the main characters .	-1
This book is simply dull with unbelievable characters extremely stupid plot and brainless heroine . I refuse to think that the heroine actions were justified by her absurd wish to have a baby . This is my first book by this author and seriously let me less than thrilled !	-1
It looks like I am going to be the odd man out on this one . I have been a long time reader and fan of Robinson and Insp . Banks.I could not believe this was written by the same author of the great inspector Bank series . A good editor could have cut this novel by 30 % by eliminating the over descriptive commentary that had little story relevance or plot support . Actually I thought the plot premise was weak . Please stop with the music ! Maybe I am just too locked into the Banks ' books , which I will continue to read and enjoy . Sorry !	-1
The 9/11 issue is complex and the implications that it might be an 'inside job ' so horrific that many people can not even give the idea house room . My experience has been with those who doubted , looked at the evidence , changed their views to `` this looks very fishy '' and slowly drift back again because the main stream media have never done an in depth analysis of the huge number of oddities , coincidences and things inexplicable ( within the official consiparacy theory of 9/11 - the radical Arab theory ) . Books like this are unhelpful and linking those who have significant doubts about the official narrative with holocaust deniers , is just distasteful nonsense .	-1
This was a difficult read for me . For several months I would pick up this book become utterly disgusted with the characters and put it back down again . I 'm really not sure why I finished it as the more I think about it the more I truly hated it . I wish I had returned it to the library unfinished.This is the story of Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by the Earnshaw family and Catherine Earnshaw his only childhood friend . Let 's just say that as events unfold and as the characters develop we come to know the evil Heathcliff and selfish Catherine will never be together . Since they truly love each other the only alternative seems to be to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them . At this point I was really hoping for a rabid pack of wolves to attack everyone and end their misery . Unfortunately this did not happen.On a more positive note this book was very well written and the character development superb .	-1
i have always heard great reviews of Wuthering Heights . its a classic right ? well i was very dissapointed . its so boring ! i will make myself finish just to make sure i havent missed anything .	-1
Well apparently without reading the prequel of picture this , you have to have a real imagination to picture this . I am lost and not found , could not get into the story beyond 50 pages .	-1
I bought this on the strenhth of the foreword by Mike Anthony . Big mistake , Mike writes very well . Same can not be said of Sammy . He is capable of contradicting himself several times on a single page ( alcohol , drugs , women ) . Makes it difficult to believe that this book is honest . Often the events are incoherently described , you are not sure how a particular episode ( with his dad , mom , ban ) ended . I am gon na make myself finish reading it as punishment for squandering 2 bucks . Mike you write THE book !	-1
First off , I 've been a Dolphins Fan since '83 , and I still love them.I 've read a lot of books on the 72 Dolphins , and pretty much enjoyed them all . Then I read Undefeated , and I had a lot of problems with it . First is everything in this book , pretty much has been told in other books . There was nothing new in it , it was just a rehash of other books and articles . Second , there was very little football in it . It was a lot of social commentary with a little football thrown in . Third , there were things in the book that the author could n't know . An example is when Nixon wrote a letter to Shula , the author said how Nixon wrote it , when he took pauses to think on what he wanted to say to Shula , and how Nixon paused for 40 seconds . Come on , how can the author know that . Fourth , some of the sentences were very choppy and had to read . Something just felt off on it.There are a few book on the 72 Dolphins , some very good , but unfortunately , this is n't one of them .	-1
These are on sale for $ 2.60 at B & N . Hahaha ! Great for rolling papers or toilet paper if desperate . So go to the mall and grab a couple put aside for emergencies !	-1
Sarah Palin 's second book , America By Heart : Reflections on Family , Faith , and Flag , is her take on what makes the United States great and why its current state of affairs is hurting its reputation at home and on the world stage . Palin relies heavily on quotations to make her points , featuring quotes from the founding fathers to contemporary pop culture personalities . I found the lengthy eighteenth-century passages plodding to decipher . It would have been better to keep her quotations to a paragraph or two instead of page after page of centred indented smaller-font text . Palin is not afraid to admit that in the USA 's recent history both Democrats and Republicans have made mistakes and she pulls no punches when she refudiates what some members of her own party think of her.Palin believes that Obama is taking the United States down a path of wishy-washy mediocrity . The greatest country the Earth has ever known is now nuzzling up with other nations as an equal partner in the world arena instead of being the one who is supposed to lead these nations . Her jingoism is not offensive , but rather expected . Palin believes that the United States can return as leader in global greatness by following the principles the original founding fathers set out in the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . Recent administrations have drifted far from these principles . American exceptionalism is being compromised by a President who wants to assuage dictators and share power . She compares the current administration to umpires at kindergarten baseball games , where nobody gets out and no score is kept either : everyone is supposed to be happy because nobody wins.Palin would restore greatness to the United States of America by withdrawing federal authority and restoring more autonomy at the state level . She is not a fan of `` Obamacare '' and her interpretation of federal babysitting in a welfare state . As the Governor of Alaska , she does have a different perspective as a Mama Grizzly looking down on the Lower 48 . In America By Heart Palin shares many stories about hiking , climbing and hunting and she definitely comes across as a mother figure at home in the Last Frontier . She talks of her forty years living with Alaska 's vast wilderness as her backyard and she knows whereof she speaks . Palin believes her independent nature is a trait of Alaskans , whom she claims often feel as though Washington was still treating as backwards gold prospectors who were not from a state on equal footing with the other 49 , but from a territory that could be manipulated at federal will.I was not moved by America By Heart in the same way I was by Palin 's earlier memoir , Going Rogue : An American Life . I did n't find Palin 's blueprint for restoring American greatness all that inspiring , even though I find her a champion of commonsense Constitutional conservatism .	-1
If you delete the endless , tiresome pages of quotations , famous full speeches , prayers and poetry and add the anti President Obama negations your are left with an election brochure .	-1
If you MUST read this idiot 's book , spend an afternoon in an armchair at the local bookstore ! Shame on anyone who shells out money on such drivel . Not only are you paying for this ... woman 's ... brand new Arizona mansion , you 're also killing innocent trees in the process . Sick all around .	-1
Awful book . I guess I 'm naive , and since I was unfamiliar with this author , I thought I 'd give it a read and see if I could glean any wisdom from another perspective . Sadly , I felt this was just a finger pointing , name calling disappointment . I gave it to my ex-husband , a very right wing Republican .	-1
Savage plays to his audience well . Those that only want to hear part of the story may enjoy the smooth rants of Savage . He argues like Reverend Wright ( although for the other side and to a larger audience ) and tells the Fox News-type audience exactly what they want to hear , even if there is little truth behind the words . It 's not worth the paper it 's printed on .	-1
I have never before been disappointed in a book by Terry Pratchett , but this book is a disaster . In fact , I do n't believe that Pratchett wrote it . The style changes at least three times during the progress of the story and the `` voices '' of the most settled and familiar characters are entirely different than they were in many previous novels . I 'm referring in particular to Lady Sybil and Willikins whose persona in both cases has undergone a complete change . Lady S is now and suddenly an arch and unpleasant scold , rather than a supportive and never socially ambitious wife . Willikins instead of a very formal and proper man 's man in this book is a street tough at all times rather than only in times of war or conflict . To say this is disconcerting is a vast understatement . The English rhythms of speech ; the colloquial usage of words and the over wordiness of the descriptions are alien and clang unpleasantly on the ear . I do n't know who composed this book , but they should never do so again .	-1
I know this review is late and pretty much everything I 'm going to complain about here has been mentioned by others . However , here 's the bottom line : THIS WOMAN IS SO FAR GONE ! Here is the one thing that I would like to address that has n't been discussed much ; the name of Jenny 's book should be `` Love , Lust , Faking It And Hating The Catholic Church . '' By the time I got to chapter eight ( which was quite a struggle to get through ) I had enough of the whole `` Wah Wah The Catholic Church has scarred me about feeling guilty over sex/masturbation '' AND the constant demonizing of the Catholic faith/derogatory remarks . Jenny delivers such clever lines as `` Jesus ca n't dump nuns . `` First off , I respect Jenny 's right to express her opinion in a book . I also respect her choice of religous belief or lack their of . If you want to be a new age Buddhist or even a total atheist ; then fine , that 's your choice . But there IS a point where you are just beating a dead horse . There has to be a time when you stop blaming religon , or how you grew up or whoever hurt you in the past and hold yourself responsible for your bad decisions.There is also a huge deception/half-truth that Jenny is spreading in regards to religous belief and sexuality especially in regard to Catholicism/Christianity . Mainly that Catholicism is the big , bad , mean ol ' oppressor and all other religons let you live your life however you please . WRONG ! Judaism , Hindu , Buddhism , Islam and even the teachings of Kama Sutra have guidelines on sexual practices . As much as Jenny would like to `` Single Out '' ( ha ha I made a funny ) Catholicisim into the world 's scapegoat , the fact of the matter is this : To practice any form of spirituality means that you must abide by certain customs/rules in every aspect of your life . Yes , this includes sexuality.Now having said that , let 's also look at Jenny 's age ; she 's a whopping six years older than me . I am 34 and she pretty much grew up in the same timeline that I did ; the 1980s . I myself was raised Catholic and educated in a Catholic School and ( brace yourself ! ) today I am still a practicing Catholic who is content and at peace . Sorry Jen , I do n't have the psychological hangups that you insist are tied to the belief system . Nor was I abused in any way.This is what I am really wondering however . Since Jenny and I both grew up in the same time period and in Catholic families/schools , why does her upbringing sound more like she were raised in the 1950s ? I have two very devout parents , but the whole `` fire and damnation '' teaching went out the window with Vatican I . You ARE aware that Vatican II took place , right Jenny ? You are also educated about the teachings of Pope John Paul II and World Youth Day ? You know that little event that brought together over 2,000,000 young adults in 2011 ? I also assume that you know about the biblical teaching of The Good Thief who died on the cross next to Jesus ? The individual who was forgiven NOT because of the severity of his sins , but rather the sincerity of repentance and humility ? So by the time we get to chapter eight , Jenny tells us time and time again about how the Catholic Church did this and that to her . Okay , Jenny I 'll play your game to humor you ; but this time let 's throw the ball in the other direction . What DID N'T the Catholic Church do to you ? You know things that YOU have to hold YOURSELF responsible for ? Here , I 'll give you a couple to get started:1 . ) The Catholic Church DID N'T force you and your sister to pose nude in a girlie magazine for some half-dead , washed up eighty year old has-been who has one foot in the grave . Said eighty year old has also used young women just like you under the guise of `` fame '' long before you were even born.2 . ) The Catholic Church DID N'T force you to make claims against the medical community which were proven to be false , but not until after spreading pandemonium and putting innocent lives in danger.Now the issue of Catholicism aside , I will also point out even more blunders in this trainwreck of a `` self-help '' book . Jenny 's whole philosophical belief system which is loosely based on various religons , new age and debauchery really MAKES NO SENSE ! ! I even listened to this on audiobook to see if it would make any difference.It does n't ! You can even hear the narrator stumble over the words that are haphazardly pieced together and TRY to make them sound sane . One of the core beliefs that I found humorous was the whole `` life is positive or negative soley on how you percieve it . '' She becomes so cliche as to say `` Heaven becomes Hell once we percieve that an angel is playing a harp too loud . '' Really Jenny ? Playing a harp ? Is the angel also standing on a white , fluffy cloud ? Old cartoon references aside , let me just confirm what your are selling me . If a woman were to be raped it would be positive so long as she percieved the act as `` being made love to ? `` Lastly , her constant whining of how her mother married her father INSTEAD of her `` true love '' would be extremely comical if she was n't actually serious . Jenny let me tell YOU some advice which I heard from a priest on EWTN . It 's very simple : `` There are no accidents . '' In another words Jenny , IF your mother did not marry your father THEN YOU WOULD NOT EVEN EXIST ! Which come to think of it might not be such a bad thing for the rest of us ; but for you personally it definitely would be ! God , Buddah , Alla a `` higher power '' or even fate itself has decided that you are to be here among us , for better or for worse , for reasons we may never know on this earth . What exactly is your IQ anyway ? Or would that go into the negative digits ? Well , I have certainly had enough of Jenny `` dysfunctional '' McCarthy for this life AND the next . Do yourself a HUGE favor and actually read a book with some degree of intelligence or substance.AMEN !	-1
I loved the first book , the second was alright . Requiem was the biggest let down . I was bored . And the ending was awful . I kept trying to find the pages I was sure I skipped over . I was so looking forward to reading this .	-1
I hope this rating is n't too harsh . Maybe this works as a YA novel , and an older reader just does n't get this . I found the premise of the Panic competition lacks credibility , and the whole book was tedious .	-1
-First its a good read . Hats off to the ghost writer . LACK of passion aside chapt 1 though-second it does n't have the LJ spark that made me love it . I read for Delena thats why I loved it . Take that away , and no real passion for me . We 've been over and over with Stelena . No more twilight endings please.-Third it has a good plot but its its own series now do n't expect the oldHaving a few friends , we all chipped in and will pass this amongst us . I figured I 'd review the book based on itself , how it compares to the original and return series and then add spoilers for those who wo n't read it.The book itself was pretty decent and easy to read . it flowed and did n't overly repeat itself and smoothed out previous points with much needed clarity . As you all know this was writen by a ghost writer who I believe was the old editor . When reading I found that the book retained its old feel from the first three books . It seemed to lack some of the fire that LJ wrote though . The characters were more like their old selves , and yet , seemed odd and empty . Like they were coated over . I believe the author did a pretty good job of retaining the sense of the story , the characters of old , but I cant help but feel we went backwards some . Elena is more hesitant which is good , and yet seems so very odd in certain places . Everyone played a good role ... Alaric was good , Merideth had a nice part , matt reflect and not much with bonnie . Bonnie herself will begin more witchy stuff and there seemed to be no Bamon . ALOT of jealousy but this is a main feature of the story I will not spoil till later . Many of Damon 's fans will be happy and yet sad at the same time.Overall the series is much more straight forward , not overly descriptive and yet lacks something intense and deep . Fans of the old will find the read more to their content as far as the format . Its tone is much similar . As compared to the return series , it lacks a shine or power . Overall i liked it and wish the company would add the new author on the book ( even if they keep created by lj smith ) . now on to spoilers***Spoiler zone****Ok it was well written , but the steam was n't there for me . I do confess to being a Delena fan more than any other but not limited to . This is why I felt it went backward . If they undo all that ... I dunno . Its part of why I stayed with the series so long . Elena needed to have a sense of control and she does still need to address it . She addresses that she feels love for both , and guilt . The guilt makes me feel like she wants to tell stefan she loves him more , first , or is her one true love . It makes for a good read as she works though it and wo n't dodge it so much . BUT It makes no sense ... you ca n't deeply love two people equally . As wrong as it may be they are related , your heart sometimes dictates love . or in that you will always love one more than the other . I see a chance that she can love damon that he has changed , but I do n't want this to go backwards after all their development . IT will not make sense nor work for me personally . But i felt glad that she knows and seems to try whereas before she just gave in all the time . Push and Pull is great.In the least , let them have their time even if Alloy does n't want to pair them in the end . it works this way for both groups of shippers to have it end in a way that closes the door . Of course I love who I love , and I do hope they make their way there . It will definitely be a chore . Stefan really does love Elena and you really feel that beyond words . And that is sweet to see and really feel . So is the fact that Elena was able to step back . I have to say delena makes me want to read , and without them its kinda meh . But as long as the plot stays good and we work through the issues I think some may keep reading . I read it in 4 hours.Hardly any bamon , a bunch of stelena but with grief and much questioning and heart aching . YES DAMON IS BACK . Sad part is that Elena seems to pull away and remark to Stefan how she loves him tinkering on `` more '' . Damon makes a startling good change so we see our guy really becoming all friendly and caring with the group.The phantom is a being that elena set free when she blew up the moon . while returning there is getting old , it was well done and not so detailed that it bothered me . the reason they re all jealous is because the being is feeding off their emotions . Bonnie is very jealous , damon is , stefan is severely , and elena is feeling guilty.My sense was that Elena and Stefan felt like they had been through more , and i was kind of glad to get this feel and to see his jealousy . of course our boys fight in there . I sensed elena unsure of stefan 's darker side , and of herself , and kind of awed by the change in damon . The only part that bugged me was her dreaming of him ... its never mentioned whether he remembers it or not . It does feel like there is an added connection because of it . Damon does call bonnie his red bird but i do n't feel he means it the bamon way . he does mention that she is his girl , but i got the impression that it was like his human that he cared and watched over for . There is no reminiscent kissing or adoring with them . Perhaps a Bamon fan will interpret it differently though . not much romance , but she is very jealous in this book . If you are a bamon fan this may be a big thing . The girls are jealous of one another when concerning Damon for sure so glad to see it come out . as a Stelena fan you feel their connection and wonder how they will work through it , and feel the love and its cracks now . As a delena fan you are happy he is back , but sad because elena pushes him away . also loved how they feel about one another . She is less like return elena and more controlled like first series elena.As a delena fan , yes she is still with stefan but she is wondering in several parts . As a bamon fan , not much there in this book , stelena 's dunno if the couple is strong but you def feel the pining of stefan knowing he is aware how much elena loved damon , and how she keeps that part from him.It was just so much easier to follow and understand like the old books it felt like home . but LJ still has the creative spark over all . I hope she does get a better editor for her future endeavors . I do not think these characters are but 80 % of who they were in the first books and even less of the return . There is extreme lack of passion . The ghost writer did a very nice job generally speaking but it still seems like a fog which is not her fault . It just happens with two separate writers . I was sad , and let down some . I suppose if my couple goes bye bye so will I . Plot alone is not enough after all that . I feel stelena is tossed down my throat as other shippers may feel opposite about their team . Together , suffering , near death , after death ... .I did buy via amazon kindlei tried the ghost writer and think its good but it lackswill be passing the copy around several people who will not pay for bookthanks for your time guys hope u enjoyed and got some answers	-1
this author really is good at creating brainless , stupid women . Yeah , there 's some funny chatter once in a blue moon , but for the most part you just want to wring the heroine 's neck.I guess pairing dumb broads with overly wrought , tormented guys that are just thrilled by these dramaitcs creates some balance . You 're relieved that two stupid people are off the meat market and not inflicting themselves on someone who 's actually with it.Overall , a big disappointment . I guess as a working class girl I had a hard time dealing with such bimbos . Joy is a brainless twit , I felt like I was dealing with a self-absorbed Paris Hilton type . Ick ! Ca n't believe this series gets good reviews . Katie really dropped the ball with this group of characters .	-1
I have been with Ms. Feehan since the first Carpathian book hit the shelves . The series is about a species of males , Carpathians , who are essentially immortal , and who eventually turn into soulless vampires if they do not find their mate . Once they find her , they can once again see colors and feel emotions.As other reviewers have stated , there are many factors in the last couple of books that weaken the plots . For one , these Carpathians have just discovered , after centuries of wandering , that they are not the only ones of their kind in the world . Yet they do not seem to be in much of a hurry to meet the others ( including their prince and their brother ) , or even ask any questions about their people . For another , a long-standing question of mine has been this : if the Carpathians now know that certain mortal women can be their lifemates , would n't common sense demand that they start frequenting places of high concentration of these women , like associations , research institutes , etc ? Also , readers have been told for the last six books that female Carpathians are rare , but we have been given no further reason for it , or any indication that anything is being done about it . Where is this species ' instinct of self-preservation ? The heroines in the first few books were strong , valiantly trying to cope with nightmarish events , while holding on to their personal beliefs . They were not easily intimidated or controlled by their lifemates ; there was a lot of & quot ; look , bucko , just because you 're incredibly powerful does n't mean we do things your way all the time ! & quot ; . The latter heroines have been milksops , incessantly whining about the males ' authoritarianism without ever doing anything about it . Lately , Ms. Feehan 's books have all had the same plot : ( Man ) & quot ; You are my lifemate , do as I say ! & quot ; ( Woman ) & quot ; No , I wo n't , I wo n't ! & quot ; Picture a foot stomping here , and you 'll have the whole idea . Instead of a man-woman relationship , it has become a parent-prepubescent one.These ladies are also unbelievably ineffective at defending themselves , or having a say in the course of events . I am generally attracted to strong female characters , whose love for the hero does not obliterate their ability to think for themselves , or the pursuit of their own goals.I keep buying the new installments , hoping against hope for a return to the heroine who can hold her own against the hero , and I get disappointed every time . Do n't be like me . Read Dark Prince , Dark Desire , and Dark Magic . That 's it , stop there .	-1
This is the second book in this series that I 've tried to read . It has had great reviews and been recommended time and again , so I thought I 'd give the Argenau 's another try.I could n't finish it . Once I start a book , I HAVE to finish it . Even if it 's boring . The only reason I do n't finish one is because its lost my interest too much or something about it really bothers me , and that is rare . Unfortunately of the 3 books I 've started and never finished- 2 of them were in the Argeneau series . I have no idea why I do n't connect with this series . It is wildly popular and many people love it . I am a huge fan of the genre , so that is n't the problem for me . In fact , I 'm always looking for new books within the genre and with so many in the series ... I really WANTED to like it.I 'm not saying I would n't recommend this series but I 'd probably only buy one book at a time until you can decide if it works for you .	-1
I wrote the following as a comment to another review , but thought that perhaps I should also post as a separate review , for those who might miss it otherwise ! I was terribly disappointed with all of the `` facts and figures '' that were so overly-detailed in this book ! Percentages , ratings , dollar amounts , etc. , etc . I did n't want to read a `` Wall Street '' accounting of this show ; I wanted what it promised : behind-the-scenes information about Lucy , Desi , and all of the rest of the cast , crew , and guests who comprised the `` I Love Lucy '' show ! It seems as if it took FOREVER to get through this book , due to the fact that it was SO mired down with useless business information and statistics ; there were times that I actually had to FORCE myself to pick it up again , and I have NEVER felt like that about any of the other books that I have read about Lucy and the gang ! Skip this one , unless you 're an accountant , or someone who loves the DRY behind-the-scenes look at Desilu 's financial statement !	-1
I will not buy the kindle edition of a book for the same price as a paperback . Will have to get it from my local library .	-1
Darkness Before Dawn.Haha , the title is a pun on the heroine 's name ! How not cute.The book started off with an ice-monster prologue that did relatively nothing to entice me and made me realize that the next 350 pages were going to be loooooooooooooong.Let 's start off with our main character , conveniently named Dawn . Dawn is the second-most boring female protagonist I 've ever read , only behind Lucinda Price . The best internal line she had in the book was `` He was a damn vampire ! `` Seriously.That 's it.Her whole life was so boring . `` I did this . I did that . I did this , too . Then , I did that . '' That was what the prose felt like . It was n't even prose ; it was just crap.I feel like `` J.A . London '' ( a.k.a . Jan and Alex `` London '' [ a.k.a . Rachel Hawthorne and Alex Nowasky { a.k.a . Jan Nowasky and Alex Nowasky , mother-and-son writing team } ] ) just wanted to earn a few extra bucks and decided to capitalize off the perpetually-growing YA field . ( I 'm glad the mom and son did n't decide to write Harlequin romances ; that would be just awkward to write together . ) I feel ultimately like they could 've put a bit more effort into making an original story with refreshingly genuine characters and just plain originality , because what they gave us is a pile of more of the same.The extra star is for the plot finally moving somewhere within the last one-hundred pages .	-1
I have read a number of Beauty and the Beast retellings . It is the ultimate female fantasy . A humble , beautiful , clever , brave , self sacrificing maiden meets a cursed monster and through time and understanding , love conquers all , breaks the evil spell and they live happily ever after.This retelling is a Gothic twist that makes everything seem overwrought , overdone , convoluted , thick , slow and illogical . I felt I wasted my time reading half of the book . I could n't force myself to finish.The descriptions of things and people are repeated over and over again as though the author was paid by the word like the old days . Except the author is not as gifted as Charles Dickens . The wierd way Italian phrases are gratuitously stuck in , here and there , makes me wonder `` what was that for ? '' The `` Monster '' and his character are standard romance cliches , `` legs like oaken trunks '' Puleeze ! What he says and how he acts are fake gothic and ridiculous . The only person worth anything is the heroine and sometimes , I found her motivations and speech to be repetitive , whiny , illogical and just plain stupid . The rest of the characters in the `` palazzo '' are straight from a 1930 's B movie horror flick . It made me laugh out loud the absurdity of their speech and mannerisms . Maybe a reader in the 19th century would think this was hot stuff , but in 2008 , romance readers expect more.I am going to give C Feehan another chance with her vampire books , but this one went into the recycle bin about 1/2 way through .	-1
I am a devoted James fan but I could not enjoy this book . The characters were shallow and unlikable while the story was farfetched . There is a happy ending but it comes super fast and with no real resolution . Theo does not the explanation she deserves or the opportunity to express her feelings . Much of the book is devoted to Theo second guessing herself and struggling with her self esteem and this is never resolved . Usually , I read a new James book in 24 hours . This one took several days and it was an effort .	-1
No , I will not be reading Sophie Nash again for awhile , this novel was just awful . Hero and Heroine are stuck in a very silly bargain , that 's just too much to swallow . There are way too many characters , not too mention too many Dukes . I did not get introduced to all the Cynsters or the Bridgertons all at once , why did Nash decide to set up her series this way . That definitely does not work since it took away so much from the relationship of the hero and heroine . Final verdict : I will not be reading the rest of this series .	-1
DNF . Not because it is a bad story , it is actually pretty good but way to slow for me . I need a book to move faster and I was battling with the `` historical '' writing style . Maybe I will pick this book up again ... .	-1
This book deserves 0 stars . It lacks everything : story , characters , action flow . The abstract makes you have great expectation but the book doesn ` t live up to them .	-1
I read the first few pages , skipped to the next chapter and put it down and have not wanted to pick it up again.It was recommended to me by a friend , I would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I just finished the Kindle edition of & # 8220 ; Divergent & # 8221 ; . If you want a literary review of the book , this is not it.I read a lot . I & # 8217 ; ve read the 14 & # 8220 ; Wheel of Time & # 8221 ; books five times , the & # 8220 ; Mystborn & # 8221 ; series twice , all of & # 8220 ; Harry Potter & # 8221 ; three times , and so forth . Most books , like the & # 8220 ; Hunger Games & # 8221 ; series , I read once . I have both hard copy and Kindle edition of almost all of them . I read for entertainment or education . This book provides neither.The whole story is of brutality , sadism , and pain . There is no 'happy ' at all . Morality seems twisted and not something anyone would want to experience . I am NOT going to see the movie because Hollywood seldom improves presentation of such human behavior . Perhaps the sequence of books will develop into a happy ending , or a satisfying triumph of good , or a resounding vindication of moral strength . If you think so and you want to be optimistic you can hang around for the subsequent volumes hoping for something uplifting but I don & # 8217 ; t care to do that.I finished the book at about midnight and , after putting it down , I was lying quietly in the dark hoping to drift off to sleep . But I did not . Realizing why , I had to laugh at myself . Through the years I have come to believe that each day each of us changes . What we read , what we watch , the people we are with , and the things we do change us . You are not the same today as you were yesterday . And you will be different tomorrow . So , I thought about the effect & # 8220 ; Divergent & # 8221 ; had on me and I realized I was angry and disappointed . The reason I read it was because it was mentioned both by my 22 year old daughter and by my 10 year old grandson . He said he heard it was like the Hunger Games but better . No , it is not . The effect the book had on me was to make me worry about why those I love would like all the beatings and bullying and the evil intent of factions in the book . I was lying awake getting angrier . LOL . So , instead of sleeping , I & # 8217 ; m up telling you what think about & # 8220 ; Divergent & # 8221 ; . Hope this heads-up about the content helps you . I do NOT believe reading the book will . Sincerely .	-1
I was really hoping by all the reviews that I would be in love with this series but I can not love it.The plot of the whole book seems shallow . Descriptions are pretty much non-existent . The Dauntless home is confusing . Is it a cave ? It has a glass ceiling and a large pit with water that goes through it . The description is so vague I ca n't even conjur what the author wants us to envision.Overall I just did n't like the storyline . I have aleady bought the second book but am debating do I really want to waste another few days readins such a bland story.The characters have no depth or like to them . Yeah they are fine but the are not great . I feel like Tris is such a child that in a way it disgusts me that she is even with a boy.I think there are a lot better series out there than this one.I say skip this and read a series like the Shadow reader by Sandy Williams . At least that brings warmth to your cheeks from the plot line .	-1
The writing is amateurish . The editors really dropped the ball on this one or just did n't care because they figured they could sell another teen dystopia with little effort at quality . The story is not bad , but not original . The movie is much better as it streamlines the plot and cuts out the stale dialogue and stream of consciousness .	-1
Though the plot was superb and the book well-written , I really hated the main character . She came across ( to me ) as cold and self-centered . Also , when she was killing people , she SMILED like she was enjoying it . I lost a good 75 % of my sympathy for her after I read that.This being said , again the story is great and it 's well-written .	-1
if i could have given this book no stars , i would have ... .i endured the torture as long as i could , since this was recommended by a friend who was very enthusiastic ... and it has received good reviews here as well ... .this book may be addressing a timely and important topic , but the characters could not be more shallow . there is n't one of them i would have for a friend ; and i could not get interested in what was happening to them , or what they had to say .	-1
This is the first Jamie Freveletti book I have read and I 'm sure if I will read another . The main character , Emma Caldridge , is a super hero of sorts and she falls short . Instead of a strong , willful , athletic character , the author has her doing unbelievable things that make you laugh instead of relating to her . Every man in the book wants her and I ca n't figure out why.The storyline is a bit silly too . A drug cartel trying to destroy the United States with a deadly virus ? Then who would buy their drugs ? It does n't make any sense and neither did any of the scenarios in the book . The action sequences were shallow with Emma always coming out a winner and withou any harm done to her . Sorry . I will pass on any more books by this author .	-1
I have enjoyed Caroline Linden 's books in the past , What A Gentleman Wants ( Zebra Historical Romance ) andA Rake 's Guide to Seduction ( Zebra Historical Romance ) are amongst my top 50 ever favs . But I was disappointed with this book.It started off really well . Lord Gerard de Lacey is the youngest son of a Duke who has just found out that his dead father had a bigamous marriage which means he is a bastard . He also finds out that his father was being blackmailed about this before he died . Determined to find out who the black mailer is , Gerard decides to head off to Bath to follow clues . But he is also mindful that he could become cast out of society and made penniless , thus he agrees to a marriage of convenience with Katherine , who is a very rich widow needing a protector . Katherine has been secretly in love with Gerard for years and prays that he will love her as much as she loves him . But he has other things on his mind . Question is : will Gerard recognise what he has before it is too late.The reason I did n't think much of this book was that it started off strong but petered out . The blackmail story was really interesting , but Gerard gave up the search for the blackmailer once he decided he was in love with Katherine ... why he does this , I can not work out . Katherine appears to be in terrible danger from her dead husband 's relative , but that all fizzles out . Even the relationship she has with her mother becomes something of nothing . We end up with a pretty uneventful story about two people are suddenly decide one day that they 're in love , and that 's about it . I will read the other two books in this series , and hope there is a little substance than in this book .	-1

I want to be clear that if this is the authors first attempt at a novel it is pretty good . The writing is okay , for the most part , and I was not hit with a significant number of jarring editing errors that can so easily pull me out of the moment and ruin a story . My biggest gripe is that there is nothing new or particularly interesting in the story , with the exception of a surprisingly unselfconscious sexism that repeats itself over and over throughout the story . It reads like a fourteen year old boy 's fantasy about civilization collapsing , where he is surrounded by women who need his protection and look to him for everything that requires thought . A strangely dominant theme is that a man should know exactly when it is time to kill his womenfolk ... you know ... for their own good . Bizarre.Otherwise it the same basic story that is seen over and over again in the genre . The characters are underdeveloped , the story arc is obvious , and the bad guys are cardboard cutouts . Based on the positive reviews I thought it might be good , but I was pretty disappointed overall .	-1
I really liked Variant , and I wondered like everyone else what was the purpose of putting robots in the school . And ... do n't expect a great answer to this.The story is a repeat of Variant , just not as well done . The only people , who escape , were Becky and Benson . Becky is severely wounded . Benson finds a town , and it is filled with human versions of the robots from the school.This is a poorly done version of Variant , also known as mix and repeat . Now they are stuck in a town and need to escape . The kids in town can not escape , because they have implants in their brains and with a push of a button can be killed . The dynamics and interactions between the kids were just not as well done . Everything that made Variant good came off as lame in this book . This was just a bad repetitive version of Variant.SPOILERSOkay , Benson decides to break back into the school , but he warns everyone to hide in the underground tunnel they have been slowly carving out over time . And the powers that rule the school are very concerned because they ca n't find the people in the town . Ummm , have n't they spent years carving out that freaking tunnel ? I find it unlikely that no one noticed that some of them would disappear for a little while . YEARS , and no one notices ? BIGGEST SPOILERSo we get to the end , and magically , though I do n't understand how , Benson defeats the robot . So , it was all due to darn , dirty aliens . They have been there for like a 100 years , manipulating people . And I scratched my head and wondered why ? What a dull ending .	-1
My God ... I hate to do this , hate it , but this book is GOD DAMN AWFUL.I 'm pretty sure it will be one of the worst books of the year for me , right next to Impossible by Nancy Werlin . *shudders*I dread writing a bad review , dread it , but I also hate when books let me down like this , and I paid for it , so I think I have the right to rant a little bit.My main problem with Carrier of the Mark is that it 's a Twilight copycat . There are no vampires or werewolves , because the paranormal part has to do with magic and the four elements , but really , everything else is exactly like Twilight , like this : -The book starts with the heroine ( Megan ) going to her first day on a new school-There , she immediately caughts the attention of this extremely gorgeous and mysterious guy ( Adam ) who does n't socialize with anyone else besides his sister ( and I can tell you right now she 's the `` Alice '' in this story ) -Megan 's friends keep telling her to stay away from the guy but she does n't , of course , and thinks about him , and his handsomeness 24/7-At a point Megan gets ditched by her friends and walks to a party at night alone . Two drunk guys show up and one of them wants `` to have fun '' with her . Out of nothing Adam shows up and saves her.-They hook up in the following scene , after Adam tells her he ca n't stop thinking about her since they first saw ( stared at ) each other-The next day he invites her to his house , to meet his weird family . His room is strange . ( There is a bed , but the wallpaper is orange and has a floral pattern . ) -At the house Megan meets the family 's guardian , Fionn ( `` Carlisle '' ) , who does n't want her there , but she trips and falls on her face and he starts acting nice-Adam 's older brother , R & iacute ; an , does n't care that Megan is clumsy or fragile , he still hates her after the face-on-the-floor-incident , and starts hating her even more when Fionn explains about the carriers of the mark , the magic , and of how dangerous it is to be part of that world , and Megan is still all excited to get in . R & iacute ; an is obviously the male equivalent to Twilight 's Rosalie.-And did I mention that Megan ca n't stop thinking about Adam 's good looks ? Like I said , the copycat was what bothered me the most , but there were other things , like most of the time the dialogues do n't make sense , especially between the couple . For example , from day one , all they do is stare and frown at each other from the distance , and in one of their first real interactions , Adam tells her he 's crazy about her , even though she might find that hard to believe , because of the way he has been acting . I read this and asked myself : What ? What did he do ? Did I miss a couple of pages ? They barely interacted until this point , so what happened ... ? He did save her from drowning a few days before , maybe that 's it . He is sorry he saved her . DOES N'T MAKE SENSE.Now , why I stopped at page 177 and refuse to finish : Megan , Adam , his brother and sister are all descendents from a mythical being , and each one of them is in possession of magic according to their element ( just like Sailor Moon , Megan is Air , Adam is Water , and so on ) , and this magic is in their blood , meaning : they need to procreate amongst each other so the line of magical descents wo n't go extinct . Now , there are others besides Megan , Adam and his siblings who possess the magical gene , but I swear to God that when Adam explains to Megan it 's basically their duty to make babies , it sounded to me like he was saying : Look , it 's either with you or with my sister.So I closed the book for good.Seriously , do n't read it . Save your money and your precious reading time for something else . *You have been warned*	-1
Slow and just got rather weary of the story . The beginning of their journey takes up the first half of the book ! And it just got boring reading page after page of erotic daydreams about each other . Page after page of having sex mentally about the other . Bored with the author writing the same description of her & # 34 ; berry lips & # 34 ; over and over . This book is just saturated with the above that I found myself thinking , & # 34 ; just do it and let 's get on with a story & # 34 ; . And what is it with the h not bathing or any kind of hygiene , puking her guts up , waking up with a mouth described as horrible , and she , herself , admitting that she ca n't stand her stench ... .then the H kisses her and thinks how wonderful she smells and that berry mouth so sweet ? Guess anything smells and tastes good when a hero is horny .	-1
I picked up a copy of this book because I am a fan of country music . I grew up on it , so I wanted to read this book as these are three men that are staples in this industry . So I was excited to read this book . Well I do have to say that it is packed full of information , however , I found that sometimes too much information is not always a good thing . Especially if you do not break up the information some with more personality . This is what I was hoping and looking for in this book ... personality . I wanted to get to the meat of these men and hear from them more and the special stories they had . Not really to read a book where I felt that I could gather this information from the internet . Sadly , I grew bored of this book and put it down and walked away from it .	-1
Chelsea Enright inherits her late grandmother Brooke 's cottage in the Adirondacks and with it a secret diary and some photographs . The diary holds the clue as to why her grandmother closed the cottage 60 years ago and never returned to live there . When Chelsea goes up to the cottage , she meets her neighbour Dr. Brandon Yale and decides to spend the rest of the summer there as she discovers her grandmother 's story.The premise of this book is good : long-buried family secrets , a summer cottage , romance . Unfortunately , it turned out to be a melodramatic over-drawn tale that failed to move me . Sensitive as I am , I could n't get into this book . It dragged , with characters that lacked depth and an unexciting predictable plot . I finished it only because I thought maybe the ending was going to be revelatory . Not at all . Everything is tied up too neatly in the end too . The whole thing was unrealistic , from the theatrical reactions of the characters to the men who shed tears quicker than my sister 's toddler.I think better editing was in order for this book . The overuse of ellipses , unrealistic dialogue and writing that left nothing to the imagination became irritating after a while . The setting was great , though . My family has spent summers in lakeside cottages and it is special . The author did manage to capture that feeling and I did enjoy some of the scenes , such as when Chelsea and Brandon flew over the lake in his floatplane.I guess some would consider this novel a sweet romance , and if you like that kind of romance along with a story of a grandmother 's secret hidden in a diary , and you are willing to disregard all the things that irked me , then you might just enjoy this book a whole lot more than I did .	-1
Lori Wilde is confusing me . She can write beautiful and exceptional stories like The Welcome Home Garden Club and the Wedding Veil Wishes series . Then , she throws in clunkers like The First Love Cookie Club and The Sweethearts ' Knitting Club . Unfortunately , this one is among the latter.It did not help that I had just finished reading an intelligently written book by a former attorney which snapped and sizzled from the first page ( About That Night by Julie James ) . The Cowboy Takes a Bride read more like an attempt by a first-time writer with no editor . There were incomplete sentences and incorrect punctuation , which constantly interrupted the flow of the book . Wilde once again employs the use of each character literally questioning him or herself as her method of advancing the story . The complete lack of creativity was glaring throughout.Neither character was compelling and they had zero chemistry . The pacing was ridiculous ; one minute nothing is happening between the two and the next they are `` in love . '' This book was so frustrating because I know what a good writer Lori is . When I read , I want to fall in deep and enjoy . This was more like a small wading pool . Terrible !	-1
This is the first book in this series I have read so I ca n't be sure but this book seemed to serve as a turning point for the heroine . It was slow and somewhat boring in terms of the heroine . The interesting part was the back story of the Indian immigrants and how they came to England and what happened to these women who came over as nannies and them were left to deal on their own . The heroine Maisie has some decisions to make in her life , decisions that she seems to have been putting off who knows for how many books . She does finally make some . I think enjoyment of her predicament/s would be greatly helped by reading her earlier books , this is definitely not a stand alone for the best enjoyment . The heroine is a psychologist and now works as a detective with the help of two staff . The has a lover she has been refusing to marry . The story takes place in the 1930s and is historically interesting but the overall feel of the book is rather depressing , again not sure if her other books are like this . I would recommend getting the first in the series and starting there to get involved with the heroine so you can feel for her challenges .	-1
It was too obvious , and I did n't like the style of writing . Just not me . I would n't recommend it to a friend .	-1
Given all the hoopla about this book , I thought I 'd find out for myself . I was particularly interested in the charges leveled against the author that he is a universalist or otherwise doctrinally unsound , a charge he denies.His critics need n't have worried . In fact , the controversy is giving this book far more exposure than it deserves . This is a book that , standing on its own merits , should be headed straight for the discount bin . Reason : fluffy , superficial teachings by an author who practices second-hand exegesis ( I would n't be surprised if not a single thought were his own ; he admits that much in the preface ) . Among the exegetical thought that he compiles , cuteness seems to be the number one criteria for inclusion . While he 's at it , he also butchers language study . The worst example of atrocious scholarship . however , is his total lack of knowledge of church history ( or disingenuous misrepresentation of it -- your choice ) . For example , he discusses how God 's grace would lead Christians to passivity on social issues and charity -- after all works are strictly optional . However , he fails to mention the tremendous track record of Christian charity and missions throughout the ages . He treats the idea that God 's grace will not lead to everyone 's salvation as though it were a great theological conundrum . Perhaps it is to Mr. Bell , who is obviously not a theologian or even a particularly theologically sophisticated preacher . To the theologically even marginally educated this may not be a pleasant subject by any means , but it is nonetheless an easily explainable non-issue.Or , Mr Bell claims that in the church tradition , universalism has always found a place and been even somewhat welcomed , since nobody could agree on this issue anyway . This misrepresents the truth egregiously . There probably have always been universalists ( and some that Mr. Bell tries to misrepresent as such , e.g . Luther ) . However , their teachings have been consistently held as heretical by the vast consensus of the church . If Mr. Bell knew church history he would know this . If he does know this , he is plainly dishonest.However , back to the charge of universalism . I do n't think that , at least based on this book , Mr. Bell should be characterized as such . He raises a bunch of questions . Then congratulates himself for raising such clever questions ( while the reader scratches their head in wonder as they realize that these questions are not original but have been dealt with in the orthodox and broad mainstream of the church often close to 2,000 years ago -- Does Bell not know that ; or does he pretend he did not know so that he can appear novel and original ? ) . Then he goes off into some poetic `` reflection '' and little language games , before finally failing to answer ANYTHING . While trying to sound clever and hip all at once . He is no universalist ; he does not have it in him to express any theological view that would show any degree of coherence and consistency ; not even one as absurd and discredited as universalism ! Mr . Bell is not the problem . Sadly , he is but a symptom . A symptom of uneducated , philosophically and theologically light-weight , ignorant or indifferent non-theologians tackling issues that they are simply not sophisticated enough to deal with ( It 's no wonder he received a blurb from Brian D. McLaren who squarely falls into the same category of theological impostorship ) . It 's also an issue of the book buying public falling for this , or buying books simply to see what the fuss is all about . And finally , the issue is a Christian publishing industry that has lost its way as it 's been chasing the big dollar signs . Lastly , an issue that the pursuit of truth seems to have become strictly optional -- as long as something feels good or tickles the imagination , who cares if it 's true.Save your money . Instead read , Counterfeit Gospels : Rediscovering the Good News in a World of False Hope , by Trevin Wax and Matt Chandler . It 's about 2 bucks cheaper and gives a pretty good background on various modern evangelical impostors ( without mentioning names ) , a couple of which fit Mr. Bell 's brand of faux theology.Love wins ? Not if in the process , the Truth loses ! Only those pandering to a postmodern audience will expect for even a moment that you could possibly have Love without Truth ( or Justice , for that matter ) . The absurdity of this kind of logic becomes readily appearent when you consider whether you would accept that kind of love in your marriage , from your friends , or even in the way you view yourself . This deficient `` love '' is better known as co-dependence , indulgence , capriciousness , or narcissism -- diseased fantasies ! But lest one may feel too sorry for confused theological light-weight Rob Bell , one thing 's for certain in all of this : Rob Bell wins -- all the way to the bank !	-1
I picked this book up numerous times ... and every single time I did so , my eyes blurred , my head nodded ... It 's simply way too descriptive for me . I think it could be a good story . The plot , what I could get of it once I trudged past lots of descriptive details , could be gook.. but overall I felt the book was mostly filler.I recommend this more for people who like the classics.. over contemporary style reads . I was unable to complete it .	-1
I got this book as a Kindle promotion either for free or for pennies , I do n't remember which . The low rating is because the book simply was n't my cup of tea , so to speak . It was n't necessarily badly written , although it could have used a little more polish . I have wanted so much to find a good steampunk book because I find the concept fascinating , but this one just was n't to my taste .	-1
State of Wonder is the worst book I have read in a very long time . It bewilders me that readers , or editors , could recommend or promote the book . The writing style is amateurish , the plot is unbelievable , the `` medical facts '' are laughably wrong , the imagery is pedestrian . `` Preventative '' is not even a word , although it appears five times in the novel . ( I know , `` preventative '' sadly is becoming an `` accepted '' alternative to the correct spelling , which is `` preventive , '' but that is no excuse for selecting a less preferred , and frankly wrong , spelling of the word . ) A description of the character Barbara Bovender in a space of half a page refers to her as `` Barbara '' , `` Barbara Bovender '' , `` Bovender '' and `` the Australian '' , despite the character 's having been introduced at length previously . The simile of a folding ruler to describe the impact of learning of the death of a friend seems so inapt and unlikely a reference for a medical doctor , but there it is , describing a feeling that many readers undoubtedly have had , without , I would bet a dollar , ever conjuring up in their own minds the image of a measuring device . Nothing in this book rings true . It might have had a nanometer of merit if it were offered up as a spoof on the pharmaceutical industry , but it simply is not funny and appears only to be an unintended joke . Anyone who recommends this book to you is just barking up the wrong tree ( which is a sad pun that I trust you can discover with minimal research and without having to purchase or read this book ) .	-1
There were a few things I liked about this book . Cutrone encourages readers to be extraordinary with compassion to make a difference in their communities . She justifiably has no tolerance for those who ignore the suffering of others when they have the power and resources to help . She writes about loyalty and surrounding ourselves with true friends who love us unconditionally and stick with us even if we behave badly at times , and to be that kind of friend as well . Cutrone shares about the deaths of her father and grandparents and in doing so shows us a glimpse of the kinder , gentler person she is behind the tough exterior.But I did struggle with most of the book and message . It really was n't so much a book of advice for women as it was an opportunity for Cutrone to rant against people , politics , and moral views that she does n't like under the guise of being a `` mama wolf '' to mentor young women.Cutrone uses the Merriam-Webtser definition of normal ( according with , constituting , or not deviating from a norm , rule , or principle ; conforming to a type , standard , or regular pattern ; of , relating to , or characterized by average intelligence or development . ) to make the case that anyone fitting that description must certainly be dull and incapable of having real success or fulfillment in life.The frequent use of the `` f-word '' was personally offensive and distracting . I 'm not sure who is `` normal '' - me for being offended or her for not . Her disdain for Judeo-Christian values comes through as she preaches her self-made anything goes religion of self and goddess worship with references to her spiritual mentor , a Hindu goddess she calls The Universal Mother , page after page.The basic positive message of needing to do something different if `` normal '' is n't getting us where we want to be is a good one but for me , it got lost in the author 's angst and delivery . If you really like Cutrone , then you wo n't have the same issues with this book that I did and will probably like it . I did n't .	-1
The main character is so wishy washy in deciding which man she wants , and with nothing more driving the plot than her wishy washyness , I got bored . The ending picked up , but not enough for me to want to read the conclusion .	-1
This is one of the most disappointing thrillers I 've read in recent years . The premise is solid : a woman wakes up one morning in bed with a middle-aged man and has no idea who she or the man are , or where she is . It 's quickly established that she 's in London and suffers from both `` regular '' and anterograde amnesia , that is to say , she ca n't remember most of her past , and nor can she store new memories . Early on , a psychologist secretly convinces her to start keeping a journal , and thus , through this journal she is able to start piecing together who she is , who the man is , and what happened to her.Unfortunately , none of this is thriller in the slightest , nor even very interesting . The bulk of the book is supposed to be her actual journal , but it 's written unlike any journal I 've ever seen , with full conversations recorded verbatim . In fact , it reads like a novel and ends up feeling quite clumsy . Because of her condition , we have to go through many repeated instances of her waking , freaking out , having her condition explained to her , etc . Now , I realize this is necessary in order to plant the clue and information necessary for later , but it 's also quite tedious to wade through over and over . The real problem , however , is that one basically reads this kind of book to get to the big `` twist '' or revelation at the end . But that twist is entirely obvious and predictable from very early on -- so obvious and predictable that even when it happens , I kept expecting a double-twist , because the first one was so `` meh '' . But that never comes , and instead we get a syrupy , rosy wrapup.And of course , the elephant in the room is that this condition has been used at the basis for both a gripping film thriller ( Memento ) and an underrated rom-com ( 50 First Dates ) , so it does n't even have a fresh scent about it . That has n't stopped a film version , due out next year ( starring Nicole Kidman , Colin Firth , and Mark Strong ) .	-1
Not very good - it 's very predictable and the ending is just , 'blah ' . I wo n't go into details about it because it could be considered a 'spoiler ' . The feeling I was left with upon completion of the book was , `` Wow , that was a complete waste of time '' .	-1
This has got to be the most bizarre book I have ever read . I just finished reading this book and it left me with the feeling of `` why '' ? The first and last chapters were the only two with much sustenance and everything in the middle left me saying `` yada yada yada '' .Obviously , I did n't like the book and would never recommend to anyone . Sorry Watson .	-1
Ooh , this sounded like such a good book . And the beginning was great.I was reading it every minute I had a chance.but then it started getting unbelievable , and not in a good way.Like others have said , the main character , Christine , has amnesia every morning , but knows how to use a cell phone every day when she does n't know they exist ? ? And her husband is never going to find that phone ? ? ha-ha ! ! And the Dr always manages to call only when the husband is away ? ? ha-ha again ! Sometimes people get sick and ca n't go off to work , and sometimesyou get a wrong number call on a cell phone , Yes , yes you do.Then the story started to really drag and I had to skip pages in order to make myself finish the book.I did n't even find any of the characters likeable.If I had checked this book out of a library , I would have just given up.But because I paid full price for the kindle version , I forced myself to finish.This was also a weird book . It 's a male writer trying to write first person as a woman ... that 's a major ick factor for me , especially the masturbation scene ... What ? totally threw me - it did not have any purpose or point to it , did not move the story along , and just came out of nowhere . and the 'bobbing erection ' was ridiculous ... .I rolled my eyes a lot reading this book.. and the ending was a mess.It was really confusing and was just not believable ... I wish I could wake up and forget I read this ! !	-1
Seriously , Erica , err I mean Susan , your autobiography was a disappointment to me . I expected insight into what has made up your exciting and unique life . Instead , reading `` All My Life '' was like overdosing by putting too much cream in my morning coffee -- all sweetness and light . Come on , Susan ! Your life must have contained a bump or two along the way , so why not share both the ups and the downs with your fans and readers . Nobody 's life is *that* perfect.Perhaps had you written your autobiography today , now that `` All My Children '' has been cancelled by ABC , your life 's story might be a little less rosy . Do n't get me wrong , I am not trying to be cruel , nor am I looking for downers . I only wanted to get to know you better through your writing and I honestly do n't believe that this occurred.While your life was wonderful and you no doubt have a wonderful family and a wonderful career , I am afraid that your book turned out to be wonder-less . I closed your book feeling let down and disappointed . And that 's a real downer .	-1
I read everything . I 'm not sure why I bought this book . Now I know why I should n't have . The pictures are terrible , there is no story except that of one who is continually patting themselves on the back for being just so great . He is just a washed up old rocker who wants to stay in the limelight as long as possible and I have just helped him . I like photography very much ... but this just stunk . If someone wants this.. let me know .. I 'll gladly give it for free .	-1
The characters are silly . The story is boring . I honestly found it hard to finsih and my teenage daughter tossed it aside after a chapter or two . The main character is n't someone you like or have empathy for so it 's hard to really care what happens to her . She comes off as really spoiled and self centered . There is no romance to speak of except for a few meaningless makeout sessions . I ca n't recommend this for anyone .	-1
what a waste of time . I would NOT recommended any this book to any one . This is one of the worst book ever	-1
I am angry that I wasted my time reading the first 2/3 of this book . No sense of time or place . A copy of not only Jane Eyre but also Cinderella and Oliver Twist . The attraction of Mr. Sinclair to Gemma was just too much of a fairy tale for me to proceed . Do yourself a favor , and read the originals .	-1
This so called Erotic Romance is totally lacking of eroticism it might as well be labeled OK for teenage reading .	-1
I own , in print , nearly every book SH has written , but have begun to exchange them for ebooks which is what lead me to Kiss of Surrender . I read a bit of the blurb , and confess I read only some of the sample included on the product page because it was SH after all , and I 'd always loved her books in the past . Until this one . I got to 40 pages in and could not read anymore . It 's not bad , per se , but it is not for me . I got so bogged down in the vampire angels and vampire devils that I could n't sink my teeth into the story plot . I will continue to be a huge fan of SH books , though not with this series . I returned the book after less than a day , which I felt bad about , but reasoned that if I 'd seen it in a brick and mortar store that I would have stood there reading some of it and would have set it back on the shelf before I 'd even read 20 pages . Sorry to SH -- still a huge fan !	-1
Keep with the TV series and leave the writing to the pro 's I enjoy his TV entertainment , but not the booksnt	-1
I thought I was reading a mystery , but soon found out it was a history of Indian life on the reservation . This is all very interesting and a story that needs to be told . However , I am not into reading historical novels ( true or untrue ) for my entertainment . The story is sad and makes one ashamed of the atrocities the Indians had to suffer as we , the white men , raped and pilfered their lands , their homes , their families , and their very souls . An odd way to tell a story , what with the bits of humor .	-1
The book embellishes a crime and it 's after effects through the eyes of a child . The author keeps introducing new characters that have very little to do with the plot . It is enlightening about the comparison of tribal law and U.S. law .	-1
Too real . I was not ready to be sad and depressed about conditions that still exist in these areas . Yes , she is a great story teller . I just could not read it .	-1
I like T.I . 's music . That said , I do not like his writing . I agree with others who said the writing style felt a little forced . In all actuality , I could probably read something else with that type of style , but it was n't working for this specific story . I , as well , became a bit disinterested after the main character made note of how he was checking out his adopted sister . I had high hopes for this , because again , I love T.I . 's music , but I would not recommend this book .	-1
Many times it is a disappointment when someone uses the name of an excellent author to sell a book ; that is the case here . I am just over half way through the book on my Kindle and find myself skipping large portions in order to finish . I expected 'some ' input from Terry Pratchett and find none . Mr. Pratchett is one of my very favorite authors , I guess I will just start rereading his original books . I miss you Terry .	-1
I was n't a great fan of `` The Long Earth . '' The 'parallel universe ' premise is n't a particularly original hook , but some parts of the original -- particularly the later parts of Lobsang and Joshua 's journey -- were somewhat interesting . Pratchett 's 'voice ' was hard to detect -- perhaps in some of Lobsang 's dialogue , which sometimes had some of that dry wit Pratchett in his prime was known for.In `` The Long War '' there 's barely evidence of Pratchett at all . The book is all Baxter , and it 's a gigantic , overwritten mess . To what should have been a continuation of the discovery story Baxter ends endless minor characters who were no purpose other than to represent a Point of View ( religious , political or otherwise ) . There are endless chapters of backstory that are completely skippable and add nothing . We get new sapient species based on dogs and early hominids that can suddenly speak English in weeks and become fans of The Kinks . We get a whole bunch of separate voyages among these Earths that add up to absolutely nothing . We get the threat of some kind of civil war fueled by a `` taxation with representation '' premise , two female 'authority ' figures who are nearly impossible to tell apart , and an animal rights saga that is literally solved with a hologram . Oh , and we get a completely irrelevant thread of Long Earth hero Joshua Valiente sent on missions where he accomplishes absolutely nothing ( other than being verbally abused in one journey and physically tortured in another ) .This is just bad , bad writing . Baxter appears to be influenced by the George R. R. Martin school of introducing numerous characters and backstories and hoping that readers will catch up . Martin got away with this in his first three books and fell on his face in last books . Baxter does n't even get past the first 100 pages before he completed negates any possible interest readers might have in this story .	-1
If you 're a seasoned romance reader I do n't see how you could possibly give this 5 stars . It was one of those novels where the two main characters over-think everything to the most ridiculous degree . The thing that keeps them apart throughout the novel is their own peculiar take on the world.For me it was a whole novel of the same baffling angst rehashed in a number of different scenarios . I found it wearing and tiresome.Not only that , I found Michael 's motivations in particular unnatural and contrived , and the other characters did n't fair much better . The characterization for all of them was vague or non-existent.Add to this that the whole thing was totally without charm or humour . Sarah Maclean 's first novel was exceptionally good . Sadly , this was little more than a dirge . I felt glad to get it over with .	-1
I had to force myself to finish this . I kept thinking this was computer-generated from some new writing software -- follow this checklist , and you 'll have a novel ! No , what you have is a checklist . And it 's boring to read . My problems with the book are as follows:1 ) The author does n't show you the characters ' thoughts or their changing -- she tells you they 're changing , or have changed . It sounds like she 's writing a list to remind herself what to write . So even though they are different at the end of the book than at the beginning , you do n't believe it.2 ) The main characters have very little personality or definition , and the secondary characters -- none at all . We are told she 's very concerned about her brother , but he has perhaps two lines in the whole book . He 's a prop , as are all the other characters . What does he look like ? Do they resemble each other ? Does he feel empowered by her stepping back and letting him be a man ? And the description of the hero ! The first paragraph basically says : You know all those other Corinthian , Regency dashing hero types ? Well , just like that.3 ) Though one of the orgasms is described thus : `` ... they were re-formed , transformed ... '' , nobody was actually transformed at all . The hero was supposedly rakish , yet is compounded of nothing but virtue from the first . The heroine , though supposedly a stickler for propriety , seems to suffer not the slightest qualm about shedding it , shredding it ! ( yes , that was sarcasm ) -- indeed , the first action we see her take is to slip into the home of a stranger in the middle of the night , a stranger with a rakish reputation . ( A wealthy stranger whose door is perplexingly unlocked . ) Young ladies of the gentry , concerned about propriety , would not go out even riding or walking with a man in daylight , without the presence of a maid or chaperone of some kind . Nor would they travel without a maid -- those garments were not easy even to take off , let alone put on , without assistance . But that would have been inconvenient , so it 's ignored.The heroine does n't so much transform as weigh her options , with cold , calm , calculation . She does n't feel anything at all -- and neither do we.There was a wealth of ideas present , all to absolutely no purpose , which could have been spun into gold . A good writer might have mined the secondary characters for some much-needed humor , or at least for something to do.Here 's the ultimate spoiler for the book:1 ) Stock outline of main couple2 ) Plot situation3 ) sex scene4 ) sex scene ... . ( yada , yada , yada ) 20 ) Tell people they 've changed , and pull the curtain as they kiss.To fill pages , the book just piles on the sex scenes , seemingly just taking the previous one and substituting different cringe-worthy mixed metaphors and florid plays on words . ( ... '' their fingers splayed , played ... '' ) . First , he 'll `` dance her out into the fire '' -- the dancing analogy . Fire analogy mixed in . Religious terminology -- whenever they climax , instead of being covered with fluid , it 's `` glory '' . They swirl higher and higher , until they fall ... Bleh ! They seem written by an adolescent virgin , straining to top the record for metaphors abused in a single sex scene.A strange note -- much of the sex stuff seems written from the POV of the guy : descriptions of how it feels to touch a woman , how her body parts are responding . Not what I am looking for , nor what I 'm interested in . We do n't need an anatomy lesson -- we need clues about how an allegedly `` prim '' virgin goes from `` proper '' to `` professional '' overnight . That 's the real transformation.The author might try describing what 's being transacted between the characters while they 're dancing , burning , falling , and glorying . At one point , the hero thinks about what a breakthrough or revelation they 'd had the night before -- and that was the only Night of Swirling Metaphors we were n't invited to ! That was one I might have found interesting -- a scene in which the sex is , to borrow from Tennessee Williams , a `` meeting between two people '' . Then she 's less likely to pull a muscle straining for new metaphors and more 'glory ' .	-1
I 've been a long-time fan of Stephanie Laurens but this book felt more like reading Charles Dickens . Why ? Because the 400 plus pages felt as if she was being paid by the word ( as Dickens was ) and she dragged out every scene with far too many words . I 'm a lawyer and teacher , not an editor , but felt as if even I could have drawn a red pencil through at least half of the book 's many , many repetitious thoughts and descriptions.Please , Ms. Laurens , return to your formerly excellent tight writing for the next book !	-1
I love Stephanie Laurens ! I loved the first half of this book and thought a great thing was going here although I did smile a few times at some of the strange words she used to describe things . Then the book turned into lots and lots talking , thinking and not much action at all . I could n't believe I finally began skimming , and even skipping , pages through the last third of the book to get through it . I will certainly continue to read Miss Laurens and hope for more the next time .	-1
I have loved the majority of Ms. Laurens but , I was n't impressed . There was not much romance or steam or much chemistry at all .	-1
I 'm going to do you a favor . I am going to tell you , right now , the single highlight of the entire book.A man , performing for children , asks them what he will do if he loses his prized , trained parrots . Upon hearing their responses , he tells them it was a rhetorical question . Then , he asks them if they know what a rhetorical question is , and gets no reply . He decides that either they do know , or that they don't.Now I have saved you the money , time , and effort that it would take to sit through this book . That was the SOLE good part of the entire book . The rest of the book was plaintive whining , gnashing of teeth , and DESPAIR . Not even the good , healthy , cathartic kind of despair , either . The sad , miserable , and quiet , `` sit in the corner until I die '' kind.If that 's your thing , then this book is too . Otherwise , go read something with some joy . Or at least some meaning . For God 's sake none of the stories has an ending . None of the characters are likable , unique , or even interesting , really . The plots are so flat that they make the ground look like a saw blade . There is , literally , almost nothing I enjoyed about this book.Unless I meet some pretentious person who thinks that this is `` art '' , I ca n't envision recommending it to ... anyone . Unless I secretly hate them , and think that they do n't know that I hate them . And I think that I might be able to make them suffer by paying for it and trying to read it ... Harkius	-1
I just did n't like it . It was n't what I expected . The reviews were inaccurate and the plot was just plodding .	-1
I am going to have a very hard time reviewing this book because I did not finish it . Like so many other reviews I read , I just could not get into this book . I did make a genuine effort , but I did not connect with the characters even though I really wanted to . If I do not make a connection there is no way I can be fully invested in a book.The cover of this book is just so amazing though is n't it ? And the summary sounded right up my alley , but after a hundred pages I had to walk away . I know there are others out there that did enjoy this book , so I would recommend reading an excerpt from the book or one or two chapters before you commit to buying it .	-1
A disappointment . Not up to par with his other novels . Do n't know if it was editing or what , but it almost seemed as if another author had a hand in the writing of the characters . Good storyline , though .	-1
`` Lyon 's Bride '' tries to combine two genres -- Regency romance and fantasy/paranormal . The two different genres are not fused in a convincing manner in this novel.The novel starts in the 17th century when a member of the Chattan family jilts the daughter of another noble Scots family . The abandoned fiancee and her mother commit suicide , but not before the vengeful mother places a curse on future Chattan males -- if they marry for love , they die soon afterwards.That 's the fantasy part of the novel.Then the reader is abruptly dumped into London in 1816 , where a strong-minded heroine , Thea , who 's been widowed and abandoned to poverty by her ducal relatives , struggles to support herself and her sons by working as a matchmaker . She secretly nurses a broken heart for Lord Lyon , a Chattan family member who abandoned their teenage friendship without explanation.Lord Lyon asks Thea to find him a bride whom he will not love , but who will give him children and be a creditable aristocratic wife , thereby allowing him to avoid dying young of the family curse . I found it unbelievable that he would ask a woman who he had a serious crush on as a teen to come in constant contact with him as a matchmaker and thus risk the revival of their feelings.I also could n't connect the semi-pagan world of early 17th century Scotland with the brisk modernity of the Regency setting . The author seemed to have started out writing one type of novel and then abruptly switched to a different type of novel . The curse simply was n't credible in the Regency part of the book . I could n't suspend disbelief .	-1
I wanted more action in my book . I like to read books that make it so I ca n't put the book down .	-1
This book was a do not finish for me . The tone was very dark and things were not explained leaving me guessing as to what exactly was going on . Another book about a girl staying with a guy who is wrong for her when he does n't even seem that interesting .	-1
I returned this to the library after listening to 4 cds.I am clueless about what was supposed to be going on in this book . The . keeper and the seeker appease the shadow spirits . The village was gone ( they left ) , but men on horses took the children . It seemed like whenever there was real action that we were spending time with the wrong twin . There just seemed to be meaningless bad things going on , and it was presented in the most boring way possible .	-1
The theory of evolution is that microscopic organisms evolved into whales in a period of about a hundred million decades . I use decades , rather than years or seconds , because it takes 2 decades for a fertilized human egg to produce all of the cells in the human body.Whether evolution is a fact or a theory , natural selection acting upon innovations is an attempt to understand what caused evolution . The old paradigm for innovations is random mutations , but the new paradigm is natural genetic engineering , at least according to James Shapiro of the University of Chicago.Whatever the paradigm , evolutionary biologists do n't understand how mammals evolved in such a short period of time . This is expressed by saying natural selection explains the adaptation of species to the environment ( microevolution ) , but not common descent ( macroevolution ) .Consider hemoglobin , the protein that carries oxygen to cells . The primary structure of hemoglobin is a chain of 600 amino acids . There are twenty different amino acids and every amino acid must be in exactly the right position on the chain . Sickle-cell anemia is caused by one misplaced amino acid . Hemoglobin is like an English sonnet with the 26 letters taking the place of the 20 amino acids . Since it is virtually impossible for a computer to generate a sonnet by randomly selecting letters , natural selection can not explain even the primary structure of a protein.The only theory that even attempts to explain evolution is the theory of intelligent design ( ID ) , and Meyer is an advocate of ID . However , ID is irrational because there is no evidence that an intelligent designer exists.Meyer thinks there is evidence for ID because he does n't consider the possibility that the universe is not intelligible . The existence of proteins is evidence that the universe is unintelligible . It is not evidence for an intelligent designer . The theory that an intelligent designer exists is an exercise in circular reasoning . As Richard Dawkins put it , `` Who designed the designer ? `` Meyer also uses the straw man argument by implying that evolutionary biologists who are against ID think natural selection explains evolution . This scam succeeds because atheists go along with the scam . Atheists do n't want to admit that ID is a better theory than natural selection in some sense . Both atheists and advocates of ID are more interested in promoting their religious enthusiasms than in promoting an understanding of evolutionary biology.Meyer tries to explain why ID qualifies as science notwithstanding the objections of those who advocate `` methodological naturalism '' and `` materialism . '' This is the case of the blind leading the blind . Human beings ask scientific questions ( Why is the sky blue ? ) and metaphysical questions ( What is knowing the sky is blue ? ) . The answer to the metaphysical question is that it is a mystery . This means humans are embodied spirits and finite beings . Since finite beings need a cause , an infinite being exists . We call the infinite being God , Brahmin , Nirvana , Heaven , Tao , and Shangdi .	-1
Honest Abe reportedly commented about how gullible some people could be . That may be Meyer 's intended audience.Like a carnival barker peddling miracle cures , Meyer seems to have little expertise in many of the technical fields he addresses , while the vast majority of the acknowledged experts in those fields apparently disagree with him . So Meyer 's opinion about evolution seems only about as credible as Michelle Bachmann 's opinion about vaccinations.Many of Meyer 's key arguments seem pretty illogical . He claims the appearance of phyla before species is a problem for Darwinism , but his argument makes little sense . Can you even have phyla without species ? And his similar argument about disparity preceding diversity seems pretty dubious too . Phyla may be quite different from each other today , but that does n't logically entail that they were that different 540 million years ago . Meyer 's apparent assumption here seems not only question-begging but also pretty dubious.Meyer 's analogy between man-made ( designed ) objects and living organisms seems pretty misguided too . He argues that man-made planes are rigidly separated and necessarily distinct from cars , but the allegedly rigid separation seems pretty arbitrary . James Bond demonstrated how planes could be converted into cars in Octopussy , real-life hovercraft ( `` flying cars '' ) have appeared on golf courses , and many real-life race cars have real-life wings . So Meyer 's `` rigid separation '' in designed objects does n't really seem very rigid at all.The second half of Meyer 's analogy claims that different types of organisms are also rigidly separated from each other , just as he ( probably falsely ) imagines designed objects to be . That seems dubious too , since lateral gene transfer and symbiosis are two well known ways for different types of organisms to commingle components . So Meyer 's `` rigid separation '' argument seems problematic on both the design side and the biology side.Meyer also spends quite some time arguing that simple genetic changes can not account for the Cambrian Explosion , but real experts have emphasized the role of changes in `` genetic regulatory networks '' ( GRNs ) , rather than the simplistic genetic changes that Meyer addresses , so Meyer seems to be attacking a straw man here.In fairness , Meyer does at least mention GRNs , arguing that modern GRNs are hopelessly resistant to evolutionary change , but he offers no evidence showing that today 's GRNs are comparable to those of the Precambrian , so his argument basically depends on yet another question-begging assumption.Meyer repeats pretty much the same error in another , pretty significant argument about protein folds . Repeatedly relying on question-begging assumptions in key arguments seems to be a pretty serious problem for Meyer.Meyer cites an incorrect prediction by renowned Darwinist Ernst Mayr , apparently to support the inference that Darwinism itself is false , but Meyer 's argument seems badly misguided . Mayr 's prediction was explicitly based on Mayr 's knowledge of genetics , but Mayr was n't a geneticist , rather he was an ornithologist . Second , and even more important , Mayr 's prediction was made many years ago . So basically , Meyer , who apparently has little expertise in genetics himself , took a hopelessly outdated comment about genetics by someone who may have been even more ignorant about genetics than Meyer , and then tried to use that to imply that there 's something wrong with Darwinism . Is Meyer really that dumb , or is he just hoping his readers are ? And Meyer 's arguments for ID seem to be just as inane as his arguments against evolution.One of Meyer 's key arguments , perhaps the most important in the entire book , is that ID does make legitimately `` scientific '' predictions , specifically about the functionality of the human genome , but that seems extremely dubious . Indeed , it seems an obvious non sequitur to claim that the human genome was intelligently designed and therefore has more than a minimal level of functionality , because intelligently designed objects may have little or no functionality . Even such prominent ID-proponents as Michael Behe , Phillip Johnson , and William Dembski have said as much , so Meyer 's bold claim about `` predictions '' seems to be just empty bluster.The prediction issue is pretty significant , because making accurate , meaningful predictions is one of the traditional hallmarks of scientific theories . Judging from Meyer 's empty and ineffectual bluster , it seems to be that , despite having been around for thousands of years , ID is still looking for its first testable hypothesis.And as if that were n't bad enough , the so-called `` functionality '' that ID allegedly predicted may not really be all that functional at all . Different researchers define `` function '' in different ways . The definition that Meyer seized on seems to be virtually meaningless with regard to practical reality . ( And Abe Lincoln had an opinion about strained definitions too . It was not complimentary . ) So Meyer 's `` functionality '' argument seems little more than a terminological word-game that seems highly misleading , which is pretty much to be expected from Meyer 's organization , nicknamed the `` Dishonesty Institute . `` Finally , Meyer complains about how protective Darwinists are of their precious theory and how rigidly ID-ists are suppressed , but the inside back cover of the book has an impressive list of the major news outlets that have invited Meyer to present his views , and the rest of the book is chock full of citations to published studies of mainstream scientists critiquing various aspects of Darwinism . So where exactly are the suppression and protectionism that turned Meyer into such a tear-stained wretch ? Meyer was even invited to be a witness in the world-famous Kitzmiller trial . This was a golden opportunity for Meyer to present an extended , detailed argument for ID in front of a massive , worldwide audience , but instead of showing up and testifying in open court , Meyer chickened out and refused to appear . Where exactly is the suppression in that ? And why blame Darwinists for Meyer 's apparent cowardice ? Meyer 's book probably does n't do anything to establish ID as a worthwhile scientific theory , but it may help confirm Abe Lincoln 's hypothesis about people - unfortunately in this case , mostly Christians - whose blind faith allows them to be fooled over and over and over again.DD is n't as bad as some of the young-Earth drivel out there , but it 's still barely worth even one star .	-1
I 've been waiting to read this book for so long now that I honestly think my expectations were a bit too high . I 've seen the high average rating and the awesome blurb , and the hype is undeniable . But then I started reading and I was like : DISAPPOINTED.Not all it 's cracked up to be , clearly . I mean , part of me was really intrigued by this concept , but it took me until I was 80 % finished with this before it even got remotely interesting.The world-building is certainly creative , but in the beginning it 's haphazard and disorganized . For someone ( like me ) who has no idea where ( and when ) the hell I am while reading this book , hearing about the Marked and the Pods and Reverie and blah and more blah was really disorienting . I could n't keep anything straight and it irritated me . Along that line , there are key questions never really answered here.First of all , what is the Aether in the first place ? How did it get there ? Nuclear war ? Pollution ? Will we ever know the answer ? Second , why is nobody noticing there is a COMPLETE lack of government in this place ? We have these Consuls that apparently have nothing better to do than ignore fires and destruction , so ... .where 's the real authority here ? On to the characters ... okay , so I like them , do n't get me wrong . But I just could n't relate to them . The writing felt so formal and detached that I could n't get invested deeply enough in these characters . I mean , Aria ( whose name is SO obvious it hurts ) has this supposed deep bond with her mother , but I did n't feel it . Her friend Pailsey 's death skirts over her like it 's not important . And then on the flip side , she randomly engages in a relationship with Perry despite the fact that they ca n't stand one another . Just ... what ? Speaking of Perry . His abilities were interesting and really creative . At least at first . When Aria got her period though ... and he told her it smelled like violets ? That 's a little bit of a stretch . Even for me.Needless to say , this book has me on the fence . I liked Perry enough ( despite his awkward emotion-smelling and period-sniffing powers ) to care about him actually meeting up with Aria again . The plot finally kicked in around 70 % when stuff really started happening , so maybe the next book will be better .	-1
I LOVE Julia Quinn . I love every single one of the Bridgertons and I am very familiar with the Smythe-Smiths . I have read most of her books and I have to say , the excitement I felt leading up to this release was wasted.Slight Spoilers ahead ... So , you have Sarah and Hugh . Hugh was mentioned in Daniel and Ann 's story because it was the duel between Daniel and Hugh that forced Daniel to flee the country and Hugh 's dad to go all psycho and try to have Daniel killed.Daniel 's back , Hugh 's dad is n't going to kill him and now ... we have Hugh . Hugh is left lame ( which I believe is n't much nicer than crippled , Sarah Pleinsworth but , whatever ) in one leg . After some horrible innuendo about Hugh 's older brother and the rightful heir never having a wife because well , he 'll never marry *wink wink* because you know `` those sorts '' do n't marry *nudge nudge* . ( Eventually they just come out with why he wo n't or ca n't marry although it 's incredibly awkward and a waste of time imho ) .More spoilers ... So , it 's left to Hugh to continue the family line . Unfortunately he has n't bedded a woman since his accident . In comes Sarah , the one girl who can not forgive the stupid duel . She 's just Daniel 's cousin but because she had to go into seclusion for a year or whatever , she can not forgive Hugh.Eventually they get over this hatred of each other because obviously they are the two main characters and they have to hook up and fall madly in love with each other . The audience knows this so why even bother to provide real dialogue for more than a few convos or some semblance of romance/a real relationship.I guess that is one of my biggest problems . The relationship felt forced . They COULD have made a good couple , if the time had been put into it . Half of the book is spent with them disliking each other ( for stupid and forced reasons ) and then in like 20 pages they are madly in love.Also , the conflict in this novel was completely ridiculous and absurd . What 's even worse ? The solution . Complete drivel . Completely unbelievable , completely ridiculous and a complete a waste of my time.So , all of that equals me getting a refund on the book and one very unsatisfied customer.It could have been really good . Hugh and his eidetic memory were extremely interesting .	-1
This is the first JQ book that I struggled to finish . I love her Bridgerton series and her older novels too . But this one I found boring . The characters were n't interesting and I was n't emotionally invested in their story at all . The 'bantering ' also seemed somewhat contrived and went on for too long , such that there was n't really much action or real conflict to drive the story . The secondary characters were also a bit blah , and overall , this book did n't leave much of an impression.The storytelling , characterizations and wordcrafting of the Smythe-Smith novels seem a level lower and less imaginative than the wonderful Bridgerton series . Hope that JQ 's subsequent novels will strike a spark again .	-1

I found most of the parts to the book painfully boring , but I took interest when they did take the time to explain that `` not every polygamous marriage is perfect . `` ( as if someone has been assuming such a thing ) We should take note that this book is an attempt to show that `` success '' can be achieved in polygamy , and the point the authors make is to dispel false ideas about polygamy , but they harbor their own unique views of the practice as `` independent '' Fundamentalist Mormons . One not-so-unique position that comes out immediately is that Mormon fundamentalists consistently misunderstand the complaint against their practice , and this book seems to dive right into that misconception . The misconception is that the non-polygamous public are concerned about pre-marital sex , and thus the Dargers waste a lot of time elaborating that they were all virgins going into this , that day the three of them got married . It 's as if the rest of us can all relax , since they were virgins.When I read books about polygamy , I look for what usually gets no attention at all . What about the young boys who grow up in such families ? There are n't women for all of the men to practice polygamy , and therefore , inevitably , large numbers of young men drop from these groups at a rate proportionate to the number of women being taken into polyguamous relationships . Just look what happened to Valerie . She married a man more than twice her age , who already had four wives , and the abuse they all suffered because of this man was subhuman , as she describes it . But where are all the excess men going who ca n't , because of sheer number , practice this life they 've been raised to believe is so important that they call it the `` Principle ? `` I attended a book-signing with the Dargers and I asked them about the problem of excess males who have no one to marry , but are all obligated to follow the commandment to do so ? My question was quickly shuffled aside , unanswered . I 'm getting used to that . At some point , polygamists are not going to be able to shuffle away the questions that incriminate their religiously-based polygamy . They can hardly speak for these men who leave at a very young age . They are in no position to say that any of them leave simply because they chose not to be polygamists . These young men leave for a variety of reasons , one being that all of the girls their age are getting taken as polygamous wives to men sometimes many times older than they.I also think the Dargers owe the rest of the world an explanation about tolerance . They wish for it , but would a black person of African descent be eligible for their Mormon fundamentalist Melchizedek Priesthood ? This requires a yes-or-no answer . The LDS Church changed their view on this matter in 1978 . Have the Dargers and the priesthood authorities with whom they affiliate followed the lead of the LDS Church . I know the answer , but I 'm not going to speak for them . But if they are clinging to pre-1978 Mormon policy with regard to black men of african descent , it 's a little hypocritical for them to be begging for tolerance . They need to be very specific about this answer.Brooke Adams was there and she answered that in her experience , most FLDS men do not end up going into polygamy . Well , should n't that go without saying ? It would be physically impossible for that to happen . Brooke was only explaining what we should obviously expect in a society where population ratios ensure that less than half of the men are able to practice `` The Most Holy Principle . '' I felt like they were trying to give the impression that most men `` do n't wish '' to stick around , but that 's just a sneaky assumption they use to avoid to problem . In polygamous communities , men leave by the scores , while women are held for life . There 's nothing equal about that , and the Dargers are contributing to the problem . Brian David Mitchell has showed what can happen in that situation . Unable to practice polygamy in a Mormon fundamentalist group , he kidnapped a teenager for himself.The Dargers are very nice people indeed , and I hate having to ask probing questions like this , but since they 've chosen to take a public role in describing their practice , they should also give equal time and honesty to the consequences of polygamous society , even if everyone is over age 18 before they marry.Yes , there are problems in monogamous society too , but monogamy does n't set itself up for failure this way . Polygamy fosters a sort of elitism among the men who have enough prestige to acquire many women . Unmarried bachelors are at the bottom of the social scale .	-1
Listen to this advice from an hardcore Christie fan : do n't read this book . It 's such a painful experience to see one of the greatest mystery writers ever getting into - I ca n't use another word - complete senility . The story ( I ca n't call it a plot ) goes nowhere . Characters are wooden , and some excerpts are merely ludicrous . If you really like Christie , be charitable and forget about that sad final opus . She wrote so many excellent things in her earlier years .	-1
I think that I 'm going to have to be more patient in future when buying new releases from old favourite authors . If I 'd read the reviews prior to buying the book then I could have saved my money.I think the main problem is that the first 2 thirds of the book are devoted to dishonesty between the H and h. You could see the trainsmash coming and yet she persisted . It made me feel sick and if I did n't have a personal golden rule about finishing every book I start , I would also have stopped reading before I even got a third of the way through.The h was n't shrewish but she was willful , annoying , interfering , nosy beyond reason and I just never warmed to her . I do n't blame the H for not trusting her more and more as time went on . Usually I expect things to be moving in a positive direction in the last third but I just felt sick about it all.As for the rest of the continuing plot with The Order etc , I find I 'm just not inerested in it at all and skimmed through it as quickly as possible . There is so much more that I could say about what I did n't like but I think I 've said enough already . ***SPOILERS***The h was n't a virgin and had made one brief mistake but she decided not to tell her husband and continued to keep quiet about it even after her wedding night . This immediately created mistrust with the H , even though up to that point they 'd both been quite happy to be 'forced ' into marrying . The longer it went on , the more I felt the mistrust increased.By the end of the book I simply did n't care about the romance and did n't think that the love story was convincing at all . It started better than it ended in my opinion.I have loved so many of Gaelen Foley 's books in the past but this Inferno series has been terrible , except for the 4th which I quite liked ( My Ruthless Prince ) .Let 's hope that the next will see a return to form for Ms Foley , but I 'll certainly wait for reviews before buying the book .	-1
The cover looks nice , but the buck stops there . I just could n't not get into this book . Too much jargon this writer has created . Although I did see some of his points I found the book to be quite boring . Basically the author is saying , & # 34 ; Do n't just give stuff away. & # 34 ; Make people have to do something to earn it , pay a little , get involved in planning . And then you can create a program to help the poor with them as the leaders .	-1
On occasion , I enjoy a good ghost story from the ghost 's point of view . Since Ashes to Ashes was compared to Ghost ( one of the best movies out there , in my opinion ) in some versions of the synopsis , I became excited about reading Callie 's story . However , the story was completely predictable and about 150 pages too long.The world-building in Ashes to Ashes was the most interesting aspect of the novel . I have always been fascinated by everyone 's different interpretations of the afterlife , and I liked learning about Prism . It was like a less artsy version of Heaven from the movie What Dreams May Come with Robin Williams ( another favorite ) . Prism is more like Limbo than Heaven , and the spirits stay there to finish their hauntings before they can move on to Solus ( Heaven ) . Each new spirit/ghost had a Guide to take them through the process and that 's how Thatcher and Callie are thrown together.I was about a third of the way into the book , and I knew where the story was going . Well , I had guessed ( correctly ) about what was going on with Lee and Reena . I knew the secret behind Callie 's special snowflake powers without a shadow of doubt . I broke my cardinal rule of reading and skipped to the last chapter of the book . Sure enough , it was EXACTLY as I expected.To be fair , I flipped through the middle third of the book that I had skipped , but I did n't really find anything that I needed . I already liked Callie well enough to have been able to read what I had , but I never really connected with her . ( If it 's not there before 100 pages in , it 's not coming . ) Thatcher really did not interest me because broody , standoffish male protagonists make me tired . The & # 34 ; villains & # 34 ; were even too vanilla for my tastes.There are plenty of twists and turns in Ashes to Ashes that were obvious to me a mile away but may work for you . Perhaps you 'll even enjoy the journey more than I did , and I wish you the very best of luck on it . Dust to Dust is the next book in the duology , but I 'll be skipping it .	-1
I 've heard this book referred to as a & quot ; masterpiece of science fiction & quot ; more than once , often from sources that suggest it is n't simply publishers ' hype . After having actually read it , I can not understand why . Bradbury 's characters , by and large , are pretty thin . That might be forgivable if he were writing in order to set a mood or make some kind of interesting point , but his writing style tries too hard to be poetic , and his ideas are mostly pretty trite . There are quite a lot of books that cover colonial insenstivity , nuclear war , and the supposed meaninglessness or self-destructiveness of modern life , and Bradbury 's does n't stick out from the crowd.This could be partly because the book does n't fully cohere . I know that it is supposed to be a connection of linked short stories , not a traditional novel , but Bradbury seems to have frequently changed his mind about the most fundamental aspects of his version of Mars . I might not mind this if I thought he was trying to make a point by presenting radically different kinds of Martians at different times , but that would n't be consistent with his somewhat superifical handling of many of the other ideas in the book.There are several stories in The Martian Chronicles that do succeed , and I suspect I would have been more impressed with it if I had read it when it came out . I can certainly see how it could seem impressive to someone who had read little or no science fiction , or literature in general . Still , it did n't have a lasting effect on me , and it looks pretty anemic next to , say , Ursula K. LeGuin or Gene Wolfe . If you are new to science fiction , I would refer you to one of those authors , or to a number of others . They have more interesting things to say than Bradbury .	-1

This is an interesting story told badly . When I pull out my marking pen and start correcting the grammar and writing a few pages into a book , I know I am in trouble . & lt ; ouch > This is an interesting story , but the bad writing gets in the way of telling it . I preordered the book because it had two additional writers which I had hoped would smooth out the writing . Simply because one has had an interesting life does not mean that they can tell it well . Unfortunately in their attempt to sound `` authentic , '' they sound foolish . This book is almost nothing like Marcus Luttrell 's `` Lone Survivor '' nor Howard Wasdin 's `` Seal Team Six '' both of which were superlative stories told incredibly well . I 'm sorry I bought this , but I am going to attempt finish it because I want to hear the story . I just wish the telling did n't make it so painful . I would not recommend this book until you have read the others ; and , if you have read the others you may not want to read this one .	-1

This seems more like someone blogging about how they used NLP and very little about NLP itself . I 'm sure that there are better books on NLP out there .

Shatter Me occurs in a dystopian world where a myriad of events have ravaged the land and its people . Juliette has been incarcerated because she has a rare condition where , if she touches someone , she can cause pain and maybe even kill them . Thus , she has not touched anyone in 264 days , the same ones she has been locked up . We are then introduced to Adam , the male lead with whom Juliette quickly falls for ( too quickly , I know she is starved for love but jeez ) .I have so many issues with this book , I scarcely know where to start.The narration : It took a great deal of self control not to throw this book at the wall . The idea was interesting , the purple prose was not . It got old really fast . Although the writing is beautiful , poetry really , it is just too much in a book . A page or 15 of it I could take , not the entire book ! It was a never ending stream of consciousness with heavy ( read : the entire page ) doses of purple prose . The author seems to believe commas are evil or contagious because she barely uses them. & # 34 ; My body is a carnivorous flower , a poisonous house plant , a loaded gun with a million triggers and he 's more than ready to fire. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; The bed under my back is filled with broken clouds and freshly fallen snow ... & # 34 ; Every page is like this . It was infuriating . Every sentence had a metaphor , every page was purple prose.And then there is the story . In the beginning , I was very interested . I was looking forward to this book when I first heard about it . After finishing it , I am so thoroughly disappointed by the complete lack of originality in this book . SPOILER : This story is exactly as that of Rogue in the X-Men . Exactly . So , when they say in the back of the book that this is a & # 34 ; superhero story as thrilling as the X-Men & # 34 ; they should replace & # 34 ; thrilling as & # 34 ; with & # 34 ; this is a re-telling of. & # 34 ;	-1
I 've read `` The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes '' in a number of formats including paperbacks and a much beloved two volume annotated edition of all of Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes stories and novels in chronological order . In spite of the price this version for the Kindle was a bit disappointing . A huge problem for me was that every time a sum of money was mentioned it was difficult , and sometimes impossible , to determine the correct amount because either there was n't a symbol for Pounds available or it just did n't transfer properly when it was prepared for the ebook format . It felt as though it was scanned with character recognition software that could n't read the symbol for Pounds Sterling.Another aspect that I was n't particularly happy with was that the table of contents had no hyperlinks to the individual stories . I read the book straight through , but there are times when I 'd like to revisit a particular story out of order . It 's possible to do using search but it would be so much more convenient if linking were available.While all in all this edition delivered what I wanted - the first book of Sherlock Holmes short stories for the bargain price of $ 0.00 - there were enough problems and annoyances in the transition to the electronic device for me to regrettably regard the presentation of the book as substandard .	-1
What is this story about ? After reading the first book , I am clueless.The cover is really cool , and that is the nicest thing I can say about this book.Summary : Faith Daniels learns from her new school mate , Dylan Gilmore , that she has the ability to move objects with her mind ; however , she does n't have the important second pulse . There are others like them , and they are at war with some of them.Sadly , this is the entire plot of the story . We do n't know why they have powers . We do n't know who they are at war with or why . It was vaguely hinted at that the bad guys do n't like the States , but we do n't know why.The world building has me torn on whether the States are good or bad . They allow people to live on the outside . Some are legitimately there to help with closing down / cleaning up , and these people are working under contracts . They also make it clear that the States provide food , schooling and clothing for coin , but it is unclear what those who do n't work for the States do to make coin . We are introduced to the concept that there are drifters . I have no idea what is a drifter . Faith 's parents were drifters , but they also worked for the good guys.The kids learn through tablets . The state comes to get them in white vans , which sounds insidious , but it was n't made out to be that way . We know from the ending that the States were created to give the land a chance to recover from the effects of global warming . It is an environmentally safe habitat designed to leave a small carbon foot print . We learn that Spur Chance , the designer of the world , was also telekinetic and used Intels , people whom he could harness brain power from . We learn Hawk , one of Faith 's friends , is an Intel . He is also a good guy.The book goes on and on about school and the powers , but there is no development of the world to help us understand the plot . There is nothing that explains who these people are . Sure , Faith has several angsty and angry moments , but they are only there to develop the fact that the Quins , the bad guys , are really bad . I got it , but we still have no clue what they are doing.Here was the sad truth , I had accidentally picked up Tremors first . I realized after starting it that it was a second book . I checked out amazon , and I learned Pulse was the first book . I went back to the library and checked it out . Honestly , I could have read Tremors without ever reading Pulse because Pulse does little to contribute to the story . I was n't really missing anything.There is a lot of world building ; however , none of it is used to explain the plot .	-1

How did this book get published ? I am an avid reader of literary as well as contemporary fiction and I also have authored three of my own books . Having said that , I am no expert but I know what makes a good story and this is so lacking in all aspects . Too much run on detail and the characters are people I could n't feel anything for - quite unforgettable . I kept hoping for something to happen but it never did.It is evident the author is classically trained for fiction because he relies heavily on those antiquated influences and comes very close to copying styles from some of the biggies but unfortunately it falls short because the writer is not a classic authors - I will give him that he is schooled apparently in writing flowery descriptions that go and on but in this modern day in time those descriptions are no longer necessary for the reader to imagine what the writer is saying . In fact , in some ways this writing is offensive and insulting to readers - you can fool some of the readers some of the time but not all the readers all the time and I am not fooled by this poor imitation at art . Sorry - no way will I recommend this book to anyone .	-1
You are insane . The Rapture is not even in the bible . Anyhow . Come on Brystol is a Joke . Sara Palin is a lousy parent and you people that follow her are a bunch of obsessive compulsive fanatics . This book is not worth the $ 9.99 I paid . It should be 0.99 cents . ( take note Amazon ) For Christsake , the whole idea that her virginity was stolen from her is completely ludicrous . She was like any other teenager looking for fun . The fact that she has a couple of absentee parents did n't serve her either . She has not lived long enough or has gain any significant insights from her short time in the spotlight to justify this book which was written by the way , Just to make some money from losers like you that are obsess with the Palins . Accepted , The Palins are a joke in this country , hell , They are a joke to the world . So Brystol , run ... run ... run ... Anybody considering buying this piece of crap , do yourself a favor , DO N'T . Save your Cash .	-1
Up to the present I have bought all of Daheim 's Bed and Breakfast mysteries.This is the last one I 'll take time to read . The zaniness was amusing at first , but it 's gotten to be boring , and the characters ... mainly Gertrude and Renie ... are just plain annoying . So far , I have most thoroughly enjoyed the Alpine series by Daheim , but the McMonigle-Flint series has pretty much run out of steam .	-1
I 've seen one five star review for this . One . Even the people who rate every book five stars did n't rate this five stars . There 's nothing particularly wrong with it ... there just is n't anything really ... stellar about it . It 's actually a little worse than `` meh . `` Mila is an ordinary girl trying to fit in to her relatively new life in a new town while simultaneously dealing with her father 's tragic death . After her `` best '' friend 's motives to kill Mila fail ( okay she was n't trying to kill her , but it totally would have , what a psycho ) Mila is left with a strange arm injury that leads to her questioning who , and what she is . Mix in a government agency , an agency that rivals the government agency , a really awkward love interest , and a heroine that is bland as the android she actually is , and stir thoroughly . The end result is Mila 2.0 : a thriller that is less than thrilling . I was actually a little bored.You know when authors create this whole back-story and talk about it a lot in the beginning then totally forget about it ? Frustrating , right ? This happens multiple times and leaves a few plot holes . Seriously , though-what happened to all those horses ? There is also a small , but infuriating issue that I hope was fixed in the final version that is published , and that is Mila 's mom 's hair . Yes , her hair . It has a nasty habit of changing colors throughout the story . A lot . This would n't be a big deal if it was n't mentioned every other chapter and we were forced to read how she dyed it in the first place.imageI believe the main purpose of this novel was to focus on Mila 's humanity . She 's a robot with no real human parts , but she has true human emotions . I feel like this could have been better if it was written a bit differently . Mila got on my nerves when she would say things like `` Oh , look tears-how am I crying if I 'm not human , '' every other sentence.Needless to say , I did n't care for Mila . I did n't connect with her at all . She was way too robotic ( no pun intended ) and I found myself losing interest in all of her endeavors . When she was in a life or death situation , I could n't muster up enough emotion to really care about her being successful.I will not be reading the sequel .

Oh where to start ... WHY did I buy this book ? ( I must have asked myself this question every few paragraphs but continued to read ) First , it 's hard to believe Kendra hired a ghost writer . Whoever wrote this book is a terrible writer . The book rambles all over the place . One paragraph Kendra is lecturing us on texting and driving and the next we are back to her diet ( but wait , did n't we just cover two chapters on poor Kendra and her wt loss woes ? ) It 's ALL over the place . The same boring subjects are covered over and over and over ... Being Kendra is actually a great title because that 's all it is . MEMEME . Here 's how hard it is to be poor me ( doing every day things the rest of you moms out there do ) but wait ... let me tell you how much I love all the free things companies send to me . Poor me , I hated being on DWTS..but wait , I loved the paycheck.My 'favorite ' is Kendra 's lectures on how the whole world should eat as healthy as she and Hank do and baby Hank ( this goes on forever all thru the book ) and why does n't every mom out there make homemade babyfood ? Yet in the middle of this we have : Hank is from New Mexico so he does n't know how to eat well . What ? I 'm sure New Mexico readers will be thrilled to hear this ) Kendra cries about how she ca n't lose her postbaby wt ( she gained nearly 60lbs . She finally discovers she has a 'condition'-hypothyroidism , which she makes sound like some rare disease ( note to Kendra millions of us have low thyroid and take the same dose of Synthroid as you do..oh , and I never gained a pound from it ) So THIS is why Kendra got fat and ca n't lose her wt . But a few pages later read all about how Kendra ate junk food nonstop thruout her pregnancy , esp donuts . Hank slept on the couch so she could sit up all night eating donuts and all kinds of crap . What about the 'condition ' ? ? Oh , I 'm so confused.Much of the book is spent on her looks , how hard she works , how she does this all by herself , then gives the list of all the people she employees . She spends a great amount of time preaching about parenting , marriage , and family life ( because she 's done these for nearly 2 whole years now ) . She is quick to point out what everyone else is doing wrong and why she is doing it all right.Somehow this does n't quite work for me when she spends the rest of the time being very insecure and jealous , constantly asking if her husband is cheating on her , firing her best nanny because her baby likes the nanny too much , physically and verbally abusing her husband ( one time knocking him unconscious ) while drunk and checking his cellphone for txt msgs.But she has a GREAT marriage.Oh , and then we 're back to her body/diet/clothes fitting well and how confident she is now . And then two pages later , she has a c section scar she does n't want anyone to see ... .but she 's glad she 's curvy..and two pages later , hard to find clothes that fit because I 'm so skinny ... but baby Hank is doing great because I 'm just a regular mom drinking coctails by the pool and oh yeah I always carry tons of babywipes with me cause I 'm so prepared and such a good mom ... oh and by the way I have n't talked to my own mom for over a year after we had a big fight.Yes , the above paragraph is a pretty good representation of this book . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY .	-1
Save your money , the novel is like a bad imitation of an imitation of Hiaasen who has this particular territory well covered .	-1
S. J. Kincaid understanding of history and economy is simply nonexistent . The world she describes is nonsensical . Corporations control the world . The USA and China , incited by evil corporations , exterminated 1.2 billion of Muslims ( who courageously resisted domination by corporations ) . Need I continue ? Very stupid and obnoxious book . At the very least , she does not believe in our American moral values . What kind of person S. J. Kincaid is to come up with poisonous stuff like this ? And , yes , I do question her character !	-1
The author went through a horrible ordeal by becoming functionally blind . I do n't want to dismiss the severity of the author 's predicament , but I did n't enjoy the book . I tried to read this book over and over , but nothing clicked . The chapters were tedious to read . The writing was fragmented in parts and then long run on sentences that made me snooze . I admit that I gave up finishing the book-it was torture .	-1
I love Loretta Chase , The Last Hellion , Lord Scoundrels , loved them . This book is boring and doesnt seem like a LC book . I didnt like her last on either , Last nights Scandal . Would i recomennd Scandal Wears Satin ? No , maybe at .99 or free i would .	-1
Scandal Wears Satin is the second book in The Dressmaker series by Loretta Chase . I have read other books by this author and have always found them to be interesting . With this one I thought it was okay but a little slow in the beginning but it picks up once Clare runs away and puts Longmore and Sophy together while they try and find her and then slows down again.Sophy is all about saving the Maison Noirot & # 8217 ; s dress shop as because of the shocking scandal that happened from the first book , they are having a hard time selling to the aristocratic ladies of the ton . Marcelline Noirotis a dress maker married the Earl of Clevedon in the first book Silk Is For Seduction and it has turned their world upside down . Their only hope is Clare and her pending marriage so when she runs away Sophy decides it & # 8217 ; s best she go with Longmore to find her.Longmore has a bit of a temper especially when it comes to his sister and anyone who tries to compromise her . So when Longmore & # 8217 ; s sister and Sophy & # 8217 ; s wealthiest client runs away , Sophy intervenes so that he doesn & # 8217 ; t do anything rash . Along the way things change between Sophy and Longmore and sparks fly . The thing is , is that Sophy knows it can & # 8217 ; t be anything more than a fling because she can & # 8217 ; t get involved with a client and they already have enough scandal in the family with her older sister & # 8217 ; s marriage.Sophy & # 8217 ; s is an interesting character and she seems to have many different sides to her and she shows those sides in dressing up and pretending to be other women . She does that twice to help Longmore and his sister . I liked Sophy because she is determined to do what ever needed to save their dress shop . Longmore , a hot tempered handsome Lord , but I can & # 8217 ; t really say I loved him . He didn & # 8217 ; t really make me swoon , but he was still a likable enough character.I think the problem I had with this novel was the lack of romance . I don & # 8217 ; t mean sex because I can take it or leave it on that part of a romance novel but I just mean the plan old sensual romance that is found in most romances . The sizzling attraction and the teasing that normally goes on between the two main characters . This novel seemed to be formed more around Sophy trying to save her dress shop and stopping Clare from having to marry the horrible man she was compromised with . In between all of this there was a little sexual tension and sex , then more trying to set up Adderly.Narrator : Kate ReadingThis is my first novel with narrator Kate Reading and at first I wasn & # 8217 ; t sure if I was going to like her but her voice grew on me . Her best male voice is actually when she is trying to do the sexy growl for Lord Longmore . Kate is great at reading and the audio is crisp and clear and runs smooth.This was my first romance novel on audio so I wasn & # 8217 ; t sure how I was going to feel with the sex scenes but they really were not that steamy so I think I got of lucky on my first audio romance.Now I did have a little problem with one of the CD & # 8217 ; s not playing right and it wouldn & # 8217 ; t let it rip on to my computer so I could transfer to my phone , but I am sure it was just a glitch in my CD copy . It was a little frustrating and thankfully only on one CD . ( This problem doesn & # 8217 ; t affect my rating )	-1
It was hard to keep up with plus it was too much ! I would not read anymore of her books .	-1
If this were really a debut novel by a new novelist , I would probably give it 3 stars . However , if you read historical romances , you are already familiar with this author . As Gayle Callen she writes Victorian historical romances and as Julia Latham she writes medieval romance . Now , as Emma Cane , Callen is making her contribution to the many small-town contemporary romances available to the romance reader , such as series by Robyn Carr , Emily March , Lori Wilde , etc . and this first one by Cane does n't really have anything new to add to the genre.Emily Murphy , recently divorced after many years married to a lawyer in San Francisco , moves to Valentine in the Colorado mountains . She has inherited from her late mother a building in downtown Valentine with living quarters on the top floor . Her intention is to sell it but the previous renters trashed it before leaving and she has repairs and renovations to make before she can put it on the market.This gives her time to make friends , find True Love and heal from her previous life problems . Emily has economic woes , mainly stemming from her refusal of any financial help from her ex . She also has emotional woes stemming from both her husband 's treatment of her in their unhappy marriage and a question about the identity of her biological father . ( She also seems to have an uncontrollable urge to bake , something that seems silly at the beginning of the story but will make sense as the book progresses . ) Her love interest is hunky rancher Nate Thalberg , whom she meets the first night she arrives in Valentine and they feel an instant attraction , which they decide not to act on . Nate has some emotional issues of his own about love which do not seem very big-deal to me but I guess they were to him . Anyway , both Nate and Emily need to overcome their emotional difficulties to be able to find love with each other . It 's a romance , so of course they will manage it.This novel of Cane 's follows all the guidelines for small-town romances . You have your typical small-town folks who like to meddle in other people 's lives but , of course , they only do this because they care . These folks are not very multi-dimensional but if you like this type of story they will appeal to you.As I said at the beginning of my review , I would have upped the number of stars of the rating if this romance had not been written by a seasoned author . Gayle Callen has been writing romances for several years . Because of this , I would have expected something a tad better from her .	-1
First off , the writing , uneven and often infuriating for its `` wink wink '' attitude . Not what I would expect from Lionel Shriver . The characters are fundamentally uninteresting above and beyond their lack of likability . Unlikable characters are fine , but I think we really do need to be interested . And the plot ? I was hoping for an intelligent satire , instead it seemed to be a predictable pot-boiler of a plot . Self-satirizing in fact .	-1
This novel tries to be a cutting look at the role of modern journalism , the use of violence for personal and political ends , and how everyone walks away from any event with their own personal understanding of it.What it ends up being is the rambling adventures of a self-described 'also ran ' who likes to pretend he 's not bent on taking any opportunity to stick his thumbs in the eyes of the popular kids , but does just that.There 's even a scene fairly early in the book where our supposed protagonist , Edgar , meets up with the subject of his juvenile hero worship only to discover that he 's no longer the Adonis of his teenage memories . The long-lost sometimes-friend even presents Edgar with his side of their teenage friendship , a totally different perspective that , while contrasting sharply with Edgar 's , is equally believable and probably equally true . Does Edgar , who has perfect self-awareness of every other aspect of his life , learn anything from this experience ? Of course not . He acts like a complete jerk.Ms . Shriver has plenty to say about terrorism and journalism , but seeing it all through Edgar 's lens of resentful inferiority makes it downright painful to read . What happened to Barrington ? Who are the SOB ? Frankly , after a few hundred pages of Edgar being Edgar , who cares ?	-1
Wanted more from this book . I have always wanted to pick up a Shriver book , and so when I got my hands on this one I was so excited . But shortly after starting it , I was so bored . I kept with it hoping it would get better but it just fell flat for this reader . Edgar Kellogg was a character I could n't identify with nor felt any sort of interest in.I should have known better than to pick up a book about terrorism and politics . I have a hard time following who is who and all the ins and outs ..Maybe I should pick up We Need to Talk About Kevin ? I would like to redeem Shriver and this review .	-1
I was disgusted at this book . It was suggested to me by a friend , however , my friend had only read the first few chapters . She explained the concept of how it was a school that taught people to be fairy tale characters but a good girl got in the school for villains so now she is in trouble . So it started off in this town with a beautiful girl who , WANTED TO GET KIDNAPPED ? ? ? All the other kids his from the kidnapper but she was trying to get kidnapped . Trying . So she has a best friend . Except she is ugly . So that stirs up some trouble . So there were two school parts , a part for good , and a part for evil . They thought Sophie ( the pretty one ) would be good and Agatha ( the ugly one ) would be evil . But they switched . I thought and knew that it was about learning that just because you 're pretty does n't make you good , but it taught the opposite . Sophie spent hundreds of pages trying to get a guy , and Agatha was just trying to get home . Plus , the prince of our fairy tale is a jerky jock who kicks animals and does n't care about girls feelings . So I thought that it would just end with Sophie realizing that she is evil and Agatha realizing that she is good . But no , it just made them reform to what people thought they were , then sent them back home . No lesson learned .	-1
Plot falls apart.Ending leaves you hanging.So much wasted in the middle.Characters change back and forth and back and forth.Unnecessary huge sections to fill in gaps made up , nothing to do with anything ... ah , nuts , my book is only 27 pages long ? ok , well , we need a Trial . And then we 'll have to have training for the Trial , then the Trial , yeah , that 's 100 pages . and then I guess we can still finish with the Trial being pointless and you win and you lose because this magic blue ball says so , story over . done . Can I have some money now ?	-1
For old times sake , I would have given The Great Escape three stars , but following on the heels of Call Me Irresistible , I could n't . I love SEP , her books until now have been an automatic buy for me . But two clunkers in a row are too much . I hated how she debased Meg in Call Me Irresistible . She does n't do justice to the Lucy of First Lady either . There are flashes of her trademark humor , little chemistry between the two main characters and recycled plot devices from previous and better books .	-1
SEP is one of my favorite authors ( at least she used to be ) but this will be my last book that I purchase ( from her ) . I 'm all for good causes and I 'm very liberal in my thinking but she is using her political views to write the book . It did n't feel like a story or a romance it was so full of her views that she forgot about the characters . Panda and Lucy were not appealing at all and the story was so boring I just to the point where I did n't care . There was n't the romance , the excitement of what happens next.If she wants to use her fame to help others she needs to do it in a different way . Ugh ! what a waste of money . Please get back to true romance and leave out your life lessons .	-1
I pre-order and can not wait for SEP 's latest books . I was very disappointed with this one . All through the book I had a feeling of d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu , not because some of the characters are from previous books ( I enjoy that aspect of her writing ) , but because the plot is too . Running away from a wedding on a motorcycle ( Hot Shot ) , hiding out from the press and pretending to be pregnant ( First Lady ) , staying at a lake , baking and falling in love with a cottage ( This Heart of Mine ) are some of the more obvious recycled plot lines . It felt like a contest to see how many similarities one could find with previous books . I missed the fast paced story line , the likeable secondary characters , and the witty dialogue usually associated with SEP . I also had a problem as others mentioned with the name of the male lead - Panda , really ? It felt silly every time I read it . Everybody has a stinker or two in them and this is one of SEP 's . I am looking forward to future books more in the style of `` Match Me If You Can '' and `` What I Did For Love '' .	-1
Another well-written book from Amy Tan , but the subject was so distressing I could not finish . I could not even get a third of the way through .	-1
I have read many Amy Tan novels and enjoyed them . I did not even finish this one . Maybe it was the subject matter . I did not have any feeling for the main characters . Very disappointing .	-1
This book started out promising . Then it just went off the tracks . On and on and on and on about the sexually obsessed characters . I did not like any of the characters in this book and got to the point that I really did not care what happened to them.Very disappointing book . Less about how to be a courtesan and more substance to story .	-1
I ordered this novel as an audio book and I am glad that I did because were it the actual book , I would have stopped reading by page 100 at the latest . The story description sounds far better than it is . There is so much dialogue , most of it horribly stilted and borderline annoying . The characters failed to hold my interest because of it . They seemed silly and dishonest . There also was not that much actual research aside from basic historical facts . I also did not like the readers . The one voicing one of the main characters , Violet , injected tension and excitement were none existed for example . She made a basic statement sound like the sinking of the Titanic was about to occur . I could barely make it through the audio book as it went on and on and on .	-1
I 'd actually been looking forward to this book , the second collaboration by these 3 talented HR authors , following the previousThe Lady Most Likely ... : A Novel in Three Parts . It takes place in Scotland and the description made it sound like fun.Scottish laird Taran Ferguson has no children to carry on his family line and his two nephews are not cooperating by finding good Scottish lassies to marry , so when they are visiting at his castle , he decides to supply the lassies for them . He sends his men to a ball to abduct 3 lovely heiresses and bring them for his 2 nephews to choose from . I guess 3 seemed like a good selection to him but it turns out his bumbling men bring 4 lassies and a duke , the extra young woman not even from a rich family . The accidental abduction of the duke was because the bumblers used his coach to abduct the women and did not know he was asleep inside.Now we have 4 young women and 3 young men at the castle and 50-something-year-old Taran , who must be counted for romantic reasons you will discover as you read . Each author pairs off 1 man and 1 woman in her section of the book and this time , as opposed to what happened in THE LADY MOST LIKELY , the characters stay pretty much true to form throughout the book . Since they 're so shallowly developed , that was n't too hard to do.But what I thought would be a rather more volatile , exciting story , what with the abductions and all , turned out to be just another boring house party . And because there were so many romances , they were rushed , with all the pairs falling into unconvincing insta-love . The whole thing was a very superficial , shallow and predictable read with cookie-cutter characters.I suppose one could blame the set-up of the book for the lack of depth , with each author writing only a short novella ( or perhaps long short story ) within its framework . But authors such as Courtney Milan can get a lot of depth into a very few pages . These 3 authors are talented and should be capable of the same , but they did n't even try.In addition , there were some silly mistakes , probably typos and not the authors ' fault . One was a reference to `` dangling '' a child on someone 's knees . That sounds pretty uncomfortable . I imagine that child would much prefer a `` dandling '' . Then there was the reference to fashion and bosom exposure during the reign of George VII . Considering that the last English king George was George VI and he was present Queen Elizabeth II 's father , I 'm thinking that should be a reference to George III in the book.All in all , I found myself to be the wrong reader for this book : I 'm too old , too easily bored , and have read way too many HRs to find anything original in this one . I preferred the authors ' first collaboration to this one and now am not sure I 'll read the third one to come , unless I find it at the library .	-1
Could a book be any more lame ? I think not ! Just picture Lucy ( of Peanuts fame ) played by vampire Arturo ... picture Charlie Brown , played with remarkable accuracy by gullible Quinn . Picture Quinn running to kick the football and Arturo pulls it away . Repeat , Rinse , Repeat- The plot has just been summed up in a 6-frame cartoon strip . Everytime Arturo makes a promise to help Quinn he turns on her , every time she believes him when he promises to help her again , and again , and ... well , you get the idea . Skip this one . The author leaves the door wide open for a sequel - someone needs to take pity on her and slam that door closed on that idea QUICK !	-1
I had high hopes for debut author , Bethany Griffin 's Young Adult Steampunk/Dystopian like mashup with Masque of the Red Death ( Masque of the Red Death # 1 ) . This might be my favorite cover of this year and I 'm a big fan of anything Edgar Allen Poe.Masque of the Red Death introduces a world where the air is poisoned and only the rich can afford breathing masks so they do n't die from the virus in the air . Araby Worth is very lucky because her scientist father is responsible for creating the masks that keep people alive and well . Araby is also very suicidal because she feels responsible for her younger brother 's death . She goes to clubs where she can get high in the hopes she may overdose . She 's more than depressed and is barely functioning . But then she meets two boys . One is Will , a bouncer at her favorite club , The Debauchery Club , who takes care of her one night when she overdoses . The other is Elliot , the brother of her best friend April who has gone missing and wants her to help him take down his uncle , the crazed Prince Prospero who rules the land . Araby wants to find April , and even though she does n't really trust or like Elliot , she will betray her father and put herself in danger to help Elliot unseat tthe Prince and restore hope across the land and allow every citizen a chance to have their own breathing mask so they can live a life free of disease and not suffer a horrible , early death.Masque of the Red Death was a major disappointment . I DNFed half way through because I was so bored . The plot is weakly written and the dark atmosphere and Araby 's self flagellation grew tiresome and ridiculous . The writing is very cut and dry and has no meat to it . There was no real substance to the story , and again we have the familiar trope with Elliot , the semi bad-boy who does n't treat Araby with that much respect , and yet wants her to give up her entire life to help him . Araby was a cardboard character for me who was DOA as soon as the story began . Her personality was as dead as the corpses found on the streets and in the alleys . I had no sympathy for her plight and why she wanted to give up on her life . I found myself wanting to smack her because she came across as some whiny daddy 's rich girl.Masque of the Red Death is a big pass and another poor attempt at trying to write some hybrid Steampunk universe that is n't Steampunk at all.Katiebabs	-1
Let me start off by saying that this was an entertaining read . The reason I am giving it a one star rating is the glorification of Elliot . What he supplied to Araby IMHO ranks up their with one of the most vile things you can do to another human being . I am shocked and disguisted that the writer would make someone like this a love interest and a hero . Araby had a serious problem and he exploited and encouraged it for his own personal gain . I found it in very poor taste that after all this the wonderful Mr. Elliot is supposed to save the day and we are supposed to swoon for him . This is a YA novel and I really hope that parents are aware of its content .	-1
Clearly a self absorbed whiney athlete writes about his disillusionment with the `` life '' . One antidote after another about how unfair the whole thing is . Most , distressing is the total lack of any kind of closure , he suffers a career ending injury and boom the book ends . I do n't know , maybe , it 's me but this feels like a drawn out sob story	-1
Suki Piper is a boring loser with no job , no friends , no boyfriend and no prospects . And that 's exactly how the story reads . A hundred pages in I was wondering if the main character was bi-polar and if the story had a point . Two hundred pages in I was skipping pages and found it made no difference to the storyline . The last thirty pages did n't make sense at all.This book was not what I was expecting . I was hoping for a mysterious , gothic-like tale of suspense but this was anything but suspenseful . The story was split in half ; the past , involving Suki 's scatty upbringing , dysfunctional parents and solitary childhood . A bizarre air-raid hatch in her backyard haunts her , as does a creepy life-like doll in her neighbour 's home . And the present , detailing Suki 's sad attempt at making and keeping friends , from her fondness for her former friends teenage son , to her impromptu trip to Greece . I still have no idea why she was asked to go . The ending was abrupt and open , leading to possible sequels but I really hope the author does n't bother . Just plain weird .	-1
I 've read a couple of the author 's books . They were entertaining , but nothing special . I started reading this book and encountered the character & # 34 ; Andie & # 34 ; who is Swyteck 's fiance ( but no date set yet ) . I do n't recall encountering her before and since I found her to be utterly obnoxious ; it seems I would have remembered her.I found the character to be impulsive , overbearing , short-tempered and controlling . That was within 20 % of the book and I did n't any further as I gave up on it . If you like that kind of female character you will probably enjoy the book.Also , the story did n't seem very interesting to begin with . It appears to me to be based on the Casey Anthony murder trial .	-1
This book was not for me ... ... the story line was totally lame . I bought the other book & # 34 ; Spun & # 34 ; and I am not looking forward to reading it . Sorry	-1
I really wanted to love this book . It started of well . The author had a good voice and premise but did n't go deep at all . I get that she was only at rehab to get the story on a famous actress , so I expected her to be somewhat trite with her attempts to go oer the steps . But the sessions with group and her therapist were one page long - the evivilant of five minutes in real time . Additionally , she gets out of her jam in a very predectible way , sending no real message at all .	-1
I wanted to like this book , I really did . I looked forward to reading it- and I chose it because the plot sounded interesting and Jacqueline Winspear ( a favorite author of mine ) called it `` Shakespearean '' in fashion . But right off the bat this book was horrid- the characters are unlikeable , the plot lines/twists are ridiculous ( and just wait- when you think the events ca n't get worse- they will ) and the whole thing seems more like a satire making fun of Shakespeare or Downtown Abby/Pride & Prejudice or something than a real novel . ***SPOILER ALERT***If you like books that seem more satire in nature , involve a lot of chaos , and then jump the shark and turn into a zombie book then this might be the book for you . If not , then maybe skip this one .	-1
I have not been a fan of this particular series of Robin Hobbs ' but was intrigued enough to finish the series out . Do I regret reading the last book ? Not exactly but , frankly , there was nothing exciting happening here and anything that could have been exciting was somehow made utterly mundane with Hobbs ' writing . How is is that a dragon attack can be boring ? I found this series to be filled with too much chatter , almost zero character growth until the very last book and what little growth/development does happen it only happens with a few characters . I found the dialogue to be very tiresome after a time and seeing as how the whole book is filled with the boring nattering of the dragons 's caretakers the story really seemed to drag on and on . I think Hobbs ' has some great ideas but the execution of this entire series has been off for me ; I really enjoyed the Farseer series and wish Hobbs had been able to find a better balance with the Rain Wild series as she did with the Farseer and Tawny Man books .	-1
I feel bad because I am the one out of a million writing a bad review . The cover , the description , everything about this book made it out to be something great . Unfortunately , for me it was just something ok . I 'm even ok with leaving the book as is and not following the series.First off , Rachel , I liked her as a character . She is strong and hard-headed..Someone who does n't take much from others . I get at one point , she had a devastating tragedy happen to her but really did it have to go on for two chapters ? Rachel is silent , I ca n't get her to talk . I do n't feel like talking . Let me wait to tell Logan something important because I ca n't speak . The author took it to an extreme it should n't have been taken to.Logan , the boy who thinks he needs no one . This quickly changes in the book once he has to take care of Rachel . He gets to see her as the woman she is becoming and the woman she is . Now , I know some people think he is controlling when it comes to her , I did n't see this . Sometimes Rachel needed to be put in her place and he put her there.It got irritating at how long it took for them to admit there feelings and when they surface they ignore it ? It got me screaming at the book . I did n't understand the `` creature , '' it 's not a dragon ? A different version of a dragon ? Honestly ... I 'm sorry to be the downer . I 'm glad this book could be good for most and I hope that others who try to read it get a positive story .	-1
When the world has no air left only the rich are able to survive comfortably . Alina , Bea , and Quinn are on a mission to change how the world works and thinks and to make air available once again to the masses.It was an interesting concept but I did n't like having to follow the constant change of perspectives . Also , none of the characters were really that likable . Both Quinn and Bea seemed to be weak for a hero and heroine meant to change an entire way of view of life . Alina just had a mean and condescending attitude most of the time and came off like she could save the whole entire world by herself . With the hope of a good story line I was once again disappointed , most of the plot points were disjointed and from too many different perspectives . Needless to say I felt there was much to be desired in the outcome .	-1
I understand that authors usually leave a few tantalizing threads untied in a first novel with the intention of tying up those threads in subsequent sequels . However , that does not begin to explain this book . Even in a planned series , each story needs to have the usual beginning , middle and end . This book is one for three . Barely . It 's hard to even call this book a decent Act I . More like an overture.In this opening to what is clearly a multi-book series , we meet plucky twelve-year-old Lucy P. Simmons ( the `` P '' seems especially important , although we never find out what it stands for ) and ( briefly ) her sea captain of a father and his wife ( Lucy 's mother ) . However , Lucy 's parents are conveniently thrown overboard ( both literally and figuratively ) trying to rescue a drowning `` Brute '' during a sudden freak storm within the first chapter so that Ms. Mariconda can tell the story she really wants to tell : the story of a sweet and innocent , yet determined , orphan who boldly faces - and overcomes - the unmitigated evil into which she is thrust.Following her parents ' death , Uncle Victor and Aunt Margaret waste no time in showing up , not bothering to mask their salivating hunger for the family 's assets . Barrister Hardy , however , reads in Father 's will that Aunt Prudence is to assume custody of Lucy and fiduciary duty over the house and assets in trust for Lucy . Unfortunately , Aunt Prudence is busy wandering about the globe ( apparently having something to do with a `` family curse '' ) and ca n't be reached . That being the case , Lucy 's supposedly loving father next left her and the house in the care of Uncle Victor , until such time as Aunt Prudence can be found , with surprisingly few stipulations as to how either could be disposed of . His job done , Barrister Hardy , perhaps reluctantly , but without a backward glance , leaves Lucy to her fate , nevermind Uncle Victor 's thinly veiled threat against Lucy 's life.Uncle Victor turns out to be everything Lucy had feared and more . Greedy , controlling and punitive , he reduces Lucy 's life to a bare shell in short order . But there are some comforts . Stalwart servant Addelaide ( Addie ) comes as a package deal , and out of the accident which killed her parents , Lucy acquired a dog , Mr. Pugsley . And best of all , Lucy conveniently discovers that the house itself has magical , protective powers which shield her from all but a minimal amount of Uncle Victor 's wrath . And then there 's the strange woman whom Lucy spies swimming in the tide from time to time.Lucy knows she simply must find a way to contact Aunt Prudence . A letter indicates that Aunt Pru was last in the Australian outback , and perhaps likely to be there still . But how exactly is an early twentieth century Americal girl supposed to contact her there ? Lucy 's problems seem to double , then miraculously abate for a time , when `` Miss Maude '' shows up to take her off to `` boarding school '' . Who - or what - Miss Maude really is , along with her connection to the `` Brute '' is a hazy mystery that gradually swirls into a semblance of subtstance.Then events rapidly spiral out of control as Uncle Victor sells the house ( Barrister Hardy having now conveniently returned to England to care for his ailing mother ) and the Brute fights for the return of his children ( which such children also happen to be in the care of `` Miss Maude '' who is actually named Marni ) . The `` ending '' is all a bit complicated and rather difficult to believe , but suffice it to say that Lucy both retains possession of her house and finds the means of reaching Australia . And that is how , on the final page of the book , the voyage of Lucy P. Simmons finally begins.If it were only the cheap opening and ploy to get readers hooked on the series , I would still be annoyed , but I 'd probably read the ensuing books in spite of myself . But that is not the only thing to dislike about this book . Overall , the book just did n't come together for me . The characters are too black/white - either radiantly pure and innocent and good , or unmitigatedly corrupt and evil . Furthermore , things are too easy . It 's too easy for Uncle Victor to get away with his schemes and his designs on Lucy 's father 's money and property . On the other side , it 's too easy for Lucy to evade him , using the convenient magic of the house and Marni 's strange gifts and selfless generosity . The book lacks depth and nuance in both the characters and the plot . It 's as if Ms. Mariconda were to eager to get Lucy off on her voyage and did n't bother to develop her story as she went.I can well imagine that Ms. Mariconda will find her sea legs , so to speak , as the books continue , and probably subsequent books in the series will be better and more developed as she gets to know and trust her own characters . Unfortunately , however , this first book has failed to make enough of an impression for me to bother finding out .	-1
There 's no passion , no juice to this story . All of the characters are interesting , but we do n't care about any of them .	-1
At this viewing , 414 people thought & # 34 ; The Son & # 34 ; was a 5-star read . Wow ! The patriarch 's story was the only interesting storyline , and he was not & # 34 ; the son. & # 34 ; I wound up reading every third chapter because the book is arranged by 3 's : patriarch , son , great-granddaughter . The interweaving of the time periods is very disconcerting and , I suspect , meaningless . Half-way in , I threw up my hands and decided & # 34 ; who cares ? & # 34 ; I continued with the chapters about the patriarch , Eli McCullough , who is kidnapped by the Comanches , becomes a & # 34 ; convert , & # 34 ; leaves the band when it is defeated by the White Man , joins the Texas Rangers , buys land and becomes a rich Texan . So if you pick up this book , divide 562 pages by 3 and you will get 200 pages of good , Western storytelling .	-1
... and knock off the jumping around . I hate having to go back to an earlier listing of characters , who 's married to whom , who is offspring of what marriage ... I just want a story told in typical sequence , and that 's not what Philipp Meyer provides here . I know the book has received some rave reviews , but I do n't read to be frustrated , especially over as many pages as this book contains . So , I gave it a chance . I also had the benefit of my sister 's having read and finished the book , a definite lack of enthusiasm for her reading experience evident as she discussed some of it . So I 'll take a pass on this one ... and probably not give Philipp Meyer any more of my time . There are just too many books to read to waste one 's time with one that just does n't capture my interest .	-1
I was really excited to read What I Did . The novel is narrated by a young boy , which seemed like a really interesting a potentially unique idea . Unfortunately , the idea did n't really translate into a great novel.The problem with What I Did is that I could n't get past the barrier that existed between the six year old Billy and the reader . In a typical novel , you can always second guess the characters actions . With What I Did , it felt almost not right to second guess the behavior of the child . It felt like a chore to read without the fun of being able to wonder what Billy could 've done differently.The book is also way too serious for my tastes . The whole six year old protagonist thing just did n't work due to the serious nature of the novel . It might have worked if it had been cute , but I could n't really deal with it here.What I Did is a chore to read . One of the reviews toward the top of this page compares the book to Atonement . That 's accurately fairly accurate on the grounds that they 're both very tedious novels . If that 's what you 're into , maybe you 'll like it . But I sure did n't .	-1
This book seemed to be a halfhearted effort by the author . It was slow and the ending was anticlimactic . Also very little character development .	-1
Flight Behavior is an interesting character study of Dellarobia Turnbow , her family , and Appalachian community . Dellarobia is a stay-at-home mom who lives down the road from her in-laws . She is unhappy with the life she is leading and has a short-lived romantic liaison with a younger man . On her way to one of her meetings with this man , she discovers that a portion of her in-laws property is covered with Monarch butterflies . These butterflies typically winter in Mexico , but changes to the environment have altered their natural migration . People start flocking to the Turnbow property to view the butterflies . A scientist by the name of Ovid Byron also comes to the property to study these butterflies . Dellarobia takes a job helping Byron with his data collection and tests , while continuing her responsibilities at the farm . Although I liked the way Kingsolver interwove the similar life paths and problems of Dellarobia and the Monarchs , overall I was very disappointed with this book . The book had some interesting characters , but I found this book somewhat boring and difficult to consume .	-1
Flight behavior is about climate change focusing on the plight of or effects it could have on the monarch butterfly . The main character is a sorry sort of woman struggling with her life choices in Tennessee . I only gave it 2 stars because it is written by Kingsolve otherwise I would have given it 1 star . The writing is n't nearly as good as Poisonwood Bible . Actually none of her other books even come close to PB . However I was hoping she was at least trying again to accomplish more than a trite story . Even though the theme is redeemable , she did n't do it the justice it deserves .	-1
This book was not worth the money or time it took me to read it . Jeff Ashton came off like a man with the biggest ego I 've ever seen and all he did was rehash what went on with the trail . He did not tell anything new that I did n't already know from watching the trail . Terrible book I would n't reconmmend this book to anyone .	-1
First , let me say that the quality of the prose is quite good , as is the setting of Above and Below . It 's obvious the author put a lot of work into world-building.That said , I can not recommend this book because I simply did n't like the characters . Or the story . Specifically , Cherry 's lack of past kept me from caring or understanding her motivation . She seems to just drift around because she can , not because of anything really meaningful driving her . Yes , the money is an issue , but should n't be that bad of one , considering her status and stipend . She is not a likeable character , nor , really , are any of the supporting ones . Far too many things happen seemingly with no cause or explanation . While this may be intended to convey mystery or a lack of control , it left me without any connection to the setting or characters ; so what if these people disappeared without saying why ? I would try another series by this author , but nothing further from this one . After having seen that Kady Cross recommended it , I am disappointed by the item ( since I loved Cross 's Finley Jayne stories ) .	-1
I have read and reread all of her books and LOVE her ! ! ! I could not wait to read this one to satisfy my craving until her new one comes out , but I should have saved my $ 1.99 ! This book was just plain awkward and BAD . Do n't waste your money on this one , actually makes me hesitate to buy the new one : ( Very disappointed !	-1
Whether you like the President or not this book is a joke . Half of the material in this book is her opinion with no factual proof . This is the type of thing we have to sift through now . Just look at how almost every personality on Fox has written a book to take down an American president . Pathetic , racist and shameful to see the least . Just watch her on Hannity whoring her book ! I hope most people can see what this book is really about . It is a very weak read . Her attitudes are so closed minded . She misses the point , the world is a big place , it 's not just the United States .	-1
Here 's why:1 . - It 's poorly researched and shoddily edited . Here are a few examples of what I 'm referring to : ( a ) The song `` Surf City '' , the lyrics of which are quoted in the book while stating it 's an `` old song by the Beach Boys '' , though written by Brian Wilson , was actually a hit by Jan & Dean , not the Beach Boys . ( b ) The USS Yorktown , referred to in the book as a `` battleship '' , is actually an aircraft carrier . ( c ) During a drive from Atlanta to Columbia , Les was unable to place a cellphone call from her new Mercedes due to a lack of cell towers . I 've made that drive many times . There is no lack of cell coverage along that stretch of I-20 . ( d ) During a party for Molly , the book states that `` Harold 's daughters '' were flirting with Bertie . It was the daughters of Paolo , not Harold , doing the flirting . Nitpicking ? Maybe , but editors and researchers are supposed to eliminate this kind of stuff . In this case they didn't.2 . - One of DBF 's tried and true formulas in her books is the bashing of the disappointing ( for various reasons ) ex or soon to be ex-husbands of the main characters . Fair enough . In this one , though , far too much of the book is devoted to completely trashing the hapless Wes , who is painted as a clueless dolt . This is particularly annoying and inappropriate considering that Wes is a tremendously successful businessman who , while raising and caring for his family , had the temerity to drive nice cars ( that were largely used to entertain his clients ) , play golf on the weekends , and accumulate a 22+ million dollar fortune that he did n't tell his wife about ( but made no attempt to shelter against legal claims from her . After seeing her actions & lt ; e.g. , treating herself to a new Mercedes , diamond jewelry and a new , expensive wardrobe > after learning about the money , it 's easy to see why the frugal Wes did n't want the potentially , and later , actually spiteful Les knowing about the extent of his accumulated wealth . You ca n't spend what you do n't know about . He clearly was n't going `` all out '' to keep it from her . The documentation was in a desk drawer to which , we find out later , Wes had given her a key. ) . A $ 22 million dollar fortune generates a considerable amount of income , yet no explanation has been given as to how this supposedly intelligent woman signed the joint tax returns every year for over 30 years , while remaining totally in the dark about the existence of the money . Are we supposed to believe that Wes somehow persuaded the various financial institutions with whom the money was invested to simply forego the required 1099 forms and not report the income to the IRS ? Or was Les so completely clueless about financial matters that she did n't notice that the couples ' income was at least a million dollars more than her husband 's salary when she signed the tax returns ? Either scenario is preposterous . Upon learning about the money , Les , of course , is absolutely furious that she has n't been living the lifestyle that the money could have been providing for her - poor gal had been forced into driving an Audi that was no longer new , cooking for her husband and other similar domestic atrocities . While furious about the money - which she played no role in acquiring and the existence of which she was completely unaware of , by the way - she has no problem in laying claim to half of it on her way out the door . The bashing of successful husbands has become quite fashionable in the writings of liberal women , and I 'm more than a little weary of it , particularly when it 's done in such a gratuitous and self-serving manner . DBF went over the top with it in this book and needs to dial it back in the future , in my opinion.I 'm still a fan of books that are centered around South Carolina 's Lowcountry , and am not giving up on DBF . Her writing style is still compelling and her subject matter is still appealing to me as a reader . This one misses the mark by a fairly wide margin , though , and I 'm disappointed in Dottie Frank for having written it in this manner . I hope she tones down the ex-husband bashing in her next outing , and pays more attention to the details .	-1
First let me say , I 've loved Dorothea Benton Frank 's books since Sullivan 's Island and Plantation , right on through Pawleys Island ; after that , not so much . Ms.Frank 's writing has become slick and polished and has lost , for me , what I liked best about her books , their realism , their authenticity as it were . Ms.Frank seems to be trying to be all things to all people and in so doing has lost what she did best.It makes me sad to review Ms. Frank this way , but it is honest I find this to be a a slick , commercial book designed to appeal to all that is hip and modern ( requisite gay character check , denigration of religion check , references to every & # 34 ; designer brand & # 34 ; and tv & # 34 ; celebrity & # 34 ; known to God and man check ) .Sad day for me , I wo n't be buying anymore DBF books ( at least not new lol ) I 'd been hoping Bull Island and the stuff that came after it , up to and including this book , were just a temporary . meet the deadline books and Ms. Frank would eventually go back to the original , witty , loving and lovable books from before , it 's pretty clear that wo n't be happening , so I wo n't be buying .	-1
There is way too much filler and too many irrelevant characters in this book . From about page 20 I found myself starting to skip over the irrelevant junk about Beaumont 's knee replacement , hospital surroundings , mail nurses , female nurses , book he read in Vietnam , the comrades from Vietnam who did n't make it back , his son 's career , his first wife , his third wife 's career , etc . etc . etc.Then I got smart and quit the book .	-1
Fia and Annie are sisters . A sister 's bond is one of the strongest bonds that can not be broken . The sisters attend Keane School . Although this school is not your normal school . Think of it kind of like Xavier 's school for the X-Men only this school is for girls . Fia has not been the perfect student type , so it would figure that she would learn to be an assassin . Annie on the other hand plays be the rules . Fia wants to get away and be free . Unfortunately she has to care for Annie . Their bond will be tested.I have been excited about all the new young adult books that have come out recently . Some of my favorite authors have picked up on the wave as well and have written series . What I like about this genre is that the books can go more fantasy or the book or series can have very relatable characters that make me want to follow them on their journey . I did not get the relatable characters from this book and the fantasy aspect was alright but not as well written or portrayed.Annie seemed weak and feeble minded . Where as Fia was strong . This one sidedness od Fia being the only strong character can only carry the story so far . I wanted Annie to grow and be just as strong a character as Fia but this did not happen . Another aspect of this book that drove me crazy is the `` flow '' . It was bumpy and did not flow as smoothly from present to past or Fia 's voice to Annie 's voice . Even though the start of each chapter told me if it was the past or present or Fia or Annie talking , I still got confused a few times . Also , it seemed that Fia and Annie never really aged from the past to the present . There will be a follow up book but I am not sure that I will read it .	-1
I found this an interesting read because I live in the Sarasota area but the essence of the book was very simplistic and only found it of interest because of the places mentioned that I am familiar with	-1
This book does not uncover conspiracies , but instead gives a history of & # 34 ; some & # 34 ; conspiracies . More disappointingly though is that is dwells on so many conspiracies from the 19th century ( and 18th as well ) , but not so much in modern times , or how they affect/relate to pop culture . I read to near completion , but found it just too boring and unrelatable .	-1
This has to be the worst book I have read in years . I wo n't even go into the story except to say that it is about a wealthy family that has a summer home down the Cape ( Cape Cod ) .The story revolves around some members of the family more than others and their children 's care takers who come to America from Scotland . This book is the most depressing novel that has no bright moments . The family is disfunctional to say the least . I finished the book in hopes that there would be a SOMEWHAT bright moment to complete the book but I was wrong . Why any publisher felt merit in publishing this book is beyond me . This is the first book I have reviewed that I have given only one star .	-1
This book was especially disappointing because it started out so well . I had hopes of an entertaining yet au courant read about the joys and terrors of internet publishing . Halfway through the author seemed to have become possessed by a self-destructive urge to make all her characters as revolting to her readers as possible . Before our eyes the heroine degenerates into a whiny school girl surrounded by a gaggle of nagging , scoldy old ladies . And that includes her boyfriend . The only character `` with a pair '' is Moira . I would have enjoyed a book with Moira as the heroine . The plot becomes aimless , yet predictable . The reader must face the depressing fact that the internet is ruled by idiot females with degrees from expensive colleges who are unable to figure out how to change their own clothes and shower . And this last item is the reason I have to give this book a 1 star instead of 2 . Describing a character 's body odor , foul unwashed clothing and skanky dirty hair might be acceptable reality in tales of life in the middle ages but in this book is simply disgusting .	-1
Parts of the book were very hard to follow because you did n't know who was speaking or if you we 're in a flashback or not . However , once into the story and fully caught on to events in the story it was a good read . I certainly do n't regret reading it but it was n't something I would normally have picked up . Cudos to the author for the maturity of Colby .	-1
WHAT IS IT ? C . Robert Cargill 's `` Dreams and Shadows '' is the story of Ewan and Colby and the havoc that magical creatures wreak on their lives . Ewan was kidnapped in infancy and raised by faeries with the expectation he would be sacrificed to the devil at age 7 . Colby left his alcoholic mother and his absent father in the company of a cursed djinn who promised to show him all the secrets of the world . After the boys meet and become friends , Colby risks his life to save Ewan from his appointed fate . Several years later , long after Ewan 's memory of the faerie world has faded , two dangerous fae come back into his life : the Sidhe girl who loved him , and the changeling boy who vowed to kill him . It is up to Colby , now widely known as a fearsome wizard , to protect Ewan if he can.WHAT 'S NOT TO LIKE ? If you enjoy being talked down to , `` Dreams and Shadows '' is the book for you . Cargill attempts at various points in his first novel to adopt the style of children 's fairy tales , partly as a way of announcing `` Hey , this is a fairy tale ! '' and partly to create a cool contrast between innocent language and dark doings . The best children 's authors , like , say , Lemony Snicket ( Daniel Handler ) , have a talent for combining the adorable and the horrific with simple language while conveying both conviction and respect for their audience . Respect for the audience is not something Cargill conveys very well , however , whether he 's narrating an oh-so-cute tale of young love or lecturing at you like The Criminologist from `` Rocky Horror . '' Cargill is no Lemony Snicket , nor is he a Neil Gaiman , and if you do n't like being treated like an idiot , you will have a difficult time reading this book.Cargill 's plotting is not world class , either . Most novels are about mysteries or quests of some sort . You know from the outset that you 're seeking to learn who did it , or maybe why or how they did it , or who will win the war , or where in the heck the Holy Grail has been hiding itself for all of these years . In this novel , we know from the outset that Ewan and Colby are doomed , but that 's about it . Not until mere pages before the end of the book do we have a sense of where the whole thing was supposed to be headed . This means that readers will constantly be asking themselves questions like , `` Where is this going ? Why do I need to know this ? Why should I care about any of this ? '' This is not the best way to keep the reader engaged.The novel has many other flaws , but these two were quite enough to leave me regretting my decision to acquire the book.IS THE BOOK A TOTAL DISASTER ? No . Cargill shows art and imagination in the way he pulls elements together from Scottish/Irish/Welsh mythology . He draws a little bit on other mythologies , but Coyote , the Native American trickster spirit , is the only significant example . Like some contemporary fantasy authors , he also brings in angels and Hell.Few of his characters have any depth , but that does n't mean they 're not vividly portrayed within their narrow limits . Cargill 's most lovingly crafted character is Knocks , the changeling who was given over to Ewan 's parents on the day he was kidnapped . Even though he 's just a pawn , Knocks is the novel 's central villain , a twisted and evil fairy who hates his almost-brother Ewan with every fiber of his being . Ewan , ironically , has virtually no character at all . He 's pleasant , eager to please , a bit artistic , and that 's about it . Colby falls somewhere in the middle . He 's the novel 's most important character , but that does n't really come clear until the final third of the novel , which , not coincidentally , is the strongest part of the book.The book has other highlights . I like the way `` Nora '' seduces adult Ewan in Austin ; that moment has a sincere sweetness that the twee story of Ewan 's parents in the first few pages of the novel does not . I was also impressed by the way Cargill evokes the power of Ewan 's musicianship ; musical performance is rarely captured well in writing.For me , none of these pros overcome the cons I list above , but that 's just me.AND SO ? This novel is not without its high points and rewards . If you can get beyond the flaws I discuss , you may enjoy it . Still , I recommend that you not purchase the book before you 've had a chance to peruse a good chunk of it in the bookstore or online .	-1
I have a problem with pirates being portrayed in a positive light . In real life , pirates are horrible human beings who deserve whatever punishment is meted out to them . They are not , as this book would have it , some sort of collection of rough and tumble bohemians seeking out an alternative lifestyle and community beyond cultural norms . In real life , the navy is the good guys protecting law abiding merchants and travelers from the predations of pirates ; it is not a tragedy or an injustice when a naval vessel destroys a pirate ship.Also , I have a problem with books where the protagonist is a child who goes around dealing with conflict by threatening to run people through with a sword . Not that anyone gets run through with swords , nor do the pirates actually do much in the way of piracy . We do n't see how it is that all those legs got turned into pegs or those eyes got replaced by patches . The pirates in this book might as well be at the Renaissance Faire in terms of actually doing anything . The most violent episode in the narrative is an adult being hit by a can of beets . The book references Treasure Island several times , and you might be well served by reading that instead.And I have a problem with how the father and mother are portrayed in this book . At least in the old Disney movies , the screenwriters had the decency to kill off the parents in order to explain how a minor ended up on a dangerous , thrilling adventure . They did not make them indifferent , and at best , horrible parents.So , I have a lot of problems with the basic concept of this book . I also did not like the typography used for denoting handwritten letters that tend to end chapters , if for no other reason than it slowed down my ability to finish reading this dreary book . Also these letters and newspaper clippings aim to be flippant parodies ; if you want that sort of stuff , I suggest The Onion.When I compare this to the kind of books I was reading as a child or early teen , for example theHoratio Hornblowerseries by C.S . Forester , which were truly adventurous and fun ; and as an added benefit actually taught something about how people lived in the past , I 'm just saddened.I wish I had something good to say about this book . It 's reasonably well written with a minimum number of typos . Regardless , I can not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I bought this book based on the reviews . I feel like i read a different book . It was just awful . The detective does everything wrong and thats all he thinks about . The last few pages the author must have written about 20 times he went outside for a cigarette . Really did we need to know that each time . Plus the ending which tried to change everything was just to much .	-1
Although I very much enjoyed all the other titles in this series , I found this tale a major disappointment since it diminishes the character of Anna Madrigal to a petty , insensitive , and lethally vindictive individual with no redeeming characteristics . Nor is there anything of interest in any of the other characters .	-1
I would not recommend this book . I did n't even bother finishing it . Do n't waste your time there are so many really good books out there !	-1
***Review posted on The Eater of Books ! blog***The Ruin of a Rogue by Miranda NevilleBook Two of the Wild Quartet seriesPublisher : AvonPublication Date : August 27 , 2013Rating : 2 starsSource : eARC from Edelweiss***Warning : this is an adult book , and for the eyes of mature readers***Summary ( from Goodreads ) : Charm , wit , and nerves of steel have helped Marcus Lithgow gamble his way across the Continent . But when his heart is at stake , all bets are off for this most perfect rogue ... It 's been years since Marcus set foot in England -- why toy with the ton when he can fleece wealthy fools in Paris and Rome ? Yet everything changes when he inherits a ramshackle estate . Marcus 's first and only chance at a respectable life needs funding . . . the kind Anne Brotherton can provide . Such a wallflower should be ripe for the picking . So why does Marcus fell like he 's the one hanging by a thread ? Anne Brotherton is sick and tired of being an heiress . She can not bring herself to marry a fortune hunter . Why ca n't men like her for her sharp mind and kind hearts rather than her impressive dowry ? She nearly falls for Marcus 's smooth seduction . But when Anne realized she 's being strung along , a lust for payback empowers her like never before . Two can play the game of deception . The game of love , however , has its own rules.What I Liked : Ahhh , I really wanted to like this book . You all know my obsession with historical fiction , and more specifically , with historical romance . I got this eARC with two others from Edelweiss , and I chose to read this one first because it sounded awesome ! Rogue , heiress , games ? ! I had high hopes for this one - not that I do n't have high hopes for the other two eARCs I got along with this one.Anyway . I was totally looking forward to an awesome historical romance book . Marcus sounded like a yummy rogue with a plan . And he was - sort of . I liked his plan from the beginning and the way he went right after what he wanted , despite the fact that he had basically no money , and that Anne eventually caught on and drove him up a wall.I did n't really see the part about his `` smooth seduction '' . I mean , I saw a kind gentleman , eager to please a lady , but not fall over himself trying to make sure she was pleased . I did n't really think Marcus was a rogue at all ! He seemed like a poor and desperate man , but he also seemed like a complete gentleman to me ! He did n't try to kiss her or do anything sexual AT ALL . Which was very nice of him , and I respected that , but if he 's supposed to be a rogue , with rakish behavior , then that does n't really fit his personality.The ending is good ! Happy ending and all that . There are sacrifices made , but as with most historical romance novels , there is a happy ending for the happy couple.That concludes what I liked from this novel.What I Did Not Like : Oh my gosh . I mean no disrespect to the publisher and the author and everyone who worked so hard to make this book what it is , but there are SO MANY THINGS that I just did NOT enjoy . It pains me to say this , because I love Avon Books and historical romance.Okay . Well . My first thing to point out is that this book is indirectly split up into two parts : the first part deals with Marcus and Anne , in which Marcus was being super nice to Anne in order to `` charm her '' , for her money . The second part of the book deals with Marcus trying to restore an old manor he inherited from his mother 's uncle . Anne follows him to his new manor because she has heard that there are ancient Roman ruins in this particular manor summer , and she is interested in archaeology , so naturally , she wants to explore the ruins.So . I must say , while this book is split into two parts , both parts are extremely boring . The cadence of this book is so boring . I did n't care what was going on , I did n't care if Marcus and Anne were trying to trick each other , I did n't care about Marcus 's manor , I just did n't care ! This book was so boring and had no life to it ! It made me not care about anybody or anything ! Anne is just so uninteresting . I know that the premise of the book says that she wants men to acknowledge her brains and her intellect , and not just her money . Okay but ANNE . You are such a boring person ! You have like , NO personality . She likes archaeology and ancient ruins . I LIKE archaeology and ancient ruins and whatnot . But she bored me to TEARS with her chatter about archaeology and villas and UGH.So Anne was a boring and almost a nuisance . She stood up for herself when she realized that Marcus was after her for her money , but she still acted like a spoiled heiress ! I expect her to act like a spoiled heiress ( she IS one ) , but she tries to convince herself that she 's different than the other aristocratic heiresses . Ugh , no.And Marcus was in no way the rogue and rake that the premise claims him to be ! I really do n't think he acted like a rogue at all ! He acted like a nice gentleman , even when Anne joined him at his manor , even when he struck up a bargain with her . He did n't demand anything naughty in nature.And that 's another thing . Anne does housework with Marcus . Like , sweeping , dusting , cob-webbing , that sort of thing . MANUAL LABOR . Does anyone else see a problem with this ? No heiress/aristocrat/rich lady would EVER stoop that low , just to see ancient Roman ruins . And that in itself is anachronistic - no aristocrat and definitely no LADY would go on her hands and knees to dig up ancient ruins that might not even be there . No one . I so so not believe that.The romance itself is just BAD . In the beginning , Marcus just wants to pursue Anne for her money . In the beginning , Anne falls head over heels in love with Marcus , because he has knowledge in ancient ruins , and he seems kind and NOT after her money.In the second half of the book , they fall in love while restoring the manor and digging up ancient ruins . I took FOREVER for them to actually decide that they were in love . And there was n't very much chemistry ! I was so disappointed in the lack of chemistry throughout the entire book ! Their relationship did n't seem very passionate . It seemed taxed ( on Marcus 's end ) , and boring ( on Anne 's end ) . Or maybe just all-around boring . I find that sad - because this is a historical romance novel ! There is supposed to be some burning passion , or something ! All of the `` passion '' comes at the very end , and it happens only a few times ! Okay , so I feel like some people would say , `` Well , maybe this is a historical romance with a lot of intellect and very little sex . '' Okay , I completely respect that . I love it when books are supposed to be intelligent , and more based on the plot than the romance . BUT , when we 're dealing with a historical ROMANCE novel , I think there needs to chemistry throughout the book , among other things.Did I already mention that I did n't care for the plot ? It was so boring . Both parts to the book were unappealing . The characters were somewhat unappealing ( mostly Anne ) . There were some anachronisms that bothered me . I did n't like the lack of passion and chemistry.I feel like I 've said enough . And again , I mean no disrespect towards the people who worked on this book , and the author . But as a historical romance lover , I was not impressed.Would I Recommend It : No . I 'm sorry , but there are much better historical romance novels . Shorter ones , too . Length usually never bothers me , but when I already wanted this one to end from the very beginning , the sheer size of this book made it even worse . I did n't want to stop reading this book , because I thought it would get better , but alas.Rating:1.5 stars - > rounded up to 2 stars . Maybe that 's me being generous .	-1
What is wrong these days that books are classified romances when they have nothing to do with romance . Romance is a genre . AS a romance reader I have enough of having books that are not romances classified as romances . This book is far from a romance , some of the graphic scene and cheating disgusted me . Maybe this book belong to woman fiction but as a romance it is a zero .	-1
This book started out good . Very good . I liked the characters and was really enjoying it . Right around the middle of the book things turned south . Usually if a book is good I will read it in a day or two . This one took me over a week . I just wanted to reach in the story and slap both of the main characters . It started with her kidnapping him and went stupid from then on . The plot had so many twists that I literally rolled my eyes about four times because of another change that was utterly idiotic . Nick was an idiot . I mean seriously all he had to do was sit down and talk to her but no , he just bumbles through knowing he was intentionally hurting her and doing nothing about it . Then the ending , oh man what a catastrophe ! It had nothing to do with the story line at all and they STILL did n't talk about the things that had drifted them apart . It seemed like someone who has a very short attention span wrote this book because it was all over the place . I do n't recommend it .	-1
Boy , I wanted to like this book because I 'd heard so many great things about it . I will probably be flamed for the rest of my life , but I had to use superhuman willpower to get through this book . It 's taken nearly six months to push through this long-winded tome . I read voraciously and I simply could not get interested in this book until , quite literally , the last 20 pages , with the last five being riveting . That 's one heck of a price to pay for the first 600 pages.To John Irving I respectfully award the & quot ; Get Over Yourself & quot ; award for his endless diatribes and digressions ; to the character of Owen Meany I say , & quot ; All right already , we get the picture , just go and do something , & quot ; and last but certainly not least to John Wheelwright , the narrator , & quot ; It 's a great big world out there , even in Toronto . DO something ! Get a life. & quot ; And to Irving 's editor , & quot ; You 're paid to edit material , regardless of the author 's name . So edit ! & quot ;	-1
This might have been a good story if it was 300 pages instead of 600 . Alot of unnecessary repetition . The story wanders from place to place with no purpose that I could see .	-1
My fault for not more carefully previewing the subject matter . Too much old time religion and male rule . Longer review required so consider it done .	-1
I wo n't be reviewing this book as it must have been ordered by mistake . I can not find an invoice or a receipt of charge for this item but Amazon has assured me that I DID order it . However , I have less than nil interest in Mr. Bacharach so will not be wasting my time reading this book . The only reason I have given it 1 star is because I could n't submit my 'review ' without posting a rating .	-1
This book is written by someone that wants to be a writer but learned the skill through a mail order class . I am just amazed it made it past a publisher . Confusing , some paragraphs you have to read more than once to see who he is writing about . I am half way through , but it is a struggle .	-1
I love Rob Sheffield 's & # 34 ; Love is a Mixtape & # 34 ; . It 's one of the best books I 've read about real love . But this one made me a little bit disappointed . I sure do share his love for music , but not that much for karaoke . I just feel there 's nothing much for me in this book . Sorry , Rob . : (	-1
The books starts in an interesting way -- characters you care about are caught in a bizarre situation , then there is a overly long digression on -- wait for it -- prison is n't so nice . And if that is not enough edification you might also learn that war is n't so nice either . This prolonged preaching might miss a few points -- psychopaths no longer free to hurt others , and dictators who no longer commit genocide against millions might be the ( apparently unnoticed to our author ) upside of prisons and wars . The books does end in a more interesting way .	-1
What a peculiar book . I did n't like it for the first 300 pages . It does not follow a linear progression , so I was often lost as to whether we were still in present day or if we 'd stepped back into somebody 's memory . The fact that it 's fiction , yet includes real pictures from real events in Queen Elizabeth II 's life was a little disorienting as well . I 'm still not entirely certain of my opinion .	-1
I thought a pathetic read . Lacking in substance and not at all a book I would recommend to anyone . Real rubbish	-1
The author claims that people can approach problems through four personas ; Dreamer , Thinker , Lover and Warrior , which are overseen by three further characters ; the Lookout , Captain and Voyager . Given the authors credentials I was hoping for some interesting original insights , however I found the content was longwinded , repetitive and a little derivative . In the authors schema , the book was written almost entirely with the Lovers voice , with no innovation ( Dreamer ) , or actionable ( Warrior ) content and shallow analysis ( Thinker ) . I thinkThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People : Powerful Lessons in Personal Changeis a much better book , with more actionable content and better tools for helping you bring about personal change .	-1
I guess I expected she would be a better writer . And that I 'd learn things I did n't already know . Wrong on both counts . If you saw her interview with Diane Sawyer or followed the case at all , do n't bother .	-1
Had I known that this book was promoting a vegan diet , I would have never purchased it . Converting to veganism comes with its own long-term health issues.The most valuable information in this book has to do with improving your diet by removing refined foods and consuming more plant foods to increase micro-nutrients ( nothing new to me ) . For those who may not already be aware of it 's importance , this could be helpful . But to the uninitiated , filtering out the helpful from the misinformation could prove difficult .	-1
I did n't like it at all . The time frame that was chosen , the plot or even the food and drink was really predictable .	-1
I am a fan of William Boyd 's writing and was delighted to hear he had been selected as the writer for this important Bond novel . Which makes the actual result extra disappointing.This is a book of three bits , Bond in London post a birthday celebration . Bond on a mission in Africa and Bond going solo in the US . It 's a short book at just over 300 pages.We have to remember this is about the Bond that Fleming gave us , not the film and not as depicted in the Gardiner or Benson books . Important to remember that Fleming 's books were set a long time ago and did not have the pace of more modern thrillers . Having said that , Boyd commits two serious errors , he fails to get inside Bond 's personality and , worse of all , he makes the book boring.William Boyd is a brilliant writer and manages to make his characters incredibly vivid and real and he certainly knows how to move a plot . But here he fails to open up Bond as a person and almost makes him a hard drinking civil servant - no sense that he is a killer . And likewise he fails to make this a page turner or populate it with interesting characters . It 's not an awful copy of Fleming 's work but he fails to get to the essence of the fact that Fleming 's books were actually exciting ! The book has many flaws and inconsistencies and is a weak addition to the Bond heritage . I had so high hopes for this and am astonished at being so under-whelmed by this effort from such a talented author .	-1
The very first book I ever read as a child outside of school books was a paperback copy of Goldfinger belonging to my father . Because of that book I became hooked on reading and also hooked on James Bond books . Solo was very disappointing . It was just not enjoyable to read as a long time fan of the Bond books . The flash backs to World War Two trying to shape the character of Bond in the Cold War era was too big of a character change . It was trying to make Bond , the mythical modern hero , into a real world person . To me it failed . It was not fun to read .	-1
I guess the word `` sensuous '' in the description should have tipped me off ... However , I was hoping the word sensuous implied that the author was skillful at painting a picture of romance and allowing the reader to use their imagination for the explicit details.However , it seems the author was trying to ride on the success of Fifty Shades Of Grey . Really wish publishers would start warning readers when explicit sex scenes are involved ... I wanted to read erotica , I 'd pick up an erotica book . To me , it 's like bringing home a carton of ice cream that advertises itself to be mint chocolate chip , and you open it up and find they 've added anchovies to it ! If you are unable to use your imagination when it comes to sex scenes ... this book may be your thing . If you like books that leave out graphic sex/violence , pass .	-1
I also chose this book because I 'm a huge fan of Janet Evanovich , but it just is n't my cup of tea . The book is basically a Pygmalion theme . The author writes well enough and I found the main character , Holly , to be sympathetic enough . My main problem was the sex.I 'm not prudish at all but I do n't think the author 's forte is sex scenes . There is one in the very first chapter and it just fell flat for me . Then later , the book delves into spanking as a sexual act . Again , I 'm not prudish or shocked , but the entire spanking thing left me thinking wtf ? It was n't erotic at all , for me at least . Perhaps I 'd have had a different reaction if I was into that kind of sex play , but somehow I doubt it . In fact , I found myself mentally groaning whenever it became clear that there would be another ( bad ) sexual encounter.I do think Stephanie Evanovich is a talented writer and I found even the spanking couple to be very likeable ( when they were n't spanking ) . Her dialogue is quite good , too . I hope she 'll follow her famous aunt 's example and leave the sex to a minimum ( or learn how to write sexier sex ) because she 's witty and knows how to keep a book moving .	-1
Holly was never a thin girl , and after dealing with the death of her husband , she has put on more weight than ever . When she bumps into Logan , a personal trainer , on an airplane , they strike up a camaraderie , and he offers to train her . After months of hard work , Holly has transformed , blossomed . Will Logan notice the change , and will love blossom as well ? I wanted to like this book , really I did . I wanted it to be a story about a normal sized woman owning her looks and finding the love she deserves . Sadly , it was not exactly what I wanted . When Holly is introduced to us , the first impression we get of her is a big , fat , mess . I think this is the impression a lot of people have of overweight people , even overweight people who are meticulously groomed and well put together . So , right away , the author feeds into fat stereotypes . Holly was never worthy of love , and only settled on her husband , because that is what a fat girl is supposed to do . She is supposed to feel grateful for any attention thrown her way . Which is also why Holly jumps at the chance for a handsome man to become her trainer . Logan is , in short , a pig . In fact , the book is pretty full of misogyny that is thinly veiled as sexy fetishism.There is a lot of sex in this story . I am hardly what I would call a prude , but I am not a huge fan of words like `` moist mound '' and `` throbbing member '' in a romance book . A talented writer can do much better than the standard Harlequin novel fare . Between the language and the spanking , this is like a watered down version of the 50 Shades books.I am really not sure who the target audience is here . Not feminists , that is for sure . And not anyone comfortable with their body , since all the women ( no matter what they weigh ) in the book are incredibly insecure about their looks.The book is a fast easy read , and at times fun and playful . But in the end , my heart hurt for every woman who has ever felt like Holly.I received a review copy courtesy of Amazon Vine in exchange for my honest review .	-1
The situation bothered me : a deeply ethnic tale told by an author with no experience of it . Seemed very arty with the occasional inconsistency , the polished style at war with the content .	-1
Richard Dawkins is a fascinating figure not necessarily because of his scientific achievements ( although they are impressive ) but for his ability to think differently and against powerful adversaries have his message heard.The only section of this book that I found interesting was the section at the end on the writing of a Selfish Gene . If I wanted to know about Dawkins research I would have gone and read his papers ( for some I 've already done this ) . In a biography I look for more insight into what 's shaped the man and his theories . I 'm also looking for a realistic viewpoint of what life was life and struggles encountered along the way.I found Dawkins book to be more of a general overview of his research than a view into his life . For me , this was disappointing .	-1
Mr Toyne needs to spend some more time thinking about his last two books . This one was no where near as good as those .	-1
I have read most of this book and am returning it for a refund . That would seem dishonorable , but , after all , it is the author 's proposed solution to a problem that reasonable , informed persons agree on in the first place that I purchased the book to learn.I 'll return to my disappointment with the `` solution '' later , but first a few remarks.I applaud the author 's use of entirely lower-case for the word `` scientologist '' . I deplore the author 's slavish political correctness . He writes tautologically that there are n't racial differences in intelligence . He should read `` The Bell Curve '' . Why is it PC to write about racial differences in physical illnesses but not in mental illnesses and abilities ? He writes that the average age of marriage is the same as total life expectancy 20 years ago . He must have made that up . He correctly writes about the biological imperative to pass one 's genes on , but then irrationally ( and unnecessarily ) extols same-sex marriage and fails to grasp why male attraction to young women ( I agree that there is a point at which it is criminal ) makes perfect biological sense.But his conclusion about the solution to the problem is childishly naive in the extreme . Simply cut of the money flow . Sure . We all know that money is the problem . He must say how to cut the money flow off , and he does not.Compounding the tragedy is that because of capitalistic media ownership , the only people who will read books of this type are those who do n't need to be convinced as to what the problems are .	-1
I was *so* thrilled to discover a trilogy set in one of my favorite time periods - a & # 34 ; family saga & # 34 ; no less ! I was expecting something akin to the poignant and powerful Cazalet series by Elizabeth Jane Howard . I was in for a stark disappointment.I was first struck by the author 's bizarre mistakes with British honorifics . As a viscount , eldest son Charles Greville would 've been called Lord X , whatever it was ( did we ever learn it ? ) His sister Alexandra would 've been Lady Alexandra , as a daughter of an Earl , not Miss Alexandra . Family friend Winnie , as daughter of a Marquess , would also have been a Lady.I was so distracted by this that it ruined my trust and confidence in the author.I also found myself frustrated with how little time was spent on the female characters in this so-called & # 34 ; family & # 34 ; saga . With a female on the cover , I expected at least some even , absorbing representation of the ladies in the family . But Hanna , Alexandra , Ivy , and Winnie are all glossed over with cursory nods to their experiences . Lydia Foxe , positioned as a lead character , drops from the story almost instantly . The result is poorly planned , uneven , and dim . I felt the authorth 's abrupt , forced and fleeting attentions very keenly in the text . He was impatient.A story like this could 've been so rich and addictive , but without vital illumination , care , patience , and truth , we 're left with something very dull indeed .	-1
What Happens in Scotland is definitely not my idea of a romance . I could not even finish this book . The two characters are separated from each other for the bulk of the book . Not even a letter exchanged between the two . Call me crazy , but my characters need to interact with each other for me to feel their connection . Later , when they finally do reconnect , both characters are thoroughly unlikeable and the `` story '' is almost none existent .	-1
As I began to read this long , long book I was looking for vampires and found Woodrow Wilson . I then thought this book might be a biography of W. Wilson , because that man takes up a lot of pages in this story . Enough that when I finished I was trying to evaluate whether Oates could & # 8217 ; ve written the same story without him . I think she almost could have . At the very least his part of the story concerning The Accursed , or The Horror , could have been drastically reduced without hurting the story.There are many many characters here . The college and town of Princeton figures largely , The subjects are suffrage for women , race , misogyny , class divisions , Socialism , mysticism , Theosophy , and Christianity . The & # 8220 ; right & # 8221 ; sort of Christianity , of course . There are vampires , but not like you would think ... I don & # 8217 ; t think I would actually characterize this as a vampire story . Others will disagree . It is more the history of rich families in the rich and privileged college town of Princeton and what happens to them in the space of one year . Many of the characters are real people from history . The book is a huge effort . I & # 8217 ; m just not sure it is a believable effort .	-1
Not really what I was looking for . I saw her on Rachael Ray but should have researched more before buying .	-1
I tried repeatedly to read this book , but just could n't keep going . I like dystopian fiction , but it was the classic books aspect which made me try this one and it did n't play a big enough part in the novel , at least as far as I got before finally giving up.The general plot seemed to have big gaps between events in the early going . Maybe it became more linear when it got to the main storyline , but I did n't make it that far . I did feel once as if I were on the verge of getting into the rhythm of the writing , but soon lost it again .	-1
`` In wartime , truth is so precious ; she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies . `` Winston Churchill.Yeah , and I intend to go OG spoken word later . One observation I have regarding professional reviewers is often they tend to become enamored with the art of the craftsman and seem to ignore the aesthetics of the resultant product . This narrative is a prime example as it is eloquently written and about as boring as a read as a 400 page dummies guide to watching flat white paint dry . It begs for analysis in library book clubs , undergraduate English Lit seminars and gated community soccer mom bleacher discussion groups but as pleasurable escapist fiction in the sci-fi fantasy genre it comes up lacking.It is a novel with intricate passages that demand to be revisited over and over because the fundamental challenge is to sustain enough concentration to maintain some sense of character or setting visualizations . In a dystopian world of the future , what do you do with a rebellious paraplegic in an influential position , why you cut him off at the knees , naturally ... No , I 'm not making up that arguably inelegant pun ... in essence Paulette Jiles wrote it . The lamentable part of it for me is if it was n't buried in a glacier sized floe of somnolent prose the typically cynical me would probably highlight it as an example of her brilliance . I did n't measure it but I have no doubt my customary reading speed diminished by around 75 % as I struggled to plod through the preponderance of languid prose.There is fantasy here but it resides with the reader in the chimerical belief if you press on eventually you will be rewarded for your persistence because the author 's lyrical exhibition could not have been for naught . It was n't - exclusively - my impression primary character , clich & eacute ; d orphan Nadia Stephens , who discovered and commenced exploitation of her talent for lying , failed to engage the reader but also as the narrative progressed , there were preciously few instances where she ever appeared to face any threatening situations one might expect in a society where virtually all survivors had to confront a plethora of challenges to merely subsist.Yes , there existed a palpable risk of interment or execution by some amorphous governmental apparatus . She could have been discovered and reported by anyone who recognized her during her odyssey however in a putative dystopia I would have expected someone equally at risk would have been likely to slap her with a rusted out tire iron to purloin her Coco Chanel pill box crown ( maybe not but that 's the hat image I came away with ) and steal her bottle of brackish water . Even the vermin had an unrealistic principled approach . AS Gil Scott Heron once mused ( I told you it was coming ) , `` Rats bite us , ai n't no pardon in the ghetto . `` Garmin , Magellan , TomTom , GPS for Dummies , give something because I could have read it backwards and not have been any less lost most of the time . The mapmaker character was introduced and to his credit was able to actualize himself sufficiently enough to convince the author to place him a character protection program for the next few chapters.In essence , the author had the perfect metaphor for my feelings as I worked my way to the conclusion : '' The billboard light illuminated her map and then left it to the dark and then lit it up again . `` Unfortunately , not nearly often enough did her lyrical exposition bring enough illumination to make reading this book worthwhile .	-1
As a staunch Rachel Gibson fan I was really looking forward to this book . Unfortunately , they was so much time wasted on family lore and Southern mores and architecture , I began to wonder if they was ever going to be any romance . But there was . However , it was too little too late .	-1
I 've read Ahern books before . I 've read & # 34 ; Love , Rosie & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; P.S . I love you & # 34 ; . And this one was so very dissapointing to me . I wanted the & # 34 ; stuff & # 34 ; that each of those books had . This felt like the author taking the washrag she used to write those two former books and taking one last squeeze of water out of it to come up with this . This is not an original story to me . It reminded me of that movie Bucket List , only the bucket has 100 names on it and it becomes a laborious chore for the reader as the main character trys to decipher how all 100 fit together . By the end , I still did n't care . There was no & # 34 ; emotion & # 34 ; , no & # 34 ; guts & # 34 ; , no..whatever that is that keeps you strung along like a crackwhore looking for the next rock in the carpeting . ( meaning ... a reader reads to be pulled down the path ... down through the journey of the characters ! ) I felt like I had to drag myself along because I just did n't care . This could have been so good but for me it was dry .	-1
I had heard good things about this book and the Kindle price at $ 2.99 was right , so I thought I would give it a whirl . My expectations were medium , but at $ 2.99 , I figured I was unlikely to be that disappointed.Boy , was I wrong about that.The spoiler-free version of this review : if you care at all about slut-shaming and sexual assault , you will not want to read this book , because it is rife with justified sexual assaults ( by the so-called hero ) as well as trigger-worthy sexual assaults that the heroine just shrugs off when it 's convenient for the plot and trots out as a major trauma when it 's not . Both the hero and heroine treat a woman whose major sin is banging the hero as shit and repeatedly call her a whore . And Kaspar calls Violet `` Girly '' over and over and over again.The world-building is a mess ( for instance , only the fourth and the seventh son of the Vampire King can inherit ! And that is because ... because ... uh ... tradition says so ! So even if the fourth son is a sexually assaulting rapist ... ) .So here 's the spoiler-version : Our `` hero , '' Kaspar , murders thirty people ( an act he asserts is justified , but given the ease with which those thirty men fall to the vampire and his best buddies , and the speed with which they could have evaded the attack , this massacre does n't fall under any version of justified homicide that I 've ever seen ) and kidnaps Violet Lee , who happens to be a witness to this all . It would be more convenient to kill her , but she 's hot , and so his conscience acts up as it sometimes does for hot chicks , and he nobly refrains . Do n't worry , we 'll see more of his brilliant nobility as the book goes on ! Violet is taken back to the hiding place of the vampires , where they decide that they ca n't kill her because her dad is important , and so instead they 're going to put her under house arrest until she voluntarily decides to change , because then her dad will know that it was her decision . I 'm not entirely sure why these beings , portrayed as somewhere between one hundred ( on the low end of things ) to several thousand years old ( on the high end of things ) think that her father is going to believe that his seventeen year old daughter 's transition to vampire is voluntary when she was being held captive until she changed , but never mind logic ! More importantly , I do n't know why Violet ca n't just go home . The entire captivity narrative of the story is driven by the fact that vampires can not let Violet go home because she will tell what happened . Except ... her father already knows about vampires , and the vampires left thirty bloody bodies in the middle of Trafalgar Square , some of them drained of blood , information that is broadcast on the news . What , exactly , is it that Violet knows that they fear she 'll talk about ? Everything Violet knows , her father either is already aware of , or would be able to easily surmise . They 're holding her -- and risking an international incident -- for no discernible reason except to keep Kaspar and Violet in proximity for the purpose of a plot.That plot , by the way , is that Kaspar sets about assaulting Violet on a regular basis . `` His body pressed up against mine , and my nose wrinkled in disgust as I tried to fold into the wall away from him , '' she thinks . But of course , Kaspar knows better : `` Do you lust for me , Violet ? '' he asks . And when she denies it : `` Then why is your heart beating at twice the rate it should ? '' he demands . It never occurs to Violet that maybe she 's freaking out because a guy she saw rip a bunch of people apart with his bare hands is threatening her , and so she averts her eyes in a tacit admission of lust . Oy . So of course he goes for her.And then , of course , Violet starts to show that she 's as much of a keeper as Kaspar is : `` Get off me ! You have whores for this ! '' she shrieks.Yes , that 's our heroine -- she wants Kaspar to save his sexual assault for the whores that deserve it ! That 's not the only assault , not by a long shot . A little while later , Violet does something that annoys Kaspar ( specifically , she gets rid of his condoms ) . He finds out just before he 's about to use them with his latest fling , and so he accosts her , launches across the room and pins her to the bed . She yells at him to get off her . His response : `` Why , am I making you uncomfortable ? Maybe I will use you instead . '' So now we are at explicit threats of rape.Do n't worry , though ; when the girl Kaspar wanted the condom for finds out what Violet did , she gets mad . Violet 's response : `` I did n't know they made bitches and whores rolled into one . `` As far as I can tell , this other girl 's biggest sin is ( a ) she is a leggy blonde and ( b ) she is having sex with Kaspar.You know what ? I 'm so not okay with this double standard . Kaspar gets written up as the hero when he 's banging girls whose intelligence he regularly badmouths , when he assaults the heroine on numerous occasions and threatens to rape her . Violet refers to all women who are overtly sexual as whores . This is wrong . Really , really wrong.And later , when the woman he 's sleeping with calls him out on spending time with Violet : `` So you stayed with her instead of being with me , your girlfriend ? '' '' Girlfriend ? `` `` That is normally what you call the girl you are in a relationship with ! '' '' Relationship ? '' I breathed , looking around dazed , like the walls could make more sense of this than I could . `` I do n't recall us being in a relationship . `` He does recall screwing her , multiple times , for the last week . And he 's honestly confused that she thinks they 're in a relationship . But his response to her stalking off in a fit of pique is the all-time winner : `` How inconvenient . I 'll have to find an alternative source of amusement . I went back to Violet 's room . `` Later on , Kaspar decides he needs her blood shortly after she 's suffered a brutal assault in which she was injured so badly she needed a transfusion . So he visits her room that night : `` If you scream , I swear I 'll kill you , so I suggest you keep quiet , '' he muttered , looking me in the eye , carefully pronouncing each word.I scowled once more . `` But what about the Protection ? '' He faltered for a moment , eyes dulling a little . `` Give me your consent . `` BECAUSE OF COURSE , it is TOTALLY consent when you promise to kill someone if they make a noise.This is the 35 % mark in the book . It 's the point where the illogic , the bewildering world-building , the slut-shaming , and the repeated sexual assaults on the heroine , along with the vague ridiculousness that she can somehow , of her own free will , choose to become a vampire when she 's being held captive until she turns -- all of this convinces me that this is not a book worth reading or buying , not even at $ 2.99.At this point , I do n't care how awesome the last two thirds of the book are . The first third is wildly offensive , and I 'm done .	-1
David Wellington writes about a Jim Chapel , a U. S. Spy with an artificial arm . Apparently the Soviets built a fail-safe computer , Perimeter , before the fall of the USSR , using The Hydra Protocol ( hard from William Morrow ) designed to launch all of Russia & # 8217 ; s missiles if a nuclear strike was detected . A beautiful Russian agent needs Jim & # 8217 ; s help to disable the ancient computer hidden deep in Kazakhstan . Chased by Russian FSB agents , they have to survive the desert and reprogram Perimeter so it can not set off Russian Missiles . With action scenes borrowed from exciting movies and treachery in the worst places , it & # 8217 ; s impossible to put down . I wish there had been more science fiction in it .

OK. Everyone knows it . Eat your fruits and veggies . Vastly reduced processed food . Eat less animal products . Get used to it and you will learn to like it.I am not a vegan and I will never be one . If I knew that was what this book preached , I would not have bothered . I eat pretty healthy - I do n't eat fried or fast food more than a few times a year . I eat at least 2 servings of fruits and vegetables at every meal . I am not obese . I would like to lose 10-15 lbs and keep them off - i have yo-yo'ed these 10-15 lbs about 20 times over 20 years - maybe more if you count the 5 lb ups and downs.So , I found the book useless . Sure , follow it and you will be healthy and lose weight . I do n't think this is the ONLY way to accomplish that - it is really extreme . Really - one ounce a day of animal foods ? ? Zero processed foods ? And , by the way , eliminate olive oil ( and all other oils ) too . Yeah , sure . That will happen . It is virtually impossible to eat out on this plan.The book claims you get adequate protein on the plan . I track my food intake , and I do n't get anywhere near 75 grams of protein without animal products.Thanks , but no thanks - life is too short to completely eliminate an occasional treat and never be able to eat at a restaurant . I suppose what I need is a book that provides tips and techniques to avoid binge and emotional eating . This is not it . He mentions the need to address emotional eating , but does n't really offer any advice on fixing it .	-1
I am completely perplexed at the 4 & 5 star reviews , and the fact this is a New York Times best seller . There is nothing new whatsoever in this book . There 's a lot of trying to get you to love your own body , which yeah , I get it , it 's a nice thought & all , but coming from someone with her physique sounds hollow . No new nutrition , fitness or science in this at all . Save your money , check it out at a library . Cameron Diaz is a cute & funny actress , but not a good writer or author .	-1
A lot of cheerleading , rah-rah stuff , little substance . Positive tone but not much information . I expected more information and less flash .	-1
This was a total adult fairy tale . Not my type of book . It was interesting and it kept me reading but it left me un satisfied ...	-1
Story line was incomplete . I wanted to know more . It had potential but continually skimmed the surface of what could have been an intriguing fantasy .	-1
I had never read Neil Gaiman before and since this book was listed quite highly on the Bestseller 's List , I figured it would be worth my time to give his work a try . It only goes to show that not everything on the Bestseller 's List is for me.It began interestingly enough and the writing style was good , but as it progressed I was n't sure what to make of it all . Maybe I 'm just past the age of reading fairytales , as everyone hinted that this was , in fact , that type of book.I kept reading assuming the ending would justify continuing , but it did n't . It left you hanging with no clue as to where this all went or the purpose . I 'm sure of the author 's name was John Smith , it would have gone nowhere.I consider myself well read . Literary fiction is my preference and I thought I would give myself a change by trying a different genre . Well , I did , but I was sorely disappointed .	-1
It is a good story but left me disappointed . I felt there should have been more of a closure . Good writing .	-1
Okay , so I have to admit that I love action movies . I love even the super terrible ones that do n't make any sense and have explosions or violence just because it has been three minutes of dialogue . This book is exactly like those types of action movies . Unfortunately for Ewell , it does n't play out on paper as well as the screen . I think it may be the lack of special effects and the visuals of massive balls of fire . The characters all have little to no development . The main character has very little change that happens within the novel , and the minor characters are there simply to have another name on the page . The plot itself is a general storyline that occasionally has a hole in it that you need to just ignore to get through the novel . So , that is really about it . If you are looking for a senseless action novel , then by all means , this is THE BOOK FOR YOU ! If not , then you should pass it up for something with a bit more of a thought out character and plot .	-1
This book is good for only two things . Kindling for when you make a fire and toilet paper if you are on a camping trip and do n't have any .	-1
I am sorry to say that there was so much that I did n't like about this book , that I can find anything good to say about it . There was nothing that was believable about the characters , or you could say they were the most stupid people around . I mean really , you get skin cancer so now you are going to move to Alaska because it is far from the sun ? ... Get real .	-1
I have read ALL the Jefferson Bass books , but this one was waaaay too brutal for me ! ! In fact , I started it and quit several months ago when I got to a particularly graphic and cruel part . I began it again last week , skipping over those parts I knew were sooo bad , but there was MUCH more ahead ! I have to say I 'm sorry I read it as sometimes those cruel and horrific parts come back to me ! I read Silence of the Lambs and lots of other gruesome novels , but this one is the worst ! ! ! Plus , there really was n't very much of the forensic reading of clues involved in the story . Even if there had been , I 'm still VERY SORRY I READ IT ! ! !	-1
I was very disappointed with this novella . I 've read Kerrelyn Sparks before ( one of my favorite authors ) and her story was n't good at all it felt forced and rushed and just plain sucked ( pardon the pun ! ) . I forced myself to get through it but hated it . Her secondary character from her series Lady Pamela , whom this novella was for deserved a much better story . I did n't like the author Pamela Palmer 's story at all . I felt like she just pulled it from part of a book she was writing and slapped it in here . It was hard to get through . I just skimmed over it as it was n't all that interesting . Amanda Arista 's had some promise but again being a novella it felt choppy and like she was trying to squeeze a full story in a novella size book . There was no conclusion to her novella it read like a short preview of a story to come . Kim Falconers story was n't all that bad an original idea of vampires as mermaids or sirens . Had potential but again felt like a draft of a potential longer story . On a brighter note I happened to catch Amanda Arista 's full books on Amazon tried a sample and loved the book so I bought all 3 in the series . Het novella now makes more sense as one character was in there and some of her terminology for her supernatural world that did n't make sense then while reading the novella now makes sense . However , she could have explained better in the novella for those of us that had n't yet read her series . I 'm frankly off reading novellas as I 'm disappointed every time with the rushed , forced effort from authors I know can do much better . It seems they are writing novellas for writing a novellas sake perhaps at their editors/publishing companies instructions to try make more money . Novellas are meant to be short stories . Not written to be crammed rough drafts of potential stories . I feel cheated as it feels like the authors made no real effort for the novellas . They wrote them for the sake of writing one and that 's just wrong since they are good writers that could have given us better stories that we know they are capable of doing . Next time if you know the story needs to be longer save it for a full book and work on it longer . You know we will buy the full books from our favorite authors and it 'll get a good review instead of ones that say it could have been so much better and deserved to be .	-1
I found the book interesting at the beginning . However , the author 's personality really began grating on me . The guy really is a narcissistic , self-absorbed jerk . I do n't think meditation had any effect on him whatsoever .	-1
This is one of those books that I am absolutely baffled that anyone could even make it through , let alone actually enjoy . I made it through about 40 pages so take this review with a grain of salt . The writing was truly terrible , the long prose and descriptions were bad enough ( which is just a style that I do n't care for ) , but the fact that it was so terribly written made it unbearable . Yes , I did n't finish , but I did read about 20 % of the book and I do n't get what was so great about Lucy or about Jude . Lucy seemed to have a very high opinion of herself , but there was nothing provided that justified that opinion . And there did n't seem to be anything great about Jude , either . They both seemed kind of vacant and boring . There 's a scene early on where Lucy and Jude are cuddled on the beach and some of Jude 's `` friends '' come and harass them out of no where and the implication is that they 're going to attack Lucy . It was all very confusing and I could n't have cared less whether they attacked her or not . Thank god I got this one from the library is all I have to say.This review first appeared on my blog : [ ... ]	-1
I am , unfortunately , not v. good about leaving reviews , but this book was so offensive that I had to do it.I am most concerned about young people , esp . naive young girls , reading this book and thinking there is a SHRED of veracity contained within . The story , the relationships , esp . the parents are so poorly realized , so conveniently stereotypical , so ridiculous.As a generalization , teenage boys , boys in college do NOT want to `` rescue '' girls , they do not want to solely support able girls , they do not fantasize about raising the babies of their teen girlfriends , fathered by another boy.As a generalization , parents of teens / college-age kids are not encouraging their kids to engage in promiscuous behavior , to have rampant , anonymous sex . Said parents also do n't invite to live with them , providing them with a generous allowance , girls who 've become pregnant by their sons.As a generalization , not everyone is financially secure and set : people , inc. teens / college-age kids , have to have part-time jobs ( or full-time ) . Parents do n't have unlimited funds to dole out to their working-age children.I could go on and on , so clearly this ridiculous , offensive and prevaricative book struck a ( negative ) chord with me . Yep . I reel thinking of impressionable girls reading it and thinking there is a scintilla of truth in it . Ugh .	-1
Spoiler ALERT : This book was ok until i got about 58 % of the way and the author kills Chase ! he was the one i loved and i was so upset and annoyed that i can not read the rest ... .do n't get this book nothing good about it ... read thoughtless and effortless or crash and clash and of course a beautiful disaster ... ..	-1
This book was so boring . About half way through the book , nothing new or interesting happens . It is like she is writing in circles or stream of consciousness . `` I love you . . . blah blah . . . I do n't deserve you . . . blah blah . '' I think I deserve a refund . I started skipping pages it was so bad and then I skipped whole chapters and finally I just read the last few pages . Do n't buy this book .	-1
I did n't like this book and this is the first book by this author I could n't finish I usually love the characters and the animals but this one did n't work for me	-1
I read this for a Book Club and I could not get through it . Just not my cup of tea , I guess .	-1
I enjoyed the first book in the series , but this one is all over the place . The writing is choppy , like separately written pages were just joined together . The names are confusing and when you read it you wonder if there was a book one AND two you must have missed that explained why all these people seem to know each other.I gave up during the interminable hospital scene , page after page of nothingness . Sorry , Jennifer Ryan , but I ca n't muster through to the end .	-1
This is the third in a series of four . This one was incredibly stupid . The characters were unbelievable . I kept hoping it would get better but no . I will try again with the last one and maybe Ryan can redeem herself in my eyes .	-1
Ben starts the book with insight into his own upbringing and it 's engaging . But by the second or third chapter he 's out of gas and resorts to rehashing every management book he 's read -- including Andy Grove 's -- into a mish-mash of generalizations that really do n't help someone build a business.Also , if you read Ben 's blog or other info he comes across as egotistical . Maybe it 's the way he writes but I find it overbearing and not helpful to really build my own business.Further , if you 've ever dealt with Andreessen Horowitz the venture capital firm it 's just like many others : big hats and a few cattle . In other words , pretentious and self-important to the point of nausea.Historically speaking , Loudcloud was a great idea that Ben gave up on too early . Yes , they sold Opsware to HP after some near-death experiences , but that does n't mean it was the larger opportunity.Had Loudcloud delivered on the vision it could have been along the size of Salesforce.com ... which is $ 30 billion market value today .	-1
It was ok. Really nothing to write home about . The characters were annoyingly insipid at time . I did n't feel the romance nor the passion . Sorry but not worth the money .	-1
I was really into the story up until the time the character Violet describes when she gave birth , she proved that in spite of all her bad luck in life , she herself is a monster ! A cold hearted monster . She had people around her to help her , but thats when I hated the character and only skimmed through the rest to see the ending as far as the young woman who was working with her . Violet proved herself to be heartless and all my sympathy for the character went down the tubes .	-1
This is , unequivocally , one of the most boring books I 've ever read . Makes Hemmingway look exciting ...	-1
I 'm sure those that posted 4 & 5-star reviews will think I smoked something , but I honestly could n't give this book more than 2 stars . The plot was cute , but the story was very disjointed and I had trouble connecting with the characters . It just did n't flow for me . I did n't feel the chemistry nor did I find there to be romance in the bedroom scenes ... the writing made it all awkward IMO . Just did n't feel any sexual tension . It was obvious to me that this was a debut . Again , cute plot , but the writing needs work . With that being said , I have no interest in reading the other books in the series .	-1
A valiant effort but it fell flat . Also , it went on for far too long , all the action was in the last few pages , and it turns out it 's part of a series . A whole trilogy for this story is really not necessary .	-1
I was so eager for this one ! I thought the idea of an evil Dorothy was unique and creepily delightful . I really enjoyed the prequel novella so my hopes were even higher . Amy , the narrater was a decent heroine . I liked her and I enjoyed her story while she was still in Kansas . Once she made it to Oz I found that the book dragged on and that Oz did n't feel like Oz at all . There was a yellow brick road and some ( once ) flying monkeys but otherwise it could have been a brand newly created fantasy world . In & # 34 ; Wicked & # 34 ; and other Oz inspired works , the stories felt authentically Oz . This just did n't . I was ready to hate Dorothy but after seeing some of the first evil acts by the Tin Man , Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion I found myself disillusioned there as well . Somewhere underneath the evilness these characters become we should see some trace of who they once were and that is all absent . There is also way too much time spent with Amy and a bunch of new characters we have never heard of training for Amy 's upcoming battle with Dorothy . These pages seemed to drag on without much happening and I will admit I was often bored . Once Amy finally gets into Dorothy 's palace , things do pick up . The book was far more entertaining and I found myself getting into it a little bit ... only for it to be over . If you are intrigued by the idea of this novel , go ahead and try it . If I want to visit Oz again , I will turn back to McGuire or even better Baum .	-1
Wanted to love it , but somehow it did n't grab me and immerse me in that place and time . The characters and plot ran a little flat . No bad , but not great either	-1
Horrible . Too simplistic and please do not give the Zuckerberg family more of your money . This was & # 34 ; written & # 34 ; ( if you can call a few lines & # 34 ; writing & # 34 ; ) by Facebook founder 's sister . Stop the madness . Teach your children to be where they are ... not in some screen .	-1
I kept reading hoping it would get better but did not . I finally read the last chapter and thought what a waste.The characters were just too unbelievable in making such dumb decisions . Not one acts that ridiculous . A waste of time	-1
In some ways ` The Taste of Apple Seeds ' is a complicated story , but then again there is a lack of depth . It is a complicated family , but their stories and past seems to be skimmed over . Iris inherits her grandmother 's house . She seems to have no definite idea of what she will do , everything seems temporary . The chapters and storyline jumps in time in many instances . All it would have taken to avoid confusion and make the plot more understandable was a title or date to let the reader know what narrative is being described.It is so easy to lose ones ' way , as also seems to be Iris ' predicament . There are so many characters , that a list or family tree in the beginning would have aided understanding.Iris remembers her childhood and times past . She meets a childhood friend and some mysteries are revealed , but again there is no real depth . Why did someone in the past die ? Why is there an accusation , she assumes is against her grandfather sprayed on a chicken house ? Items and actions are mentioned but no one ... characters in the story or at points the reader seems to be that concerned or interested .	-1
Not a huge fan of this.I really liked the concept ; it was pretty interesting ! But that 's kind of it..Kyra , our lead , was super irritating . From the beginning . I feel she was sort of flat and boring . Plus she 's kind of selfish , which I get why she might be a bit egocentric , but come on Kyra ! She could 've been much nicer to her family so they do n't wish she 'd go missing again.Tyler , the love interest ( spoilers ! Except not really since if happens in like Chapter 2 . It was one of those books where they fall in love instantly ) was actually pretty likable . I had nothing against him , but I did n't really feel a connection between the two . I did n't really understand their romance or feel anything for it . It seemed kind of forced in my opinion.The plot was cool , but I feel like the book as a whole was not really worth all the time that I invested in it .	-1
I know that the characters in these novels must always be part of some tragic event , but this author really did n't make the whole plot of this book believable . I really got the eye rolls when the person behind the threats finally got in touch . The whole scenario was really lame . Both of these girls were victims of sexual abuse and the fact that one would treat the other so badly seems at odds with reality . I feel like the one victim was just attacking this girl all over again . A real turn off .	-1
By the ratings and sales status of this book I expected to be blown away . After the first chapter I was just confused . Why has this book gotten such rave reviews ? It seems every single page has at least one typo . For instance , saying she slid her figure across the phone instead of finger . I normally do n't mind typos , they happen , but there were just too many in this book . Aside from the typos , the story sounded like a love story between 12 year olds . I could not read more than a chapter a day due to how pathetic and cheesy it was . I kept thinking , these are supposed to be college kids ? I half expected the girl to yell COOTIES after the guy touched her . I did enjoy Jacob , but that 's about it . I hate saying negative things about books , but I could n't find too much of anything else in this story . USA Today bestseller , really ? ? ?	-1
I 'm not sure how I got this book ... I certainly did n't buy it intentionally . Formatting is awful but ca n't put the blame on author for that . Tried reading it and could n't get in the story ... really , really surprised . I was expecting so much more with Harper Collins putting their name on this book . My apology to the author for not feeling I could give more than one star rating .	-1
I will start off with the positives ... The author has potential and the main character was not a whiny wuss of a girl that can get irritating in romance books . Unfortunately , thats about it . I did n't get the draw to Rule . Guess I 'm in the minority here . I have absolutely no clue why the girl in this story was so head over heels for him , especially since he had not returned any of her feelings and never even gave her the time of day until his friends commented on how hot she was . And somehow she is in love with him and has been since the age of 14 so she has n't connected with any other guy since ? Thats laughable and cheesy . I could find no connection to any of the characters so I never got invested . Nothing interesting ever happened . I definitely was n't anxiously waiting to get back to my Kindle for this one .	-1
I bought this book because of all the talk about it . I though Jane might have interviewed some people , etc . But , no . All the book covered was the trail , which most of us watched , and not much anything else . I think some of us are in the minority here , but , I for one , was disappointed that I had purchased the book . Waste of money . Nothing new .	-1
A very unusual concept that just does n't work . Too off the wall for any buy in . It tries hard but there just is n't enough that is remotely believable .	-1
wbat the heck ? is this the same author i usually love ? you know its bad when you even fast forward through the sex scenes .	-1
It took me forever to finish this book because I just kept putting it aside due to getting bored with it . The story sounds much more interesting than it turns out to be . A young woman is married by contract to a much older man and upon arriving at her new home finds that there are mysteries and secrets . I found the writing to be a bit pretentious , almost too flowery , in parts of the book . It felt like the author was maybe trying too hard to impress . After a certain point , I found that i just did n't really care too much what happened next . I received this advance copy with the understanding that I would review it so I finished it out of obligation really . That 's not how I want to read something . If a book is well written and the subject matter is interesting , it does n't even feel like time is passing as I read . I can sit for hours and not even look up . With The Miniaturist , my experience was the opposite .	-1
I 've always been an avid reader of Greg Iles books , but this one I just could n't become interested in , perhaps it was knowing how many pages this book was . What I did read I found boring and I just gave up .	-1
This book just was n't for me . It could have been awesome ! But I felt like author , Jervey Tervalon , took EVERY single rumor ever uttered about Michael Jackson and dumped it into a book . On top of that I felt like he was more concerned with impressing readers with his word usage , than he was in actually making a really solid , coherent story.Now , I have nothing against big words-use them myself occasionally , but when there comes a time when you spend too MUCH time creating a mood , and then the story gets lost.Former chef Gibson used to have it all-a successful restaurant , a beautiful and loving wife , and a bright future . And then cocaine got ahold of him . Things started to go wrong , and eventually he was busted trying to buy heroin in the subway . Sentenced to nine months in a minimum security prison , Gibson has one goal in his life-to get his old life back.When the kind woman that runs the halfway house takes a liking to him , she recommends him for a job as a personal chef to the elusive music superstar known as Monster.Unfortunately , Monster lives up to his nickname , and again that could have been a great story , but I was left wondering too much , and trying to follow the overdone prose.Not a fan .	-1
Just finished this disappointing book . The writing was amateurish and very repetitive , which distracted from the story . If the events were not being constantly rehashed , the book would have been half as long , if not shorter . The plot was so predictable and the characters so flat that the book was boring . The punctuation and spelling errors were as usual for a free Kindle book - everywhere ! Even the dialect was silly and inauthentic .	-1
I was excited to read this book . I enjoyed The Princess Diaries movies which have a similar plot line and this book certainly has received many glowing reviews . On the positive side , there was great chemistry between the heiress and the prince . Unfortunately , the book became for me too much of a slog to finish . I might try again later though -- perhaps I 'll jump back in more toward the end of the book .	-1
I 'm Will be honest , I not even half way in and I have already been skimming.So she was fat in school but now the rocking body , he wants her . She jumps him and has sex with him , but she just seems like a door mat .	-1
Brian Bates ' The Way of Wyrd is told with flimsy , one-sided story-telling . Bates sets up his two characters like a Platonic dialogue : One All-knowing guide , an Anglo-Saxon Shaman , and one ignorant follower , a Christian priest , that will inevitably come around to whatever belief the guide suggests . Here is just one example of a particularly annoying section , ( spoiler alert -- I guess ) when the two characters are in the woods and the shaman says something like , `` Wow , you just lost your soul . Did n't you feel it leave ? '' and the guided priest says something equivalent to , `` Now that you mention it , I do feel a little cold and not quite myself . '' Then , the Shaman says something like , `` We need to strengthen your life-force so 's you do n't die . Y'know , now that you are soulless and all , '' and the guided priest says , `` I suppose you are right . You ARE the one who noticed that I am missing my soul , after all . What ever shall we do , 'cause I do n't want to die without my soul ? '' ( quotes are cheeky paraphrases , not actual text . ) Aside from this extremely annoying rhetorical tactic ( I hate it when Plato does it , too ) , The mythology could be from anywhere . There is a lot of interpretation in Brian Bates ' book . Actually , I think invention might be a better word than interpretation . This story reads as if the Anglo-Saxon mythology were some new age-y pseudo-science . I kept getting shades of the Celestine Prophecy while I was reading The Way of Wyrd -- not pre-Christian European myth . This shamanistic tale could have just as easily been in any other culture with a shamanistic background . But , more importantly , the Priest read more like an analogue to a modern skeptic than a 7th century priest . Quite a lot of his question and doubt seemed to mirror more of the wants and concerns of the 20th Century wisdom-seeker than the dark ages monk that he was supposed to be . I imagine that this is the appeal of this book to the people that have liked it . The Way of Wyrd offers what many of these new age fiction books give -- a character with which people searching for meaning can personalize . In this way , the priest is successful , I suppose . He is modern enough or at least generic enough that people can see themselves in him.I , for one , was greatly disappointed in Brian Bates ' The Way of Wyrd . I felt it to be shallow and inaccurate for the most part . I think that if a person were wanting to gain an idea of the beliefs of Northern Europeans from that time , the greatest resource the could be gained from this book is the bibliography at the back , which I am convinced the author placed there to enhance his credibility , but which are actually much better sources ( at least the ones that I have read ) for gaining insight than the book they were printed in . Read the Eddas , poetic and prose , to get a start .	-1
Over the past two decades I 've read a number of books on the Old Order Amish and other plain people such as the Old Order Mennonites , the Hutterites , and the Old German Baptist Brethren . Many have been written by insiders or others intimately acquainted with one or another of these groups . Most of these are both informative and balanced . Sue Bender 's `` Plain and Simple '' is not.This might be a good read for someone most interested in how a wealthy , highly educated person will react to living for a short time with people whose values and purpose in life are obviously different from hers . For someone looking for insight into the Amish , this is not the book to read . For , as other reviewers have noted , this is a book about Sue Bender and not about the Amish ( except tangentially ) . Despite her attempt to get close to the Amish , one gets the impression that in the end , after she has returned to her safe upscale urban enclave , she has come to no better understanding of the Amish than the typical tourist in Intercourse , Pennsylvania , who upon leaving the area , having visited the most touristy locations and perhaps having spent a night in a local Bed and Breakfast , turns to her friend and says , `` How quaint they are ! '' I would like to think that Ms. Bender learned something about the Amish while she was in their midst . In the end , it appears that if she learned anything , it was about herself .	-1
I looked forward to reading this book for a long time . I am deeply interested in connections between sex and spirituality , and I am also in agreement with Eisler about the problems that patriarchal society has created in both of these areas and especially the place where we try to integrate them.I was deeply , deeply disappointed by this book . I believe that many of Eisler 's theories are correct , but she simply does n't cite evidence that supports them . The structure of the book seems to work like this:1 ) Present theory . ( Example - children are frequently abused in patriarchal society . ) 2 ) Give a piece of evidence that might be related . ( For the theory given above , Eisler writes that several Victorian doctors wrote in their journals that many children of parents with venereal disease also have venereal disease . ) 3 ) Re-state theory . ( Patriarchy is terrible for children ! ) The trouble is , frequently the evidence does not say what she claims it says , and even when it does , it 's only a tiny piece of a very large puzzle that we ca n't see . In the example above , for instance - venereal disease is often passed from mother to child during the birth process . Also , lower hygiene standards in the Victorian era means that it was very easy to pass all sorts of diseases . Touch your genitals while passing urine , touch your child 's hand , your child touches their genitals and voila ! We now have disease transmission . And , even if this piece of evidence had said what Eisler claimed it said , that 's two doctors talking about the patients that they saw in their lifetimes - that does n't allow for the specific demographic of patients they saw , geographical differences , differences over time , or pretty much anything else . It 's close-up photography - what we see may reflect what 's going on in the big picture , but it may not , and there 's no way of knowing.This is just one example - I could cite twenty more , and I 'm not a serious student of history . That makes me very concerned - I worry that for every error I noticed in this book there could be five more that I just did n't have the background to recognize.I was also deeply frustrated by Eisler 's PC attitude towards sex . Sex is essential and wonderful , she writes , but pornography and BDSM are inherently tied to `` dominator culture . '' If we live in a dominator culture , which I believe we do , is n't everything going to bear its taint ? If negativity about sex is a significant part of what sustains dominator culture , which Eisler did convince me of , should n't we be doing all we can to validate diverse forms of sexual expression ? She winds up giving a very mixed message . `` Sex is great , but only if it 's the right kind of sex ! '' That 's not actually going to get us anywhere , that 's the message we 've been getting from our culture all along . `` Sex is okay , but only if the husband is in the dominant position ... sex is okay , but only if you 're married ... sex is okay , but only if you 're straight ... '' Have n't we heard this before ? It 's really a shame that the book is n't better written - there 's so little material written on this topic that to have even one piece be sub-standard has a serious adverse effect on the available body of work .	-1
Someone recently recommended this to me and I read it in 3 hours because it 's a very short book . The trouble is , it does n't feel very short when you 're reading it because it 's preaching , repetitive and chock-full of irrelevant and poorly-chosen cultural references that reveal more about the author 's own beliefs than convey any message or impart any pearls of wisdom.This book is an example of utter mediocrity published under the guise of self-help : this is poorly written , poorly argued , poorly illustrated and contains disturbing sub-textual murmurings that anyone with any sense will be able to spot.If you 're a vulnerable reader , at a low point , looking for something ( eg religion ) then maybe this book , with its focus on the mumbo-jumbo end of things , will provide you with some solace.For anyone else it is dumbed-down drivel that needs to go in the bin as fast as possible.Shame on you Harper Collins : did anyone at your editorial staff actually read this crock ?	-1
I will not go into the details of the poor scholarship of this book ; other reviewers have done that and done it rather well . While I find the lack of scholarship disturbing worse is the defense of this book . Reviewers of this book are not arguing for it 's accuracy but arguing that any critic of this book is biased , prejudice or terrified of the truth . Weather or not a book has used good scholarship has nothing to do with the gender of the reader of the book , the readers political or their particular religious views . Similarly good scholarship has nothing to do with politics , with being a member of a particular religion or holding a particular worldview . Good scholarship has to do with providing evidence for your claims and accurately citing works of others that you have used in coming to your conclusions.It is not unreasonable to ask ( demand ) that a reference book on mythology and Paganism and one epically designed for a market obviously so hungry for such a reference provide accurate information based on good research . It is important to look at controversial theories and to work hard to make connections between mythologies and religious practices from around the world . . But the desire to find answers does not excuse the altering of history , the misuse of other 's scholarship and the twisting of language to fit ones political agenda.Ms . Walker loudly accused patriarchal society of altering history of altering religion of engaging in a conspiracy of twisting facts to suit particular its needs . However the fact is that Ms. Walker is happily engaging in all of these activities without so much as batting an eye.Read it , enjoy it but please do n't pretend it is accurate or reflective of history of mythology . If one uses it as a tool to stimulate ones research that is fine but recognize this book is NOT scholarly , it is NOT a reliable reference and should not be used as such .	-1
One of the biggest misconceptions that are out there today is the belief that one and all will be saved . That each person , no matter what the situation or condition , will find salvation and be brought unto the Lord ( whatever Lord they themselves interact with even if they do not realize it even if they are atheists ) . Is this really a concern ? Yes it is because the belief that one and all will be saved is a striking confrontation with the truth that is the Lord that is found in Scripture . So do people really call themselves Christian and say this ? You bet.A book that you can find in most bookstores today is called If Grace is True . This book wants and does try to show that all will be welcomed and find heaven , but they are extremely off base with the truth that is found in the Bible . They say that God will give grace and love to anyone and everyone . Here is a quote from the book that is written by Philip Gulley and James Mulholland . These two men are leaders and workers within the Quaker community , however I will still consider them in the `` Christian Community '' in this case because of the implications and the ideas ( while are false ) being spread by them can be found in most denominations today . This following quote shows not only their lack of understanding of the Bible , but also how they desecrate the very name and nature of the Lord God . These writers say : `` I believe God will save every person ... I mean the whole world ... I mean Muslims , Hindus , Buddhists , Jews , New Agers , pagans ... atheists , agnostics , the apathetic ... rapists , child molesters , and terrorists '' ( 161 ) . Thus no matter who or what you are , no matter how evil or how selfish you are , and we all are because we are all sinners at heart , even if we do follow Jesus , or even if we do n't , this god of theirs they say will save one and all . Heaven is just one happy family that is basically lobotomised in the region of the moral compass . Everything is good , everyone is good , and even the worst rapist and molesters will get a happy pat to the back , at least in this popular , postmodern , but ultimately unBiblical point of view spoken by those like Philip Gulley and James Mulholland . For you see , by there being a specific grace , one must then accept there is a specific holiness within a God and thus this holy God has a omnipotent holy point of view toward right and wrong , good and evil , and from there , heaven and hell.Now this does n't mean that I myself believe that no one can be saved . But remember what Paul says in the Letters , especially the Letter to Rome . We are all sinners . We all fall short of the glory of God . God , who is Love , yes , is also Holy and demands a holiness from His children too . The Law given to Moses speaks on how sinful we are ... we all lust ... we all desire ... we all get angry , get hateful ... some worse than others ... some murder , yes ( such as abortionists , terrorists , etc . ) ... but when we ourselves say `` I hate so-in-so '' we also act in murder . That is why we need Christ Jesus , and that is why only through the blood of the Cross and the resurrection and through Jesus and only through Jesus can we all be saved . If Jesus is not in your life , then you are a footstep to hell . This is not me making a `` fire and brimstone '' threat . Read the Bible . Study the Scriptures . God demanded a perfect sacrifice to be made to bring us the wayward children back to Him ... and we have to believe in Christ to come back to Him.Yes God does want to save each and every one of us , and in fact God did provide a way for everyone even the most wicked to be saved . He wants not just you and I to be saved , but the children in Africa , the elderly in Russia , and the middle aged in Japan . In fact He wants all to be saved so much that He Himself gave the way for all to be saved . That way is Christ Jesus and Christ Jesus alone . Jesus said to you and I the following in John 14:6 : `` ... 'I am the way , the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through Me . ' '' That means that the only way to really know God , have a relationship with God , and be saved to be brought into the Loving presence of God , is through Jesus Christ and all that He did in human history . Not Buddha , not Mohammad , not Nature , not Evolution , but Jesus and only Jesus . Yet as these two gentleman explain , it does n't matter who or what you are , you will be saved no matter what . So many people might consider that to be a nice thought , but if it is , then we will find God to not be who He says He is . In fact , if they were right , then the very nature of this reality would be far more disturbing than it is already due to the Fall and due to false worldviews.The following are several step by step reasons that not everyone will be saved . These are based upon specific study and examination of the truth that is found in Scripture . This does not mean that I think that Christians should be snub , instead I will show what this means-that not all will be saved . You yourselves are welcome to study and to examine the burden of truth that is founded on the reality of the Bible . You yourselves are welcome to see the reasons why I say such things and why I have so much faith in our Scriptures . I hope that this book will help you to become not just a better Christian , but one that is eager to help spread the Gospel far and wide.1st : If Everyone is going to be saved , then God is not Holy : God can not be Holy and bring everyone to Him if everyone is following their own ways and their own ideas and their own thoughts . For you see , only a Holy God can examine and define what is right and what is wrong in this world , in fact , in this universe . A god who would let anyone and anything do as they feel like it , no matter how much pain or suffering it causes , is a god that is lack , that is weak , that is as fleeting to the extend that life and all that there is in life would have not hope . There would not be , if this was how god really was , a clear definition toward right and wrong and reward and punishment , heaven and hell . If writers like Philip Gulley and James Mulholland were correct , then it does n't matter that three thousand plus people died on September 11th . If writers like these two were right , then man who rapes another woman can rape a thousand women because God is not holy and thus God does not care . Yet luckily , God is Holy , that means that in the Bible He does define what is right and what is wrong not in our eyes but in His eyes , as seen in such passages like the Ten Commandments , sermons like the Beatitudes , and many of discussions Paul made in the letters . The Scripture reads the following from Isaiah 6:3 : `` And one cried to another and said : ` Holy , holy , holy is the Lord of hosts ; The whole earth is full of His glory ! ' '' 2nd : If Everyone is going to be saved , then God does not love : If God was saving everyone , then He does not have love within His being , for such a God who would save all no matter what the people did , such a God has no love . That then is contrary to the truth and foundation that is in our Holy Scriptures and within what great thinkers such as Martin Luther and C. S. Lewis has taught . For you see a god who would not care about the actions that you take in life , the roads that you choose , is not a god of love . Such a god would not care about you being rapped , or molested , or beaten up , or killed by a car thief . This kind of god would not notice the times that you tried your best , those times you worked hard and took the extra time to make things better for yourself and for those around you . This kind of god that authors like Gulley and Mulholland does not care about what you do for that god 's kingdom , if that god had a kingdom because such a god could not have a kingdom , only a orgy of conflicting realities to such an extent that if a god could get schizophrenia this god would . However , God does love you , God loves you so much that He does know the good times and the bad times you face , and even more , this God , the true God that is explored in the Bible shows you that He is with you no matter what . Even in your worst nightmares , God is with you to help you through so that you can see the true Grace and Salvation and Love that God has for you . John 3:16 : `` ... For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son , that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life . `` 3rd : If Everyone is going to be saved , then Jesus Christ is a liar : Why would Jesus Christ be a liar , because in all four Gospels and through the Holy Spirit 's interaction with writers such as Paul God clearly defines that it is through Jesus and only through Jesus that one and all can be saved . By coming to Jesus and Him alone , we will find the true road to Heaven . Jesus says again and again He is the Way , He and only He ; but if we listen to people who are like Gulley we are calling our Savior a liar . Even more Jesus preached many sermons that showed that there are two roads in the spirit world , the road through Him to God and the road through the world to Hell . This can be found in such parables as the one about Lazarus and the Rich Man . This is not just a story to scare children , or us , this is a story that is spoken by God through Jesus about the fact and reality that there is indeed a heaven and there is indeed a hell . Time and time again Jesus declared that there was indeed a place that is where people who do not know God and who are not saved will be weeping and gnashing their teeth in flaming pain . For you see Jesus was not a liar in fact Jesus was , is , and always will be the Son of God . As John 3:17 continues where the last Scripture reading left off : `` For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through Him might be saved . '' That is , through Jesus , and it is only through Jesus that the people of this world can be saved and brought into eternal life with God.4rd If Everyone is going to be saved , then the Cross was useless : Oh such writers as Philip Gulley speaks that the cross meant love , and that is true , but if everyone is going to be saved anyway , then the cross was not and is not important , or meaningful , or real . In fact if we are to believe what these and other writers say , then we can just delete from the Old Testament the symbolism of the sacrifices which were to get the Jewish people ready for Jesus and then delete from the New Testament most of Gospels because throughout all the Gospels Jesus spoke that He must take on the cross because that is what His Father , our God , wants . For you see , on the contrary to what these and many other theologians speak , the cross was indeed what it was meant to be . On the cross , Jesus took the blunt of all the sins you and I and countless people across the ages have done . We are told that we too will be bearing the Cross for Jesus and for our own selves . The cross is where we will meet and where we will find the true door to the eternal love of God . And it does n't matter who , as long as it is through Jesus . From the smallest lie to the greatest of evils like Hitler 's Jewish Holocaust , God made His Son drink from the cup of our sins and His wrath because , again God , the real God , is a Holy God who does not like sin , in fact He loathes sin and its corrupting nature . Jesus took on the Cross and Mankind 's sins because it is to be through Him and Him alone that we are saved from sin 's natural road to Hell and damnation . The Bible says in Galatians 6:14 `` But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world . For in Christ Jesus ... a new creation . '' We are new creations through Jesus ' sacrifice on the Cross , our old ways , those old tattered clothes we wore as sinners , are taken off of us and new clothes , the clothes of righteousness is put upon us . The Cross makes each and every one of us a new creation if we accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.5th If Everyone is going to be saved , then Jesus would not have given the Great Commission : The Great Commission found at the end of the Gospels after the resurrection speaks of God 's commanding desire that we as Christians spread the true word and good news of God through Christ throughout the world . If all religions , if all no matter what are to be saved and brought into God 's heaven , then it does n't really matter what you believe about Jesus and about God and about the Holy Spirit . You do not have to go out and spread the Gospel , you do not have to go out and help at homeless shelters in order to show God 's love , you do not have to give money to missionaries to help bring the freedom of Christ to those who do not have Him . The Great Commission is yet another lie as well as all that God through Jesus has said to the world . Luckily , God through Jesus made it very clear to you and I who do know God through Jesus that we have a responsibility to do our best to make sure that Jesus ' ability to free will be spread to whomever whenever the time ( on God 's time table ) is right . The Great Commission , as will be talked about as you read this book , is this , learn it live it . Matthew 28:18-20 : `` And Jesus came and spoke to them saying , ` All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth . Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you ; and lo , I am with you always even to the end of the age . ' Amen . '' You see ? God commands us out of love for us and for all people that we as Christians preach the good news of God as the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit , so that all can be saved if they place their hearts and minds and souls into the hands of God through Christ Jesus.6th If Everyone is going to be saved , then all the prophecies of the Old and New Testament are lies from God : The prophecies of the Old and New Testament speaks that there will be a day that God shows it bright and clear that not only He is in control but that He sees the sins of the small to the great , the poor to the most wealthy . Thus those who do not have Jesus will know , especially at the end of the ages , what will be called in the Book of Revelation the Great Tribulation . Even Jesus ' prophecies that He told His disciples and us who read the Gospels are false , are wasted , and should not be paid attention to . Though I said I would not preach hellfire and brimstone I will tell you my brothers and sisters in the name of our Lord God and Savior that there will come a day that those who do not have Jesus in their lives , those who rebel against the Lord , and those who willingly persecute Christians and Jews and others will face judgment . This judgment is one that is final and sure . The judgment can be found in the Book of Revelation 20:11-15 : `` Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and heaven fled away . And there was found no place for them . And I saw the dead , small and great , standing before God , and books were opened . And another book was opened , which is the Book of Life . And the dead were judged according to their works , by the things which were written in the books . The sea gave up the dead who were in it , and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them . And they were judged , each one according to his works . Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire . This is the second death . And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire . `` Thus the very nature of a god that is like the one worshiped and believed in by people such as Philip Gulley and James Mulholland is a very frightening nature . This god does not care what you do or how you do in this lifetime that you have been given . You can do whatever you want , whether it is for good or ill , because it does not matter . As such this god will treat you like `` oh you are all loved by me '' as these authors and many more like them say , but that is not true because this god really would not care a thing about you or what is right or wrong about your nature . Like I said , for this god , it does not matter . It is a meaningless consideration . Even more so , this god would not be holy , this god would just be there , like a person on your television screen , and just as two dimensional . This god can not be holy because the very nature of holiness means that the god would see specifically measuring by himself what is good and what is bad . To this god , again , it does not mean a thing . Even more , the grace that this kind of god offers to one and all would be about as cheap as a man buying a wedding ring for his hopeful wife at a vending machine that charges 25 cents . In other words , the grace that this god that is said to be offered by the authors I have examined would be a hollow and pointless grace because it does not answer the questions of our hearts and the actions by us through life . This kind of grace is superficial and meaningless at the very least , at the very worst , it is a slap in the face toward all of us who have struggled in the race of life-those of us who have been raped , abused , those of us who have lost loved ones in school shootings and in robberies . This kind of grace the authors insist is the kind of grace that is really not grace at all , its just fluff from a pillow.This is not meant to scare you in the sense that I am trying to make one and all feel guilty while reading this book . Instead I want this to warn you and inspire you to go out and make a difference in someone or someones life . Bring them to Christ through loving witnessing . I hope that this book will help you with that . I want this book to help you on several levels . I want it to tell you the truth , the Biblical truth that is God our Father and His Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit that inspires the Believers ' Church . I want this book to let you know what worldviews and world beliefs are out there that will try to challenge you and trip you up . Lastly I want and hope and pray that this book praises God sufficiently . I hope that this book will bring honor to my Lord God and Master Jesus Christ.What you need to understand is that God offers salvation to every single person in the world . No matter what sex that person is , no matter what ethnic background that person is , God came into history as Jesus Christ so that all will be saved . Yet the way to gain that grace and salvation is by recognizing that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior . God does not accept any other worldview or world religion . The way the only was is by Jesus . So for those who do not know Jesus , two things come to mind from scripture . First is , we have got to go out and bring Jesus ' message to these people . We have got to spread the Great Commission no matter where it needs to be brought to . Secondly , God will judge all who have not received God through Jesus by the situation of their life and how well they follow the seed of God that is planted in everyone 's heart . This judgment might seem harsh toward those who have not specifically known God through Christ Jesus but really it is n't . For you see , the Scriptures say that God has planted Himself in the hearts of every man woman and child . By our deeds we will be judged as to whether we have followed this seed that was planted in us . This does not mean that none will be saved nor does it mean all will be saved . Instead it means that our Holy and Just and Graceful God will judge those who does not know Him through Christ and weigh those people each separately and each specifically.This review was written because I know so many people want and wish that all can be saved . Yet the Bible strictly says that this is not so . Not all will be saved , only those who have been brought to the Lord through Jesus Christ . So what does this mean about those people in the world who DO N'T know Jesus ? Simple ! GO OUT AND FIND THEM . Bring them to Christ , use love , use Biblical teachings , if you ca n't go , give money and prayers to those who can . Make a difference . Whatever money you give to a missionary could help bring one to many souls to Christ Jesus and thus to Salvation . Bring the Gift of not only life but eternal life to those out there who are trapped in the worldviews of Buddhism , Wicca , Hinduism , and the New Age movement , along with those who are atheists , those who are rapists , those who are apathetic , and those who just do n't understand . Hold that candle high and let it shine , let the Holy Spirit truly minister to you and from you to those you encounter in your life . Make a difference !	-1
This book should not be listed among 'Christian ' books as it is clearly not of Christ . The theology of the book stems not even from Quakerism but of Universalism which teaches that God will save all men , even the devil himself at the end of time . Madeline L'Engel and authors like this have fashioned for themselves a happy , grandfather-in-the-sky who only wants all men to have a good time and feel good about themselves while they are doing whatever it is that pleases them.According to this controversial book , Jesus ' teaching on hell is essentially 'fire-and-brimstone fundamentalist doctrine ' fit for the crap pile . It is sad to think that they are searching for the God who is made in their own image rather than the one revealed in the Bible and the Torah . This book is not original as men have always hated God and His Perfect Mediator .	-1
Unintellectual . The entire book is one big red herring . Their exegesis is inconsistent .	-1
I was given some insight while reaing this book . I do n't agree with everything in here , but no one is going to be completely satisfied with everything . I do not like the format or the '' beatin around the bush '' persay . I felt there was a lot of babbling and many tims when I thought I was getting somewhere she goes on to say ... Later on in coming chapters ... that is annoying . If I am on the subject now I want the meat and potatoes now , not later . She looses me a few times in each chapter with a lot of useless information I believe . The other thing is this book is reallygeared towards people who have relationships with people with many issues . I am in fact codependent , but I need a book for codependents who are n't enabling an alcoholic or sex addict , drug abuser , etc . etc . I did n't quite get that from this book . I will say it was a goo staring point and did put me in the right direction to finding out what many of my issues are and gave it a name so I may do further research on my own ... mybe I 'll write my own book on codependency .	-1
To begin , I bought this book because I wanted to understand what codependent actually meant , seems everyone has a different notion as you will see if you buy this CD . Author bores you with every one of her colleagues definitions of co-dependant , which vary greatly so by the end of the first disc you are prepared to accept that every single person that ever lived is codependent . `` You are co-dependant if you like to drink water , if you hate to drink water , if you have trouble sleeping , if you sleep too much ... : COME ON ! It was laughable at times . SOOOO Long , SOOOOO many twists and turns and qualifications and re-qualifications and anecdotes Very little substance . From the start I wondered who I might give it to when I had finished but wait..I cant do that , that is codependent behaviour , sharing anything with anyone is codependent , as is being selfish ! Book is tailored toward alcoholics and really could have been edited to half the length . SNORE !	-1
instead , I checked it out at my local library . It wasDEPRESSING ( unnecessarily ) ! She said in 200 pages what could have been said in 50 . Most of the ideas were repeated . If one is reading that book , they must have a pretty good idea they are co-dependent . Instead , she gives multiple check lists , vignettes , definitions . She never turns it around postively so you can benefit from the grueling experience ( of reading her book ) . She also `` talks down '' to the reader , referring to herself frequently as a `` professional . '' There are many professions in the world , many highly educated who are co-dependent .	-1
Co-dependent No More : How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself must be considered the bible of the Co-dependent cult . In addition , Melody Beattie , by default , must be the empress of the same . The problem is that this empress is walking around in the nude and no one has the courage to tell her that the magic co-dependent garments she is dressed in and is recommending to you are not really there . She has had a con pulled on her , and it is time for her to see it for what it is.Co-dependent Disorder is not a real emotional disorder never was and never will be- at best the construct is the mad rant and raving of on the wagon substance abusers who have fried their brain cells with drugs and/or boiled them in alcohol and are now trying to tell you how to live your life . Do they really have the answer for your life ; I can not see how they could.To be fair Ms. Beattie is not holding herself out as a mental health professional nevertheless , her book and the others like it are attempting to treat a made-up emotional disorder , which can be very dangerous to the unsuspecting public . The truth is that members of the co-dependent sect hold mental health professionals in very low esteem , which may be because mental health professionals have never embraced the co-dependent construct as a real disorder . I have even read in more than one of the co-dependent cookbooks that mental health professionals do not believe that co-dependent disorder is real due to the fact that they are co-dependent . This is about as dumb a statement as was ever made . Such a statement is akin to saying that people who do not believe in ghost are ghost.Please do not get me wrong ; Im not saying to not read this book . Please do . It is fairly well written and can give you a lot of laughs if you do not take it too seriously . However , keep your eyes open and your mind in gear.Rick Goodner , Author of `` Co-dependent ... What a Bore and Other Clinical Observations ''	-1
I wanted to like this book . But I hated it.First , the writing . If you do n't mind 20-year-old war stories , assiduous name-dropping , and a pedantic , freshman-comp style ( say the concept , tell a long story to pad the ol ' word count , move to next point ) ... well , you should be fine.Second , it 's really a philosophy book with no application . The philosophy is why I bought it , because I *did* want to learn more about the idea that exercise should involve being aware of one 's body , one 's surroundings , etc . But it is way too heavy on that . What I mean is , it 's really deep and squishy & # 8212 ; like a bog & # 8212 ; on the idea side , with very little of how to actually do it . Although I should mention there 's TONS of stories about this guy running with someone here , running with someone there , etc.The guy apparently got his big break when Tony Robbins plucked him out of obscurity and put him up on the stage with him . It is frankly not terribly hard to get rich and famous when you 're traveling with Tony Robbins ... even if it was 20 years ago .	-1
This really doesnt hit our level of academics that we require for our children . First if your looking at this as a newberry award winning historical fiction then look for something else . For one you get to the end and the author so much admits because he didnt really put the skin into researching it that lets just call it a `` historical fantasy '' . So you get through the book ( and its not easy ) I found myself counting pages begging the chapter to end . It just was just SO boring . So many really interesting things happened in the turn of the century and this book hits on hardly any of them . What it does hit on is that Opium is OK if you do it once in a while . Rice wine is so tasty and makes you feel so tingly ... .graphic scenes and discrimination that the author could not factually document but sounded good in the 1970 's where race relations were really strained . Too bad Yepp just didnt realistically portray the guy he said inspired his book ... .but thats OK most kids today have no knowledge of history and most parents today could careless if the books they read push drugs and alcohol ... to some this is a great piece of work ... to others who can read more prolific works pick up a GA Henty and soar !	-1
I hated this book , and it 's a classic . Sue me.Now do n't think it 's because I 'm too old and cynical . I read this book at the age of about nine , and I still hated it . Why ? Because Sara Crewe is the Original Mary Sue . She was so sweet and speshul and wonderful and flawless that she made me gag . She never does anything wrong , anyone who does n't like her is TEH EVOL ! ! ! 11 ! ! , and everyone else thinks she 's the best thing since silk stockings . Even at such a young age I was revolted by this one-dimensional character who was obviously being held up for our adulation . And I do n't give a damn about it being an old novel . It still blows chunks .	-1
The reviewers can rave about Block 's magical prose all they like , but I just did n't like the book . Maybe I 'm just too long past my teens , but I found no warmth in the relationships here . It all seems to be trying too hard . Providing fiction for different readers should n't mean we have to pander .	-1
I 'd love to be able to review the book but , it never arrived . I learned my lesson . I wo n't do business with this seller again .	-1
This is the fictional version of Jones ' Tough Guide to Fantasyland . I enjoyed that book . Not this one , though . It is over 500 pages of sadism which , apparently , is supposed to be funny . It is not.I absolutely would not allow a child to read it and I would be suspicious of any adult who enjoyed it .	-1
Evvie , the protagonist in Jane McCafferty 's novel First You Try Everything , learns the hard way that you can not force love . When her marriage crumbles , she eventually tries what was described as a `` . . . harebrained and dangerous scheme . . . `` to try to win back her estranged husband . It is a real stretch of disbelief that any such scheme could exist . But even if you could swallow that , the author brings the reader along on Evvie 's journey in a disjointed and off-putting manner that distances the reader from Evvie and the other main character , her husband Ben , long before the denouement of the scheme . And after that , the author fast forwards four years , to a disappointing ending . I did n't hate this book , but I did not enjoy it .	-1
Autumn of The Moguls , Michael Wolff ; HarperCollins ( Hardcover 2003 ) Contents : Self-indulgent , meandering , & pointless observations about the American media & its top-ranking yo-yos in the year 2003 . A few splendid bon mots & good , solid ideas are buried in a compost heap of nitwit media business jargon.It 's not surprising that ATM sold poorly ( the book 's acronym belies the publisher 's returns ) . Wolff & others ( say , Thomas Maier , author of a 1994 train wreck , the biography `` Newhouse '' ) have attributed their past publishing failures to any number of self-consoling reasons - none of which specify the obvious : their books were very badly written . ( In fairness , I should add that of the two books , ATM is the far lesser of the two evils . There are faint but irrefutable indications that Wolff 's editor had actually looked at & did some work on the manuscript before it was published . But not much . ) 2007 : ATM was pulped , to make room for new Lyrical Ballad acquisitions ( an act of joy , not regret ) .Checking for tucked-away mementos , on p. 211 , I re-read the following : '' Consultants have become very big in THE MEDIA BUSINESS not least of all because so many people have gone into THE MEDIA BUSINESS who know nothing about THE MEDIA BUSINESS & so many MEDIA BUSINESSES have bought other parts of the MEDIA BUSINESS that have no relation to the specific skill sets ... '' ( Capitalized for emphasis . The final thirty-three words of Wolff 's interminable ooze are unprintable . I do n't want to type them . ) Did I really read 210 pages of this madness ? I can scarcely believe it.Post Note ( 03/02/13 ) - From `` Nowhere Man 's '' superb review of Stefan Zweig 's `` The World of Yesterday : An Autobiography '' ( dated May 10 , 2012 , see ) : The Austrian Stefan Zweig ( 1881-1942 ) `` really does come off as Europe 's first fanboy - each chapter may as well be titled 'Look at Me Hanging Around With ... ' - & his clodhopping prose is frequently insufferable . The first two-hundred pages read like the diary of a deadly dull autograph collector & expose the fundamental second-rate quality of Zweig 's artistic intelligence . `` My post , to him : `` I just realized with a start that the exact same author is still among us . His name is Michael Wolff ; see my review of 'Autumn of The Moguls ' ( 2003 ) , a now-mercifully forgotten 'book ' ( it had a binding ) which , by complete coincidence , I posted only a few days ago , using material that I had saved from years ago ...

Mathematicians should like this book , not economists . The text focuses on mathematic theory , not on calculations and economic applications . This text is not good for applied economics or business .	-1
I find it very difficult to leave poor reviews on books . I give credit to any author who can start , finish , and publish a work , something I have not yet done myself . However , from the perspective of a reader and technical analyst , I just did n't get much out of this book . In fact , as my review title suggests , there were several times I found myself saying aloud , `` What is she talking about ? `` .I read this for the CMT level three exam , and if it had not been required reading I would not have finished it . Actually , I really just skimmed through the last half . After she started going into astronomy and planets ' retrograde movement in chapter nine , I was emotionally finished with this book . It is a perfect example for why technical analysis is still looked down upon by many in the finance industry as tantamount to voodoo . She takes an already esoteric discipline and makes it a lot more complicated than it needs to be . The goal of TA is simply to give a trader a way to identify higher probability entry and exit points , and there are much simpler ways to accomplish this than the tools found in this book.Pros:1 . The author is obviously very intelligent , and I 'm sure is a fantastic analyst and trader . If she understands and can apply everything she writes about , more power to her.2 . She tries to look at TA in unique ways and develop new rules and applications . The range rules for oscillators like the RSI early in the book were beneficial.Cons:1 . I did not feel she explained how to apply the complex concepts well and assumed the reader had the same knowledge base as her . I 'm no novice and was able to follow along with a lot of work on my part , but she is still introducing new rules , concepts , and methods that she has developed or identified so those need to be explained more thoroughly since they are not exactly a part of the traditional TA `` dogma '' . I also thought the writing was poor at times and included too many non sequiturs that seemed out of place in a professional work . Like I said , there were many times I was left wondering what she was talking about or why she decided to mention something , and I do n't mean this from a comprehension or understanding standpoint . The topics just seemed out of place.2 . Poor charts that were placed horribly in the book . The ones included were often cluttered with way too much going on for such a small chart . I understand there are space limitations but other books have made it work . There were also way too few current charts . It 's great that a concept worked in the one chart the reader is shown from back in 1996 , but I would have liked to see evidence that these concepts can still be applied in the current markets . She would also refer to the same chart for pages at a time so I had to keep flipping back and forth every sentence . If ever there was a book that would benefit from a Kindle edition with hyperlinks , it 's this one.3 . Like most Elliot Wave practitioners , she spoke too often in definites , making the subjects seem like they work every single time and followed strict rules . TA is not mathematics . 2 + 2 is not always 4 every single time.4 . Way too often she introduced concepts , but did n't explain them until later in the book . This got very annoying.If you must read this book for the CMT , I hope you get more out of it than I did . If you are just interested in expanding your technical analysis knowledge , be forewarned that at times the author may sound like she 's about to read your horoscope to predict the grains markets .	-1
This book was recommended to me as the bible of active management . I attempted reading it several times , but gave up everytime . Coming from a science and engineering background , I find the exposition verbose , yet lacking a ground-up derive-from-fundamentals approach . Even in the description of CAPM , I can not tell the assumptions from the conclusions of the theory . The book is not an easy read , but I do n't think that 's because the subject is inherently hard .	-1
Based on some of the other reviews , I was looking for a bit more insight on the concept of storytelling . Much of what is covered in this book is information covered in other books on Storytelling . Nevertheless , if you want an introduction to the storytelling as a better way to communicated this book is fine as a first read .	-1
Waste of money getting this on Kindle . I ca n't read it on my Kindle , my Kindle for iPhone , or online at cloud.kindle.com on my PC ! The book only works on my Kindle for iPad ( probably , I would hope the Kindle Fire too but I dont have one to test ) . The landscape and usability is horrid.Aside from that the book is easy to read , quite biased , but who is n't expecting that when getting a text book these days .	-1
I was amazed at how a book full of nothing new could be sold as if it contains some secret knowledge that only the initiated could comprehend ( you know , like that Kung Fu martial arts stuff ... take the pebble grasshopper ) .What it comes down to is an organized approach to identifying , measuring , and improving business processes . This is something I imagine has been going on long before anyone called it `` Six Sigma '' .So , if you must have this book how about cutting the cost of acquisition to three bucks or so plus shipping and get a used copy to see if this is for you .	-1
Please read the other reviews warning you about the content of this book . I did not believe them , they were right . Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett are the two people I have modeled my investment style by . ( Which has enabled me to return 24 % over the past 4 years ) . How could I not read this book based on the title ? While Cunningham did an outstanding job compiling the essays of Warren Buffett , this book was incredibly tedious and I do not think captured either of the great men 's thoughts . This book is 5 % Graham , 5 % Buffett and 90 % the author . He is a law professor if that gives you an idea of the writing style.This book droned on for 40 pages about corporate governance , you had to read for hours to stumble on to a nugget of Graham and Buffett . Save yourself the trouble and buy Cunningham 's other book `` The essays of Warren Buffett '' he did an excellent job compiling that book.It is actually the book Warren Buffett told CNBC viewers to read to get his real investing style . Also read Benjamin Graham 's books start with `` The Intelligent Investor '' . Or buy Janet Lowe 's book `` The rediscovered Benjamin Graham selected writings of the Wall Street legend '' This book 's title should have been `` How to think like Professor Cunningham 's students and invest like a teacher '' .	-1
This book was a disappointment.After having excellent experiences with other books this book came across as disorganized and not useful for a learning journey . The concept , the cover and the hype are good . The execution is poor.This is not a `` guide '' to better reading as such , there are no reading tips and no section introductions to indicate what the author is aiming for the learner to achieve . The book does not have a vocabulary glossary , the readings are not well graded , and the exercises include tasks indirectly related to the reading on translation and grammar ( and not reading comprehension ) . The readings are decontextualized in that no visual clues are provided , exercises are in the same format as the reading , and there is no indication of who authored the readings or from where the readings have been extracted . The author encourages the reader to select topics of interest ; therefore the author does not envision a skill journey for the learner . The skill exercises do not build towards a cohesive skill set . It grates that the exercises and introductions are in English and not French , so there is no sense of immersion which I have enjoyed with other books.Instead of a book designed for learning , you get the sense that this book has been produced by an experienced French teacher who has accumulated a considerable collection of learning materials over the years , and then decided to publish these in a loosely organized fashion . This book may in fact be an excellent resource for teachers of French.A more useful approach might have been to include a complete lexicon of terms for particular topics at the start of each topic . But instead this book includes vocabulary exercises that come after the reading , and the vocabulary is not presented in a consistent or comprehensive manner.Instead of persevering with this book , I will use other books to supplement my part-time coursework and will use French internet-based newspapers to achieve what I had hoped to achieve with this book.Books that I have found very useful so far and which I would recommend areEasy French ReaderandBeginner 's French Readerfor improving reading in French , andThe Ultimate French Verb Review and Practice ( The Ultimate Verb Review and Practice Series ) for improving vocabulary and grammar .	-1
This book was depressing . The mother is irritating , overbearing , and paranoid , obsessed with finding a label for her son and constantly disgusted by him . It has no happy ending , it has not good lesson other than you should never never never do anything this mother did . I cried after reading this book , wondering if this was the future for my son . Depressing , profane , and not at all what I needed after learning my son 's diagnosis .	-1
This is the lousiest TY book I 've seen . If you like to learn things parrot fashion then this book may help you a little bit , but if you 're an intelligent curious adult ( that 's the usual reader of TY books ) then this book is USELESS . Things are thrown at your face from the word go without any explanation at all . There are virtually no grammar notes . It 's the first TY book that does n't even list the present tense of the verb to `` BE , '' an important verb in Welsh at the beginning ; You have to wait until lesson 4 . There are differences between written and spoken Welsh ; this is not mentioned here ; there are differences between Northern and Southern Welsh ; this is not mentioned here either . The glossary at the end of the book is a big joke : it does n't even list words used in the dialogues . Try to look for the words for `` he '' or `` she '' there . The exercises are rather idiotic : after telling you the forms for `` good morning , evening , afternoon '' the author gives you a long exercise asking you what you 'd say at 1pm , 3pm , 4pm ... . In dialogue 1 of unit 1 there 's a sentence `` Peidiwch bod yn nerfus '' translated as `` Do n't be nervous '' . You can clearly see that it 's a totally different structure . Nothing is mentioned about it . No even to say that it 'd be discussed later.I 'd suggest you 'd try to buy an older version of TY Welsh by another author ( Rhys Jones ) , which is not modernish but at least it 's better designed . Julie Brake and Christine Jones , according to the back cover , teach Welsh in Wales . I pity their poor unlucky students and doubt they 'll ever learn something from these lousy teachers .	-1
I was reading this book and it kept going against the grain in how one should really invest . Maybe this book will be good if you want to spend all your time day trading with little to no returns . I was very disappointed in this book 's inability to look beyond what a stock really is - a real company . No where did I find any mention of researching the company that is the stock . A chart will not tell you if a company has good , strong financials or if management is good . You could avoid of a lot of losses before investing by putting some time into what a company is .	-1
It was a waste of my money . The questions were all ones I 've heard about so many other times , and the format of the questions was n't fun or even very interesting ...	-1
This was not quite what I was looking for , although some decent points were made . I did feel like I wanted my money back , even though it was worth skimming through . Overall , I was bored with the tired anecdotes where the author tried to explain logic by shooting down his own pet peeves . Sure , there were some good points here , but if you 're looking for a solid , comprehensive summary of logic , this is not that book . Sophomoric .	-1
Unfortunately , I did not like this book . I found it difficult to read and boring , even though it was recommended by a friend..	-1
First , it must be said that the Schaum Outline series provides an inexpensive way for students to get more practice and check their answers . In general , I recommend these texts . That said , I used this as a supplement to a DE class I taught and it was such a pain . The notation is nonstandard , symbols for Bessel functions are downright wrong and things like this . The application exercises were more focused on converting from English units to SI units than on the variety of application problems . To add to the fun , the cgs system is also thrown into the mix . Granted , engineers and the like need to be able to switch , but that 's not the point of a DE class . It is nice to have sections on the Laplace transform and first-order systems and most exercises are ok , if repetitive . Students will have to work hard to keep the notation straight and not confuse themselves . I would n't use this in another class .	-1
Lets take the case of the 15 rental properties for 90k . Each one purchased with 10 % of the 90k , or 9k . So the purchase price of EACH home is 90k and now has a mortgage of 81k . Assuing 6.25 % interest this is a payment of ~ $ 480 per month that she can rent out at $ 680 to get positive cash flow of $ 200 . q1 ) Where can you purchase 15 homes for under $ 100k ? not in DC , NYC , Phili , unless you are buying way in the ghetto.there is no allowance for closing costs ( at least $ 2000 per deal , or $ 30k in her case ) I think she tells people that they need to activley do things with their money- and I agree with that . So if you want to send me 1/2 the price of her book for it I would be appriciative . Otherwise , skip this and get a good stock market book so you can learn how to invest and make the amount it would take to really put down on a good piece of real estate .	-1
This book is great if you are new to content writing or need a quick go to on your desk . Honestly though I wish I would n't have wasted my money . This book does n't have anything that is n't already available for free by a simple google search . If you want a physical printed book to keep at your desk , I would say get this . But if you are like most people , a google search is just as easy and it is free .	-1
I bought the Kindle version with the expectation that someone new to copy writing could learn something from the book . I am hugely disappointed . The crash course on copy writing is bare bones and general to the point of useless.Here 's step 1 in what the book says about 'Before You Write ' . `` Gain first hand knowledge of your product or service . Do a little research to get your facts straight . Get your data from current sources of information ( marketing fact sheets , product managers , recent copy ) .If it is the kind of product you can hold in your hands ( or read , or taste , or listen to ) , go right ahead . Live with it for a while and get a feel of it . Then look at the product or service as if you were the customer . What features and benefits would attract you as a prospective customer ? `` That 's it . I was hoping for something a little more beyond the obvious.The rest of the book is a list of descriptive words and phrases . Under teasers , it includes phrases like , 'Free ' , 'Absolutely Free ' , 'As seen on TV ' and 'prices slashed ! '.You do n't need the book for these phrases . Turn on the TV and sit down with a notepad and the next five minute block of commercials . You 'll get all these phrases and more for `` FREE '' .	-1
This book promised from the exerpts to be an interesting book about a man 's awakening , but it turned out to be a christian book which was more preaching than journeying . A real dissapointment .	-1
i was attracted to the premise of the book : a high flyer 's tumble into insurmountable tragedy/ realizations catalyzed by one 's impending mortality . but i was severely short-changed . this book gave me none of those things . it does not deserve to be called a memoir because i learnt nothing about the author 's family , upbringing or reflections on his personal journey . the book was co-authored or ghost-written by a developmental editor hired by kpmg , the author 's employer , which figures . this book should have been titled 'a salary man 's forced retirement : a glossed corporate overview ' . there are plenty other cancer journals and memoirs available for a lower price . this one does not enlighten at all , which is a pity .	-1
I should have known better than to buy a real estate book that was published in 2006 . This book was obviously written right at the absolute peak of the real estate market and the author 's experience and examples are from 2002-2005 , which were arguably the best times in history to be in real estate . If you 're picking up this book today , you 'll immediately see a lot of advice that just does n't make sense in today 's economy and real estate market.That is n't to say there is n't any good information in the book , because there is . Some of the advice surrounding being a property investor and landlord still apply today , and many of the basic tactics involved in analyzing markets and buying properties remain true . But aside from this information you 're more or less reading about the experience of someone who made it big during the best boom years in real estate by using a lot of leverage and taking advantage of incredible short-term appreciation to amass his wealth . If you tried to mimic everything in the book today , you 'd be nowhere near as successful . These days you do n't go out and buy a property with little money down , realize 10-20 % equity gains in a single year and then tap into that equity to finance your next deal , and so on.This book is mainly trying to sell the dream . Just based on the title alone you can tell it was marketed toward people at the peak of the real estate boom and wanted to quit their job and get rich just buying up property . That 's still the dream of many today , but this book wo n't give you all the answers to accomplish that in today 's economy . I 'd suggest a more recent book if you want to get a better idea of what it takes to make it in the business these days . Probably the best book out there isInvesting in Real Estate , which I also just finished reading .	-1
A resource called `` Streetwise Mandarin '' focusing on slang and colloquial expressions should be oriented to teaching spoken Chinese . The text , however , is in Chinese characters and English , with no pinyin ; only the vocabulary lists include pinyin.I am learning spoken Chinese and am not studying written Chinese . I really need a resource focusing on slang and colloquial expressions , but '' Streetwise Mandarin '' is useless for me .	-1
This book would be a wonderful way to learn or improve one 's spoken Italian if purchased in hard copy . As an e-book , however , it needs some work . This is more a short-coming of Kindle than the book itself -- certainly not the author.The main problem is that words and phrases listed to exemplify the subject in each chapter are barely legible . Written in tiny , italicized text , they do not enlarge as you change the font size on the Kindle page.I like the approach to teaching Italian here , and I still expect to get something from this book -- but I hope those who produced it in Kindle format correct this problem . Until they do , I ca n't recommend this version of an otherwise fine book .	-1
There were a couple of Lance stories I had n't heard before , but , overall , it was n't a good Lance book nor did it impress me as a motivational tool . Save your money : re-read It 's Not About the Bike . It 's better written , tells a better Lance story and is a darn sight more motivational .	-1
This is a book that tells you what to do but not how to do it ! Two paragraphs on scene and no mention of sequel does n't cut it . I think this was written to give himself a tax write off because it does n't appear to do anything else .	-1
I have n't seen one review explaining how this is going to help lower health care costs . There 's only mention of all kinds of grants , subsidies , means-test , and consumer driven methods . How is an individual person supposed to negotiate or `` get '' a better rate than what a corporation can negotiate ? Does n't make sense . How is this going to combat overpriced drugs , hospitals , physicians , middle men ? The profit motive is still there for the insurers in any case . Seems like a bunch of complicated mumbo jumbo that appeals to `` do it yourself '' and `` yippie for capitalism '' jingoists . A book worth reading is A Second Opinion : Rescuing America 's Health Care by Dr. Arnold Relman . Once we stop fearing the rest of the world and drop our arrogance , that will be the day we can finally find peace .	-1
I picked up this book because although I have been blogging for a little over two years , I 'm always looking for ways to bump up the revenue potential of my site . Based on the title this book sounded perfect to help me out with this , however in actuality , it was not that useful.The book is broken down into chapters on things like advertising networks , seo , rss , etc . In this sense , it has all the topics that you would expect from a book on making money from blogging ( including the expected chapters on setting up a blog for those just getting started ) . The problem is that although all the expected topics are here , they are not covered in great detail . What 's more , what is here is mostly intuitive or common sense . Thus , while the book serves as an okay introduction to these topics , I walked away feeling like I needed to read more books rather than have all the answers.In general , I think this book could serve as an okay introduction as long as you expect that you will have to read further books as follow up . If you walk into this expecting to find all the answers you will be severely disapointed . I could see this being slightly more valuable to someone who has no blogging knowledge whatsoever . However , if you have even a little bit you will likely find that you 've found better answers either online or in other books for free . ( ProBlogger : Secrets for Blogging Your Way to a Six-Figure Income , for example , is a much better alternative . They offer up a lot of the same information , but with much more depth and fewer obvious solutions . ) Overall , I would not recommend this book unless you are incredibly new to blogging and know nothing about online advertising and seo . If you already have a little bit of knowledge you are better off reading the title I suggested above , or reading blogs about blogging to find advice .	-1
I purchased the kindle version ( convenience ) and the paperback and was surprised to find the kindle version had too many errors that were not in the paperback version . The errors make it difficult to follow the arguments with missing or plain ol ' incorrect information . In addition , on the kindle version entire sections ( parts of answers ) suddenly changed into a smaller font that could not be expanded . It all appears to be errors in translating or moving to an e-book version of this text . It makes it almost impossible to see the problems worked out . ( That is what we buy Schaum 's outline for ! ) Miserable editing job ! ! I have decided to abandon trying to use the kindle version . I do not recommend anyone purchase that version until they correct the numerous errors . Note , I gave up after Chapter 1 since it was just too painful . The topic is difficult enough and with the kindle version it will be impossible .	-1
The book says `` this is not a diet '' well ... not only is it a DIET , it is one of the most strict and confusing diets I 've ever attempted . I simply did not have the time to eat the specific foods on the specific days at the specific times that this diet book recommends ... .life is short , I do n't want to spend it doing this ... .	-1
`` Economic Experience '' discusses various aspects of the financial system over the period 1966-1976 : bank failures , bailouts , new financial instruments , and variations in the fiscal balance of the household , government , and business sectors . Most of the value of the book is contained here . `` Economic Theory '' outlines Minsky 's model of the economy ; `` Institutional Dynamics '' includes a summary of the three phases of financial cycles , and `` Policy '' includes his recommendations . `` Economic Experience '' includes some good observations but suffers from the dire organization of the rest of the book . He makes some valuable points about how banks actually behave , but his efforts to show a `` conservation of debt '' ( i.e. , fluctuations in the deficit by one sector offset by opposing fluctuations in the other sectors ) is unconvincing.His section on economic theory is not very useful at all . He attempts to describe an abstract economy in which there is labor and capital ; labor receives wages , and capital receives profits . Additional refinements permit ingenious ( but unhelpful ) algebraic manipulations -- line items of national accounts that behave a bit like squishy bricks in a wall made of Jell-O ( 1 ) . The problem with these equations that Minsky fiddles with is that they do n't represent anything real . Minsky 's equations are actually flow-charts that supposedly demonstrate how the purchase prices of goods translate into the predictive components of the economy , such as profits , government deficits , consumption , and so on . These then determine the next phase of production , consumption , investment , and onward . But production processes have multiple phases , blurring the distinction between investment and consumption , and between profits in different `` production periods . `` The section on `` Institutional Dynamics '' explains the evolution of a business cycle subject to different phases of borrowing . During the early phase of an economic recovery , most borrowing is `` hedge financing , '' in which borrowers are capable of meeting interest and principal payments on their loans out of current income . Later , `` speculative finance '' becomes more commonplace -- borrowers often can only pay interest on their loans and frequently need to roll over debt so as to avoid paying down the principal . `` Ponzi finance '' later overtakes `` speculative '' borrowing , as business managers plan against a huge future payout , and are unable to pay even interest payments out of current income . When Ponzi financing becomes prevalent , then asset prices are driven to unrealistic levels and a financial collapse is inescapable . `` Policy '' consists of recommendations by Minsky ; I thought these were terrible recommendations , but other readers may disagree , and I do n't see any point discussing them here.The problems in the book are legion , although most are n't fatal . One is with this particular edition , edited by Dimitri P. Papadimitriou & L. Randall Wray ; it contains many errors , e.g , inconsistent notation in the equations , repetition , and needless qualifiers . Somewhat more serious is his discussion of the finer points of financial markets , which really seemed as though he was out of his depth.One example of this is from p.33 , where he says `` ... business is carried on within a system of borrowing ... based on margins of safety . '' He cites THE two metrics of safety , ( I ) the ratio of cash flows due on debt to cash flows debtors receive , and ( II ) , the ratio of the present value of expected cash flows discounted over the future to the face value of outstanding debt . But II is merely an integral of I , and there are other metrics used by banks in the USA for safety ( e.g. , debt to equity ) .Elsewhere , however , the observations are excellent , such as the invalidity of economic textbook accounts of bank lending flows ( 2 ) , or the precise locus of the US financial system 's lender-of-last-resort capabilities ( 3 ) .The Financial Instability Hypothesis ( FIH ) is actually somewhat interesting , but Minsky fails to connect it to anything else in his analysis . For example , he does n't consider what the financial instability cycle does to the structure of the banking industry ( it consolidates bank assets ) and he does n't examine any cases of a completed cycle -- he just describes a series of minor banking crises of the period 1966-1976 , and complains that banking regulators have become too good at preventing widespread bank failures ( the preventive measures lead to inflation ) .Minsky was a valuable source toSteve Keen : I recommend Minsky 's 1975 book , John Maynard Keynes ( review pending ) , but with respect to his financial instability hypothesis , Keen recommendsCan `` It '' Happen Again ? ________________________________________________ ( 1 ) The bricks include payrolls in the consumer goods sector versus payrolls in the investment goods sectors , and other abstract divisions of the economy ; profits earned in all sectors ; taxes paid to government , and transfer payments paid out by government ; and so on . These line items are inherently unknowable in the sense that Minsky uses them -- the line between the labor force of the investment goods sector and the consumer goods sector is very fuzzy , for example . Minsky expects that the accounting identities will hold so reliably that you can influence one item by tweaking others that have a peculiar algebraic relationship to it.Most undergrads in macroeconomics from the 1980s or 1990s will recognize these squishy bricks , but Minsky 's efforts to use them as reliable macroeconomic variables has problems that would take a much longer review to explain . ( 2 ) Monetary theory supposes that banks can readily contract their loan portfolios to business in response to a deficiency in reserves . In reality , the _flow_ of new loans is determined well in advance by longstanding commitments the bank has with its customers . `` The loan portfolio and a bank 's loan strategy are not subject to rapid change in order to bring reserves into line with reserve requirements . '' p.80 . Likewise , Minsky describes banks as `` market makers '' in money-now/money-later transactions . The constraints on market makers are totally different from the stylized behavior of either banks or commodity suppliers ( per microeconomics textbooks ) . ( 3 ) See Minsky ( 2008 ) , p.56 . The book 's editorial cut-off date was 1984 ; then and now , the US financial system has had a multi-tiered lender-of-last-resort , with most LOLR functions normally carried by the larger `` private '' banks . Minsky mysteriously neglects the impact of this on banking size .	-1
With my husband watching our child in the day and me at night , we could not get a system down that would work . Her naps have never been good and she refuses the bottle in favor of the breast . As she has gotten older , it has just gotten worse . We have given up on this method . The book had good information in regards to why sleep is so important for babies but we could not get any of the suggestions to work for her .	-1
I have followed this 12m/w actually twice a week for the last 3 weeks . I also started drinking protein shake ( 40-60 additional protein grams per day ) . I started this routine after a year I had not lifted weights at all . So I was expecting a good `` beginner gain '' for the first 3 weeks considering I am only 136-7 lbs with 12-13 % BF . I am skinny and in the past I always enjoyed 3-6 lbs `` beginner gain '' in the first 3 weeks even with less protein use but with 2-3 hours effective work-out time per week . So I am relatively an easy gainer when starting work-out ( well I never continued going to gym beyond the first 2-3 months each single time I re-started ) .But this time , with this program , I got absolutely nothing in these 3 weeks . No gain , no muscle , no increase in strength . Indeed , 12m/w gym time is better than nothing . One actually may be able maintain some of his strength with a low duration program like this ( still 12m/w seems unrealistic ) but ... come on folks ... 48 minutes per month and muscle and strength gain ? Who are the real examples ? Is there any person who can show for example 6-8 lbs muscle gain in 2 months ( very modest progress ) doing 12m/w ? Somewhere in the book , they actually mention that this routine should be helpful for the first 2 months . Obviously , if you have not been in gym for a while and have lost all your motivation , it may be a good stimulus to start lifting those irons . But for `` beginner gain '' purpose , almost any program should give you good results . If not , like what happened to me with this routine , something is terribly wrong with the program.You can find other resources about how super-slow , HIT , and other variations of this idea , `` less is best '' , work or actually do NOT work very well . Google `` super-slow research University of Alabama '' for example.There are some good points that can be found in this book : Slow training may reduce risk of injury,12m/w is good for people with little time or interest in going to gym , One can always add a day of super-slow to his weekly routine or just do a month of 12m/p for the sake of introducing some variety in his work-out .	-1
The content could have been written on 1 page.It was like pulling teeth to read the redundant , boring info.Too much reliance on single cases vs. a large study .	-1
this is a very boring read . I think I could find better information searching the Internet . not worth the money .	-1
While this book was revolutionary in the 1990s , it was obsolete when first published because it got exploited by investors everywhere as soon as it was known . What Works on Wall Street is in its 4th edition but has not even been updated since the 3rd edition . It did work as far as finding a strategy that 's effective when back-tested but it is hopelessly outdated now . Jim has not had a hugely successful track record running money overall . O'Shaughnessy has worked in the US and Canada with mixed results . After the tech wreck the mutual funds Jim managed were shut down ( Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value ) and the returns were fairly disappointing . In 1999 , O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio , The Personal Fund Company , to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet . The company was closed in 2001 . Jim had some decent returns in Canada until the 2008 downturn ( when his fund experienced a 50 % haircut ! ) but his ideas suffer from style bias since growth investments simply get slaughtered when the market is falling , flat or range-bound ( as it appears to be now ) . Ultimately , returns from growth investing have shown to be inferior to value investing when risk is factored into the equation . The O'Shaughnessy US Growth Fund has returned 1.76 % annualized over the last 10 years ( as of Jan 2014 ) and has underperformed its peers in Small & Mid-Cap Equity and even treasury bills ( visit Morningstar for more info ) . Needless to say , the ideas presented in this book do n't have much practical value if you want to make money in the stock market and are even less applicable since 2008 but they do work as a history lesson . There is an overwhelming amount of data in this book so most of it is fairly dry reading.Check out The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham or Triumph of the Optimists instead . Admittedly , What Works on Wall Street has managed to stay in print .	-1
This book is probably fine for middle school and high school aged `` kids '' , who probably would n't want you to call them a `` kid '' . It relies heavily on seventies-style casseroles and tuna dishes , chili , nachos , and other things that do n't tend to be in the palate range of the under-tween set . I also think that at times the herb choices are a bit strange for recipes geared towards kids . I would return it if I could .	-1

This edition of Financial Shenanigans : How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks and Fraud in Financial Reports is not a tenth as good as the second edition . I would give the second edition at least four stars because it delves into specific accounting issues and supplies metrics and concepts that the investor can employ . The third edition becomes more `` strategic '' and less accounting-focused and thereby significantly less useful and less relevant to the investor.The second edition of this book does a great job of highlighting indicia that are correlated with firms which have cooked the books in the past . And it is a good read . If a fourth edition is written , let 's hope the fire of the previous version is rekindled.As an aside , the subtitle oversells the book -- after all , an outsider never is sure whether something is fraud.Third edition , only so-so ; a devolution in something that was quite good . Second edition , lots of meat ; go buy that edition instead .	-1
David Rhodes and Daniel Stelter are Europe-based senior partners in the Boston Consulting Group . In `` Accelerating Out of the Great Recession '' they purport to offer solid advice on how American businesses can survive and thrive in these trying times . They begin by observing that it would take a 32 % increase in China 's private consumption to offset a 5 % reduction in U.S. consumer spending - something they believe is not going to happen . Thus , when combined with various spending inhibitors , they conclude business leaders should instead look for growth in the U.S. , albeit slower than the past . Accompanying that slower growth will be unwanted increased efforts at government regulation , anti-immigration action , and trade protectionism . Other economic drags include downward price pressure due to deleveraging , and bank reluctance to lend due to their failure to recognize the extent of their potential losses and recapitalize.Continuing , the authors point out that U.S. household wealth shrank an estimated $ 13.9 trillion ( 22 % ) in the last few years , while the savings rate rose from -2.7 % in 2005 to +5.9 % in 2009 . Both factors reduce demand . Meanwhile , the GDP-boosting U.S. trade deficit ( 4.6 % of GDP ) can not continue , unemployment and underemployment remain high , and most surveyed business leaders are not optimistic about soon returning to record 'pre-recession ' profits.Soaring U.S. health care costs ( 17.3 % in 2009 , expected to hit 25 % in 2025 and 37 % in 2050 absent fundamental change - Congressional Budget Office ) receive almost no attention in `` Accelerating . . . , '' despite the obvious fact it can not continue . ( Suffice it to say , health care reform will not occur on its own , and will have major impact . ) Rhodes and Stelter continue , finally concluding that consumers will become more `` value-conscious , '' obvious old news to most . Eg . Guess what has driven Wal-Mart from nothing to become the world 's largest public corporation in 40 years and the U.S. largest grocery retailer in 21 years , while department-store market share fell from 38 % in 1995 to 19 % in 2002 ? Home equity financing reached almost $ 1 trillion in 2006 ( 7 % of GDP ) , before home values began tanking - guess what that does to demand , especially for big-ticket items ? Up to 70 % of homeowners are underwater on their mortgages in some areas - those homeowners will not lead any economic recovery , period . Just two years ago the U.S. finance industry generated 41 % of corporate profits - that wo n't be repeated soon either.Worse yet , Rhodes and Stelter are oblivious to the reduced impact and opportunity from today 's consumer sales . Decades ago when Americans bought a car , toaster , toy , shirt , tank of gasoline , or a shrimp dinner they not only boosted retail sales , but generated added activity for the U.S. auto , appliance , textile , toy , oil , and fishing industries and their U.S. employees as well . Today , that second level of activity is largely gone , both in the preceding areas and many , many more - mostly off-shored to China . Thus , adding a dollar of U.S. consumer sales not only requires more credit than before ( $ 1 in the 1950s , $ 3 in the 1990s , and $ 5 in the last decade - per the authors ) , but also has far less impact on total GDP . Regaining that stronger impact requires protectionism , despite Rhodes and Stelter 's unconvincing counter-arguments , unless one proposes ballooning the trade deficit - which they also oppose . What does this mean for business leaders - that major economic improvement requires government to reverse course on 'Free Trade . 'The second section of `` Accelerating . . . '' covers suggested business strategies . Those looking for new , sophisticated strategies and insights , however , will not find any . The material is simply a superficial rehash of Finance 101 - protect your cash position , negotiate with suppliers , focus on inventory management and reduce debt levels , divest non-core businesses , focus on bloated R & D ; , focus on innovation , . . .. Easy to say , not so easy to do when surrounded by excess world production capacity ( U.S. - 20 % , Japan - 15 % , European Union - 18 % , India - 30 % , China - 40 % , Brazil - 30 % ) , with Asian producers especially advantaged by much , much lower operating and capital costs . Clearly , America 's economic future will not be found through just working harder at more of the same.Bottom-Line : The U.S. can not accelerate out of the great recession without creating a new , significant , sustainable , strategic advantage , or at least a similar defense - especially in the industries of tomorrow . The New York Times ( 1/30/2010 ) reports that China is already the world leader in green energy wind and solar power , and pushing hard to build nuclear reactors and more efficient coal-fired plants . It also is leading in electric bicycles , and the `` smart money '' ( Buffett 's Berkshire ) is betting on a Chinese state-owned company developing electric cars and their batteries . Meanwhile , China is also significantly boosting R & D ; efforts in nanotechnology and bio-sciences . All this while erecting trade barriers to outside competition in new areas , and refusing to revalue its currency - thus protecting old areas as well . Little , if any of these current ( or former ) initiatives occurred through purely private initiative , or simply across-the-board Chinese business tax-cuts . Nonetheless , `` Accelerating Out of the Great Recession '' ignores or takes a negative posture on the potential role of U.S. government , probably because many Americans believe it should have no role in private enterprise.China became a modern power by facing down its anti-capitalist roots en route to a heavy government role in lifting private businesses ; further , its on-going economic vibrancy is assisted by much , much lower health care costs ( admittedly the government is working to expand this area ) and an undervalued currency . The U.S. similarly needs to face down its anti-government roots to help maintain our modern status through government-led health care reform , severely limiting illegal immigration , imposing tariffs to counter China 's under-valued currency , and guiding/helping the development and protection of nascent industries .	-1
I do not understand why people think this book is great.It is NOT a book for beginners to learn electronics in any way . It is more like a basic encyclopedia that gives you a brief description of a million topics.The book does cover an incredible number of areas , most are NOT beginner subjects at all , but it only has one brief paragraph to cover a subject that should be a whole chapter.The information given on most subjects is so brief , like an overview , that you will not understand the subject properly . The chapter covering linear and digital integrated circuits is only 8 pages ! 8 pages for all linear and digital IC 's ! you do n't learn anything.For me , the few times they actually do try to really explain something , they do so in a confusing and complicated way , I would have no clue what they were trying to say if I had n't read 2 other books.When you get the book it is nice and big so you think it is going to be great , but most chapters are 6-8 pages and then 4 pages of quiz and the last 100 pages are quiz and index so only about 60 % of the book is subject matter . The quizes are valuable for the most part.For a hobbyist I think only the first half of the book is even relevant.I am disappointed , I wanted to learn more about semiconductors , transistors , and ICs but this just had very little to offer here . It just tries to be to broad.Like I said , for a reference book with basic info on a lot of subjects that other books do not cover , this is fine.As a first book for `` Teaching yourself Electronics '' ... Forget it . The first part starts out good but as soon as you get to semiconductors it changes to very short theory paragraphs and you do n't learn enough to be useful . Every other book I have read on basic electronics is better . Sorry	-1
I thought & # 34 ; wow , how convenient- I 'll be able to access this book from my phone , kindle , and laptop ! & # 34 ; Boy , was I wrong.None of the tables or flow-charts are included in the kindle version , which means that the kindle version is 100 % useless . The book itself is super helpful , and I will definitely be buying the hard copy.Save yourself the trouble . Do not buy the kindle version .	-1
Diabetes Mellitus is increasing in frequency and some of the increase may be due to confusion produced by laboratories . Last week my wife came home somewhat distressed because she was told that her blood sugar was high . It was 101 . If you are a physician , have you tried to explain the difference between glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus to patients with sugars between 100 and 120 ? If so , then you have observed that puzzled look as their eyes glaze over . There are many tens of millions of adults in the United States who fall into this category . Neither they nor the practitioners of diabetic care have been well-served by the article on Diabetes Mellitus in this textbook which has been authored by Dr. Alvin C Powers of Vanderbilt . The lesser trained PA 's and RNP 's who are gradually taking over the primary care of this nation often do not understand the difference . We have been brought to this point of confusion for millions of normal people by the decisions of the distinguished Diabetes committees who determine such things.Michael E Murray MD , FACP	-1
difficult to use , actually easier to use a book , or the internet . I 'd avoid it , pay more and get a better source	-1
This book shows you how to be a leader in the digital age and provides `` keys '' to do it . The keys themselves boil down to : keep it simple , be true to yourself , be decisive , set ridiculous goals and stick to them , and put people first . None of them are particularly groundbreaking , but they were aggregated well from other business books and presented in an engaging way . Although those parts were more like a business primer than a book in its own right , I still enjoyed them.Another reviewer said that this had good advice for `` baby boomers '' but was nothing new for the already computer savvy . This may be true , but based on how many public Facebook pages there are with people posting things they clearly do n't think are public , maybe there are fewer `` computer savvy '' people out there than we think . Some of the tips and tricks ( like using LIFO for emails , managing your online presence ) are n't anything new , but they are definitely things people need to know . The digital-related information comprised only a small part of the book which made me wish it had a different title . When a book is called `` Digital Leader , '' its readers are going to expect digital content.I still would 've rated this more stars if not for the EGREGIOUS editing errors . There were many , many missing commas that made some sentences difficult to read . This was a sentence : `` To help sell an original deal to Starbucks 's owner Howard Shultz . '' Yes , that 's the whole sentence . And the very worst of all was the paragraph that referred to both `` Rosey Grier '' and `` Rosie Grier . '' Incredibly distracting . I 've never stopped reading a book because of editing mistakes , but I almost got there with this one . Come on -- these are basics ! Qualman , I 'll read your next book , but only if you get a new editor .	-1
Of all the reference books for computer science subjects that I own , I have yet to find a book more poorly organized . Sure , there MIGHT be a lot of information in there , but if you ca n't find it , what good is it ? It is really a pitiful mess . My advice - Buy almost anything else about Oracle , leave this one to collect dust .	-1
It 's my belief that about 90 % of what 's written in computer books is excessive and unnecessary : there are a ridiculous number of them , they 're overpriced , and they spend too much time telling you the obvious.Given that context , this is a good book by computer book standards , though clearly that 's not much of a compliment . What I found most interesting were the reviews and suggestions regarding third-party software ( and where to get same ) . Most of the rest consisted of rather obvious tips on how to use the existing software , of which I found about two to be of use . In other words , the useful parts of this 600-page book was about 50 pages or less.So if you 're really at a loss on how to use your Palm Pilot , go ahead and get this book , or if you can buy it and deduct it on your taxes . Otherwise you 're probably just about as well off doing a Web search as forking over ( $ ) for a marginally useful book .	-1
This book is terribly disorganized , repetitive and has numerouserrors . Unfortunately , it seems to be one of only 2 booksavailable on this certification . The only chapter that was worthreading was the one on JMS . The rest of the book was eminentlyunreadable . I suggest reading & quot ; UML Distilled & quot ; , theDesign Patterns book by Gamma et al , and a good book on EJBs , messaging and JCA , instead of wasting time and effort overthis book .	-1
I bought this book despite the other poor reviews on amazon . I was hopeful that the other reviewers were just being too harsh . But after reading the first couple chapters , it became clear that the other reviewers were being charitable . This book is filled with errors and is poorly organized.The worst error I 've spotted is on p16 . The book says that & quot ; The current version of the SCEA exam tests your knowledge of J2EE 1.3 API. & quot ; In fact , at the time I 'm writing this review , and certainly at the time they wrote the book , the current version of the exam is still testing the J2EE 1.2 API . That is pretty bad when the course authors do n't even know which version of J2EE they should be writing about . It also would be quite detrimental and confusing to readers who would assume they should be studying topics that were added in the J2EE 1.3 version.In many places , the book also does not seem to be well synched with the topics , approach , and vocabulary of the exam . Some chapters seemed almost irrelevant to the exam.If you buy this book , you should only consider it a supplement to help give you a general idea of what you need to study . I would suggest doing most of your studying with other books or resources .	-1
This book is only worth the first 166 pages ( Chapter 1 to 8 ) . You could just literally tear off the rest 650 or so pages and save yourself the burden of carrying the weight.Chapter 1 to 8 provides a brief walk through of some of JSF features . I say brief because the content lacks matter . The author spends too much time and text on stuff that are so obvious and wisely evades concepts that are important and difficult for JSF beginners to grasp . Most of the prose is vague and lacks rigor.Chapter 10 , 11 & 12 that deal with building custom components are very poorly done as well . Again , the author eludes explaining the 'whys ' rather writes 'this is what we should code ' . This leaves the reader baffled understanding why this needs to be done this way . It would have been easier if the author had explained the custom components , its parts & methods by putting the JSF lifecycle into perspective instead of pages and pages of prose . If you are a copy-paste type you are probably benefitted with this approach but if you want to understand 'how & why this works ' it does n't help at all.Chapter 13 is about Facelets . Probably the worst part of the book . Pages wasted . No clear explanation on how facelets differ from JSPs , no working examples and a quick & fast-paced ( mere 4 or 5 lines of text ) run through of facelet features.Chapter 14 & 15 gives an overview of Localization & Securing JSF applications.Chapter 16 & rest of the book ( ~400 pages ) is just a printed copy of faces-config DTD and the Tag lib descriptor file . The examples are so terse and hard to understand and of no practical use . The examples at jsf tool box dot com are way better and illustrative.Also , this book was written for JSF 1.1 and parts of JSF 1.2 were 'injected ' into the prose that does n't fit or go well with the context.This book does n't cover the basics well enough . Concepts that deserve rigor and more examples and prose are smartly evaded ( or the author lacks the knowledge ) . You will have to constantly refer to JSF documentation and online resources to fill the gap . If all you need is a printed copy of the JSF Javadoc , its XMLs ' DTDs and TLDs , buy this book . I do not recommend this book to anyone at any level . I 'm using this book to train my biceps .	-1
I had to get this text for an education course in which I 'm enrolled , and I have NOT been impressed thus far . While there are a few useful suggestions and ideas in the text , the authors seem to be too concerned with issues that have little to do with actually educating students . Also , many ideas in this text , if carried out , will continue to fuel problems that plague schools and society today by propagating erroneous and ineffective tactics . For example , the text discusses the degradation of American society , family values and the traditional demographic , and the massive negative impact that is having on schools and society . However , instead of suggesting the schools rise above the decline of society and try to learn from the mistakes of society by educating students to be good and moral citizens , it implies that schools should follow suit and essentially lower expectations and degrade themselves to align with society . What this book DOES give me are ideas of what NOT to do by doing the opposite of what it suggests . I 've had greater success with students by applying more conservative and moral values , and this text leans more toward liberal views . Now that said , the book DOES offers some good ideas and positive tactics , but it 's the many asinine ones that ruin it for me .	-1

Clinton 's magnum opus is a grant testament to a life spent in the pursuit of power . It lacks even the barest hint of self-evaluation or honest soul-searching . Clinton accepts responsibility for nothing . Every mistake he has ever made- political , personal , sexual- he blames on some other person , entity or phenomenon . His continued attacks on Ken Starr and his whining about his failure to secure peace in the Middle East ( a failure brought on as a direct result of his pandering to Arafat ) are pathetic . Readers who are hoping for an genuine look into this man 's inner state are bound to be disappointed- either he wrote most of this fluff for filler or his life really is as shallow as some of his critics allege .	-1
As a future Presidential historian , reading this book reminded me of his Presidency , a lot of promise , but no clear direction and a letdown . There were too many irrelevant asides and too much attention to vindicating himself for the various problems and scandals that occurred during his Presidency . None of his failures were his own fault but were the fault of others , which is characteristic of a narcissist , which I am sure Clinton can be described as . As a future Presidential historian , this offers little to study about the Clinton Presidency . However , this book is just like the man himself , either you love it or hate it , and it all does come down to your politics . If you are a Republican , you will hate it because everything that went wrong in the nation and all of Clinton 's problems were a result of the Republicans . If you are a Democrat , you will love it for the same reason . I do wish that Clinton would have been more ingenuous with his book and give historians more fodder to decide where on the pantheon of presidents he truly belongs .	-1
What more can be said about this person.I choose to view him as a sign of the times ; and a sad time it is . Amoral , dishonest , selfish & self-serving . All the qualities that we see in the people held up to us by the media giants as icons . We should n't expect anything different from this lump of offal.His presidency should be seen as a watershed : his last day in office was the last day of the slide toward Gomorrah.Do n't let this tome be a loadstone to the return to decency .	-1
First the disclaimer -- I am a conservative and I disagree with Bill Clinton 's politics . Naturally I view the man and his book from that perspective . However , let me say that I acknowledge that Clinton was in many ways an extraordinarily competent politician who was a formidable political foe of my side . He deserves the respect one gives to a competent adversary . Look , let us face it : Clinton was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to finish two full terms in office . Not an insignificant achievement.I agonized between a two star and a three star rating , because I wanted to be fair but not to a fault . I finally went with two stars because to be honest , this is a long hard slog and does not remotely constitute `` a good read . '' It should have been and could have if Mr. Clinton had had a good editor . But no.That being said , I think that Mr. Clinton did himself a disservice in this book . Maybe because he wrote it too soon , without the benefit of some historical perspective , which might have developed given a bit more time . As someone else observed , can you imagine the memoirs of great presidents such as Jackson , Reagan , or Roosevelt having a chapter dealing with a sordid event involving a young woman intern ? The question is its own answer.Clinton should have focused on what he wanted to achieve , and why this led him to a career in politics . Instead , we are presented with largely irrelevant and not very interesting background on his life , most of which information he incoherently presents without any real context . The book rambles and dwells in a literal desert of irrelevant facts , anecdotes , people , and places . When he does talk about his administration and its goals , ( which I might have hoped would be the central theme of his book , but almost is not ) I found it coming across as self-serving , largely as a quest for a legacy . I admit that my view on this might be influenced by my own hostility towards the man and his agenda . However , contrast this book with any analysis of say , Franklin D. Roosevelt ( whom conservatives such as myself admire even as we dislike his policies ) and you have to conclude that this book ( and this man ) come up short . By the way , I do n't hold it against Mr. Clinton that he chose to mostly gloss over the other `` bimbo eruptions '' ( that is what his own people called it ) that characterized his administration and his earlier political career . I do mind that he seems to be trying to say that he was right on the job as regards terrorism when we all know that he viewed the terrorist problem as a distraction from his real goals of universal health care and the rest of the progressive-liberal agenda ( which the Republican Congress with which he had to contend largely thwarted ) .Bottom line : if you are really interested in Bill Clinton , read this book , but do n't expect this book to establish any kind of legacy . If you are not particularly interested in Clinton , steer clear entirely .	-1
David Lee Roth writes books like he writes songs . The words in his songs and this book can have a comprehensive meaning only to him . It is a waste of time to try to figure out what he is trying to do here ... ... .write a book or another adolescent tune . I was in the music business for eleven years as an audio engineer and had close contact and conversation with many famous rock stars . They do speak another language but this guy tries to take it to another level and fails every time . I never did work with DLR , but I have seen several interviews with him and he seems to write in the same way he speaks ... ... rambling , confusing and at times even lame . His act is old and so is he . He is no longer a factor in music and not funny in the least , even though it is obvious that is what he is trying to be in this book . Do n't waste your money ... ... ... buy Sammy Hagar 's book instead .	-1
The only good things that I found with this book were ( 1 . ) For a very anxious person like myself , the book attempts to show how silly anxiety regarding change can be and ( 2 . ) The book is very short , therefore there is no reason why people should n't read this book and judge for themselves if they like it or not ... On the other hand , the content of the book is quite simplistic and the point that it is trying to make is no different than the advice that any friend would give you when going through a trying situation ; for example , losing a job , going through a tough break-up , etc . There is always `` light at the end of the tunnel '' and `` no door ever closes without another one opening . '' This is the type of advice that you can get from a friend that would serve the same purpose that this book serves . I can not rate this book higher than two stars .	-1
I enjoyed reading this book , but it really is n't very good.I 'll save you a lot of time by summarizing the book : Cheese is anything that makes you happy , and if you want to keep getting your `` cheese , '' then you 'll have to be able to adapt to change .

AND , this lesson can apply to your life . AND , this lesson can apply to your life in more ways than one . AND , you should buy copies of this book for all of your friends . AND , you should attend our seminars . AND , you should read our other books . AND , you should go to our other seminars . AND , change is good -- did we mention that ? AND , you should tell others about this message.That 's right -- this book is more about self promotion than it is about change . It 's a quick read , but it is n't very good.Here 's a test of how good a book is that generally works with amazon . It 's kind of a math test , but it works.W = weight in lbs.UP = Lowest used priceAP = Amazon price ( AP / UP ) - ( W - 2 ) Score:0 - 1 : Very good book1 - 5 : Mediocre book5 + : People want to get rid of this book as fast as they can.Right now , Who Moved My Cheese gets a score of 6.7 .

1 hour 13 minutes and 37 seconds wasted from my life.On the grand scheme of life , wasting 1 hour , 13 minutes and 37 seconds does n't sound like much . I guess I could have slept-in some weekend for the same amount of time.They translated a 94 page book into this fiasco . Well , the contents of that 94 page book would scarcely have filled a greeting card , with any editing at all . If they had SAID on the label that it was for the preschool set with constant repetition , maybe I would have been able to stomach it . At least Dr Seuss has some great rhythm and rhyme , and you can learn from the salesmanship of Sam-I-Am !	-1
I had to read this for a school inservice and I have to say it the only thing it was good for was comic relief . This book was so contrived and such an insult to my intelligence that I finally started crossing out words and putting in `` Big Brother '' , `` Thought police '' , `` Thought control '' and `` comrade '' to keep my self awake . Surprisingly these ( and other similar words ) fit in rather well . The basics of the book have already been told in `` The Grasshopper and the Ants '' , `` The Little Engine that Could '' and every mother 's saying , `` You never know until you try . '' I 'm sure it was helpful to some , but I found that most of the book just covered things that are common sense . Work hard , be flexible , be open to new ideas , pick yourself up and dust yourself off pretty much covers everything in the book . There is also a heavy emphasis on doing what your suppose to without thinking about it too much and taking any changes that are thrown at you with a big laugh and a `` sure , I wo n't resist your way of thinking in the least '' . Thus , managers and administrators love this book . Of course if you are a person who can not stand ANY kind of change at all , maybe this can be of some help . I personally like new things and ideas , so maybe that is why I found this book to be so overly simplistic and condescending . I give it a big yawn and a grudging 1 star . Perhaps it should be called `` Who Moved My Common Sense ? ''	-1
I have been an off and on vegetarian for about fifteen years . Recently I moved our family to a 100 % vegetarian diet that includes not using a lot of fat because I am concerned about the long term effects of eating a lot of foods that have saturated fats ( cheese in particular , but olive oil as well , which is 14 % saturated fat ) . If you are looking for cookbooks that might offer some help in this respect , do not buy this one . The majority of the recipes are loaded with eggs , olive and vegetable oils , cheese , butter , heavy cream and creme fraiche . We are not talking moderate quantities either -- the Mushroom Lasagne has eighteen ounces of cheese , thirteen ounces of ricotta cheese , ten tablespoons of butter and one large egg . The Caramelized Garlic Tart uses one tablespoon of olive oil , but nine ounces of goat cheese , two eggs and thirteen tablespoons of creme fraiche and heavy cream.If Ottolenghi uses olive oil in a recipe , he introduces prodigious quantities of it . The first recipe in the book , `` Poached baby vegetables with caper mayonnaise , '' uses one and one third cups of oil , including one full cup in the poaching liquor . The second recipe in the book , for `` Moroccan Carrot Salad , '' calls for one third cup of olive oil plus more for finishing . There are a some recipes that use two to four tablespoons of olive oil , but they are in a minority.An annoyed reader wrote to the Guardian newspaper complaining about the amount of fat in the the Broccoli and Gorgonzola Pie and Ottolenghi characterized the complaint as `` a condescending attempt by someone who , I suspect , does n't like food to tell others what to eat '' . This is a childish reaction to a criticism that probably comes from someone concerned about the health implications of too much saturated fat in a diet . Ottolenghi advances the `` general sense of over indulgence '' over the last few decades as a reason why people include less meat in their diets , but the recipes in this cookbook are the epitomy of over indulgence . Some of them can be modified to meet a higher standard of healthful cooking , but most are not amenable to that kind of change.The book is beautifully photographed and has a padded cover , but potential buyers should be aware that it has a particular bent that makes the cookbook less valuable for many of us .	-1
Timeline is the third disappointing novel in a row from Crichton . There was simply no suspense in the novel at all . Scientific facts and conjecture can only do so much when unaccompanied by at least some tension . Every sword sparks , every horse sighs , winnies or snorts and everybody escapes huge knights in the knick of time ... It was a chore to finish , skip the book , skip the movie ...	-1
I really ca n't say much about this book as the story does n't have enough substance to critic but if they do make it into a movie I hope they go for the comedy genre . The guy who had the lead in the 1999 movie & quot ; The Mummy & quot ; would be great for one of the leads .	-1
The book starts with a neat premise of harvesting the power of quantum mechanics but quickly betrays the reader by not explaining time-travel paradoxes and not resolving major plot threads . One series of events and characters that seem to be essential to the plot are simply never mentioned again as the book decays into page after page of sword fighting in 12th century France . Whenever a sci fi writer ventures into a story about time-travel , it is his duty to work out the paradoxes in some way . ( what if you go back in time and kill your grandfather ? , if time travel is possible , why have n't we been over-run with travelers from the future ? ) Here this is done by a character literally announcing , & quot ; there are no paradoxes & quot ; . It is explained that there are an infinite number of universes with time travelers are going to a different universe that is almost identical to our own . Strangely , they are able to leave notes in the 'past ' that get read by people in the original universe . Summary : If you want a great time travel book , read either The Doomsday Book or To Say Nothing of the Dog by Connie Willis	-1
The premise of this book is so interesting - a homeless man holds up a law office . But the premise is the only interesting part of this book . Even the hold-up scene itself is weak . Then suddenly the narrator spends all his time thinking over the fact that he is rich but other people are poor and trying to reconcile his lifestyle with the ideology he developed in 14 seconds , which is instantly his only characteristic . Sure , people have life-changing experiences , but this guy would never exist in real life . He 's just tacky and unrealistic - had he never seen a homeless person before ? Grisham clearly wrote this to prove a point ( or to make some bucks ) and neglected to make the story interesting and the characters worth caring about . Seriously , do n't bother with this one .	-1
Who knew that the everday kitchen compound we call salt was once a form of currency ? Mark Kurlansky did , and he painstakenly documented that and many other random facts in Salt : A World History . The book is detailed look at the crystalline compound we all know and love , from its early days as a form of high-value currency , to its present place in our kitchens , yards , and vocabulary.I picked up the book because it , like its sister work Cod , was met with rave reviews and spent some time on the NYTimes best sellers list . Some of the highlights : It 's true that before it became commonplace in the home , salt was a highly-valued commodity , often used as currency . In a time before refrigeration and processed foods , salt was a critical component in food preservation , and was a high-priced luxury . In fact , salt cellars on the table were the sign of a wealthy home ; they often took elaborate forms that today are considered valuable works of art.Salt mines were so elaborate during the 1600s that royalty would descend t0 the mine 's core where they would dine in rooms carved entirely from salt , view chapels carved out of salt rock , and use chandeliers carved from salt crystals.In time , developments in agriculture and canning meant food could be produced and stored throughout the year , decreasing man 's reliance on salt for preservation . And while it is no longer considered a high-priced or scarce resource , salt is still ingrained ( ha ) in our daily lives.The human body needs salt to function ; it helps muscles and nerves work , and regulates blood pressure.Many common words in our vocabulary are derived from the word salt ( or , the Latin sal , to be exact ) ; among them : * salad ( originally , salted greens ) * salary ( money given to Roman soldiers to buy salt ) * salacious ( for years , salt was thought to be associated with fertility , and thus `` salacious '' and `` salty '' became synonyms for lustful ) * salami ( seasoned sausage ) Anglo Saxons called a saltwork a wich , so many of the salt-producing towns in England earned names with the -wich suffix ( e.g. , Sandwich ) . ( I 'm not sure if our present day towns with this suffix trace their histories to salt-production , or are simply carry-overs of European names ) .And there are thousands of other uses for the compound , like de-icing roads , cleaning tarnished silver , and relieving tired feed , to name a few.So salt is a pretty fascinating substance . And while Kurlansky does a good job of bringing these things to light , I found his book tedious at times , and a bit unfocused . Mention of a particular salt-based cuisine , for example , spiralled into a discourse about the region of the world in which it was created , or a related crop or food product ( e.g. , talk of its early use in Chinese soy sauce led to a lengthy discussion about the soy bean , and Marco Polo 's visit to Kublai Khan in China ) . No doubt intended to amplify the lowly compound 's place in history , I found these tangents distracting from the story at hand .	-1
Several years ago I went with friends to see the movie & quot ; Speed. & quot ; I was very impressed with the plot , which was as follows : there 's a bomb on a bus ; the bus goes fast ; people shriek ; this continues for two hours . Fans of & quot ; Speed & quot ; -- and apparently there were many -- will love Jurassic Park . Its plot : killer dinosaurs chase people around park ; people shriek ; this continues for several hundred pages.Hello ? This is n't a novel ; it 's a situation , and an endlessly repetitive one at that . & quot ; Oh no ! Dinos ! Danger ! A narrow escape ! And then the heroes went another mile and -- oh no ! More dinos ! More danger ! And another narrow escape ! And then they keep going and -- can you believe it ? They see more dinos and have to narrowly escape ! ! ! & quot ; In addition , we have Crighton 's usual characters : one-dimensional bad guys ; one-dimensional good guys , and worst of all , the Crighton mouthpiece . Yes , you know this man well , for he parades through each and every one of Crighton 's novels , preaching Crighton 's own Crightonist philosophy and spouting oh-so-wise Crightonisms at the other characters ( who generally try to ignore him , as do I ) . In this rendition , he is masquerading as a wounded mathematician who lies around foretelling doom and chiding everyone for not respecting Nature . Funny how a mathematician can sound *exactly like* an overrated Hollywood/New Age author who ca n't write a plot to save his life !	-1
Really ... $ 10 Amazon ? Greed much ? I know the publisher supposedly sets the price but I have grave difficulty believing Mr. Crichton is insisting on charging more for an E version than the actual paperback costs . Call me crazy ... or call me 'Not going to spend $ 10 to buy a 'second ' copy to my hardback version '	-1
For most authors I might have given this book 3 stars , but knowing what Powers is capable of makes this very middling effort that much more disappointing . Powers ' books in the past have worked on multiple levels , with intriguing ideas meshed with an interesting plot , together with well-realized characters . Parallel plots with interesting cross-links provide food for interpretation and Powers ' high-flying prose made reading interesting and fun.This book has none of these merits . First , and most glaringly , the book has no plot . There is no dramatic tension at all . In fact , not until page 250 was there even a challenge or a problem to be solved by the characters . And at that point , it simply felt like an afterthought , and not one that was particularly interesting , either.It 's hard to criticize without spoilers , but I found the conclusion to be shallow and silly . I thought the exaggerated character reactions caused by an extremely distant and tenuous military connection to be completely unbelievable.I did n't think the two parallel plots really cross-fertilized and enriched each other in the way they have in Powers ' better works . In this book , they seemed like two seperate stories tacked together , as if Powers was & quot ; writing by numbers , & quot ; lacking any more original structure for a novel.Powers ' strength has never been his characters , but in this novel they seemed shallower than usual . And they were described almost exclusively in terms of what they had experienced , and not by their actions in the present . ( This is related to the lack of plot mentioned earlier . ) This gave the characters a two-dimensional feel.Lastly , I did n't find the ideas in the novel to be grand or gripping . Virtual reality seems to me to be a neat little technology , not the monumental , existence changing advance that Powers tries to make it out to be . It just does n't have the shoulders to support grand ideas and musing that , say , the discovery of the DNA-protein link or game theory do . VR 's main application is in making neat video games , which I find it hard to get too worked up about.The above makes it sound like I hated the book , which I did n't . It was a decent read and was a way to enjoyably pass a few evenings . I 'm probably overcompensating because of the effusive praise the book has gotten here . But it was an average book at best , and one which left me completely unsatisfied .	-1
An expert in wine may appreciate the smallest nuiance in it 's character , but the search for that nuiance takes precedent over the enjoyment of the bottle . If you want a story that will require you to revell in the smallest of subtleties at the expense of enjoyment of the book , then Waiting is for you . If you a looking for a tale of love , faith or hope , there are much better pages to turn . The prolouge reveals to us that the Lin 's sought after divorce will not materialize for 18 years , so we read the next 200 pages knowing that Lin and Manna Wu will not be united , if at all , until much later . While the details of the 18 years are , at first , interesting , they begin to blur together into a series of inconsequential events . Like Lin and Manna Wu , who become comfortable in their relationship rut and plod along , the reader churns through the pages and plods through the story . While it is true that the years build and develop the characters , they do so at a snails pace . How many times do we have to be shown that Lin is indecisive and timid ? How often will Lin and Manna Wu suffer because they can not break out of societal norms ? The plot develops more in the final chapters , but the outcome is telegraphed . Lin 's eventual revelation that they waited just for the sake of waiting is both predictable and , worse , emotionally unsatifying for the reader . A true critic might call this a love story of infinte subtlety . I would not call it a love story at all . Ha Jin has instead written a political allegory of 60 's and 70 's China . Lin 's wife and his love respectively symbolize the old and the new China as they fight for the soul of Lin . Lin is the people of China whose infinite patience ( or is Ha Jin saying infinite timidity ? ) makes them unable to act and unable to change things for the better . For a book praised for its ' subtlety , the symbolism is obvious .	-1
Who would have guessed that such an expertly rendered series would degenerate into harlequin romance so suddenly and compeletely ? To be fair , I was enthralled for the first 98 % of this novel . It was the last 2 % that I found so utterly disappointing . My advice to a prospective reader is to buy the cheapest paperback copy of this book that you can find and rip out the last chapter . If I had omitted the final chapter from my reading , I would have given Hannibal a 4-star rating instead of 1 .	-1
I originally stumbled across Red Dragon in 1982 when I moved to St. Charles , MO about 1 mile from Highway 94 as described in Harris 's original novel with Lector . The book was mesmerizing . Silence of the Lambs , though not as taut , still provided a good read . Hannibal was a fast but less than satisfying read . The characters were shallow , the story not believable , and the ending ... . give me a break .	-1
& quot ; The Silence of the Lambs & quot ; is one of the most thrilling thrillers I have ever read . So naturally this made me look forward to the sequel Hannibal . Even though the style of writing is still slick , I found the descriptions of what one can do with human beings ( dead or alive ) way too explicit . Sometimes it is better to leave a little bit to the imagination of the reader .	-1
I found my first read of Patrick White very heavy going . In fact I barely got half way through it . They made a movie out of this book and even that flopped ( in my opinion ) . Very dark deep and extremely profound with these awful characters that I found difficult to understand . If this is Patrick White , thanks but no thanks .	-1

I have read all of Grisham 's books . I think The Firm is one of the best page turners ever . I generally enjoyed most of the others , but I think The Testament was so bad that somebody should have been prosecuted . I also found the Bretheren lacking.And , we come to The Summons . Slow , plodding , takes way too long to tell the story , and when you get to the end , alas there is n't much of a story . I think Grisham has lost it . I wo n't bite on the next one . The Summons for me was one of those books that made me angry that I had spent time reading it .	-1
It 's time to officially declare John Grisham as a hack writer . The man just simply ca n't write a decent book anymore . The Summons is not only the most boring but quite the dumbest book I 've ever read . The logic of the story is so stupid on many levels that I am unable to comprehend how Grisham got away with the money from selling the books except to rely on his namesake . First of all , if Ray Atlee is able to extract information from a professor on counterfeiting and a security expert of a gambling empire , then he should have learned enough about off-shore banking so he would have flew his little plane to there and park his money there . That ... right there ... would have ended the story for once and all . Or why do n't we do this the simple way ... ? Buy a Honus Wagner baseball card . Buy a unsealed box of NES Stadium Events . Whatever at all ... and just hold on to the collection and wait for the value to rise over the years . Secondly , since Forrest has consumed every substance known to history of drugs for a good thirty years , his brain would have been totally fried . Thus , it 's improbable that he would have the capacity to think up of the seemingly clever plot to betray his brother . Third of all , I ca n't believe that Ray hired a private detective with many assistants , and they were unable to spot the amateurs , who served time in prison , breaking into his apartment . That 's just impossible ; one break-in is enough to get started on the track . I could go on and on , but what 's the point of beating a dead horse ? All in all , The Summons is a snoozer .	-1
As a Grisham fan , I have read all of his books . Unfortunatley , he seems to be running out of credible material , which is also indicative of his last several books . Although the story starts out well , he uses too many digressions during the story which almost made me put the book down . There is no real tension or drama unfolding . The ending is quite predictable . The book is a real letdown . I hope he starts producing the good drama of his earlier books . He has been on a slow slide downward . I would suggest that you not summon & quot ; The Summons. & quot ;	-1
After reading The Summons , I felt like the small boy who made the comment to Joe Jackson after the White Sox scandal . From a thrilling and must read author to a boring , formulamatic read . Drat ! ! ! ! Johnny , we hardly knew ye !	-1
I usually enjoy John Grisham , but this book is boring . I did n't care about any of the characters , let alone what happens to them . I kept waiting for something interesting to happen . The book as a whole was uninspired as was the ending . There 're lots of good books out there , do n't bother with this one . The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because Grisham is a technically good writer .	-1
I borrowed the book from a friend ( sorry Amazon & # 65533 ; ... however my friend bought the book from Amazon so I guess it 's OK ) and I read this book in only a few hours . If anything it is an easy read . Grisham captures the mood and atmosphere of a sleepy southern Mississippi town . You can almost feel the humidity in the air as you are transported to a place where the pace of life is slower , where time has stood still for decades . You are summoned to a small Mississippi town where Judge Reuben Atlee is known , respected and when you arrive , dead . Grisham then grabs you with an unexplained mystery . How does a Southern Mississippi judge who never made more than $ 50,000 in any year and who gave virtually all of his money to charity die with $ 6000 in his bank account and three million dollars in cash in boxes neatly arranged in his home ? The premise and the mystery are heart thumping . You beg for a great story . You begin to turn pages in anticipation . It 's Grisham and you know a great story is coming . Only one problem , the rest of the novel is ultimately disappointing . The action is thin , the characters shallow and predictable and the ending well & # 65533 ; .disappointing comes to mind . The saving grace , the novel is short , not much longer really than a Hollywood movie , which this will eventually become . Let 's hope that unlike most novels , the movie is better .	-1
Even for a die-hard Grisham fan , this book was very very lame . The writing style is definitely Grisham , which is a good thing , and the fact there are not any lawyers in the story is not necessarily a bad thing.But the plot itself is incredibly weak , to the point of being almost non-existant . The character development is shallow and predictable . The `` suspense '' of who is painting the house is a joke.I could n't believe how slowly things developed , until I realized that he had developed them as far as he was going to - and that was it . End of book . Do yourself a favor , do n't buy this book new . It 's a waste of money . If you absolutely must read it , pick up a copy at a garage sale or a used book store . And do n't say I did n't warn you .	-1
Someone else said it was like watching paint dry . I wished it had been that much fun . I had to force myself to finish this book . I just knew SOMETHING was going to happen . And in the end something great happened ... The book was over .	-1
I read this late at night in hot weather , figuring the tales of jungles , dessicated plateaus , and humid cities would match my mood . It did , but failed to rouse my ennui . Gimlette in small parts writes superbly . The blurb notes that while this is his first book , he has penned travel journalism . The latter , I think , is probably better suited to his style , which over hundreds of pages shimmers but then sinks . He has to integrate four hundred years of Paraguayan history into his own accounts of his decades of visits , and the book 's weight slumps.The best part , contrasting the Lengua natives and the German Mennonites on the Chaco , comes at the end ; the previous 80 % of the work spends far too long in Asuncion and whatever happens in the jungles gets bogged down in too many visits to ex-pats , too many boring meals at woebegone inns , and conversations that fail to interest anybody but the author himself.I liked what I learned about Eliza Lynch , who is also the subject of two recent novels , and the devestating wars , the stronero regime of Stroessner , and the sheer mess that passes for daily life in much of the nation all make for naturally stimulating reading . But too often Gimlette strives for a word that does n't quite fit -- his three adjectival uses of & quot ; curly & quot ; for example -- as he strains towards a style that calls more attention to himself than his subject .	-1
Winner of awards ? Hmmm . This book was given two thumbs down from my crew : boy and girl ; nearly 4 and 6 . They found this book dull and lacking in the plot department . And I have to agree with them.Story : People and animals pile in a car . It rains . Mr. Gumpy decides someone needs to push to get them up a hill . No one wants to push . Car gets stuck . Everyone pushes . Everyone gets dirty . Everyone goes home . Sun shines again.Two Stars . Amazon suggests an age range from ` baby to preschool ' , but I would suggest baby to toddler might be better . I think by preschool children expect more from a story . And as a Mom , I would hope they might learn something . Unlike the Little Red Hen , there was no real ` lesson ' or moral to this story . Characters refused to help until they were absolutely forced to ; and that was that . No consequences . [ Someone thought the text was amusing and clever , Suessian I think they called it , but I found it rather common . Example from book follows so you can judge for yourself . ] The car edged its way to the top of the hill.They looked up and saw that the sunwas shining again.It began to get hot . `` We 'll drive home across the bridge , '' said Mr . Gumpy . `` Then you can go for a swim . `` And they did.After a while it was time to go home . `` Good-by , '' said Mr . Gumpy . `` Come for a drive another day . `` ( The End . )	-1
Not a good writer , period . Good story telling does n't have to use complicated prose and complicated terms . Not sure why people like this at all .	-1
This book review , as well as many more , can also be found on my blog , The Baking Bookworm ( www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca ) .My Thoughts : I have a confession . I gave up on this book and I do n't do that easily . I figure that if an author spent months ( or years ) writing the book and I should give him/her the respect they deserve and hold on and try to get into the story . That 's all well and good but if a book does n't grab me in 100 pages I figure my responsibility as a reader has been met.In fact , I read over 270 pages before finally deciding that this was n't a book for me . I kept trying to get into it based on the extremely high ratings that it received on GoodReads as well as Amazon . Unfortunately I kept waiting for something major to happen , some sort of direction of the plot but it never did . It is a verbose read with its detailed descriptions of medical procedures ; it has a lot of different characters ( who were hard to distinguish ) , a tiresome dialogue and plot that did n't seem to have any direction.That said , my opinion is just that . My opinion . There are many other readers out there who adored and gushed about this book . They passionately defend their reviews ( and sometimes adamantly state their disagreements with lower rated reviews ) . I get that and understand that level of commitment to a book . I 'd , respectfully , do the same for Harry Potter , 'Women of the Underworld ' series and Sara Donati 's 'Into The Wilderness ' because I lurrrrve them and they hold a special place in my literary heart.But besides the verbosity , slow plot and gaggle of characters the biggest thing that bothered me about this book was Marion as the main character . For some reason , Marion always had the voice of an adult ... even when he 's telling about his life when he was an infant . Yes , Marion narrates the book even as an infant . The author expected the reader to just accept the fact that there 's an articulate infant narrating the book -- and that did n't sit well with me . It just seemed odd to have a protagonist be so articulate and descriptive ... as an infant.Overall , I ca n't say that I 'd recommend this book but I 'm glad that I gave it a good shot . I 'd love to hear what you all thought of this book . Am I way off base here ? Or did you have a similar experience with this book ? My Rating : 0 ( I gave up on it )	-1
I had high hopes for this book but was sadly disappointed . Read this book if you want to study long long sentence construction . Each sentence was a test of my concentration . The story however did warrant this much effort . Perhaps Pulitzer is a reward for the most number of words with the fewest periods ? I gave up .	-1
I had really high hopes for this book after reading the many online and print reviews . I 've heard from numerous people who loved this book . I just do n't happen to be one of them , I guess.Ultimately , I do not find Christopher to be a sympathetic character , and the writing style , told first-person from Christopher 's POV , is highly irritating . Almost all of the sentences start with the word `` And , '' and it is normal for a sentence to actually be a series of sentences , strung into a very long paragraph that I suppose is meant to represent Christopher 's speaking style . I will still admit that I read this book very quickly , and I was extremely interested in finding out what happened . However , I ca n't say I enjoyed this book . It irritated me far more than it entertained me . I suppose I should have given Christopher a greater leeway since he is autistic , but I just could n't muster up enough sympathy for Christopher .	-1
I did not like this book at all . I could n't finish it but did read the end of the book to find out the ending . After reading the end I was pleased that I did n't waste anymore of my time on this book . There are so many good books out there , do n't spend your time on this one .	-1
I guess that is why I disliked this book had no patience with Christopher know he could not help it but still	-1
This is another book that becomes the darling of book clubs around the country and turns out to be a big disappointment for me . Yes , it reads fast and yes , it 's interesting to be in the mind of a person with autism . But I did n't need 200+ pages of it . I think the plot is simple and it 's solved halfway through the book . The rest of the book , mostly the main character 's train trip to London , I found boring and frustrating ( which might be a point the author was trying to make : autism is indeed very frustrating for those who are close to the patient ) after just a few pages . Maybe it 's not a great thing that I 'm not especially interested in autism and the troubles it causes for those who suffer from it and their close ones , but that must be why I did n't care too much for the book as a whole . Too much of a good thing , even if it was only 220 pages long .	-1
I read this book after being told it was in the genre of the DaVinci Code . I just never found it to be engaging at all . The mystery the friends set out to solve did n't interest me in the least . The solution was improbable and unsatisfying . The friendship of the `` four '' was also just not of interest to me . I can see that alumni of Princeton would like this book since it is set on campus and contains many quirky ( though again very uninteresting ) details about life on that campus . I do have to say that I finished the book , although it was one of those `` this just has to get better '' quests that went unfulfilled .	-1
Earth to five star people : Five stars is a rating reserved for masterpieces , which this book most assuredly is not . The characters seemed like chess pieces ( or checkers , more like it ) trundled around quite unsubtly in order to achieve the desired climactic result . Give this one a miss if you value your time .	-1
I really enjoyed Colonel Behrani 's voice and perspective as a character . If the entire book had been told from his point of view , I might not have skimmed through to the end . I lost interest as soon as the author took us into the voice/mind of Kathy and her relationship with Lester . I do n't enjoy 'victim-fiction ' which is why I have n't read many of Oprah 's latest picks . Kathy seemed to fall into that stereotype and Lester 's fall into her stretched my imagination too far . I hope Mr. Dubus will write another novel using the strength of the voices he captured in the Behrani family ... I 'd look forward to reading it .	-1
I am an academic economist who frequently collaborates with scientists and find that interdisciplinary collaboration is often fruitful and that there are clear synergies from letting scholars from different fields interact . I therefore purchased this book with the expectation of being exposed to useful ideas . I was sadly disappointed . The book starts with stating the need for behavioral physics . I smiled a little at this , since economists have been doing this for 150 years , but I guessed that you ca n't know everything . Then the author started writing about economics . Oh boy ! Either the author is truly ignorant of economic research the last 50 years or this guy is to scientific writing what Ann Coulter is to punditry . I doubt that there is a single economic concept that the author has understood . A fundamental concept such as Pareto optimality is botched . Apparently there is evidence that prices fall when demand grows which would be news to most economists ( including Adam Smith who is supposed to have expressed this interesting idea . ) The author states that economists look for theories that enables prediction of market movements whereas real traders know that this is not possible . Any economist will tell you that the truth is the other way around . In fact , economists know that unless there is asymmetric information among traders it is not possible to consistently outperform the market . Real traders make a living trying to do so . And the statement that microeconomic models ignore interactions between agents is just laughable . In fact economics is a holistic science in the sense that it is explicitly acknowledged that actions are interconnected . This is what general equilibrium analysis is all about . ( I do n't recall the publication date of Cournot 's market model but it was a long time ago . ) I could come up with more examples of nonsense but if you want a laugh , just borrow the book at the library . I am concerned with the disingenousness of the writing style . There is no end to the number of statements like `` Some economists believe , '' `` mosts economists will '' and `` many think that . '' Since I do n't recognize any of this I can only assume that he made these things up . The other approach is to cherry pick bad ideas from the past and present them as current practice . ( Kontradieff cycles ! ! ! ) In my interactions with scientists I have often despired about the calvalier attitude they have to economics . They seem to think that having a Ph.D. in e.g . physics means that they are super-smart ( which they often are ) so something as trivial as economics must be dead simple to them . This leads them to say the dumbest things like claiming that energy should be the unit of account when measuring value . It seems to me that having a brain that understands quantum mechanics and relativity makes you supremely unable to understand elemenetary aspect of behavioral science . ( Although you may be able to predict behaviour in queues and other not very interesting patterns . ) The contrast with biology is interesting . The flow of useful ideas between biologists and economists has been very beneficial to both sciences and promise to be more so in the future .	-1
This story idea has the potential for a really good novel , but I thought this missed by a mile ( good cliche . ) The character of the husband in particular seemed rather simple minded , although the wife certainly was n't too bright either . I just did n't see how either could be taken seriously , the way they were presented . What was the point in making the husband a part-time Santa Claus ? I did not find either of them particularly sympathetic or believable because , I think , the writing was at a level as if Berg were writing a story for children instead of adults .	-1
I 've enjoyed most of the selections by Oprah 's book club ... until I tripped on this one . & quot ; Open House & quot ; was predictable from page 1 . The newly divorced woman who feels like her insides have been shredded ? The teenage son who misses his Dad ? The fat man with a heart of gold ? The old lady who drinks tea and gives wise counsel ? Although I found all of the characters interesting , none of them was surprising or all that loveable . They were simply fleshed out cliches . The best thing I can say for this book is that I learned some neat passive-aggressive tricks in case my man does me wrong . In which case his boxers are toast .	-1
If I were a teacher of writing , and I am , and as this author is , I would be terribly embarrassed to have my students read this book . People who use such crude , sexually explicit language are not in `` my world , '' and I 'm glad they 're not . It seems so unnecessary and inappropriate for what is really at times a tender romance , albeit quasi-sci-fi . The theme of Chrono-Displacement is scary , and we can be grateful that our world , with all its present turmoil , grief , and wrong-doing , does not also have this problem.I would be hesitant to recommend this book to my friends , my book group , my sisters and relatives , even my husband , without warning them about what they 're getting into . Just to see this kind of language in print is a disservice ; I think it makes it easier for people to use such words and to think in vulgarities themselves . And what good is that ? Other reviewers have commented on the unethical , even immoral , behavior that is made to seem perfectly acceptable in this dreamlike -- no , nightmarish -- tale . And how did Henry ever keep his job at the Newberry Library ? As a former Chicagoan I lived just a block away from it -- so I enjoyed the various geographic references . Chicago 's `` Near North '' was my world at an important time in my life , but Clare , Henry , and Niffeneggar 's other characters were , thankfully , in absentia . All in all , this is a compelling but horrifying novel .	-1
The book is very shallow , the characters are shallow . There are no feelings , just endless descriptions of useless details . The story never engaged me . No insight into the charactes , no looks at society . It looks like what an immature teenager could write . Or a person who had serious traumas and dwelve in superficial details to avoid going deep into her feelings for fear to suffer.As the love story goes ... where is the love ? Many people rave about the love story . I never saw love . Just a list of predetermined facts . They met , had sex , a family ... and where is love ? What does she love of him ? What does he love about her ? The author never wrote anything or even never let you guess what attracts each other . They have sex often . That 's all . Is that love ? Bah .	-1
The premise is interesting enough : Henry and Clare are lovers who meet and re-meet between different chronological ages , slowly assembling memories one has and the other has not yet experienced . When Clare first meets Henry , she is 6 and he is in his 40s , later she is 20 to his 28 . The narrative alternates between Henry 's and Clare 's points of view , much like Henry 's sudden departures from Claire 's life.The problem I have is that the voices of Henry and Clare are nearly indistinguishable , even as they age . Most irritating is Niffenegger 's constant need to impress us with her knowledge of punk music ; her endless enumerations of 70s punk bands grow tiresome . These descriptions ultimately prove fatal to the believability of these characters . I could never buy WASP-y , reluctantly prim , auburn-tressed Claire as a closet punk ( especially since she wears -- retching noise here -- a long brown velvet dress in one of the first chapters ) . And Henry is described early on in the novel in a way that summons an image of a dark-haired Fabio in black jeans and high-tops rather than the soulful Richard Hell image the author seeks to invoke . I could n't help but think the author was trying , unsuccessfully , to create hip , irreverent characters without understanding how such characters would actually interact with one another . Also , some terrible metaphors and banal similes distract from the story throughout . It was n't terrible though . Definitely a decent airplane read and I managed to finish it . She 's no Nabakov , however . I suggest spending $ 15 on an Interpol CD instead , and checking this out from the local library .	-1
I wanted to love this book and , if a few things had been different , I would have . Niffenegger comes up with a very clever premise and she 's skilled at creating good characters . The non-linear plot took some getting used to , but after a while I was very much enjoying the time shifts and seeing the many pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place.The problem with The Time Traveler 's Wife is the last quarter . After hundreds of pages of build up this book just sort of peters out . I 've been disappointed with a number of books lately for this reason ( Forever and Everything Is Illuminated are two that spring to mind ) . Good premise , decent writing , but an ending that just renders the whole thing a waste of time.Niffenegger is talented , there 's no question . But it almost seems as though she got fed up with her own book and just hastily threw together an ending . Poorly executed and extremely disappointing for the reader .	-1
Wow . This was a disappointment and was 150 pages too long . I loved the premise , but this book had huge problems , including foul language , dull prose , and pretentious characters.I do n't mind dirty words , but please try to keep them in the sex scenes and not just floating around like free-radicals ! The wife in the book actually used , `` my c -- - hurts '' a few days after delivering her baby . Who says that ? ! It 's ludicrous.If you have a life that includes ordinary daily activities , this book will not excite you ... unless you are fascinated by hearing about other people 's ordinary , daily activities . I mean , this is an adventure ; it was light on adventure and heavy on the mundane.Niffenegger loves to give lists of books , works of art , and musicians to prove how cool and cultured her characters are . I ended up skimming these endless lists ... and , honestly , I skimmed the last 150 pages . I 've only done that twice in my life ( The Thornbirds- snoozefest , and The Corrections - Oprah club nightmare ) .This story deserved a better treatment by the author .	-1
The Time Travelers Wife by Audrey Niffenegger was a really uninspiring book . The premise is kind of sci-fi , this guy is randomly transported to other times and places , leaving a pile of clothes behind , and arriving stark naked wherever he arrives , and then returning to where he disappeared from , again stark naked , and hoping to find the clothes he left behind are still there ... and that is only the tip of the iceberg . There is a love story entwined with all this time travel . The book did not , in my opinion , deliver the story it advertised on the cover . It implied that the two main characters , man and wife , overcame danger , etc . in order to be together . It almost got there , but remained undeveloped . Also , this is a little bit of a soapbox here , but I think that this book could have been a lot better than it was . I find that I am really annoyed by crudity of language , especially in describing relationships . Why can we not use nice words when we talk about sex in books ? Does the author talk like this to her lover/husband/partner ? Do any of us ? ( Do n't answer that , really ) I think that her use of language in describing the sexual relationship of the main characters made the book less than ordinary and unappealing . It could have been charming , and the love story could have been inspiring . The author is a professor for heavens sake . One imagines that she has command of the English language , or at least a thesaurus . I will not buy this book or recommend this book to others , I 'd be too embarrassed .	-1
I 'm in the minority I see . However entralling the idea of time travel is this book missed the mark . First it was disjointed . So much so in fact , that I 'm still not even sure how Henry died . Secondly , the characters were not likable - none of them . I just did n't care about any of the characters - main or subplot . They were vulgar , disgusting people who used others when they wished and used alcohol , drugs , and profanity to excess . Thirdly , the overuse of profanity was pointless . People I know do not talk like these people ( especially in front of their children ) . Fourth , the sex talk was uncalled for ; it was too graphic . Fifth , this has been hyped as a love story . I say it 's no where near a love story . And if this is what the author thinks is love then no wonder she missed the mark . A sad tale that could have been very interesting .	-1
From the get-go this novel was pretentious . Other reviewers have regaled this book for its intelligence , but constant references to Ovid and Dante seemed like rubbing the readers face in the authors research . The storyline about Penrose and the two sisters was awash with mythology that weakened the idea . A more straightforward telling could have made it intriguing . The underwater garden could have been so cool under different circumstances.The protagonist 's thinking and actions seemed disjointed . To not see Neal for well over a decade seems unbelievable . Was he sentenced to the institution , or there under his own volition ? It was never explained why Juno did n't keep track of him even if he had tried to drown her and Beatrice . Why did it take days or weeks ( could n't get a grasp on the passage of time ) to read the snippets of notes found around the stained glass ? It was n't a novel , for goodness sake . In the end , Juno faced betrayal by two very important people in her life , and the author did n't use it properly . She did n't make the reader feel the betrayal , or care . The ending was preposterous.I did n't like this book at all . It was a book club selection for this month so I made myself finish the book . The middle really bogs down , and the ending is almost unconnected to the rest of the novel . Not recommended .	-1
I am writing this review because Amazon suggested I should buy it , but I have already read most of this book and found it such a disgusting experience that I did not complete it . Unless there is a twist at the end that I missed by quitting , this should not be called a mystery . No mystery involved.I was surprised that the editorial reviews were quite honest about the content and also surprised that the customer ratings are so high . I do not find reading about chopping up bodies to be appealing .	-1
Wilt in Nowhere follows the same formula that the other Wilt books do . Somehow Wilt manages to get himself into an unbelievable situation that leads to misunderstandings and trouble with the law , bringing Inspector Flint into the picture as the situation gets more and more absurd . This time a drunken Wilt manages to stumble his way into arson , and later the suspected murder of a Shadow Minister.Sadly this book does n't come close to the hilarity of the previous Wilt novels , although it has its moments . One can always rely on Sharpe to concot plots so preposterous , so absurd , thst contemplating them will cause fits of laughter . Wilt 's family in the drug trade , Wilt 's quads making recordings of their great-uncle arguing with his wife about sodomy and blasting them at 1000 decibels so they can be heard from miles away , Wilt himself being suspected of involvement in murdering a Shadow minister , those things are damn funny . However , much else aims for the funny bone but falls short : the satire on the DEA and their investigations , Uncle Wally 's war-loving imperialism , Bob `` Bobby Beat Me '' Battleby 's S & M and child porn . Did n't work for me , those ones . The magic just was n't there . I guess we ca n't always be at the top of our game .	-1
I do n't know if the Taxmen were after Heyer when she wrote this , but this is simply boring tales of a wive who spends too much money and digs in deeper as she refuses to tell her loving husband . Compounded by a brother who borrows for his gambling , these are all unlikeable characters .	-1
The author is a social scientist , a psychology professor actively engaged in research , a Jewish atheist who is widely read in the traditions of the East who has visited there and interviewed many proponents of Eastern philosophy , someone who is not a practitioner of any of these philosophies but a respecter of the rights of others to have those views . He majored in philosophy as an undergraduate and `` found few answers '' . He now teaches university classes on positive psychology which employ cognitive therapy principles . The writing style might be called popular academic -- it has footnotes to chapter notes , references and an index.The author explains that our likelihood of finding essential truths is small . `` No one person can ever read more than a tiny fraction '' of our available knowledge `` because our library is also effectively infinite '' His quest has been to `` read dozens of works of ancient wisdom '' and sift out the wheat from the chaff -- to `` question it in light of what we now know from scientific research . '' His confessed bias , then , is to bring us wisdom filtered thru the lens of science and that he does . Any measures of happiness he uses will be the kind of quantitative clinical evidence-based analysis that a scientist would use . This narrow view is a very modest baby step compared to the broader sense of happiness sought after by the serious practice of spiritual disciplines.His metaphor for self-control is the rider taming the elephant . `` Meditation has been shown to make people calmer , less reactive to the ups and downs and petty provocations of life . Meditation is the Eastern way of training yourself to take things philosophically.Cognitive therapy works , too . '' If statistical evidence on Prozac matches that for another modality , then it is effective too.He seems just as impressed the way `` philosopher Robert Solomon ... directly challenged the philosophy of nonattachment as an affront to humanity '' as the `` Millions of people in the West have followed [ Buddhism ] , and ... few if any , have reached Nirvana '' Whether you want to call this fair and balanced or wishy-washy is a matter of semantics.At some points the author may sound like a debunker when he says things like : `` I am in no position to say whether God , heaven , or an afterlife exists , but as a psychologist I am entitled to point out that belief in postmortem justice shows two signs of primitive moral thinking . '' At other times like a pragmatist : `` religious faith and practice can aid growth , both by directly fostering sense making ... and by increasing social support '' In Chapter 5 on the pursuit of happiness he makes many strong assertions about why he feels that modern happiness research suggests that Buddha was wrong to say that happiness comes from within . He cites studies that suggest happiness can come from without , not studies to show that Nirvana is a meaningless state of consciousness . He talks about the importance of social networks and traps of modern life like having versus doing . Perhaps the author should talk to the NDE population before writing his next book . This half-way-there approach to research is not fair and balanced . The author is very enamored with the `` progress '' of his colleagues to the exclusion of tradition . There are plenty of studies about TM and other types of meditators , and none of them are discussed or listed in the 25-page list of references . There is a second issue which is that Buddhist happiness is in all probability a different animal than clinical happiness , this is not addressed.The author is certainly aware of the meaning of non-duality but does not dwell on it . There is a cognitive dissonance at work in this writing , the author is very happy to point out when the principles of cognitive therapy are echoes from past teachings , but is very reluctant to state what else those authors had to say that is not part of cognitive therapy . Though he sprinkles mention of Buddha throughout the book as early on when he quotes from `` The consolation of philosophy '' by Boethius he waits until late in the book in Chapter 9 `` Divinity with or without God '' ( curiously God is not in the index ) to tackle issues relating to enlightenment . He leads off with a very appropriate metaphor from Flatland by Edwin Abbot . He then has a very extended discussion of disgust and elevation which leads into a seven page discussion on awe and transcendence . He surveys other Western authors like Timothy Leary , Abraham Maslow , and William James . The contrast that sets apart the legendary work of Maslow from cognitive researchers is that Maslow started from the top with peak experiences and the cognitivists start from the bottom and never make it up the ladder , they continue to wallow in the dregs . How do you see the light if no one lifts the manhole cover ? I 'm sure that academics in the field will consider this work an essential read , as for the general public or someone seeking happiness , that is a very different matter . To use the words `` ancient wisdom '' in the subtitle of this book is an affront to readers who might expect to read it to find metaphysical sophistication . You may find some interesting writing , but very misleading PR in the title . A more accurate title might have been `` The Happiness Semi-Hypothesis : Why I think science trumps the Buddha '' . Buddhist practitioners and knowledgeable students will see through the author 's temerity and shallow perspective with no difficultly . I 'm not saying a cognitive band-aid can not be helpful , just that this kind of unfair and meaningless misconstruction of Buddhism is undeserved . Haidt is happy with himself for his freedom to `` think treasonous thoughts '' which seems to mean his ability to say in print pretty much whatever he chooses . That does not mean people that have been warned wo n't be smart enough to ignore his books.If what you want is to know why Buddhists are happy and how to get that way you might try Awakening Joy : 10 steps that will put you on the road to real happiness by James Baraz or perhaps Wake up Now by Stephan Bodian . For a broader view see Coming Home : The Experience of Enlightenment in Sacred Traditions by Lex HixonFor something less spiritual try You Can Be Happy No Matter What : Five Principles for Keeping Life in Perspective by Richard CarlsonAnd no , I am not a Buddhist and have no intention of becoming one .	-1
What this guy does n't know about Buddhism would fill another book of equal length . Not only does he make the typical Western mistake of viewing of emptiness as a negative state , he seems to think the Buddha 's words are some sort of self-help guide to happiness.Why try to be happy if it will only turn to sorrow ? What 's behind this axiom is not an alternative route to happiness . Any attempt to make it into one , as Haide has done with this baffling book , is a basic mistake . The Buddha is concerned with enlightenment , absolute freedom . If Professor Haide does n't want to be free , why did he bother to read the sutras he misquotes at times in his book ? To make a name for himself in the emerging scientific method squabble with spirituality perhaps ? Unfortunately , Haide fails there too , as he absolutely muddles his attempt to claim reciprocal altruism as his moral tether . He should have realized that the new scientific priesthood headed up by Dennett/Dawkins does n't concern itself with morality ; it 's too busy proclaiming its proponents have the answer to everything based on the fact that they understand empiricism.Save your money . Look elsewhere for the road to happiness.Jonathon Haide does not know what he is talking about .	-1
Unless you are a student of British royal history , we could have lived without the first half of the book ; who was with what count , who had an affair with what baron , etc. , etc. , on and on it droned . I realize that Charles and Camilla loved each other all along and probably should have married in the first place , but that is not Diana 's fault . I feel that this book is very one-sided . Diana was a very young girl , not savvy in the ways of the world or the royal family . Indeed , she probably was a bit insecure and neurotic , but are n't we all at 19 ? I felt there was too much Diana-bashing in this book for someone who indeed made a contribution , turned out two fine sons , and did many good works in the world.Now while I agree that Charles and Camilla are no doubt far more compatible and are probably a & # 34 ; great love story & # 34 ; , this book is plain old boring . It is PR for Charles and Camilla , and nothing more .	-1
I read the review of this one in the Times and thought it was worth a try . Unfortunately , the book did not hang together that well . The linkage between the two strands of the story ( involving a medieval manuscript and a computer game ) seemed forced . The main character was shallow , and consequently hard to like ( and hard to root for ) . It was a quick read , but largely because there was no depth to the plot .	-1
This is a terrible book pretending to be `` complex , '' `` cerebral , '' and words dreamed up the critics . The critics compare it to the Name of the Rose , etc . The critics are wrong ( or is it they want to praise one of their own ) . Everything about this book rings false : the Wall Street whiz , the computer game , the characterizations , the plot , ... I should have listened to my instincts , and quite after a chapter or two - instead I read the entire @ # & ( ^ book .	-1
I was not impressed . I had been looking for a more engaging read . I did n't care about any of the characters , what they were doing or what happened to them . Disappointing	-1
I do n't write poor reviews generally , but since I selected this product to read for free , I am now committed to writing a review of this for Amazon.com , for that 's the agreement.I spend my reading time these days divided ( mostly ) between ancient literature , modern philosophy , and cultural criticism . So , this book looked promising : a fun experiment , interfacing our modern culture with the culture of ancient Greece , by way of placing the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece in the modern world . I thought it would be a fascinating story , full of contrast and critique.That 's not at all what this book is . It is , in fact , the opposite - the stock scripts and behaviors that fill the modern social lives of middle & high-school children are projected onto the behaviors of the gods . The gods have neither depth or fidelity to ancient forms as a result - their actions are merely a collage of shallow pop-culture phrases , gestures , interests and activities that make soap-operas look like the pinaccle of all of Western Civilization by comparison.I laughed at the very first line of the book : `` One morning , when Artemis was out walking the dogs , she saw a tree where no tree should be . The tree was standing alone in a sheltered part of the slope . To the untrained eye , the causal passer-by , it probably just looked like a normal tree . But Artemis 's eye was far from untrained ... '' etc . The gods , throughout , are the projected fantasies of a poorly educated low-ceilinged imagination , who has reified the tawdry and the banal , and can only assert that these characters are gods because they have `` powers , '' which powers belong on the TV show `` Charmed , '' or some knock-off of it ( which reinterprets the meaning that the word `` god '' had to an ancient Greek , or to anyone from any ancient culture ) . The characters themselves are simplifications of the archetypes found in the media of the Modern Pop-culture Industrial West . They say nothing that an adolescent could n't dream-up and then put , word for word , in a comic book.This is very frustrating for anyone who has any appreciation for the slightly secularized literary expressions of real , robust ancient Greek paganism , and who is fascinated with the religious experience of the gods that is reflected in them . As far as the god Eros is concerned , I doubt that any modern Christian would recognize the Christianity that he has adopted , though it serves as a wonderful foil for the author to have the gods mock Jesus ( `` that thief of faith '' ) . Strangely , the gods seem to think of monotheism as a heresy , which is not a category that any ancient pagan would have understood , and clearly one that the author does not , either . The gods of ancient Greece did not care what you believed , and did not care about `` faith , '' whatever the author means by it . They want sacrifices , temples , monuments and feats in their honor.If you 've never read any classical literature and think that `` Survivor '' is one of the highlights of your week , and that the quarrels on Jerry Springer and Judge Judy are real , appreciable , conversation-worthy problems , you 'll enjoy this book . To top it off for you , it 's got some very dull sex scenes in it , too , which most pop-TV trash could never show you.Otherwise , read Lombardo 's translation of TheIliad , which really punches , and reads a lot better ( and more accessibly ) than the other translations of that work , which are usually dry , and ( strangely ) have a British temperament . Even readers of this book ( `` gods behaving badly '' ) could pick up Lombardo 's translation and understand it without trouble . That will enrich you and expand you , and make you more human . This will enslave you to the dregs of modern consumer culture far below the level of `` The Gossip Girls . ''	-1
Marie Phillips debut novel , `` Gods Behaving Badly '' takes a fun , if not unique , premise of the existence of the Greek Gods in modern day London . While this is obviously a very light-hearted idea , when done properly it could provide a very entertaining read . Taking a different take on mythology and/or theology has produced some excellent fiction . Zelazny 's `` Lord of Light '' and `` Creatures of Light and Darkness '' and Brust 's `` To Reign in Hell '' are examples where such a premise can produce outstanding results . Unfortunately this book does not follow in the steps of those great books . That is not to say that this is a bad book , it is an easy read and something that may provide an enjoyable few hours , but it does fall far short of what it could have been.The story is about the Greek gods in modern day London , living together in a townhouse in London , and trying to preserve their waning power until they can find a way to restore it . Unfortunately , the Gods find it difficult to give up some of their bad behaviors and mischievous antics which ultimately involve two mortals and completely disrupting their lives and bringing the Earth to the brink of destruction.While reading this book I could not help but think about what other authors might have done with the premise . As a debut novel , it is decent , but I am sure that others could of , and would of made more of it . At the start of the book , too much time is spent on the sexual antics of Aphrodite . It is not clear if this was done to lengthen the book or to try to spice it up , but the result is a rather unnecessary drawn out section which would have been better used to flesh out some of the other characters . The good news is that the book does get better as it goes on , for the most part , with the highlight being the section which takes place in the underworld which is both inventive as well as very funny . The very end is a bit predictable , but had the rest of the book been as well done as the section in the underworld it would not have been an issue.Whether you should read this book really depends on what you are looking for . If you are looking for a nice diversion , then this could be a good choice . If you are looking for something more than that , then this would not be a good selection .	-1
Mario Puzo virtually invented organized crime mythology 30 years ago with & quot ; The Godfather. & quot ; What tends to be forgotten in light of the two Best Picture awards won by the movie and its sequel , however , is that the orginal novel was not taken very seriously despite its mass sales . Francis Ford Coppola was the one who pumped the magic into Puzo 's vision and made it a tale for the ages rather than a soon-to-be-forgotten pop phenomenon . That said , with & quot ; The Last Don & quot ; Puzo essentially attmepts to do a rewrite of the book that made hime famous . Unfortunately , he had little in the way of fresh ideas to enliven his old premise . Like the Don of the title , Puzo was past his prime , though he refused to admit it . And making Hollywood the center of the plot is a nod to his considerable experience with moviemaking . One would say that he knows more about filmmaking than about the gangster life.Ultimately , & quot ; The Last Don , & quot ; is what & quot ; The Godfather & quot ; would have been without Coppola ; a massively popular novel that will be little remembered by posterity .	-1
Predictable plot and I did not like all the flashback writing which seemed to happen every time I actually almost got into the real time story . I prefer longer novels and the large lettering in the kindle version makes the length very deceiving .	-1
Was I reading the same book as those who described this mystery as a 'gripping thriller ' ? There was nothing gripping or thrilling about this book . I did not think the character of Kurt Wallander was developed at all and so I did not feel I understood him or liked him . But in fairness this is the first Kurt Wallander mystery I have read and so perhaps his character was developed earlier in the series . However , it was an effort to finish this 400+ page book . No surprises at all in the end , in fact I kept saying to myself 'why do n't the detectives figure that out ? ' . I did not like the style of writing and found it very choppy . I was fed up hearing about the rain , it was raining , it was going to rain , would it rain . I am amazed at all the five star reviews .	-1
I used to give a book 100 pages to suck me in . Now , it 's 50 . I tried with this one but I just could n't do it . Not all books need an intro , I prefer books that dive right into the characters and the story and I do n't have to figure out later how it all ties together.Once the book got into the main characters , it improved but I was already mentally checked out so I stopped reading . I am sure for many people , they will love this book . It just was n't my cup of tea .	-1
As an author I found the structure of The Man from Bejing sadly out of balance . It begins with a horrific mass murder in a tiny Swedish hamlet in the north . This certainly gets the readers ' attention , but the motivation of the killer is not credible , nor it is likely that a powerful Chinese capitalist would commit such a crime , killing innocent people in a far away place . The author 's intention is garbled , for much of the book is devoted to a political polemic contrasting Maoist ideology with China today . It is always an error to push a political ideology in a work of fiction . The Swedish protagonist , a judge with a past in pro-Mao ideology , is hardly believable , and her own actions are to my mind illogical and unbelievable . When mugged in China she does n't share the news with her roommate , which is the obvious course of events . After a very long diversion into history of Chinese laborers on the building of the railroad during the Gold Rush to somehow justify revenge over a hundred years later without revealing fthe actual reason for the need for revenge , to me was a cop-out . The Swedish protatonist bumbles along unconvincingly . Her failing marriage is hardly reconstructed as she is not proactive and does n't seem to care very much . ( I first read a sample on my Kindle , then turned to Amazon for a used copy for one cent plus postage . ) I ca n't understand how this could be touted as a best seller unless it rode on the coattails of the author 's previously very successful mysteries . I found reading it dreary and disappointing . Save your money..	-1
I know that there are people who really love this kind of stuff . I remember trying to read Patterson 's `` Year of the Machete '' and not being able to finish it . Too grafic , to horrible , the kind of stuff of which nightmares are made . I do n't understand how some people thrive on bloody books but I am sure not one of them !	-1
Although the story was exciting written th a very unpredictable ending I found the skeletal explanations hard to comprehend therefore making this more like a science class than a relaxing . Book .	-1
I must admit that I 'd only decided to read this book after seeing the film.The 'suburban couple ' are anything but that : they have none of the insecurities , aspirations or delight in the suburban comforts that such a couple of that era would have had . They are more like a couple of 1950s bohemians who somehow 'compromised ' themselves to an ordinary life when the girl fell pregnant and then hate themselves for it.Chapter 1 reads well ( otherwise it would n't get past any publisher 's editor ! ) and has one good line referring to the odor of fresh loam from the fields coming through the car window as the Wheelers go to the play.I found reading the rest of the book a bit of a labour.Frank 's masterly letter to mollify his associates in another division was amusing - and quite real to those familiar with sales managers.The sparring with the institutionalised son of their realtor was very stilted : a blatant case of character creation solely to raise uncomfortable questions.There is another great line when - during one of their less stormy periods - Frank admires April 's legs on the couch as she speaks away fluently on some subject : `` Never before had beauty grown more purely from truth . `` But the bulk of the story read like an enauseating mixture of clich & eacute ; .Maybe it fell victim of the psycho genre trend of the day , making extreme what one simply wanted to highlight . For sure it focusses far too much on the vie int & eacute ; rieure of characters rather than on their real living . The notion that human nature - not least the issues raised when living together - would somehow disappear were they to simply drop out of mainstream job + mortgage lifestyle would never cut it in a novel today.All the same , I share a reaction with a previous reviewer : I have been looking into Yates ' other work , expecially the short stories .	-1
The plot is sketchy and illogical . This was his first book and was obviously only printed because of later successes .	-1
I am a big Harry Hole fan , having read all of the books in the series . I always wondered why the English translations began with Nesbo 's third book . Now I know . this book is mediocre at best , boring at worst.The basic plots wander about slowly . There is page after page about Aboriginal heritage . The identity of the serial killer is obvious about midway through the book and then after the identity is established we are led in a silly confrontation . Most ridiculous is the way a civillian is used as bait without reasonable security measures - just to make a bigger personal impact on Hole.If I had read this book first , there would n't have been a second one that I would have read . Looking at the Amazon reviews , I think many share this conclusion .	-1
This book is easy to read and provides the authors insight into a few of his clients and how they grew personally and spiritually from a psychodynamic viewpoint . Perhaps what I did n't like was that it rambles far too much and sometimes I found myself getting lost as what the whole point of the story was all about .	-1
Cultural icon M. Scott Peck presented himself as , and somehow enjoyed a reputation of being , thoughtful and `` scientific '' . Several times in The People of the Lie Peck says that `` evil '' mysteriously `` kills the spirit '' but never bothers to define what his cryptic assertion means . The verbal vagueness of this psychologist allows for sweeping attacks on open contempt for admittedly fictional sketches of `` patients '' who are , uh , EVIL . After Peck `` vents '' and rants against these unflattering but largely mythical biographical sketches ( or B.S. , for short ) , he wonders aloud if anyone will ever come up with a `` scientific '' way of helping Peck denounce people as EVIL.Worst of all , Peck then becomes an amateur demonologist , pointing fingers at what he imagined to be a real live person and thing called SATAN . Perfect for Peck : those who have read his biography ( The Road He Traveled ) know that Peck was a nasty man who could not properly run his own family . Keeping Peck 's real personality in mind illuminates the vague prose of a book that is basically a receptacle of Peck 's bile . Peck 's SATAN ! is not the subtle and interesting literary evil to be found in The Screwtape Letters or the tempter of Paradise Lost . PECK 'S SATAN IS THE CAUSAL BLACK BOX NEEDED TO MINDLESSLY ATTACK PEOPLE . So if you are supposed to help a vulnerable person , but decide instead to twist a knife in his back , Peck is the theoretician for you.Peck does not attack REAL historical figures like murdering politicians . Oh no . Peck attacks fake strawman amalgams of screwed up people who came to him and payed him lots of money for help . Calling clients EVIL and looking for SATAN ! is how Peck the Professional pays them back . How did Peck the monster attain such a positive reputation as an advocate of `` spiritual journeys '' , `` growth '' , `` community building '' , and `` love '' ? Peck 's popularity speaks very badly of 20th century psychology , social work , and psychiatry.Over the years I have been involved in community crisis centers ( domestic violence , etc ) , and have been astonished by how Peck was popular with supposed `` Christians '' who , I see now , were just like Peck in their desire to condemn people they just did not happen to like . And the one weapon that most often came out of this and other Peck books was the bad example of a Dana Carvey-like Church Lady yelling SAAATANNN ! Just as Peck was a loser at home ( as shown in his biography ) and an emotional vampire ( as Peck demonstrates in his own accounts of therapy ) , so countless other `` humanitarians '' I have met look for vicious Peckian ideologies to justify picking on the helpless looking for help . All Peck 's work is good for is a cheap rationale for unprofessional help services.Please understand that Peckian Demonology is as morally and intellectually respectable as Carl Jung 's Aryan Archetype racism , Freud 's unintentionally hilarious doctrines , Alfred Kinsey 's `` pre-pubescent sexuality '' , silly `` Third Way '' New Ageism , and the useless methods of Behaviorism -- that is to say , worthy only of contempt .	-1
I liked it just enough to keep reading because it was so odd , but it left me with no real answers and the main character disappointed me . I hoped that somehow there would be a small win someway or somehow .	-1
I thought this book was going to be something special , the summary is what caught my attention . But really I made it to the 4th part of this book and it is soooo boring and I ca n't bring myself to finish it !	-1
I would have given 3 stars , as it was merely dull , ham-fisted , and in a writing style I do n't appreciate , but I 've decided to start dropping a star from any book not about WWII which brings Nazis to bear , whether as the `` bad guy '' in a thriller or as here , simply a long recollected passage meant to draw parallels with the protagonist 's own dystopia - if you need to mention Nazis for me to understand that the regime is evil , you 're doing something wrong . ( Copied from my Goodreads review )	-1
I found it boring and depressing . Politics as usual . This is nothing new ya know.The people who have governed this country ( heck ! , the world ) from the getgo have all been like this . It was just kept under wraps better . Too many leakers , climbers and journalists these days .	-1
yes , the storyline is great , its churns your emotions , you feel for kumalo and everything and everyone around him . But hey , this is not the first time i have read a book that is as moving . But definitely the book gives you a peek into the aparthied situation in Southafrica . Just a peek , there are more worser things happening there.I honestly struggled to read the book and understand it because of the language . I like simple language , which is understadable in todays world . And i think if this book was re - written in not so poetic style , i would have loved it.Its a tough read . You need to clear your mind of distractions to understand the book.But seriously whats the hue and cry all about ! ! ! ! Not fascinated .	-1
I had a difficult time getting into this book . It was not difficult to read and finish , but very difficult to have any feelings about or connections with the characters .	-1
In paperback , Outlander , turns into an 856 page brick . This time-travel romance , is based upon the character of Claire Randall , who is swept away from her life in and marriage the 1900 's and dropped into a life in the 1700 's . In her `` new '' life , she meets a cruel sadist who looks exactly like her husband , and a cast of Scots who take her in , though they to resemble Neanderthals . James Fraser is a man she is first forced to love , but then grows to desire like no other . She is torn between staying in this time and finding away home to the man she first married.At first I was intrigued , but my mind would wander during some of the plot , which seemed to drag on for me . Much of this story is written in a Scot dialect , and some you will have no idea what was supposed to have been said , but in time my figure it out because certain phrases are reapeated , and you learn them via context . For example , `` Ye kin we like her '' . At a certain point this grew stale with me.There is plenty of sex , but not all of it is concensual and a great deal of blood , fighting , disease and death . James Fraser is brutalized so many times , I expected him to have armour UNDER his flesh.The end ( last 200 pages ) of this book requires complete suspension of belief- which says a lot when we are already reading a time travel book . I rolled my eyes numerous times and laughed when the story was not trying to be funny .	-1
The characters were not relatable and the love scenes were kind of odd to me , as well . I managed to finish the book but I will not be reading the sequels .	-1
The book glosses over a lot of computation details for performance equations and does not provide good relevant examples in the book . The exercises at the end of every chapter are not relevant to the material covered in the book itself . The reason being is because the authors of the book were separate from the authors of the questions , which is why the questions do n't mirror the book 's material . I feel like the questions themselves are good questions to ask students , but the book does not adequately explain all concepts that the questions demand , because there are some nontrivial questions in there . The CD that comes with the book and the MIPS reference sheet are pretty useful though .	-1
Mr. Atkinson is a nice guy ... but this book was rushed to market , and will be qualitatively beneath the next PHP books . As a handy paper source , it is sufficient.After flying through this book , I was comfortably writing 300 line PHP scripts to access Oracle databases and contextually format very complicated web pages . My general happiness with life right now is probably due more to PHP than to this book.One example of this book 's problems : function calls are sorted alphabetically . Thus , you 'll get to & quot ; closedir & quot ; way before you get to & quot ; opendir & quot ; or & quot ; readdir & quot ; . Also , the function titles go like & quot ; string urlencode ( string url_text ) & quot ; -- which means that you have to read the SECOND word of every heading to see the ( alphabetical ) function name and the FIRST word to see what the function returns . Function descriptions are generally sorted into & quot ; File & quot ; , & quot ; Database & quot ; , & quot ; RegExp & quot ; etc. , which further frustrates any quick reference attempts.The book is not in depth . If you 're wondering whether you can regexp with a variable during a directory read , you 're out of luck . I found myself wishing Larry Wall ( of Perl ) had written the book.The thing is , I probably know more about PHP after one week exposure to PHP than the book does . A good reference book is supposed to constantly refresh and enlighten you . Lastly , keep your pen handy , because this early edition 's code has some errors that you 'll want to correct on the page . The CD-ROM also has those errors .	-1
This is truly a deplorable book . Most of Spanish grammar can be compressed onto a couple of pages - aside from that you only need a list of about a thousand vocabulary words for a first-year course . What then , is the excuse for burdening the poor student with this back-breaking weight and sinful expense ? Yes , the pictures are pretty . Yes , the young people depicted are good-looking and ethnically balanced . So what ! Learning a language requires CONCENTRATION on the subject matter ! These illustrations are merely a DISTRACTION from the material the student is supposed to be studying ! The only use served by filling every blank space in the book with COLOUR illustrations is to keep the student from drawing rude pictures of the teacher in the margins ! Oh yes , the book is printed in COLOUR , at appreciable extra and useless expense ! SHAME !	-1
This is a book which alleges to be about `` critical thinking , '' and yet on page 291 states , `` what counts in human life is not who is RIGHT , but who is WINNING . '' An interesting position in political science , perhaps , but the absolute NEGATION of critical thinking . And this is only one of many egregious errors in the book , beginning in the very first chapters in the discussion of the `` three functions of the mind , '' which the book classifies as `` thinking , feeling , and wanting . '' Not only does this not conform to modern psychology or biology , it is completely arbitrary : wanting is a type of feeling , and feeling is a type of thought -- so we 've really only identified a single function.Worse , there are `` think for yourself '' exercises which really serve as INDOCTRINATIONS -- the authors choose ethical positions with which they disagree ( such as egocentrism and sociocentrism , which they incorrectly identify as the `` sources of irrational thinking '' ) and require the reader the reader to identify these types of thoughts on their own and how to expunge them . This is classical Communist re-education.The very worst part of this book is that it is actually published by the Foundation for Critical Thinking . They should be absolutely ashamed of themselves . I can only hope their other books are better .	-1
Pearson is one of my least favorite publishers because they make college textbooks for 6th graders . I do not find their dumbed down approach to writing along with a plethora of giant illustrations helpful . I stopped using this book after the first chapter and bought the one by Elsevier instead . Some people really like the garbage published by this company but I am not one of them . I replaced this book and did very well in my Pharmacology class .	-1
This is a really weak attempt to write on the topic and consequently , for the new trader - to understand trading . That is partly because the content is somewhat poorly organized and presented . I recommend Linda Raschke or Toby Crabel 's books . They are both hedge fund managers , and trade for living . Their books and materials are almost out of print unless you see it on Ebay or Amazon.But after reading this book I am rather confused as to how and when to use the disclosed trading techniques .	-1
It was more for health professionals then the average reader . I had thought it was more for the average reader .	-1
I think perhaps you need a psych degree to enjoy this book . I felt like I was reading a text book the whole time . It was boring and I did n't feel like I was learning very much . I try to make it a point to finish a book that I start , but I wish I 'd broken that rule with this one .	-1
For starters , innovation networks are nothing new -- companies have been outsourcing r & d ; for decades . Also , the book mentions Second Life , but if you have visited SL lately , you will notice that many of the areas are more like digital vacant lots than the slick innovation exchanges the book describes . Many complex issues surround intellectual property transfer , but the book glosses over them ( check out `` The Wealth of Networks '' by Yochai Benkler for detailed description ) . Moreover , heirarchies have survived this long because they work and because not everyone wants to be a leader . The real challenge will be utilizing external networks in conjunction with in-house r & d ; ( with all of its heirarchies and power structures ) .Several other things ( related to the video presentation on the review page ) : ( 1 ) Retail investors are smarter than experts ? I think he means index funds , which do not use `` crowds '' to make their allocations but are simply indexed to the overall market and adjusted automatically ( 2 ) The Navy example -- -if memory serves me correctly , the investigators were not randomly chosen but were pre-screened for their mathematical ability	-1
I bought the book from Barnes & Noble for about $ 65 . I like the fact it 's a hardback , and I was extremely anxious to dig in and start developing Qt4 GUI applications.The first couple chapters are great . Very easy to follow , just type in the examples as the book tells you to , and then it explains it ( though not as much as I 'd like ) .As some other reviewers have said , you do n't really get a clear picture of what Qt4 is all about . It does n't really explain WHY the code works as it does . You do n't learn how all of the objects mesh together.After you get through the first couple easy chapters , it feels like you 're thrown into the deep end ! Not in complexity of the concepts or code so much maybe , but in the even moreso LACK of explanation.I just ordered `` Foundations of Qt Development '' on Amazon , I 'm really hoping this book is better .	-1
If you are planning on learning Data Structures and Algorithms , this is definitely the book to avoid ! Concepts are so horribly explained that I 've ended up creating an aversion towards them . This book makes easy topics appear to be the most difficult things that you can ever learn.Mr Carrano may be a top notch Computer Science person , but writing books is definitely not his forte . That is my opinion , after having to deal with this book for about two semesters.I love books and have read good amount of books on computer science . I usually hate to sell them or give them away , but this book is definitely going to be off my shelf as soon as I am done with my course . In the future , I would for sure avoid any course that requires reading this book.No other book bothered ( read it as irritated ) me as this one did .	-1
This book was not written for a general audience . If you are n't extremely well schooled in economics you are apt to find it impenetrable . And if you manage a bit of comprehension ( which I believe I managed ) you are apt to doubt the author 's thesis ( which I do ) .If Paul Krugman 's analysis of our economic situation makes sense to you ( as it does me ) then this will not . The author believes that Keynesian theory has failed us and that there is no way forward via government borrowing and spending . He may be right . I may be crazy . ( The preceding a pop song reference , ca . 1980 ) .I think he 's wrong .	-1
I agree with what the other reviewers have said about this book not focusing on dividend investing as the title would suggest . The first portion of the book is about budgeting and managing expenses . Good , solid , basic advice but probably not why you bought the book . Then there are sections are mistakes day-traders have made and the author 's own experiences as a day-trader . Interesting enough but again , this is supposed to be about investing with dividends in mind . In this mix there are maybe twenty-or-so pages allocated to actual dividend investing strategies . There are a few plugs for his website though . And in terms of actual portfolio allocation with respect to a strategy of earning dividends ? Nope , none of that either . There 's really no information in this book you would n't find online or as part of a more comprehensive guide to investing . For this reason , I really would not recommend this book .	-1
Writing this review goes against my visceral feelings . After reading this book , I have an almost overwhelming desire to be subjective . But , keeping that in check , these are my objective evaluations.Ever been to one those free seminars that promise to teach you how to become a millionaire in your spare time ? I have not , but I do know that they do n't teach you anything . They are a prelude for an expensive course that promises to teach you how to become a millionaire in your spare time . Which of course it does n't , but that 's because you did n't focus hard enough . This is like the seminar , except that it is not free and there is no follow-up course . After reading this book the only thing you will know about trend trading is what you knew when you started ( actually more likely less ) . This book is pure salesmanship , pretending to teach you about trend trading , when all it does is give a sales pitch that trends are the thing . Most of its contents are glowing reports of the success of the writer 's friends , who oddly happen to be the same people who wrote the endorsements in the book description . And , to give it objectivity , it throws in personal attacks on W. Buffett and `` value investing '' , but who , it is disclosed , is actually a trend trader , or not , depending upon which paragraph you read.The book contains not one useful idea about trading trends . Worse , it is dramatically self-contradictory : Never get greedy , no one can predict the market tops , versus the secret of success is letting your winning positions ride.Always let your winning positions ride versus be sure to use stop loss orders to prevent reversals . Well how do you account for interim fluctuations , the variability that is a natural part of trends . Not a word , just be sure to watch for them , know when to get out , and let your winning positions ride , but use stop orders.Diversification puts you in a better position to hit the big one versus diversification means that your portfolio will trend toward the mean and that is death , go for the outliers.Money management is key to staying in the game [ which assumes that you are losing ] versus greater rewards come from greater risks.Now , assume that you , like me , already believe that there is some economic merit to trend trading , what does it teach you about how its done ? Nada , nothing , zilch . Not a glimmer of how to spot a trend ; not a word how and when to get out of a position ; how to account for variability in placing stop loss orders ; what constitutes a trend ; how do you factor in the various types of risk ? Simple , let the numbers be your guide . Could we have just one chapter to give a clue to which numbers and how to let them guide us ? No.Reading this book is like paying to spend a day listening to a used car salesman try to sell you a clunker . If you want to learn how to be a used car salesman , this is your script . If you want to know about the car , forget it.This book is worse than useless , its a complete waste of time ( and you only have so much of that ) . It does a disservice to the concept of trend trading : making it look like a huckster 's con game.If you are looking for useful advice , look elsewhere .	-1
Any book on trading markets - especially one that is focused on `` art of technical analysis '' must explain very fundamental components of ANY trading system - entry/exit points , risk/reward metrics , position sizes , correlation with other instruments in portfolio . This book provides none of the above for the famed Lindsay approach the author is basing this book on.The book does provide a `` method '' that seems to be based on 36/40/56 year cycles ( I really would like to stick around to collect 6 or more datapoints based on this approach myself to get any meaningful result - but Nature may have some other plans ) . Relying on a very few `` correct '' calls and then extrapolating it as an accurate system is misleading . If not for the sheer illogical nature of that approach , this would be a comical read.The problem of the book is not that it is not applicable to the current markets where high volatility and 400-500 point swings on the DJIA are the norm . The problem of the book is neither Lindsay 's system - assuming one existed . The real problem of the book is the flawed attempt to explain something after admitting the proponent never documented it - and then expecting readers to interpret this book as a `` trading system '' .One star for attempting to write a book on a system that supposedly existed , but my author 's own admission , `` ... took it to the grave.. '' . How convenient . Second star for all the glowing reviews ( mostly the only one they have written ) and the author 's public reactions to the critical reviews .	-1
This book is written by an insider - a financial analyst - as an attempt to explain the hows and whys of the recent financial crisis . I have to say that after reading it , there are some better books out there . First , while I am a relatively smart individual , the book is very `` rapid fire '' and requires an inordinate amount of attention for it ; and that is fine , but it does seem that if this book is geared toward the 'general reader , ' this is probably not the best to read . Secondly , the book is a bit one-sided , putting the brunt of the blame on a free-market ideology ( when the truth is that the financial sector is one of the most regulated and least free market industries we have in the U.S. , and certainly our recurring history of financial bail-outs does n't lend itself toward a free-market approach to things either ) .While I ca n't really expand that much on what other ( particularly three-star and below ) reviewers have said , here are some books that I think will be a little bit of a better read than this one : Barry Ritholtz'sBailout Nation , with New Post-Crisis Update : How Greed and Easy Money Corrupted Wall Street and Shook the World Economy ( a very balanced book that is a bit easier to understand for the 'average reader ' than this one ) Johan Norberg'sFinancial Fiasco : How America 's Infatuation with Home Ownership and Easy Money Created the Economic Crisis ( Norberg is a free-market advocate , but this book really does put blame on all parties , explaining VERY well how government , private industry , and consumers all acted recklessly , adding up to a huge financial fiasco ) Nicole Gelinas'sAfter the Fall : Saving Capitalism from Wall Street-and Washington ( This book focuses more or less on making recommendations for what kind of policy changes are needed to avoid repeating the same mistakes . Unlike this book , which offers few suggestions , Gelinas 's book is a really good discussion of policy measures . )	-1
The whole book reads like a motivational speaker trying to sell you a product . In this case , it almost seems as if he is trying to get the reader to invest in his firm , since he keeps talking about himself . He shares almost no concrete information , rather explaining that `` if you read a little more , you 'll find out how to become a great trader . '' But in the end , it 's all marketing-hype and no information . There is no `` playbook . '' The playbook is the one you make yourself with your own trading rules by putting in time & effort . The author presents several long-winded scenarios of his firm 's lucky trades , but everything is based on some random technical analysis ( which this book does n't even explain ) . He just tells his traders to keep looking at charts - the author 's role is more of a `` middle-manager/slave-driver . '' He explains how he makes his traders work many hours in a day , staring at charts , and that if you want to be a good trader then you 've got to do the same . It 's a lot of fluff , no substance . What a waste of time .	-1
I really like the idea of this book and the format seemed great at just a glance . Each chapter is brief and covers an idea or topic in just a few pages making it great for leaders who want to get a `` tip for the day . '' To be honest some of the insights are valuable , others are interesting if you are new to management but are n't new ideas , but most of them sound like they came from the fortune cookie warehouse . Basically the author just uses a formula to flip statements around and end up saying things akin to Your worst idea is your best idea , your bad day is your good day , etc . I wish the book was shorter and had all the fluff removed .	-1
Although as comprehensive a book on patternmaking as is available , this text is desperately in need of proof reading . Take for example instructions that refer to `` Figure 2a '' and `` Figure 2b '' on a page with illustrations labeled `` Design 1 '' and `` Design 2 '' . Is `` Design 1 '' actually 2a ? One is left to puzzle out inconsistencies that result from a lack of careful proof reading . A fifth edition , one would hope , would have these issues resolved .	-1
When I received and opened the book I immediately noticed that the print font was very small which made reading this book a challenge.Not only was it a challenge to read because of the font size but the content was not that great . I have read many books on the conscious and sub conscious mind and this book had the least substance of them all.I do n't think I will read this book again or recommend it to a friend or family .	-1
Did n't use it much but for test review . If you have to have it then hey , welcome to higher education .	-1
I found the book tedious and uninteresting . Got about 30 pages into it and decided not to torture myself any more .	-1
This commentary is exceptional in the amount of material it covers . Referencing this commentary on two different occasions for serious scholarship on a few tough questions has turned out not provide any adequate answers . One New Testament question and one Old Testament question was not answered properly in this text . In fact , it made light of it . The New Testament example was Jesus who rode on both donkeys implying he rode both animals . Instead of clarifying the language in the Bible as not misleading it continues on with the trickery . The reviewer who gave the commentary a 1 star review had some important things to say about this text . I 'm a Catholic . The dissenting view has value and is a reasonable reflection . If you want to take a look go ahead and get it . But I did n't have to go too far with it to find it unreliable on some basic questions . The other Old testament question was in Genesis . You should have materials to cross reference before you include this in your library .	-1
Good ... could n't say great , but if you 're & # 34 ; into & # 34 ; the psychology of the mind and how it works ( and I thought I was ) by all means , read it . Guess I 'm just disappointed that it did n't change my life .	-1
I asked my wife if any books had arrived and she said no , because in her mind this was too small to be a book and it did n't register.In a nutshell that is what could be improved , it should be a lot bigger than it is . The pages are small , the print size is large , pull out sentences like you 'd see in a newspaper article , there are a couple of forwards and an introduction , and a huge number of short chapters . With maybe two small paragraphs per page and not enough pages to work with the author tries to do too much . Just about every topic of sports psychology that could have general applicability to life is crammed in resulting in covering none of them well . It 's like getting hit with a strobe light , none of the concepts has time to sink in before the next flash hits.I do think this book could be redeemed with a good rewrite . The concepts are actually quite valid , and I think if they could be elaborated on , bulked up to use a sports metaphor , people would be able to relate better to them and understand better how to integrate them into their own lives . If the publisher wanted to keep the svelte form I think a book this size could cover 1 chapter , and you could turn it into a series .	-1
In the lead-up to the January 20 , 2009 , presidential inauguration of Barack Obama , there were around one dozen books landing in stores and looking for a little elbow room on the major display shelves.There are big winners and major losers with so much product hitting the marketplace . In this one , business partners and authors Barry Libert and Rick Faulk fail miserably in their attempt to cover the Obama campaign from the technological angle through this skimpy `` analysis '' that utilizes four chapters that total less than 140 pages . Simply , if one feels that the statement , `` Business - Like Politics - Is Extremely Personal , '' ( which is found in the book ) is revolutionary , then this will be an incredibly solid read.The authors essentially take tidbits of research that could have been pulled from any number of media sources during a campaign that was launched in February 2007 , but had a foundation set much earlier , and weave it into a ridiculously simplistic `` Business 101 '' outlook . The material in the chapters - Success You Can Believe In - And Emulate , Be Cool , Be Social , Be the Change - would not be new to any person who has had an introductory business course within an educational setting or is chasing a slice of the `` American Dream . `` The text ultimately morphs into a commercial for Libert and Faulk 's framework for social software and networking , with Obama - like the reader - along for the ride . It is best to search for a real analysis of the technological approach from the campaign that is worthy of studying for the historical value and possible application to the daily grind of staying a few strides ahead of the competition , professionally and personally .	-1
( Truth in reviewing . I 've written a lot of business books and am always looking for good new ones ) .This is so vapid that it is hard to say anything about it . The author takes a dinky idea -- companies should be clear about their goals ( the truly valuable `` What '' s -- and avoid the `` How '' traps of process myopia . But the concept of the What is simplisitic to a point of banality and a trivial instance is then extended to explain the entire transformation of a company . Michael Jordan 's failed retirement to play baseball is completed explained as `` Jordan assumed his high-performing What was Play-Sports , when in reality it was simply ( and phenomenally ) Play-Basketball . '' Dell 's `` Resolve Customer Questions/Problem What '' is seen as a source of its erosion and somehow its turnaround . The analysis is all about How not What Dell did . A crisis at Jet Blue is described as partly failing to address Manage-Communication as a What . But isnt the issue how to manage communication ? A Tawainese consumer electronics firm is seen as leading in the marketplace through its Manufacture-Product What . How ? How ? and How ? The How-What distinction is blurred throughout . The examples are forced to fit the simplistic thesis -- the Manage-Transaction What gave ING Direct its market lead , for instance , but what is any bank 's core other than its transaction management and how it leverages this in services and relatiionships ? This is such a lazy book . Many of the examples are inaccurate and/or incomplete and/or biased.I ca n't recall a single original insight in this vapid , assertive I-have-the-Truth morass of illogic . It is short with biggish print and wide margins . It 's still far too long for its lightweight thoughts amid heavyweight claims .	-1
I can quickly summarize this book.They want you to network by forcing yourself upon people and not taking `` no '' for an answer all while under the guise of trying to schedule a professional peer-industry meeting . They essentially want you to act like a used car salesman . It is a useless book and if it was n't free for the kindle edition I would 've never picked it up .	-1
This book is very misleading . Instead of going into depth over what people who are in debt should do , it follows the author 's experience employed by a collection agency . I really do n't have a lot of sympathy for folks who take this kind of job , even if they get ripped off . Basically , he spends about the last 30 pages telling you stuff you were really hoping the entire book covered , but glosses over it.There are better books out there .	-1
I got this for free for Kindle so I do n't feel too cheated . The title is misleading . The book is less about the soul of beer and more about the business of brewing . It is mildly interesting as a book about the beer industry . 45 % of the book is the actual book . 34 % is endnotes which should have been eliminated or incorporated into the text . I did not read them since there were so many that reading them would have completely destroyed the flow of reading the text . There are two very short appendixes , and the rest is an index . A good editor could have made this much more entertaining and enlightening .	-1
Not terribly compelling for me , but then I 'm not in marketing . Fluffily written , but still a slog for a layperson like me .	-1
this book was funny , sarcastic , and unmotivationally motivating . reverse psychology at it 's best . i guess would work best with a moody teen or something . it got old fast and i found myself rolling my eyes through most of it . i guess i 'm a moody adult . i did n't really enjoy the read and i 'm glad i did n't have to purchase it . where have all the good books gone ? ?	-1
I was hoping this book would give me some techniques for improving my company . What I got was a motivational speech . Very big on generalities , very light on details.Much of the book is a parable : a story designed to illustrate the concept and teach a lesson . And the concept seems to be `` Develop the attitude that this is a great place to work , and it will happen ! `` The author describes a lot of ideas ... Hoopla Teams , `` THE Conversation '' , for example . But she does n't provide a lot of details on what they are , or explanations of how they work . Chapters on dealing with employees who are n't buying in to the program consist of a lot of description of their negative behaviors and attitudes , and a couple of sentences on how to deal with the . Which usually amount to `` have THE Conversation '' with them.And of course , the parable serves to prove the theory of the book , because that 's the way it was written . The book is written in an informal style , where we learn that one character `` cut into her steak , just the right shade of pink '' while discussing generalities with someone whose company was in trouble . That might be a nice detail in a novel , but it does n't add anything to the subject . Do n't tell me how she cut her steak , tell me how she fixed her company ! Some of the `` examples '' of how this system works were pretty far fetched . A bank implements the plan and `` the energy shifted completely the next day '' , and `` it became the buzz all over town '' . Even more incredibly , `` the mood of the entire town changed '' as all the other businesses in town applied the same system . Sorry , I just do n't buy that.If you want an inspirational pep talk , this might be a good book . But if you 're looking for some detailed advice on improving the morale and quality of service at your company , you 'll need to look elsewhere .	-1
The book was ok at best . It is supposed to be a tell all book of how to get motivated to go to work at a place where you really do n't want to be . Really it is a rehash of her past books as well as it seems like the author is holding back info instead of giving it all . Maybe she is holding the info for another book . Anyway the book is a easy read and is n't extremely long . It just does n't have much substance to it at all .	-1
First ... .anyone who gets this book will note that the print is exceedingly TINY ! ! ! TINY to the max . I am not visually impaired ! Then ... it is huge and heavy.Too little in the way of useful phrases . such as ... '' where can I find ... '' ? Much too scholarly ! If chatting with Italian friends ... and have a smattering of Italian ... and they of English ... .not appropriate.I am buying small , useful phrase and word dictionary instead . Will sell this to a used book store .	-1
I down loaded & # 34 ; The Catcher In The Rye & # 34 ; onto my Kindle as part of this & # 34 ; modern classic novels & # 34 ; phase that I 'm going through . Orwell , H.G . Wells , Capote , etc . You know the type . I 've always understood that this novel was a cult classic with inner meanings and supposedly enough impact to cause a man to be motivated to murder John Lennon . Quite similar to that of a man who was motivated to kill a group of celebrities and start a race war because of hidden meanings he thought he heard in the song , & # 34 ; Helter Skelter & # 34 ; . After reading & # 34 ; The Catcher In The Rye & # 34 ; , I do n't understand why it has received such praise . It is nothing more than the revelations of an adolescent man 's rambling thoughts which at times , make no sense at all . The dialog is reminiscent of that used for the period in which it takes place and at times it took me back to & # 34 ; The Three Stooges & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; The Untouchables & # 34 ; . Though guy talk . The plot is practically nonexistent with no sense of where it should take the reader and really does n't take the reader anywhere that she or he was before reading the novel . If this book is filled with inner or hidden meanings , I ca n't for the life of me see them . It 's just the aimless ramblings of a manic depressant kid . I could identify with some of the feelings that Holden Caulfield ( the main character ) expresses with those of my own teenage years , but I do n't think that they were interesting enough to write prose about . To sum up , I do n't understand what Salinger was trying to say , what he wanted the reader to see or feel , or where he wanted to take them . I was very disappointed with this piece and thought about putting it down for good several times during my reading . I would not recommend this book to anyone .	-1
I have been wondering all these years about this book..everyone raves about it , calls it a classic , my niece even said she re-reads it every few years , so that did it , I bought the damn book..read the damn book , then when I finished the last page I wondered why everyone thinks this is such a great book..maybe it was the times , or maybe they do n't read a lot of books , but I find that there are many , many better authors than J.D . Salinger ... hmmm , maybe it 's just me	-1
Be warned , this slim book is controvertial because it contains foul language . I am not particularly sensitive to such language , having grown up around some wonderful , earthy characters , however even I found this excessive -- puerile even . Perhaps shocking for the sake of being shocking ? I was turned off and just stopped reading it after a while ( which is unusual for me ) . I did not see enough of the expected `` artistic merit '' to spur me on further . By all means give this book a try -- you now know what to expect , perhaps you 'll have better luck . Either way , write you own review -- maybe I will be inspired to try again !	-1
This is quite possibly the worst book I 've ever read . A good friend of mine recommended it to me and I kept reading expecting something more ... It just seemed to keep going on without any real purpose .	-1
The narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is a sixteen-year-old smart-mouth and like most smart-mouths he is intolerable . I assume it was Salinger 's intent to make him unlikable and he did a brilliant job .	-1
I thoroughly enjoyed Naipaul 's two travelogues that took him through this part of the world . This book , however , is baffling . It reads as if it were torn from the middle of a much longer work , and its grammar and diction are so thick as to obscure the point Naipaul is attempting to make much of the time . Not recommended .	-1
After several distractions , and more than two months , I finally reached the end of Steinbeck 's so-called 'epic ' . Apparently , I should have watched the movie instead.There 's not a lot to add to previous reviews . The story is long , unfocused , long , rambling , long , cliched , long , tiresome , long , repetitious , and not short.The scope of the story is simply too large , and there are too many characters who ultimately add nothing to the drama . The 'modern day Cain and Abel ' angle is worn into the ground long before the story even turns its attention to Cal and Aron . The previous generation ( Charles and Adam ) make perhaps the dullest pair of charcters ever put together in any work of fiction , and the long , incresingly frequent digressions to catch up on the Hamiltons , the progress of American history and its impact on Salinas , and the state of the prostitution industry , serve to slow this book to a glacial pace.The Chinese housekeeper , Lee , is perhaps the only saving grace in the second half of the book , although the final scene involving he , Cal , and Adam redeems some , if not all of the novel 's shortcomings.Generally , 'East of Eden ' disappoints , because it asks readers to make a long-term emotional investment in a largely lifeless and dull saga , populated ( with only a few exceptions ) by cardboard characters.In my view , Steinbeck was at his best with more compact novels or short stories . 'Eden ' might have worked better if Steinbeck had followed the more loosely-formatted framework of 'Cannery Row ' , rather than weighing down this story with so much verbiage .	-1
This story just failed to really make me want to read until I was done with the story I would not suggest this to any of my friends it just failed on every level.It is not a great approach to the whole story line and I did not care for the book at all .	-1
This short , depressing and harrowing tale is very well written . The text flows smoothly , thoughts are well addressed and the horror is very well conveyed . My main issue is that once you 've read it you 're just left in a depressed mood with no real insight or revelation just a bleak reminder of a very horrific tragedy.It 's gruesome scene after gruesome scene on every page and by the end you 're mentally exhausted from imagining the toll of terror that had taken place but that 's it . You just feel bad and that 's not a read that I 'd recommend.I had been recommended this book by several people and I saw it was very famous of several lists so I was hoping for something a lot more . I was not aware this was a trilogy until after I finished reading this first book so I will finish the series and hope that it gets better along with some more depth and purpose . The excuse I saw one lecturer reply with was ` sometimes we need to feel bad for the sake of feeling bad ' . I strongly disagree that that statement would apply to this book , yes , feeling bad can be eye opening for certain occasions but this is not one of them	-1
After seeing the ridiculous floor plan in this book of Nero Wolfe 's house , I wondered if the author actually ever read any of the novels .	-1
Okay , this edition of Finnegans Wake may not exactly be dishonest , but it is disingenuous enough to be seriously misleading . Up front they tell you that the text of the book is taken from the first edition published in May of 1939 . This is true , but it does n't tell the whole story , and most people have no idea what it really means.Finnegans Wake was originally published in 1939 . The first edition was replete with errors and typos -- thousands of them . James Joyce spent the last two years of his life ( he died in 1941 ) going through the text correcting the mistakes . An errata list comprising many single-spaced pages was printed in the back of the second edition , and the third edition had all of Joyce 's corrections incorporated into the text . So the third edition is the definitive one.But Penguin is reprinting the first edition . Get it ? The text you 'll be reading will have all of the typos that Joyce spent two years correcting -- uncorrected.Viking does have the third edition of Finnegans Wake in print . It 's smaller , with smaller type and not nearly as pretty a cover , but it 's the text that Joyce approved . I would get that one ( it has a white cover with a green stripe going across the middle of it ) , and leave this edition alone .	-1
Clearly , Edward Crankshaw is a fluent , coherent , well informed writer . But it is equally clear he is not an academically trained historian , nor one who strives for objectivity . Sadly , his prejudices and preconceptions are as ill-formed as they are ill-concealed , and they gravely damage his credibility.An ardent and sincere admirer of both the Austro-Hungarian Empire ( and likely the concept of empire itself ) , as well of its long reigning emperor , Franz Josef , this work is in essence an apologia and lament.Initially , I was intrigued by the unconventional interpretations ( which prompt a healthy questioning of received opinion ) , but after a while Crankshaw writes more unguardedly.Most notably , is his view ( presented without detailed support ) there was nothing ` inherently unstable ' about the empire ( a jury-rigged house of cards at best ) which under different circumstance could have survived W.W.I and prospered . Additionally , he has a strong ( and equally unsupported ) distaste for the Hungarians who he depicts as severely oppressive to ethnicities under their control , while casting them as the central disruptive , destabilizing element of the empire , imprudently indulged by an honor-bound Emperor.So far , novel and intriguing - perhaps.But somewhere around the 3/4 point , more off-kilter views emerge.Example ? `` Politically , the disintegration of European civilization expressed itself in nationalism ; morally in Bismarckian diplomacy and the technique of using calculated aggression as an instrument of policy ; spiritually in romanticism , the glorification of the individual impulse . '' ( p. 308 ) Surely this says more about Crankshaw 's own simplistic understanding of disintegration , nationalism , war and diplomacy , and the Romantic movement , than it does about any of the nominal topics.More unfortunately , he indulges in an anti-semitic , ` blame the victim ' analysis of the rise of Viennese anti-semitism . `` The cultural life of the city was dominated by Jews to an extent which was clearly unhealthy : pouring in from Bohemia , Moravia , Galicia , and Bukovina , they quite failed to realize their own strength and , by pushing too hard , made it all too easy for crude and unscrupulous men to play on the latent spirit of anti-semitism . '' ( p. 313 ) This was the screech of chalk across the blackboard - I had to acknowledge I was reading the work of an intellectually flawed , albeit knowledgeable author.Admittedly I did pick up some interesting tidbits , ( that most important period word , ` fortwursteln ` - muddling through - was coined by longtime minister Eduard Taaffe ; and that Marie Vetsera was not the first woman Crown Prince Rudolph asked to join him in suicide ) . Crankshaw may be reliable in such details , but in regard to the larger picture , he is eager to fit events into his own analysis .	-1
Just did n't like it , was boring , did n't know if the it was a dream or a story , did n't like the personalities of the people .	-1
The author William Duffy concocted this book out of stories and hearsay sitting in his apartmenton 93rd Street in Manhattan . This is widely known and acknowledged ; intentionally sensationalto promote book sales . B Holiday disavowed any cooperation with the author.Read a modern biography for the truth .	-1
In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels , i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.from the very first page , the book had me hooked . merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree . in her family , she 's a bit of a misfit , and as a consequence , finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.everyone hates them and wants them gone . merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house . the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she , head lifted , tries bravely to remain unafraid.it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses .	-1
This is an AWFUL book . Two sad sisters with a disturbed Uncle hiding in one home with only the one poor sister going out to town to the store and having townfolk who hate and tease her each time she does so.The secret comes out at the end - about the murder - but the whole book is a real downer . It is sad , Pathetic and show how cruel people are .	-1
I read this because I was starting out in creative writing and thought that reading well known `` literary '' fiction would help develop my talents . I should have stuck to the Great Gatsby and the Sun Also Rises.This book desperately avoids any of the conventional trappings of fiction : character , plot , setting , tension , etc . No one in it is convincing , I do n't care about their problems , I 'm uninterested in where they live.Delillio uses their local supermarket as an extended metaphor for the characters ' rampant commercialism as their shopping trips turn into orgasmic experiences of materialistic indulgence . At first I thought this was funny and in a sense true , i.e . we all spend a little more time worrying about having the latest and greatest `` IT '' gadget . But then I thought , wait , who the hell enjoys grocery shopping let alone REVELS in it ? No one I know -- it 's a chore that we do because we have to.Six months after reading White Noise , I remember nothing except for a lukewarm moral : do n't be so materialistic . Great , I did n't need a book to tell me that . Theme is supposed to emerge from a work of fiction ; White Noise is nothing but a ( tepid ) theme , with a few literary trappings about it to trick people into reading it . And that is what this book really is ; a silly trick by a critic 's darling to help us feel more self-rightous , i.e . I read this book so I 'm smarter than the rest of you .	-1
Much like when I read On the Road by Jack Keruac , I read 2/3 of White Noise and did n't bother finishing it . My initial thought on the author is that he is trying to be Kurt Vonnegut . Satire is a tricky genre to tackle without resorting outrageous humor and I can appreciate DeLillo 's attempt . Here we are introducted to Mr. & amp ; Mrs. Gladney living what should be an idealic life , he is a professor and she a teacher and reader to the blind . What is supposed to be satiracal is that he teaches Hilter Studies and she teaches common sense stuff and read tabloid stories to the blind . Oh yeah , I sure see the witty light in this one.Husband and wife seem to be preoccupied with the fear of death to the point of internal paraylsis . Perhaps it seeped into everything and infected those around them because none of the characters seem remotely interesting and speak in dry stale dialouge that goes on and one . I do n't mind overwrought dialouges since I 've read plenty of books where family conversations and arguements seem to take up entire chapters but atleast then it is full of life and vigor . Perhaps the constant fear of death have made everybody subconsious zombies.I do n't know if DeLillo is trying to be the next Vonnegut or not , but for now I 'll stick to the original .	-1
I mean , I guess if you 've never read Salinger or Bukowski , you 'll think this book is okay . Frankly , his writing style is unimaginative and dated , and his plot seems to move aimlessly , but not in a very charming or interesting way . Main character gets drunk and stumbles around a lot and fails at playing tennis , and then he tries to direct a movie and then moves around from various US cities to Britain and back . He has a few friends and offends a lot of people . And a lot of people tell him to stop being such a jerk . And he has some pseudo-philosophies about money , but not really , because he just talks about that money exists and that he has a lot of money and that money runs the world.The book is supposed to be a kind of discourse on how money ruins people , but I 'm not exactly sure how this story brings new ideas to the table . Money corrupts . I 'm not sure how this is a new message.If you want an interesting book on money , read A. M. Homes 's _This Book Will Save Your Life_ . If you want an interesting book on consumerism , read DeLillo 's _White Noise_ . If you want a book on money that wo n't teach you anything new and will re-hash other authors ' techniques , go ahead and pick this up .	-1
There are many myths about the Australian Aborigines and most of them are misguided . As a white Australian I do n't profess to any special understanding of the Aboriginal , but I do know that it is wrong to try to measure their success or failure in terms of European cultural traditions . What matters is that Aborigines are honoured for what they are , for their own culture . I feel that I need to make the same effort with the Aboriginal culture but it is difficult since it has been dominated so much by Europeans . What exactly is the Aboriginal culture - one of the oldest isolated cultures in the world ? We should not fall into the trap of assuming it to be a homogeneous culture across such a vast empty space , and one that lived in harmony with nature - always complimenting and never changing the environment . A great place to start getting some empathy with Aboriginal people is Josephine Flood 's 'Archaeology of the Dreamtime'Chatwin 's 'Songlines ' is colourful and worth reading but to me it was also disappointing , seeming to apply a far too European explanation to what he 'observed ' or , at least , interpreted . If it is your step into further exploration on the culture of the ancient race of the Australian Aborigines then read it by all means . My voyage of discovery with the Aborigines was triggered by finding a skull being excavated by wind on the dunes at the back of a lonely beach , but that 's another story ... ..Recommendations : 'Archaeology of the Dreamtime ' by Josephine Floodaboriginal cave paintings	-1
I just could not get & # 34 ; into & # 34 ; Father Brown 's short mysteries . The stories just could n't hold my interest . I I deleted this book after reading only a few .	-1
Maybe at the time the short stories were written they were good . Presentely , they are very silly ! I stopped reading the book !	-1
I thought I would enjoy these as detective stories but they are not written in a style I enjoy . The stories seem unreal ( which of course they are ) and do n't connect with me . Others may enjoy this style .	-1
The very first thing you read in this book is a mistake . The Prologue begins with a photo of German POWs at the end of WWI . The photo caption states that the German Army at the end of WWI was `` unbroken '' and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership . This is doubly misleading . The German Army was soundly defeated on Western Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate . In 1918 , Germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg . The political leaders who lost will were the German High Command . Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army . Keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious `` stab in the back '' myth used by the German military and right wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic . Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters.This type of error recurs throughout this book . My favorite relatively minor error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields , a major strategic resource , from Romania to Hungary . See prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude . Just as important and in some cases even more important are Keegan 's failures to discuss crucial aspects of WWII . He makes little effort , for example , to discuss the origins of the war . Indeed , his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss . Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic , there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic . Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war , we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization . Instead of a discussion of the sad history of the Weimar Republic , crucial for understanding the ascent of the Nazis , we get another misleading discussion of the Freikorps phenomenon . Among other significant omissions are his failure to grapple with the possible strategic significance of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany , a issue analyzed insightfully by Richard Overy in 2 of his excellent books . Keegan 's discussion of the Holocaust in both inadequate and implicitly misleading . Partly because he does n't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by Nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in crucial respects the Holocaust was the point of German aggression . The Nazis went to war not just to overturn the Versailles settlement or even to conquer Eastern Europe , but to impose their bizarre notions of racial conflict on the rest of Europe . Without this background , its impossible to understand the outbreak and the specific nature of WWII . Among other things , Nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the western Soviet Union , a factor in their eventual defeat . As pointed out by other reviewers , Keegan devotes a disproportionate amount of the book to activities of the Western allies when the Eastern front was really the crucial theatre.To be fair to Keegan , writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very difficult . The best 1 volume work on WWII is Gerhard Weinberg 's book , which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly small font . Some of the individual sections of this book are quite good and Keegan has a nice , sometimes actually elegant , writing style . None of these positive features , however , can overcome his neglect of basic features of WWII and the lack of attention to basic facts . This is not just error , this is actual negligence .	-1
I did not like this book . I found it boring and almost porographic in places .	-1
This book reeks ( pun intended ) of warped teenage sentimentality and middle-aged male perversion . It might appeal to a teen as provocatively profound and disturbing . ( Hmm a Nirvana song is based on it . ) It might appeal to those whose fetishes tend toward violence . For the rest of us , the story tries so hard to be bizzare in an artistic sort of way that it ends up being monotonous . Parts of the book really drag . The end is more comical than harrowing . The end is just too fantastical . The characters are like deaf mutes on sedatives . There is no reason to believe in , care for or justify the main character.You 'd get red in the cheeks if you had to tell your Mother about this book you just read . She 'd know immediately that the emperor has no clothes.The author tried to make literature but he ended up with a cartoon , granted a cartoon set in an interesting time and place ( hence the 2 stars ) , but a color cartoon nonetheless .	-1
This is a very OLD-school book . It is mostly talk about his live , author ` s 40 trading experience in 70-x . There were a lot of changes since then , and this book has just a historical value .	-1
I was looking forward to reading this book once I saw the incredible comments about it : `` brilliant '' , `` amazing '' , `` a dazzling achievement '' , `` a new departure for the American novel '' . But what a waste of money ... Not only was the book dull and obvious , but it was also pretentious . Do not expect to find anything similar to a mistery novel or even a detective story . It 's about a writer ( yes , so original ) who clearly does n't know what to do with his life . So , he decides that pretending to be a detective is a good way of spending his time .	-1
In decades of reading thousands of books , this was the only book I could n't finish . I did enjoy his `` Haroun and the Sea of Stories '' , but this was a mess .	-1
The plot seems promising but this book is a dreary slog.Any excitement is subsumed in banality and the author seems so impressed with the quality of his writing that he buries the story in long-winded monologues and descriptions.The characters are neither interesting nor likeable , the interesting point should be their talents but the book spends little time on that , instead giving a meandering history of India mixed with childish peeves and sulks.There is endless foreshadowing of important events to come , as if these teasers should be enough to keep you reading while the book plods along with nothing happening for page after page.If you like fantasy this book will bore you , if you like history it will annoy you , I have no idea how so many people have enjoyed this.I pushed through two thirds of this unenjoyable muck before giving up .	-1
Sanders may be a genius in his field but the book is painfully dull and slow , despite it not being very long . Why ? Because the writing and presentation of fascinating information should have been much more carefully edited . Instead , we get the persistent drone of `` this is what I 'll tell you , '' `` this is what I 'm telling you , '' `` this is what I 'm going to tell you . '' I wish he 'd had an editor who could have pushed him to make the book what it needs to be : accessible and inviting to an average intelligent reader . I left academia a long time ago and am reminded of why I was glad to go when I read books presented in this dreary style . I 'm not asking this to be dumbed down , but one can write for intelligent readers without being dry and unappealing .	-1
I do n't consider myself to be a total idiot . I 've read a little psychology , a lot of philosophy , quite a bit of mythology , and have a fair grasp of history . At the same time , I 'm also open to what today we call `` New Age '' or `` occult '' even if I am always going to be a bit of a skeptic . None of that really helped here . Ever read a paragraph and realize that you did n't really get what you just read ? This might happen if you 're tired , or lose your focus for a minute . Then you go back and re-read it and it makes more sense . Well , The Portable Jung reads like that initial scenario for me from start to finish , no matter how focused I am . The thing is , when I read a summary of Jung 's ideas from another writer , I understand exactly what is being said . The collective unconscious , anima/animus , the shadow ... it makes sense . Then I read Jung 's own writing and ca n't connect the sentences . My grandmother says it just must be `` bad writing . '' I do n't know . Maybe Jung sensed in his own time the hostility and ultimate rejection of his ideas by the scientific community and always wrote and spoke that way to avoid the ridicule that plainer speaking of such unorthodox subject matter would provoke . ( Wow , multiply the awkwardness of that sentence by 10 and you 'd think I was channeling the spirit of ol ' Gustav ) . Ironically , Jung has pretty much been ditched by the psychological community and embraced by English majors , such as myself , who would receive the written equivalent of a scowl from our professors if we ever wrote with the pretentiousness and virtually alien syntax of this book . Anyway , I worked and worked at appreciating The Portable Jung , reading as carefully as possible . I really wanted to like it . But first I needed to understand what I was reading sentence by sentence . I never did ( however , the reasoning , when the clouds occasionally parted , seems to be pretty much what you 'd expect from anyone trying to justify what is essentially parapsychology . Check out the references to the 300-something `` random '' interpretations of a patient 's dreams , which , ta-da , remarkably revolve around the idea of alchemy and an Asiatic symbol called a mandala ) . 2 stars , though , since I did start keep track of my dreams a bit more ( however I have concluded that a recent dream involving rollerskating had more to a movie preview I saw the day before of `` ATL '' rather than the Wheel Of Life ) .	-1
There has been a resurgence of interest in Barthelme 's work so I thought I 'd go back and re-read him . After all , I 'm older and presumably wiser : now I should be able to appreciate him , something I did n't really do when I first read him.Uh , actually , I 'm still not impressed.Barthelme is to literature what Spike Jones is to music . He 's a novelty act , a sideshow.Not to say that he 's untalented or lacking in intelligence . Far from it . But there 's too much of the clever graduate student in love with the tap-tap-tap of his typewriter . Because of his committment to absurdity at all costs , he would n't do anything as un-cool as develop a character or create a situation that really involves the reader . Everything is seen from a great distance and the viewpoint is always ironic and detatched.It may be that bringing so many of his stories into one volume really does him a dis-service . Maybe if I 'd come upon just one of them in a magazine or an anthology , it would have been impressive . But as presented here he just calls on the same old bag of tricks over and over and over.I guess I 'm just too much of a traditionalist . I consider & quot ; Cat in the Rain & quot ; by Ernest Hemingway and & quot ; The Far and the Near & quot ; by Thomas Wolfe to be the two greatest short stories of the century . So I 'd advise readers to go back to these two masters to see how short fiction ought to be written .	-1
I 've got a pretty strong stomach for rough stuff , but it never lets up in Red Sorghum . And it 's the repetition of it that finally chokes me . And yes , please do n't say & # 34 ; red sorghum & # 34 ; again . I had to quit right after that section where the dog packs keep returning . It seemed it would never stop . Did anyone else have trouble figuring out who was narrating ? Was it now the father , grandfather , son , greatgrandfather ?	-1
Maybe this is meant to be a woman 's book and that is why I do n't like it ( I am a guy ) . I found it boring , overly mellow dramatic , I found the characters uninteresting , and the story dragged . While I often like the Fantasy genre , most of it is mush and this book is an excellent example of that .	-1
I borrowed `` The Mists of Avalon '' on audio book at my local library . Since it was read by one of my favorite narrators , Davina Porter , I thought I would have a grand time . I was looking forward to this version of the Arthurian tale . I was really disappointed , however , and did not finish the second book ( nor did I read the next two volumes ) .My main critic is that all the female characters , without exception , whine constantly about a variety of topics : not beautiful enough , not powerful enough , not loved enough , etc . For a book about supposedly powerful women who shaped the world and took control of their destiny , they sure lament a lot . This litany of lamentations goes on and on to the point of boredom and exasperation . It would have been nice to feel a little empowerment here and there ! I took a particular dislike to Gwynivere , Arthur 's wife , with her narrow minded , self-centered and frankly bigot attitude.I felt let down by the author and hope this is not a reflection of her view of women in general .	-1
I have read the short version and the long version ( which includes a middle chapter about an old Indian man ) . Neither version is one I would give a child , unless I wanted to put them off horses for life.The boy on a small ranch is given a pony which contracts a disease called strangles and dies.The old Indian steals an old horse that 's worth nothing and rides off on it.The boy is promised a foal from a mare but when the mare 's foaling goes wrong a ranch hand bashes her head in and cuts her open to rip out the foal.Still think it 's suitable for young people ? It 's not .	-1
I had to read this in school as a kid . The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing . I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events . Steinbeck has none of that in this book . The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book . Things go from bad to worse as the little boy 's dreams are shattered . Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it ! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story . As an adult I know it 's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still do n't like this book and think it 's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories . I know it 's supposed to be a classic , the problem is I do n't know WHY ! Some readers say `` this is a great book for readers of all ages '' but I would have to disagree ! I do n't think this is a kids book . I do n't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I do n't think I would ever read it again .	-1
The Good : The story is classic and the writing is easy to get though.The Bad : This was definitely the case of the movie being better than the book . I saw the Gary Sinise version in high school and I remember the visual portrayal being a lot more entertaining that the writing here . For a short book , not much happens and it what does happen is very slow paced .	-1
I was made to read this for English and thoroughly disliked every moment of it . I thought the plot was boring and it was n't nearly as good as everyone appears to believe it is.The only reason I am not giving 1 star is because when I look back on the story I can sort of see it being realistic , but then again every time I hear mention of this book I pretty much get nightmares .	-1
This book is a miniature book . Its almost like a pocket book . Its very small if you were expecting a normal size book .	-1
I gave up reading this `` Gibberish /Jargon `` at about the 125th page . Jargon is defined as speech or writing full of long , unfamiliar , or roundabout words or phrases . Jargon accurately describes this novel . If you want to read 400 pages of jargon and try to figure out what Mr. Conrad is trying to say , then this book is definitely for you . I 'm sure Mr. Conrad was an excellent sailor but a writer he is not .	-1
This was the worse copy of a book - it is clean and obviously copied from another book - there is NOTHING in it - no pages to show anything about when it was written , publisher etc . There is an ISBN no . on the back 9781461036302 . It looks like somebody copied it and had it bound . I had a hard cover of the book previously from Amazon and someone borrowed it and did n't return . This was very disappointing .	-1
This is Anatole France 's cautionary tale about ideological fanaticism during the `` terror '' of the French revolution . It is doubly remarkable in that it was published in the decade prior to the Soviet seizure of power , which imposed decades of political terror in Russia as we know , and in that France was a well-known member of the left . Thus , academics rightfully proclaim it as a symbol of the horrors to follow in the 20C.Unfortunately , I did not enjoy this book very much . Not only is its tone self-important with ponderous and ever-present references to classical mythology - the myth of Orestes as well as the bacchantes - but its innumerable references to obscure figures of the French Revolution , in all their historical accuracy , make it , well , just plain boring . Moreover , the characters appear more like symbols of abstract ideas than flesh-and-blood creatures , and so are both unrealistic psychologically as well as put in situations in which they can carry out long and improbably philosophic discussions.The plot follows the impoverished members of an apartment building during a time of grave threat to the revolution . There is a fervent young man ( a painter and revolutionary fanatic ) , his missing sister ( shacked up with an aristocrat ) , his simple mother , and an older cynic atheist ( an ex-courtier and libertine ) , who gives refuge to a persecuted priest and innocent peasant girl . As the revolution takes an increasingly murderous turn , they become ever more intimately involved with each other as vehicles to portray historical events.As such , the book seems to be written for the French high school student , all of whom memorize survey literature from secondary sources to pass rigorous examinations . This makes them able to spout facts as if they had read widely , implying depth and thoughtfulness that all too often is n't there . Of course , France obviously has great depth and his historical research is indeed exhaustive , which taught me a great deal . But the book just did n't make me feel like I was there , which was why I read it . Instead , while reading I felt like I was studying for a high school exam.As I try to get through the classic authors , I am occasionally surprised at the banality and dullness of some of the most famous works . Perhaps this is because I read them from a rather na 've perspective , open and as if they are not revered for whatever , but just as a pure reading experience . Thus , my perceptions are personal and limited to my own experience . While the overwhelming majority of classics are truly wonderful , this one was not.Recommended only for history buffs and students of French lit .	-1
.. before I gave up the book out of sheer boredom . I suppose the point of the book is a beat-inspired play on phonyness . Yawn . There 's a lot ( and I mean a LOT ) of well-crafted pseudo-intellectual blather from major and minor characters that tries to move the story forward , but wordiness does not make a masterpiece . I still think it 's important that , first , a novel describe - the who what when where - and much of the time I was even confused about who was talking , and to whom . Other reviews mention Ulysses , and Pynchon ; well even in the thickest tangles of those works I knew what was going on . I 'll probably reread this from time and pick up where I left off ; I do n't expect much revelation in the second half .	-1
While John Steinbeck is a master of Literature , The Long Valley 's stories are all dull and some do n't even feel like stories , but just descriptions of things ( the short story `` Breakfast '' was overly pointless ) . This collection starts off great , with a couple of wonderful stories , but the second half of the book ( along with The Red Pony parts ( another of John Steinbeck 's drab writings ) ) is very bad and yawn-inducing.My favorite story was `` The Flight '' , and that is the only reason I am rating this 2 stars instead of 1 . `` Johnny Bear '' is also a good story in this collection , and a fairly humorous one as well.Check this out at the library for a couple of good stories , but do not purchase it as it would be a waste of money . If you want to read great works by Steinbeck , check out East Of Eden , The Grapes Of Wrath , and Of Mice And Men .	-1
I know it is looked down upon when a `` classic '' novel gets a less-than stellar review , but it is appropriate in this case.Steinbeck 's last book is extremely disappointing , mainly because of its unbearably slow pace . The story of a man who veers away from his stringent moral code is a strong premise . However , very little happens in the book . The narrative is plagued by the main character 's irrelevant musings and the odd shifts in POV . I struggled to finish the book , especially the last 90 pages , and there is no real payoff.Steinbeck certainly has the talent ( Of Mice and Men is amazing ) but good writing is only part of the formula for a good book . It should also have some element of entertainment . Sadly , this book is flat out boring.It is a shame that Steinbeck did not end his career with a better book.Steven Donahue was a copywriter for TV Guide magazine for 14 years .

What is missing from Siva Naipaul 's account of Africa is Africans . His writing is sharp and incisive , but most of it is based on interactions with the people he manages to interact without much effort : hoteliers , bureaucrats , fellow travellers , immigration officials . As such , the picture he portrays of Africa in the seventies is how Whites , Asians , and a few mid level African bureaucrats . His dismissal of socialism in Tanzania is entirely based on whether the hotel bus works or not , what one particular local individual has to say about the state of affairs , and a few other characters . What is missing is an understanding of the state of the majority . At least in Tanzania , he tries but fails to visit a concept village , but in Kenya and Zambia , he does n't even bother to try to find out for real how common people have fared under ideological states like Tanzania , semi-idealist state of Zambia and the completely free-for-all-takers Kenya.What saves this book somehow is a reasonably well articulated investigation of African hatred of Asians and a few generalizations ( e.g . both blacks and whites deserve each other , both are not worth a tear , both have been corrupted by contact with each other ) , which though sweeping in nature , are thought provoking enough to call for a better book to dwell more thoroughly on the same questions .	-1
That was the first thing I remember thinking when reading the book . It was strange . Lyrical . Disjointed . Meandering . The book has been lauded as a masterpiece and I am sure it will be studied for generations . However personally I did n't find it interesting . In fact I thought it was a con . A joke buried in a elaborate set of words that were strung together by a chimpanzee and recorded by Pynchon . Accomplished ? It would n't be a word I would use . Perhaps the words for me would be clammy and cold.Joyce 's Ulysses , another hard book , is worth the time . I think the reader is enriched for the experience of reading it . Gravity 's Rainbow not so much . For me anyway . There are other 'hard ' books that have a payoff for the hours you pour into them but not this one .	-1
I do n't like historical novels , they are not an easy read because I do n't feel like I am visiting the people , I feel like it is an account of something happening elsewhere	-1
I really wanted to like this book , I really did . Terse and sometimes difficult prose , drug flavored stream of consciousness , and heaping allusions to The Odyssey and pulp comic book heroes . At first the book seemed perfect for me , but not unpredictably Richard Farina 's creative well was poisoned by the usual dose of misogyny . Usually I can stand some cognac in my literature , but in this case it felt as if there was more poison than water . Been Down is a frustrating book , where Farina 's hatred of women overcomes , strangles , shoots , poisons , and drowns out any of his natural talent.Been Down follows Gnossos Pappadopoulis as he navigates his way through college while the whiteheads of the sixties rebellion make their way through his circle of friends . Early on he seduces an engaged woman who quickly falls in love with Gnossos . Why ? I have no clue because the description of the `` seduction '' veers precariously close to date rape . It is easily the least erotic love scene I 've read . When the seduced woman informs her fianc & eacute ; that she is in love with Gnossos , he ends up committing suicide . A paragraph of regret later and Gnossos is back to his old ways.Gnossos eventually gets bitten by the love bug when he meets Kristin ( of course , if you 've read the novel you 'll know that 's not the only bug he gets bitten by ) . This gives Farina the opportunity to delve into some drug induced conversation and scenes . The first psychedelic set piece is rather successful , and it involves Farina describing a dream where he encounters a wolf . It actually plays rather well by taking the form of an allegory but denying the reader any strict one-to-one metaphor . This strong passage is offset by another psychedelic piece involving a demonic monkey . Yes , you read that right . It 's funny for all the wrong reasons , and the only way I was able to get past these passages was by imagining the evil monkey that lives in Chris Griffin 's closet on The Family Guy . ( I took a similar approach in getting through Wuthering Heights by imagining that Joseph was the spitting image of Groundskeeper Willie ) .Well , it goes without saying that Gnossos ' love ends when they have a falling out , she becomes pregnant but decides to rid herself of the child , and , naturally , at the end of the book Gnossos ends up forcibly giving her a heroin suppository . Once again , you read that correctly . There are more subtle examples of Farina 's misogyny , but you have to admit he saved the most flagrant for the finale.At one point Kristin asks Gnossos if he ever gets tires `` thinking about stuff all the time . '' This line is second only to the demonic monkey in unintentional humor . If you 've ever wondered why so many progressive hippies became straight laced businessmen or fanatic evangelicals , then I have two untested observations . First , for a certain age group being a hippie was the norm , and for many was merely conformity to a subculture ( Charles Manson comes to mind ) . Second , many just could not escape the lifestyle their parents had raised them in since birth . A summer of love ca n't quite overcome a childhood filled with gender roles . Farina suffers from the latter and it is readily apparent in Been Down.It 's a shame that Richard Farina dies so young , because at times you can see the talent peeping out of this novel . The prose can be really strong and unique , but unfortunately Farina suffers from an immaturity that is beneath his years . I can sense that a good book was in him if he has survived . Perhaps by the time he was sixty he would have written a novel with the insight of a thirty-year-old ?	-1
After the intellectual Left killed off God , they found themselves staring into the abyss ; absent God what is the meaning of life ? There have been many , mostly feeble , attempts to answer this question . The most disastrous have , of course , been Darwinism -- we exist to propagate the species , Hegelianism/Marxism -- there are World Historical forces in control and Existentialism -- existence is it 's own point . Saul Bellow seems to fall into a loose grouping with the Existentialists and The Adventures of Augie March is essentially an existentialist tract . In a return to the style of the picaresque novels ( i.e. , Tom Jones ) , Augie March bobs along from Chicago to Mexico to Europe to an open boat in the Atlantic , experiencing life and meeting a variety of characters -- observing without judging , experiencing without changing , seeking without finding . Critics claim that this is a life affirming book ; but life does not need to be affirmed , it simply is . One recalls Dr. Johnson 's response to the argument that the material world does not exist : he kicked a rock and said , & quot ; I refute it thus ! & quot ; The task before us as human beings is to find or bring meaning to life . Great literature illuminates the human condition and reveals truths which help us discern this meaning . Bellow fails in this basic task and does so at mindnumbing length.GRADE : F	-1
Everyone talks about how great Gurdjieff is , but I ca n't read this book without feeling like a practical joke has been played on me . First , it 's long . Second , the setting and descriptions are ludicrous . Basically , I feel like Gurdjieff is either not telling me what he really knows , or he just has nothing to say . If you want to read a book on the mysteries , by a copy of the Kybalion at a half priced book store . At least I got it from the library .	-1
Like some of the other reviewers , I did n't make it through the first part of the book -- too much long-winded pseudo-mystical rambling . If it 's never occurred to you that you should try to find work that you find fulfilling , this book might spark some reflection and insight . If it has , you 're better off with Boldt 's other book , How to Find the Work You Love , or the old stand-by , What Color Is Your Parachute ?	-1

However , we know that the Pumpkin is not native to Ireland , and that , due to this fact , we know that a turnip was used in lieu of the former vegitable .

This book demonstrates first hand the difficulty of attempting singlehandedly to come to a & quot ; solution & quot ; to consciousness by merging several disciplines . I was amazed at the author 's quick acceptance of certain interpretations of cognitive psychological experiments . For example , take Miller 's experiments on the magic number 7 ( plus or minus 2 ) . Nrretranders interprets this and other like minded experiments that measure cognitive capacity to mean that we have a limit of what we can experience consciously of somewhere between 1 and 40 & quot ; bits & quot ; ( and most likely around 16 & quot ; bits & quot ; ) . Now , if you read the literature carefully , and if you use some common sense , you will find out two things . First of all , there is the widespread problem of memory that has never been dealt with satisfactorily . There is an inherent problem with trying to measure the contents of consciousness with some kind of report from the subject -- they will always be reporting on their memory of the event , and not the event itself . Since it is the contents of phenomenological consciousness that we care about ( and not the total processing , conscious and unconscious ) , it may be unknowable what the precise contents of consciousness are at a given moment , at least using current techniques.There is also a second and more damaging critique of Nrretranders ' calculations of the number of & quot ; bits & quot ; available to consciousness . That is this : Is one unit of information about the perceptual stream only a single bit ? Take for example the percept of seeing a full color photograph . What are you conscious of when you see it ? In Nrretranders ' estimation , only a couple of things at a time -- say the redness of a shirt , the expression of a face , etc . And there is of course evidence that you do not apprehend ( or commit to memory , anyway ) a large majority of the information that enters the senses . But this does not account for the richness of the percept , for example , of & quot ; the expression of a face & quot ; . Is this expression one bit ? Or is it the summary of hundreds of complex apprehension , recognition , and association bits of information ? What does it mean for something as complex as consciously perceiving a face to be reduced to a single bit of information ? The problem with this book , as with many of the books to come out recently on the topic of consciousness , is that the author has spelled out in a clear thesis what consciousness is , and how it can be characterized in such a way so that it will be easily understandable . And of course , that is what all good scientific theories strive to do -- reduce complex phenomena to something that is manageable and predictable . However , there is a failing here in that so much of the description and experience of consciousness has been lost by estimating how many bits it consists of . Consciousness is a notoriously changing and nebulous thing . Things can be nearly conscious , and percepts and ideas can lie on the fringe of consciousness -- this much has been well accepted since the time of William James . There is no clearly defined , perfectly stable box of consciousness , within which 16-40 bits of information reside.The thesis is an interesting one . But the support for it is not there . Every interested person in this topic seems to have his or her favorite simplification of what consciousness is ( 40hz activity in the brain , a winner-take-all network , a global workspace , and now a user illusion ) . I suspect the answer that is needed to really satisfy as a useful scientific theory will end up to be more complex and involved than any of these simplifications . Each has a certain draw to it , but it becomes confusing when you get scraps of the puzzle that each claim to contain the entire picture . Final analysis : there is no convincing reason to believe this view of consciousness over any other one , and the lack of rigerous scholarship ( i.e . in-depth analysis of the research ) discourages me from looking closer in this direction .	-1
I hated -- absolutely hated -- Nicholas , the male antagonist of `` Harvesting the Heart . '' I can see how callousness might help him in the operating room ( a la the eponymous character in the TV series `` House '' ) , but it 's no way to act towards the people in your life whom you are supposed to care for . I do n't care that his parents considered getting a divorce when he was ten , or that his boss at the hospital is a jerk . Just because you 're having a bad day -- or a bad year , for that matter -- does NOT give you license to poison the lives of others with your moodiness.So I was infuriated that Paige , the female protagonist , persisted in trying to reconcile with him in the final act of the book . Does she not see that he is only happy when he makes the people around him unhappy ? She was attracted to him for the right reasons when they met , but he changed irrevocably after she had their baby , as if he realized he held all the cards in the relationship and reverted to what one might call his `` true '' nature : surly , churlish , and cruel . In short , he put zero effort into the marriage ; all he thought about when he returned home from work was sleeping and having dinner made for him . For her part , Paige abetted his negligence by not standing up to him . ( Nicholas ' mother 's diagnosis of this problem is particularly enlightened and my favorite part of the book . ) Nicholas ' emotional abuse does n't excuse Paige 's spur-of-the-moment decision to walk out on her family . She merely validates Nicholas ' heretofore unjustified , degrading opinion of her . The so-called answers she seeks are , if not contrived poorly by the writer , then delusional . ( In general the characters ' hang-ups are petty and self-absorbed ; Paige 's phony Catholic guilt especially leaves a bad taste in my mouth . ) The eureka moment in which she realizes the difference between herself and her mother who abandoned her as a child lacks emotional depth , in my opinion.This makes the final act an especially painful read . As if she has a new lease on life , Paige returns to win over her husband all over again . Needless to say , he is resistant . I appreciate his anger at her for abandoning him and the baby ; that , to me , is Nicholas ' only justified grievance . But the implacable , spoiled brat has elevated victimhood into an ethos . Formerly estranged from his parents , he expresses zero gratitude for their volunteering to take care of his son while he 's at work ; nevertheless , mom and dad still love him . He reserves zero warmth for the hospital staff , who he orders around and bumps into without looking where he is going ; nevertheless , they love him . Finally , Paige gives him chance after chance to welcome her back into his life , but he rejects her every plea ; nevertheless , she loves him.A good writer , at this point , would point out that Nicholas can never be happy . He is locked in a positive feedback loop : the more he SEEMS to bear constantly the weight of the world on his shoulders , the more deference others give him . Unless someone gives him negative feedback , he will not change . So when Paige finally does finesse her way back into his house , I felt especially sick , as good tragedies are supposed to make you feel . This can only end in disaster.Everything in this criticism would be to the writer 's credit if she were aware of this and her main characters ' flaws ... but she and many of the five-star reviewers here on Amazon seem to think she wrote an epic romance with profound insights into motherhood , which undercuts the real message of the plot . So I give the novel one star .	-1
Found on the streets of 1920s St. Louis , Walter Rawley is a 9-year old boy whose life is not one of luxury . He lives with his aunt and Uncle Slim , the latter being an abusive drunkard . Walter does n't look like he has much of a future to look forward to , until a strange man named Master Yehudi approaches him , and promises to make him rich and famous . How , you might ask ? By teaching him the mythic art of levitation ! No illusions , no tricks or strings involved . Walt will actually be able to fly ! When Yehudi tells him that his relatives have given their blessing and are actually glad for Yehudi to be taking him off their hands , it seals the deal . Little does Walt know that learning to levitate involves some pretty horrific training . He 'll have to cut off part of his finger , eat and drink swill and feces and other pointless exercises that Yehudi prescribes in a sadomasochistic version of the Karate Kid . Living in the middle of nowhere on a farm with Yehudi and the kid are Mother Sue , a descendant of Sitting Bull and a former trick rider in Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show , and Aesop , a 15 year old black prodigy who spends his time studying the classics . What follows are the trials and tribulations of Walt mastering an art that should be impossible.Mr . Vertigo is one of Paul Auster 's weaker works , along with Leviathan . Like that book Mr. Vertigo was missing the mystery of Auster 's earlier books . Auster used to be able to weave metaphysical questions about identity and truth and viewpoint into his narratives , but this work is largely devoid of any big questions or cosmic inquiries . Mr. Vertigo is what it is , a mediocre attempt to write a popular novel that fails to claim its own identity . The dialogue especially seems artifical , as if the author were speaking to himself instead of crafting characters . There 's just no originality here , and nothing really imaginative happens to Walt . You could have had the same book if you had made Walt a water dowser or an obsessive seeker of Sasquatch .	-1
In my paperback edition of THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG , there are 250 pages . At about page 240 , it occurred to me that I could set the book down at that point and would suffer no ill effects if I never picked it up again . I will say that , upon finishing , the last ten pages did contain what I thought of as the crux of the story , and did somewhat mitigate the previous 240 , but in the end , I stick to my original thought . Overall , I just found it uninteresting.Most of the blurbage for this book make it sound as though it is some sort of murder mystery set in pre-revolutionary Russia , where Fyodor Dostoevsky has come to Petersburg to attend to his step-son , Pavel 's , arrangements after his suicide . This does happen , as well as a romantic entanglement with his step-son 's landlady , and some shady contact with the anarchists with whom Pavel had associated . Questions do arise as to the nature of Pavel 's involvement with these others , and Dostoevsky begins to wonder if it was suicide or murder , but these elements are relatively minor ; they are really just the structure on which to hang Dostoevsky 's frantic musings on the nature of fathers and sons , the living and the dead , desire , and , perhaps the true heart of the book , the metaphysical repercussions of artistic creation.Almost from the beginning , I had a difficult time sustaining interest . The first quarter to a third of the book is perpetually concerned with Dostoevsky 's grief and interior monologues as he fights his way through the stages of his sorrow . The author stays mired in this cycle , with Dostoevsky revisiting the same imagery again and again , refusing to let go ; and while this seems like an accurate representation of the circular thinking into which a person is trapped during a period such as this , it all sounded contrived for some reason . It could have been from the author 's choice to have as his protagonist Fyodor Dostoevsky , and I still wonder at the reason behind it . The conception of Dostoevsky carries with it a lot of connotations , especially to those who have read his work ; Mr. Coetzee was undoubtedly aware of this , and I assume he chose the Russian writer because of it . For me , this was the fatal flaw ; no matter what insights the author was actually trying to bring about , I could never suspend belief long enough to listen to them.Why Dostoevsky ? I could only guess , but none of my guesses are very charitable toward the author - and they could be all wrong . For most readers , this wo n't be an issue , and since Mr. Coetzee goes on to have some pretty heavy things to say about what it really means to be a writer , those who have no problem with Dostoevsky the character may find the book much more worthwhile than I.This does n't put me off Mr. Coetzee - this is simply one offering that did n't satisfy . There are other novels of his that I still look forward to reading , as I found the nature of the themes he explored here in MASTER of interest . It was just the method of delivery that never took off for me .	-1
I had a tug of war with this book . At times I liked it and then really disliked it in the next few pages . the characters were way over the top stereotypical and unbelievable . I live/work in California and am in the thick of this issue . I wo n't spoil it but the ending was awful . I 'm glad it was a library book and I did n't pay for it .	-1
This was a looooooooong , torturous read . I am a funny gal ... rarely will I not finish a book , even a bad one . This was a another depressing depiction of very low IQ family at the mercy of the & quot ; flim-flam man & quot ; . Someone needs to tell Oprah 's Book Club that a good story does not have to be depressing nor does it have to be about stupid or ignorant people . This was a true ordeal .	-1
It took me several attempts to even get going on this story . And I usually like this type of stuff : big , fat books with lots of detail , character development , and complicated characters , even if they are n't necessarily likeable . But even for me , the story line and characters were far too interwoven and complex . And I think it was n't necessary . True , some portions were truly engrossing , which is I think what finally kept me going and finishing this mess . But I think what was SUCH a turn-off for me with this book is that EVERYONE was SO screwed up . I can take , even expect , quirks in characters . Characters do n't have to be likeable for me to enjoy a story . But they do have to lend purpose to the story . Most of these characters did n't do that . It seemed like they written in just so the author had something else to write about other than a real plot . The story itself became the nutcases . The complexities of this story just became mumbo jumbo.In particular was the main character Marie . Marie is a nasty , bitter , bitchy , ungrateful woman . For the most part , she wrongly felt she had a right to be this way . She had this aggravating sense of entitlement in all aspects of her life . She 's been kicked , so life owed her everything . Usually I would be able to handle this . But her behavior is sooooooo over the top that it made her to be an unbelievable character altogether . Sure . We all have run into our share nasty women . Or just nasty people in general . But people as bad as this character are not someone you 'd have living next door to you . They 'd be in jail or committed to the funny farm . They would be considered a menace to society . Her naivet & eacute ; did n't make her more endearing at all . It just reiterated her attitude `` I am entitled to this , so I am willing to risk everything . '' And Marie 's final act of ungratefulness in the end of this so-called saga made me want to smash something with the book itself.And I 'm not saying the author should have `` lightened-up '' on her , either . I get the intent here . But she could have been portrayed differently . If there was at least one smidgen of some kind of growth of this character by the end of this long story , she would have been more believable , I think . It was as though the author was so intent on making the other psychos in this story seem less insane . Again , the psychos seemed to be the whole point and plot of the story instead of any real story.I do n't know . Maybe some people like that sort of thing . I do n't insist on issue-free characters and fairy tale endings . In fact , those would be boring books to me . I guess I just need something a little more in the middle . Something besides dysfunction only to hold my interest .	-1
I was ready to put this down after 150 pages because it was SO depressing , but I stuck it out on principle . After about 350 pages I decided to finish it just because I already had so much time invested in it , and I was curious to see how all the plots would come out in the end . Well , nothing was tied up neatly . I was hoping for at least one of these sorry characters to have an uplifting experience , but alas it was not to be . This was the first book I have read by this author , and I believe it will be my last .	-1
After I got over feeling that the author was pompous , I disregarded all his unknown ( to Me ) references and finished the book . Enjoyed the last 25 % the most .	-1
I was given this book as a gift , and it looked fascinating . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed with it . It is hard to follow , has no clear trajectory , and is full of italics representing the author 's ( supposedly verbatim ) thoughts on the snake handlers . His tone in these italics is mocking , yet somehow he so admires these people that he becomes a snake handler himself . The snake handlers are ( except for Aline ) vile , judgemental , ignorant and violent . Their theology is laughable . Fine , they get themselves worked up into spiritual ecstasy by dancing around , singing and babbling , etc . Standard group hysteria stuff . Big deal . Nothing new there . Somehow , and it is not clear how , Covington is drawn to these awful people , and wants to become one of them . He gets to be the hero at the end when he is cast out for standing up for the rights of women . Imagine that . Everything these people do , everything they say is loaded with import for Covington . He was & quot ; meant & quot ; to pick up a snake-handling hitchiker on the side of the road . Immediately Covington concludes that this hitchiker is a Christ figure , an outcast among his own people . It 's all fate , each time he wanders down a dusty road he is somehow being & quot ; drawn & quot ; to the place . Blah , blah blah . With its extra-wide margins and triple-spaced text , this insubstantial piece would have been better left for a long magazine article in some journal of the personal spiritual quest . Just glad I did n't spend my own money on it .	-1
John Updike gives us an especially well-researched novel following various generations of a particular family . The first chapter follows an 1880 's pastor named Clarence at the point that he realizes that & quot ; there is no God. & quot ; We see him struggle with the fact that he went from an exalted member of the community to a place of disgrace and poverty . Very intersting ! When Clarence dies at the end of the first chapter ( of four ) , the book follows the exploits of Teddy , the shy , akward , un-ambitious son . Teddy is not your typical protagonist , which makes the second chapter excellent reading . Chapter three follows & quot ; Alma & quot ; Teddy 's daughter and a Hollywood movie star . About the middle of Alma 's chapter the book becomes quite different . I found it was no longer an enjoyable read . In the final chapter , we follow the exploits of Alma 's ( and some rock star 's ) son , Clark ( active in the 1970's-1990 's ) . Clark 's chapter is so cliche it 's almost laughable . I 'll try not to give away parts of the plot , but Clark ends up joining a Waco-type cult ( continuing with the religion theme ) . As I 've mentioned , Alma 's and Clark 's sections are not even worth reading in the opinion of this reviewer , but the first two chapters are excellent . What started out as a great book , deteriorated into someting pathetic . Or did Updike intend this as a commentary on modern society ? It is well researched as several events ( such as the strike in Clarence 's chapter ) did take place , but the end seems very sloppy . You have to judge if this is deliberately so as a social commentary .	-1
I understand that art ( like novels ) deals with real-life issues , even very sinful issues , so I was not shocked by the content . But I was hoping there would be some kind of human redemption at the end . I guess I 'm not & # 34 ; enlightened & # 34 ; enough to like stories that do n't have any kind of good ending . In the end , I thought it was just boring . Could n't wait for it to end .	-1
Our book club selected this book because one of the members is a friend of Annie Lamott . Granted , Annie Lamott has a great deal of writing talent , but this book is not a good introduction to her work . Unfortunately , it falls into the genre of & quot ; women 's fiction & quot ; identified by Laura Jamison in her review of The Pilot 's Wife , a recent Oprah selection . These books have a certain sameness about them : they 're built around a bourgeois romance and feature the most generic , & quot ; white-bread & quot ; characters . This one fits the description . Elizabeth , the main character , other than being an alcoholic , has very few identifiable character traits . The author contrives for her to be grieving for her dead husband to give her at least some excuse for her heavy drinking . So many of these Oprah books feature a woman in a state of obsessive grief as if this justifies their wallowing in victimhood and their complete self-indulgence . Also implied is the notion that the women 's confession of poor behavior makes it okay and shows the woman to be extraordinarily honest . In my opinion , this is not literature ! I keep getting persuaded into reading these stories of suburban housewives ' problems , but essentially they 're boring . Why should I care about someone 's ability to conquer alcoholism or find a man ? I congratulate Oprah for getting her public to read , but I just wish that she had better taste ( except for Toni Morrison ) . So many of the women in these books seem so juvenile , dependent , self-centered , and humorless . In Rosie whatever humor there is comes from violating taboos or from description rather than any sense of irony or wit . I disagree with those who say that Lamott displays wisdom . Any wisdom is really & quot ; conventional wisdom & quot ; which is often based on cultural myth , rather than true knowledge . She can observe and describe quite well ( as some of her essays in Salon magazine indicate ) . All in all , except for some talented writing , Rosie is an ordinary book .	-1
these stories are not interesting . you will not learn anything , because you will not be able to force yourself to sit through a reading of the stories .	-1
This book is an excellent example of the importance of choosing powerful words to lead the reader in a certain direction . It does n't matter whether the words are factual and substantiated or not -- powerful words can create powerful ideas in one 's mind . How sad that two respected journalists stooped so low in a book that had the potential to be a very informative , educational read . I found their tactics disgusting !	-1
The thesis of this book is inspired by an agenda by the author . It tries to applaud him with one hand while trying to dismiss him with the other by reducing John Paul II 's complex and prophetic vision to a mere out of touch authoritarian woman hater . The only thing that is worthy of comment about this book , is the depth of myopia that the authors view this most inspiring , mystic , philosopher , artist , prophet , man who is a Father to us all .	-1
Clancy fell short on this one ! I saw him during a recent TV interview and said he hated to write . Well , looks like he put minimal effort into this one . Bear & amp ; Dragon was slighlty entertaining and just as boring ! Could it be that Clancy is over the hill ? I hope he regains his desire and talent because i normally look forward to his paperbacks .	-1
One does not need even an elementary knowledge of Chinese politics - just plain common sense , or maybe a regular news habit - to know that there is no such thing as a & quot ; Minister without Portfolio & quot ; in the Chinese Politburo ! This is a British concept . It is all fine and well for an author to use his imagination when writing science fiction or Tolkienesque fantasy ; it is a disaster when people like Clancy aim to make their stories realistic sounding while relying only on their own imagination . Clancy knows zilch about China to spin a yarn worth the telling.What makes some authors ( like Crichton ) stand out is that they have a sure grasp of the facts , and then use what expert knowledge they have to write a story that either reflects a really possible scenario in the real world or sometimes even predicts it . To use one example , a fine author once used his specialised knowledge about the coming technological breakthroughs in naval air power to write a story - in the early 1930 's - about the Japanese attacking the American naval base in Hawaii . This book was written by an Englishman , I believe , at least ten years before the Day of Infamy . It was little known at the time ... ... .but not so in Japan , where the book was used in the naval officer cadet college as a text.Some of Clancy 's older stories - like & quot ; The Sum of All Fears & quot ; - rise to this level . This one does n't cut it , although he is in fine form describing the technical minutiae of weapons systems , etc - as usual.I also suggest that from now on Clancy write three or four of his stories at a time , and bind them all together as one , although this means the publisher must overcome the considerable technical difficulty of printing a novel that runs to four or five or even six thousand pages . Why this ? Some of Clancy 's books read like this kind of tome anyway , as most readers know by now . They drone on and on and on ... ... and by the time you 're half way through you forgot what happened at the start . By the time you 're done with the book you feel less entertained than uplifted by a sense of achievement and relief - something to brag about .	-1
I was looking forward to reading the newest Clancy novel . Most of the time I ca n't put it down but this one I could . There is hardly any action in this book . Most of his books have been action packed . We also get to read about Clancy 's views on abortion . This book is not worth the money . Wait till you can get it at an used book store .	-1
Having snapped up all Tom Clancy 's previous books , I eagerly awaited this one and bought it at the first opportunity to enjoy on holiday . After a few hundred pages , I found myself plodding through it dutifully , reluctant to consign it to the bin where I felt it belonged . About page 700 the military plot began to roll , and for a few hours I was enthralled by the kind of writing for which Tom Clancy became famous.What is wrong with this book ? For my taste , the author has overreached by tackling characterisation , extensive dialogue and political philosophy . While his personal opinions are as valid as anyone else 's , the resulting book bored , annoyed and upset me . I was bored because of the lack of a tight , suspensful plot . I was annoyed by the dialogue that seemed modelled on Nixon 's White House tapes and the clumsy depiction of a US President who seems completely unqualified for the post . Although I am by no means a prude or a bigot , I was upset by the bad language and what I perceived as racial stereotyping.In conclusion , I have always enjoyed Tom Clancy 's books because I felt that he was a superb storyteller , with an unequalled grasp of military detail and the ability to tell a story from many concurrent viewpoints . An important part of his art seemed to be that even the `` black hats '' always had believable ideals and convictions . In `` The Bear and the Dragon '' , I feel that Jack Ryan has succumbed to the Peter Principle - he has been promoted far beyond his level of competence . This book could have been about half the length , and if the right parts were cut , I think I would have enjoyed it much more.I do n't know if I will be buying any more books by Tom Clancy . I certainly wo n't buy any more in hard cover - my criterion of a favourite author .	-1
Classics such as Homer 's `` The Iliad '' are readily available as free eBooks , including for the Kindle , so why pay for one ? One good reason is that commercially available editions will often have better translations , especially by modern translators , and explanatory notes for today 's readers.So I 'm prepared to pay for such editions if I think they are worth the investment.I downloaded the Kindle sample of the acclaimed Robert Fagles translation of `` The Iliad '' , which also includes an extensive introduction and detailed notes by Bernard Knox . The sample included much of the introductory material but none of the verse itself . So it was only when I purchased the ebook that I found that the notes about the poem were not hyperlinked to the verses themselves . Worse still the notes are listed at the back of the book referenced by chapter and verses ( eg . 1.45 ) , but the verses themselves are not numbered , making the notes even more useless in the Kindle edition.Generally I have found the Penguin Classic Kindle editions good ( I also just , for example , also purchased the Penguin edition of `` The Red Badge of Courage '' , and extensive notes provided all function well using hyperlinks.But I would advise against this Kindle edition of `` The Illiad '' until hyperlinks to the notes are added by the publisher .	-1
Louisa May Alcott did it all , from dark thrillers and tragedies to the laid-back family of `` Little Women . '' But it 's not surprising that Alcott practically buried her first novel , `` The Inheritance , '' which she wrote at the age of seventeen -- a gooey , cliched romance with a sickly-sweet heroine and a Tall Dark Handsome Man with a Tragic Past.Edith Adelon is a penniless Italian orphan who lives on a rambling estate belonging to the wealthy , aristocratic Hamiltons . She was brought there at an early age to be the companion to daughter Amy . Edith 's humility and goodness make her a favorite in that place , except to a relative of Lady Hamilton 's , Ida Clare . Ida is not wealthy , though she is an aristocrat , and ( by the standards of the day ) is aging to old-maid-hood.Things change drastically with the arrival of Lord Percy , a pal of Amy 's brother Arthur . Despite Percy 's broken heart , he begins to fall in love with Edith -- except Ida is determined to have him for herself . Around the time Edith nobly rejects her suitor ( because they are n't on the same social level ) , a series of thefts are committed -- and she is the main suspect.It 's not hard to see why Alcott buried this novel in a trunk -- by the time she was a serious writer , it would have been painful to have people read this book . It 's drips with gooey sentimentality and quite a few romantic cliches of the time -- the secret legacy , the rigid class system ( where lowly peasants adore the nobility ) , the tragic secrets , the nasty nemesis who never does anything really evil , and the backdrops that are uniformly beautiful and majestic.While Alcott 's writing at this point was also quite cliched , it 's also quite pretty . Assuming that you do n't start rolling your eyes at the idea of a moonlit half-castle-half-mansion surrounded by green fields and a lake , that is . But once a bit of disbelief is suspended , the writing does seem quite lovely . The dialogue , however , is ridiculously ornate and self-deprecating.Unfortunately , Alcott stumbles all over herself when she writes the characters -- Edith is a revoltingly sweet wilting lily , as well as being one of those people whose humility becomes almost a personality defect . She has no flaws , just virtues -- she 's beautiful , swoons , and sings like an angel . She even takes soup to the sick . Lord Percy is not much better -- virtuous , sensitive , tragic , and utterly dull . And the flat supporting characters all serve merely to gush about how sweet and lovely Edith is , except for the tepidly malicious Ida.Though it was later remade into a solid TV movie , `` The Inheritance '' is one of those very few Louisa May Alcott stories that deserves to have stayed buried . It has none of the charm of `` Little Women , '' nor the cliched but well-written thrills of `` Long Fatal Love Chase . '' Revoltingly sweet and cliched , this reads almost like a parody of the romantic genre .	-1
Unfortunately I allowed a TV interview with Helen Fielding sway my decision . I purchased not only the Diary , but The Edge of Reason , and Mad About the Boy . I read halfway through the Diary and decided I was not enjoying the novel at all . Think these books are slated for the second hand shop without further perusal .	-1
This book is surely one of the rare books not so much for the knowledge but the open ruthlessness advocated by the author . Other than Machiavelli 's `` Prince '' and a sparing few , we probably have very few books that justify adopting any means for achieving the desired end , and this book is one such . In the highly materialistic , competitive world , where might is indeed right , author Robert Greene illustrates the 48 laws for wielding power and influence over others . To those morally upright and genteel souls , this book could come through as a shocker for the sheer cold-blooded advice it vociferously advocates . Take for instance the 7th law that the author lays out - that of taking credit for other 's work , or his 15th law emphasizing the need for annihilating your enemy so he wo n't be alive to fight another day . Along the same lines , the 27th law outlines the need for exploiting other 's need to build oneself . And so it goes on advocating self-interest as the best interest and the call to observe these laws tactfully and skillfully so as to manipulate your way to the top , dumping in the process any tinge of conscience . Drawing information from a wide variety of sources , the book gives illustrations of the devious strategies that renowned schemers of the past had master minded and implemented adroitly . In sum , this book showcases the crafty , cunning , amoral and exploitative ways to attain the ultimate goal of gaining power and remaining powerful . Perhaps it will not be off the mark to say that this book is likely to appeal and make its impact on the reader according to the moral compass of each individual -well , to each his own .	-1
I read this but because it is considered a classic . I did not find this to be a bad book but it seems to lack current cultural relevance . i would encourage everyone to read it and decide for themselves !	-1
The book had an interesting potential , something strong , pagan , gypsy-ish , a whiff of the opposition that took place centuries ago in Europe between the old gods and the jealous new One ... But on the one hand you have a not-wannabe witch protagonist who DOES want to be normal , even suggesting at some point that her truly wild woman of a mother kidnapped her from her ( I was going to write 'Muggle ' ) normal family ; who 'has powers ' but will not use them - what is it with witches who want to stay in the broom closet ! ? - and thusly leaves us in the dark as to her true capacities , and misses the Magical Realism genre boat altogether . The old Armande certainly has more insight , daring and power than she does . Also , Vianne claims no kinship with the gypsies , which bothers me because she 's been in their boots exactly and now looks quite 'bourgeoise ' and established.And on the other , the 'Bad Guy ' , if you will , is a priest , 'the Black Man ' , the embodiment of everything she and her mother feared , as women , as witches . That could have been quite a revolutionary and daring lead - if Joanne Harris had taken it . But the scary boogeyman is quite defanged ; he monologues in every other chapter , describing 'Vianne Rocher ' with positive superlatives ( he is n't supposed to do that you know , he 's supposed to see reality through his own prism , and therefore use derogatory words where someone else would use praise ; same subject , different viewpoints ) , he 's stuck up and deeply steeped in hubris ... but honestly not very scary . Also he has a Secret - but who cares ? Ok , he will speak in the pulpit against the vice of gluttony - that does not pack a punch , and furthermore he stops as soon as he 's feeling ridiculous . Then again , what did Vianne expect ? If you settle in a small French village , you WILL get curious stares , not open arms , and sometimes downright hostility , especially as a foreign unconventional unmarried mother ! And I 'm not even going to mention Corsica ! Of course you will get the bigots , the people who never traveled to the next county , the judgmental appraisals , the wafer-narrow-mindedness ! That happened to my family and we 're French ! The story develops slowly as there are not strong pushes toward climaxes and anti-climaxes , everything turns out well , even when Vianne tells Jos & eacute ; phine to confront her violent , drunk , abusive husband . Who of course does n't manage to hurt her anymore ( hum , so much for wishful writing - he could have beaten her to a pulp , but of course he does n't and considerately leaves town ) .Joanne Harris delights in the description of ptisseries , forgetting maybe that most of them are regional - but good for them if she can make them all . The whole country is rightfully proud of its culinary tradition - I doubt anyone , even a priest would condemn chocolate delicacies , especially in 1995 . It is important to remember France is Catholic , not Protestant , and as such has always partaken in things that horrified our soberer neighbors - all that gilding , all those jewels in church , all our baroque and gothic splendors , food as gourmet art - oh no , the Catholic church renounced nothing ! About the movie ; it is tighter than the book , I love all the actors , but it is watered down even more by making the Mayor the antagonist , not the priest . By that point it loses all 'oomph ' , although setting the movie in the 50s does help with the general atmosphere of rigidity , and adds something to the transgression of consorting with gypsies . Johnny Depp can only be Juliette Binoche 's love interest , not a secondary character 's like Jos & eacute ; phine , so it 's cute and quaint and completely devoid of backbone .	-1
It took me three separate attempts , but I finally waded through this cumbersome novel . Even Fitzgerald 's brilliant descriptive writing could n't save this book for me .	-1
This is not Overy 's best book . There is a `` hand-wringing '' quality to his writing , as though he were afraid of offending someone , perhaps due to its being written for the BBC . And he fudges in a big way British pre-war bungling regarding the Rhineland and Czechoslovakia , and Stalin 's role in the purge trials.Part of the explanation for the whitewash of Stalin can be found in the publications dates : The first edition of this book was published in 1989 , so it was written BEFORE the fall of the Soviet Union , whereas the second edition came out in 1999 , afterward . I do n't have a copy of the first edition for comparison purposes , but I do have Overy 's `` Russia 's War '' , which came out in 1997 , in which he is very clear about Stalin 's direct role in the purge trials . It appears that Overy did n't go to the trouble of revising this material for the second edition `` The Road to War '' , perhaps thought `` Russia 's War '' was enough . But he could at least have made reference to his newer work , rather than let his older misinformation stand uncorrected.Overy obfuscates the British role in Hitler 's remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936 and in selling out the Czechs at the Munich debacle in 1938 , but I 'm not sure why he thinks he can get away with this . The historical record of British indifference and French trepidation is quite clear in both instances.He goes on for pages about FDR 's problems with the Isolationists , but never once mentions Harold Nicolson 's now well-known 1939-41 secret U.S.-based propaganda campaign against American neutrality.Andrew Wheatcroft 's chapter on Japan is pretty good.Overy is a good writer , which can lead one to believe that one is learning a great deal while reading his books . But at least in this book Overy neglects the first task of the historian , which is to tell us WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED . Atmosphere is nice , but the facts have priority.Suggestions for further ( and better ) reading : Winston Churchill - `` The Second World War '' , volume 1.Basil Liddell Hart - `` History of World War Two '' Julian Jackson - `` The Fall of France '' Richard Overy - `` Russia 's War '' - based on post-1989 evidence , this is much better than the chapter on Russia in `` The Road to War '' .Not recommended .	-1
it has been about a week since i finished it and I can not remember what it was about . It made no impression on me . I usually find something in a book to save . This one was an exception .	-1
This book was just way too detailed for me . It contains lots of facts and figures about biz transactions but it is just too much . It was to the point of who cares ? Niall Ferguson really did his home work as far as that is concerned but it made the book boring . To me it felt like it was written by an accountant . It is the story behind the facts and figures and how they came about which make for interesting reading . But I have to give him credit for the time he spent putting this book together is unimaginable.Having said that I would have enjoyed it more if it had some stories where they made 1.2 million on this deal or lost 500,000 on that deal but it was n't there . Just an accounting at the end of the year saying this was what they had at the end . No exciting stories like the robber barons trying to take over a railroad or JP Morgan putting together large trust deals in the US . Although chapter 11 , which tells of the Rothschild involvement with mining and Cecil Rohdes and De Beers was very interesting and by far the the best chapter in the book , although it was not enough for me to give it a better rating . But that chapter for me made the book.I skimmed more of this book then I did the first one . There are a few more interesting stories in here but not enough to really keep you interested . If you like well written interesting biographies this is probably not for you .	-1
This is a disappointing book , even though I have been fascinated with giant squids all my life . Did those reviewers designating it so exciting on the cover and frontispiece actually read the book ? There simply is not enough known about this animal to fill a book for the general public , and thus Ellis has to fill it out with exhaustive accounts of every carcass found , technical information on other squid genera that is only of interest to other squid specialists , and a chapter on squid display models which , well researched though it is , really is not the kind of thing one buys a book to learn about at such length . Ellis also needed a better editor -- there is a little too much repetition . Ellis ' MONSTERS OF THE SEA was great , but there really is n't enough more here about Architeuthis to justify a separate book , and one can not help suspecting that this one is designed to take advantage of the particular market value of this marvelous creature . Ellis did us a great service with the previous book ; this one , however , really is not worth it unless you are a teuthologist .	-1
When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie . It is not good Graham Greene . The book follows the movie closely but , it adds very little . As I read the story I miss the music . Save your money and buy the DVD .	-1
I like different , I like weird . Having said that I also like books that make sense and can be easily read . That ca n't be said of this . I do n't understand the praise . Yes , there are moments of true talent . But they are few and far between . Difficult to understand or care about anyone in this book . Not so much a mystery as a endless series of hallucinations and fantasies . What 's real ? What 's not ? In the end , it did n't matter .	-1
I just received The Bone Lady by Mary Manhein from a friend who knows how interested I am in forensics . Kirkus Reviews called this book `` A rare , effective blend of entertainment and education . '' I ca n't agree . Well , it 's educational , I 'll give it that . But it 's not in the least eerie , as the back cover claims . Dr. Manhein may be a riveting oral storyteller but it does not come across in her writing , which , apart from the requisite touch at the beginning of each chapter meant to hook you ( `` It was a cold March day '' ) rapidly devolves into descriptive narrative I sometimes wondered what the point of was , especially as in many cases the examination did n't even reveal the cause of death . Much of it was simply filler.Style was n't bad , but readability varied and I suspect her editor worked very hard with her . Even so , a few unedifying sentences slipped through ( `` Corresponding inferior facets of the atlas articulate with the superior facets of the second vertebrae , ... '' ) .The format , each `` case '' presented in a two- or three-page chapter that usually ends rather flat , was the wrong way to go , in my opinion . It tended to highlight just how insignificant her contribution often was , and fostered the suspicion that this was hyped up for an easy sell just because there is so much interest in CSI-type stuff lately . In Under the Porch , the gunshot victim 's identity was in the billfold on the body ; the Coroner just needed her to confirm the age . There was no mystery as to the killer . The crime scene investigators solved that when they found his own gun next to him . Or the body of the young male in the high-end coffin in Duralde 's Return : She spent 2 pages of text on the vault and coffin ( plus scale drawings ) and a couple of lines about the body itself ; but it must have been a public records archivist who figured out who was in the coffin , and Manhein had no idea how he died . The chapters do this : They highlight how much of a team effort is involved in answering all the questions about a case . But in a thirty-year career did n't she , with her expertise , solve any mysteries ? Not in this book . Have I been completely spoiled by CSI ? I see she has written another , so this one must have sold well enough to satisfy her publisher . I 'm not going to buy it .	-1
The writing itself is n't bad , but ultimately this is just one more so-called `` chick-lit '' book about an otherwise intelligent woman who makes bad decision after bad decision about men until she finally meets the man of her dreams who finds her insecurity adorably quirky . Ick .	-1
I think I 'll have to start ignoring reviews . Many critics raved on about The Girls ' Guide to Hunting and Fishing , which turns out to be a slim collection of largely flat short stories pretending to be a book . The main problem with Jane , the heroine , is that she is n't very interesting . This leaves a large hole at the centre of the work , one so large in fact that it devours everything else . We meet her as a sassy teenager and then she moves on from one tedious romance to the next -- and suddenly she is married with kids -- and then we 're back to the tedious romances -- and suddenly someone has cancer and we think it 's Jane -- and we 're back to the romances . It all reads as though someone pressed the `` Random play '' button on an album and we get the various chapters in no particular order . The writing is crisp and there were a couple of occasions where I laughed out loud , yet none of this can compensate for the vacuum at the centre of the story .	-1
I quit reading this book about halfway through . Potentially a good story but there just was n't enough there to make me keep reading and care about the history of this picture and the people it touched .	-1
I have n't read John Lanchester 's first book , and I 'm sure it 's really quite good . But please , do n't tell me & quot ; Mr. Phillips & quot ; is & quot ; elegant , & quot ; & quot ; delightfully humorous , & quot ; or & quot ; great modern literature. & quot ; I would like a plot , thank you , and at least one character I care about and not , as is really in the & quot ; story , & quot ; a husband and wife sleeping together with descriptions of their farts mingling under the covers and her spermicide mixed with her natural smells combining to form blah , blah , blah in the morning . My apologies to the author , but give me someone I want to know about ; interest me , uplift me , teach me , show me , break me , help me to understand , or at least make me feel something . There are already enough bad sit-coms on TV . Do n't put one in a book . Please .	-1
I have to admit to not finishing this book . The history of the Basque people is a fascinating tale , but this book was a dreadful slog . The writing style was too loose and chatty resulting in a narrative which was more of a jumble of anecdotes than a cohesive history . There is altogether too much space devoted to the Franco/WWII years . I did like the recipes and the food commentary . Historians often forget that food is an integral part of a national identity.Perhaps this book improved at the end . However , as mentioned previously , I could n't get through it .	-1
This strikes me as definitiely a `` book of its time '' . First published in 1972 ( after being rejected by 13 , count 'em , 13 publishers ) , it is written on a `` young adult '' reader level and is basically a formalized cobbling together of stories the author told his children on tedious car trips . Each chapter is preceded by a literary quote , which after the first 20 or so becomes a bit precious and eventually pretentious . Obviously , it has quite a following , but it seems to me to fall into the same category as books as diverse as `` A Wrinkle in Time '' , `` Stranger in a Strange Land '' , `` Atlas Shrugged '' , or perhaps less complimentary , `` Jonathan Livingston Seagull '' ( which itself was published 2 years before this ) . All have their fans , most of whom first read their book at an impressionable age , and who seem more passionate than the material objectively deserves , because the story has some resonance for those readers . Those fans all find some sort of inspiration , or really self-confirmation , and tend to get irate if YOU do n't `` get it '' too . Frankly , it struck me as an overly-twee cross between `` The Hobbit '' and Beatrix Potter . ( And please , I *did* enjoy `` The Wind in the Willows '' . ) The female rabbits ( `` does '' ) are essentially non-existant in the first third of the book , and are much-sought-after non-entities in the rest , useful only for perpetuating rabbithood ( did n't know THAT was a problem ... . ) The `` lupine dictionary '' ought to be a litmus test for potential readers : if this strikes you as charming , or clever , or creative , give the book a try . If you think that is just a mite affectatious , and have a hard time with rabbits having `` names '' like Hazel , Buckthorn , Pipkin , and Dandelion , I think you 'll be happier with a `` pass '' .	-1
I 'm a fanatical bunny lover and I was expecting to love this book . Instead I hated it . Very difficult to read . I did not enjoy it at all . Guess I was expecting something easy to follow and light-hearted .	-1
This book was ... interesting . I did n't really think this was a great book , but it 's an easy read . Take a day or less to read it . The book itself did n't really strike me as a good . I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [ at most ] . I got bored with it quickly [ I mean , I do n't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head ! ] . This is just my opinion though .	-1
I have read a lot of George MacDonald . His books vary in quality a great deal . Many people had recommended The Princess and Curdie to me , so I finally read it . This is not , in my opinion , one of his better fantasies . By far his best story , in my opinion , is the Light Princess ( clever , playful , but also rich in symbolism and allegory , with characters that one comes to care about ) .	-1
I read half this book and doubt I 'll invest anymore time in it . There has been no action yet an I 've moved on .	-1
The Outsiders is a book written by S.E . Hinton . SHe wrote this book about teenagers in her neighborhood . This book is nothing that any of todays children can realte to . The Greasers are a gang they are composed of Two-Bit , Dally , Johnny , Darry , Soda Pop , and Pony boy . Their rival gang is the socs.This book is not what teenagers can not even relate to . The main character Ponyboy , yes that is his real name , has family problems . Both of his parents are dead and he is raised by his brothers Soda Pop , another real name , and Darry . Darry and Soda Pop both dropped out of school to give Pony Boy a chance at a better life . Johnny is an abused child who no one loves . His `` real '' family is the Greasers . Dally and Two-Bit are tough , not because the book portrays that but because all lthe author ever saids is Do n't mess with Dally because he grew up on the streets of New York City . He does not do anything tough the whole book . Except when he is over run by grief and wants to die . He robs a conveinent store and when the police find him he turns a broken gun on the police . They of course shoot him.The Socs are the rival gang . They dont like the Greaers because they put Grease in their hair . So because of the way they do their hair the Socs attack and some times kill the Greasers . I having a teenage daughter know that this book is nothing like any teens life . A child is ridiculed in school because of the way they dress but you could never die because of it . So one night Darry hits Pony Boy and Johnny run away to a church . Dally helps them run away , yea thats real tough , and tells them how to lay low . When they leave the church with Dally to go to the Dairy Queen the church catches fire and children are trapped inside . Johnny and Pony Boy risk their lives to save them . Johnny breaks his back while trying to save these children . Johnny refuses to see his mother and only wants to see the gane because his mother hated him . If I was dying in a hospital and I hated my mom I would want to tell her I loved her before I could n't tell her any more.Pony Boy starts to fail English and he writes this book so he can pass . The End ... .I do n't really see where this book went . The author wrote it when she was a teenager , but it still does not change the fact that this was npt really a book . It was more like the prolouge.Many teachers force their Sudents to read this book and they often enjoy it because of the violence . I do n't think this book should have been published . It was not well written because the Greasers do n't think about life like teenagers will . Instead they have page long analysis 's about why they are he way they are . Like Dally , who the author claims is so bad because he has been to juvie , is said to be bad because he grew up in New York City and had a hard childhood . A child would see this as he wanted attention because if his behavior was because of his upbringing then why is he nice to his friends if he was a horrible person . The author portrays that the Streets of NEw York are so bad to live on , but I don'tsee how where the Greaers were living was so much better .	-1
The subject of this book is excellent.The format of this particular book ( signet classics ) is horrible . The print is SO SMALL that even with 2.0 reading glasses I had difficulty reading it and I have good vision.I can not recomment this format to anyone..the print is just too small ... .too bad for such a great book .	-1
This novel -- or romance , as the author calls it in hopes of getting certain indulgences from the reader -- initially drew me in . There 's certainly an atmospheric richness to the haunted house , and the way owning family is trapped in its moldy ruins is catchy . In this sense , it would make an awesome Tim Burton film . But ultimately , I grew impatient with the work and found it slight . In the end , the characters , no matter how richly painted , are painted cardboard , they 're maddeningly passive and the finale comes across as cheesy and contrived . ( But there is one really cool chapter toward the end that I ca n't describe without giving away what little plot there is . It describes how everyone in the neighborhood reacts to something that happens in the house . ) In academia , there 's a common insult for books : it would have made a nice article . That is , someone had a good idea for a short piece and then played it beyond its proper length . Hawthorne 's piece is the same way : it would have made a nice novella . But it 's not a novella . It 's a novel that 's made up mostly of description in ornate prose that is n't particularly charming ( like , say , Jane Austen 's or Dickens 's ) . So every possible baroque curl is added to the story , to the point that you wish that the characters would , for the love of God , just do something . ( They finally kinda sorta maybe do , after hundreds of pages . ) If it were written today , Hawthorne 's writers ' group would have ripped it to shreds . If it were up to me , I 'd recommend cutting back on the description . Starting with the two pages devoted to the chickens.Also , if you 're going to read this -- and it 's main interest is historical , as a classic early American Gothic novel or as a forerunner to Scooby Doo -- examine the edition before you buy or check out of the library . Perhaps they were trying to be cheap or trying to hide how many page-long paragraphs there are , but the Signet , at least , jams so many words onto the page that it 's a chore to read .	-1
Wish I had found the FREE version before I spent .99 cents . If you have common sense you will take my advise and save this expence , save yourself .99 cents , and get the FREE version . It is here too . Look around .	-1
This novel is so depressing . I read it because I heard it 's timeless and it 's referenced all through history books . However , this book was so depressing and upsetting that I did n't finish it . I guess I 'm not entirely justified in giving it 2 stars , but I could not take any more sadness from this book , classic or not .	-1
I just did't like the story . Actuall remembered I have never been a Mark Train fan . He stories are so contrived and stylized and the characters are flat .	-1
If ever a book was made for skimming - or for Classics Illustrated , for that matter - Moby Dick is it . I had the misfortune of listening to it as a book on tape , and let me tell you , of the 27 hours of narration , I would estimate that only 4 deal directly with Character or Plot.The rest of it is a grab-bag of whaling industry history , exacting description of whaling technology , inexact biology and philosophical musings that wander far , far afield . After reading Mark Twain 's hilarious dissection of `` The Last of the Mohicans '' , I can only imagine what he would do with `` Moby Dick '' .The London Literary Gazette , December 6 1851 , review of the newly published Moby Dick sums up my feelings : '' This is an odd book , professing to be a novel ; wantonly eccentric ; outrageously bombastic ; in places charmingly and vividly descriptive . The author has read up laboriously to make a show of cetalogical learning ... . Herman Melville is wise in this sort of wisdom . He uses it as stuffing to fill out his skeleton story . Bad stuffing it makes , serving only to try the patience of his readers , and to tempt them to wish both him and his whales at the bottom of an unfathomable sea ... .The story of this novel scarcely deserves the name ... . Mr. Melville can not do without savages so he makes half of his dramatis personae wild Indians , Malays , and other untamed humanities ... . What the author 's original intention in spinning his preposterous yarn was , it is impossible to guess ; evidently , when we compare the first and third volumes , it was never carried out ... .Having said so much that may be interpreted as a censure , it is right that we should add a word of praise where deserved . There are sketches of scenes at sea , of whaling adventures , storms , and ship-life , equal to any we have ever met with ... .Mr. Herman Melville has earned a deservedly high reputation for his performances in descriptive fiction . He has gathered his own materials , and travelled along fresh and untrodden literary paths , exhibiting powers of no common order , and great originality . The more careful , therefore , should he be to maintain the fame he so rapidly acquired , and not waste his strength on such purposeless and unequal doings as these rambling volumes about spermaceti whales . `` That was written before the book gained its 20th Century Reputation , one I sadly feel is undeserved .	-1
DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME.My daughter claims this is her favorite book of all time . Now I 'm thinking she was switched at birth with some stranger . I wo n't go as far as saying I hated the book , ( though I really did ) but it 's sure close . Tess is a brainless twit with no backbone and NO common sense at all . I wanted to shake her into reality . Even her own mother thought she was nuts for confessing to her husband ( on their wedding night ) that she was n't a virgin , even though it was n't her fault . Of course the self-centered husband ca n't even look her in the face and leaves her as soon as possible - sending her home to her mother . The book is all about Tess and every wrong turn she makes - not one good decision . I was disgusted with Tess and had to fight my way through to the end . I had to force myself to pick it up . I kept thinking there must be something good about the book - I was wrong.I have downloaded another Thomas Hardy book , I wo n't count him out yet , but if it starts being as horrible as this book , I sure wo n't force myself to finish .	-1
The only reason I can possibly give for reading this is to see the development of a novel at a very early stage . The plot is stiff , the characters ( except for Lovelace ) are very 2 dimensional . The material is redundant and gets very boring . The end is far from satisfying . The only thing that saves this novel from being a complete disaster is Lovelace 's animated character . And even he is poorly handled by Richardson . It would seem Richardson makes him out to be a villain , and yet he was Clarissa 's only hope . He was the only one who showed any genuine concern for Clarissa . As much as I love literature , this is one book I literally threw so many times in frustration . In all honesty , I feel that if Marlowe , Shakespeare , or Dickens tried to read this , they themselves would get restless and bored .	-1
This is a novel in superlative style : 'heroic , magnanimous , exalted , brightly , caressingly , exquisite , fascinating , wonderful , sublime , radiant , delightful ... 'It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love.There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century.This book does n't 'say nothing ' ( Thomas Hardy , quoted in the introduction ) , but nearly nothing . It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel , compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert.It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.Only for Henry James fans .	-1
I expected a lot from this book.I was very disappointed.And to think I read it to the last letter.Sure , it speaks about about the fate of a woman in the 18th cenetury , a very rare thing in those times , because nobody cared about poor women or independent women ( a ridiculous notion then ) or & quot ; bad & quot ; women and why they became bad.But , it is not good literature.Almost half of it is an inventory of the things she ( Mall ) stole , robbed , cheated ... If it were a 150 pages shorter , it would have been a much better book.Save your time and energy for a much better book , and there are many of those !	-1
It is easy to find great dystopian novels , but I wanted to read an utopian novel . I was a bit disappointed . It fell a little flat and it probably had to do with it being written in 1890 . William Morris was disgusted by the industrial revolution and the poor social and environmental ills that manifested from it , so he attempted to write about a world that reverted back to an agrarian life . I just thought it was a bit of a cop out . I would rather read about a utopian novel where the people achieved some sort of enlightenment and learned moderation or something than to completely do away with technology all together . I do n't see modernization as evil it is the people and how they choose to use it that creates the problem . I think my favorite utopian novel remains a book I read as a child , The 21 Balloons by William P & egrave ; ne du Bois .	-1
This Kindle edition does n't do the poem any justice at all.Hardcore fans are more likely to have paper copies anyway.This is n't an illustrated version either.The text is grouped together oddly with the appearance of an - sign at the end of every other sentence.It is n't a very good reflection of the flow or text . Although perhaps ok enough to get the general gist of things it certainly is n't a brilliant copy.AVP-UK	-1
This bad review has nothing to do with the seller , who delivered the book very timely . My complaint is this : THIS IS AN ABRIDGED VERSION ! It 's only around 240 pages . There is nothing to alert potential buyers that THIS IS AN ABRIDGED VERSION , perhaps meant for a child 's library ? BUYER BEWARE ! This is not even close to the full text of Bleak House , but a THIN BOOK !	-1
The font appears in Courier no matter how you set the Kindle app . The line breaks are a mess . This is a disaster that is n't worth 99 cents -- it 's worth less than nothing in fact .	-1
I have nothing of value to say about Dickens 's novel , but I 'm appalled that anyone could praise the typography of this Kindle edition -- at least as it appears in the sample chapters I 've just been looking at on my computer . All the quotation marks , whether single or double , as well as all the apostrophes , appear to be `` dumb '' -- i.e. , they are ugly , off-putting , perfectly vertical little marks rather than the graceful `` smart '' punctuation , curling to the right or left as their position dictates , that one finds in a decently printed book . As a result , `` Pickwick '' looks like something churned out by a computer , and I even find it somewhat hard to read , because the quoted text is barely distinguishable from the rest . ( Ironically , of course , the punctuation in these Amazon comments is also `` dumb , '' I believe ... and that 's a shame . But it 's certainly more appropriate for a web page than for a Kindle edition attempting to mimic old-fashioned print . )	-1
This book is more of a chronicle interspersed with snatches of Johnson 's tabletalk than a full-fledged biography . It is long and dry and boring . Johnson was probably an interesting person to listen to in his day but since most of the people he talks about are long since dead and forgotten , it 's kind of difficult to appreciate his wit and insight.It 's not a good biography because Boswell records everything verbatim with little context or analysis . If you are an expert on artistic and intellectual personalities of 18th century Britain then you may find this book of some interest but everyone else should look for other reading material .	-1
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is one of those classics that I have been wanting to read for quite sometime . Years ago , when the movie version , starring Johnny Depp , was released , I absolutely loved it and fell in love with the story and characters . Well , this is one of those cases of wrongfully watching the movie before reading the book . They were so utterly and completely different.In all honesty , I did n't really like the book . It 's really short and there was really no mention of the horseman until about twenty -seven pages in ( 36 pgs total ) . It just was n't for me.I 'll stick to Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane , thanks .	-1
If people get done reading a biography and the only thing they can praise it for is it 's prose , you know you just wasted a bunch of time reading a book about an inconsequential life.The writing is good , as far as writing goes , but one of the main points of good writing is that it has SOMETHING TO SAY.There was no point for this book being written .	-1
First of all the ideology of Communism ( as described here by Marx ) is almost impossible to be put in practice . Yes people like Mao , Stalin and others were called Communists , but they followed only couple of steps from this book and combined these ideas with Fascism . Why they could not followed everything in this book is simple ... It ca n't be put in practice ... even if the brothers in Europe with their European Union are trying so hard to destroy the borders , the languages and identity of their own people ... is still impossible .Well the Jewish boy Karl Marx wanted in his stupid ideology to destroy everything . Religion , money , borders , nationality ... a childish dream ! That 's exactly how everything in this world was created ! With money , religion and wars that did created countries , cultures and so many more.Yes i do understand the fact that the world today is ruled by greedy people and we are always under crazy propaganda , but the `` Communist manifesto '' is childish and can only be supported by so-called anarchists ( aka drugs addicts , unemployed , revolutionary wannabes ) and some others that they still consider themselves `` minorities '' when they actually have more rights than all of us . Well , somehow i guess Marx did actually brainwashed some puppets .	-1
Thomas Mann thought Theodor Fontane a great novelist . Effi Briest is considered essential reading for those who want to learn about German culture , especially Prussian culture.I found this book very disappointing . The Chinaman 's ghost is perhaps the highlight for me , a brief thrill in an otherwise slow-moving novel . There is little else here unless you are university student asked to dissect the various symbols or discuss the role of gender in Berlin in the time of Bismark . Other novels progress , move forward while this one seems to go around in the same `` social ills '' circle - Fontane continually showing his readers Effi 's loneliness , isolation , immaturity and how she is a product of her time , upbrining , etc ... etc.. ( He does a great job of beating a dead horse instead of actually telling a story ... maybe that 's where his genius lies in this novel . ) This novel is intelligent , it just happens to be dull . The symbols are there , the allusions provides some clues but it 's not enough as far as I 'm concerned . When the actual adultery happens , how it happens ... there 's nothing here that prepares the reader nor something reliable to give you more insight into Effi 's longings . Despite all the showing , the reasons for the adultery , I could n't feel anything for her beyond a minor note of pity . Subtlety is one thing but this is an `` uber-subtlety '' to the point of `` why bother '' . I gave my copy away to the library .	-1
The book that I used in reading about Socrates from the writings of Plato is the Penguin Classic , The Last Days of Socrates ( 1969 ) . Plato is the author ; Hugh Tredennick , the translator.According to Wikipedia , `` The beliefs of Socrates , as distinct from those of Plato , are difficult to discern . '' In this review , I quote `` Socrates '' but do not exclude Plato , his student . Socrates ' death occurred in 399 BC , 300 years after Isaiah wrote his Old Testament book . Plato was about 24 at the time of Socrates ' death.The focus of my attention in this review is the subject of man 's supposed inherent immortality . The translator made this comment on page 97 : `` It is an attempt to encourage by every means a belief in the soul 's immortality ... , '' but there is zero evidence in the Bible that man has inherent immortality ( only immortality that comes as a gift from Jesus for those who believe in Him ) . The Lord also taught measured punishment ( Luke 12:47-48 ) . The Greek word , aion means `` age '' and the adjectival form of it , aionios , means age-lasting ( not ever-lasting ) ! The `` ever '' part of `` ever-lasting '' comes from a mixing of Platonic thinking into translations of the New Testament ! The Bible views death as the last enemy , but Socrates viewed it as a friend . The philosopher ( like Socrates himself , who was about to die ) should be `` cheerful in the face of death , and confident of finding the greatest blessing in the next world ... '' ( p. 107 ) . Satan loves people to believe this lie - that `` death '' is not such a bad thing after all - `` simply the release of the soul from the body '' ( p. 108 ) .On page 114 , Socrates asked , `` You know , do n't you , that everyone except the philosophers regards death as a great evil ? '' Socrates was deluded for not believing it himself ! Is man 's soul inherently immortal ? Socrates answered in the affirmative , for on page 167 , we read : `` Well , '' said Socrates , `` can we say that that has been proved ? What do you think ? `` What was the immediate , preceding context ? Socrates had asked , `` And what do we call that which does not admit death ? '' The answer given was `` Immortal . '' The philosopher followed up with , `` And the soul does not admit death ? '' The answer given to this was , `` No . '' Socrates concluded , `` So soul is immortal . '' The answer given was affirmative.Thus , according to Plato ( in line with the serpent 's lie long before ) , man 's soul does not `` admit death . '' According to Jesus , the souls of unbelievers will eventually die . See Matthew 10:28 . In other words , after sufficient punishment in hell , the souls of unbelievers , to use biblical language , will be destroyed - will perish . On the other hand , believers in Jesus will receive the gift of eternal life.Socrates also promoted the lie of every false religion -- that man can save himself by being good . He said ( p. 170 ) : `` the soul ... can have no escape or security from evil except by becoming as good and wise as it possibly can , '' but Isaiah had prophesied 300 years prior of the Messiah 's substitutionary death for sinners ( Isaiah 53 ) . Our sins were put on Him , and He puts His robe of perfect righteousness ( Jeremiah 23:6 ) and immortality ( 1 Corinthians 15:53-54 ) on us who believe as a wonderful gift from Socrates ' and Plato 's Maker , Creator Christ . Here is the link to my book : [ ... ]	-1
I did n't like it . Not enough draw to keep you intrigued enough to keep reading it . Maybe if I saw the theatre production I would enjoy it better .	-1
I have to agree , this narrator , is not very good . First , the breathing , the saliva ... . and the fact that it lulls you to sleep .	-1
I knew little of the story when I picked up this book . In fact , I was one of those people who thought the monster 's name was Frankenstein . Whoops ... Anyways , I found that the narrative structure of the book to be distracting , the stereotypical characters annoying , and the monster actually coming alive ( taking place in less than a paragraph ) to be a let down .	-1
Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch . In its time , everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic . ( Including , and especially , Alcott . ) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo . ( For Little Women , it was daring to show girls with personalities , for Brady Bunch , it was new to show blended families . ) The world was never like this -- even Alcott 's own life was not . She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell : a noble , genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today 's nostalgiacs . If you enjoy that , great . Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed .	-1
This is a book that just beats you over the head again and again with moral instruction ; as a result , I found it to be just barely readable ( especially the first half ) . To be fair , I could imagine grownups wanting their children to read this- especially since the parents in this story ( and two of the four sisters ) are so cloyingly perfect that they make Biblical heroes seem like gangsters in comparison.But I personally found it to be unappealing . It is basically a bland story of bland girls obeying blandly likable authority and doing well by doing so . In a sense , it is kind of the anti-Huck Finn . ( In The Adventures of Huckelberry Finn , the title character grows morally by trying to free a slave , essentially battling authority ) .	-1
Reading C & P is like getting hit on the head with a sledgehammer , repeatedly . The author has a point to make ; he makes it . Then , just in case you did n't get it , he makes it again . And again . And again . There , now did you get it ? The entire book could be condensed into a short story and still effectively convey the same message . And on a more minor note , should n't *something* happy happen at least once in a novel ? Should n't there be at least one scene in which a little birdie chirps a happy song from a pretty tree ? Does *everyone* have to be spitting up their lungs into the gutter on a dark and gloomy day ? Sheesh ! !	-1
I do not think this book worthy of my review . In fact I gave up after only reading about ten percent of the pages	-1
As so many of the other reviewers have said , this book is boring . As if that were n't bad enough , it 's also packed full of contradictions and some seemingly made up `` scientific proof . `` First of all , the author states that ( compared to wolves ) little scientific studies have been done involving dogs . This is so far from the truth that it 's laughable ! Tufts , Harvard , MIT , the University of Pennsylvania , the University of Bristol , and so many other colleges and universities have done major studies on everything from how food impacts behavior to fearfulness to aggression . A simple Google search would have turned many of these studies up.The author seems to have done absolutely no research on canine behavior , and - as others have said - he really seems to dispise dogs , not love them . He spouts on and on about how dogs are dominant , parasitic creatures who view signs of affection and love from their human owners as weakness . While this sure is a new way to look at things , it sure does n't make any sense.A `` pure '' geneticist , he does n't believe for a second that upbringing has anything to do with how a dog 's personality or temperament develops , and claims that the vast majority of dogs in shelters are there due to aggression issues ( because the owner was nice . ) While it 's true that the number one cause of death in the United States is euthanasia due to behavioral issues , it is n't true that the majority of shelter dogs are there because of aggression . `` Behavior issue '' and `` aggression '' are two very different things . Something else that a Google search would have cleared up for him.Pathetic at best , dispicable at worst . Do n't waste your money .	-1
After an intriguing prologue , this book went nowhere . I read nearly 300 pages before anything remotely interesting happened , and then another 200 before Clancy mercifully found his way to an ending . Do n't waste your time .	-1
I am like most others here a Clancy fan . I have read all of his fiction work and for the most part rather enjoyed it . When I was done reading Red Rabbit I thought , ok for some reason he needed to tell that boring uneventful story . The next one would once again run the normal 1200+ pages and keep me reading late into the night . Well I ran out an picked this one up . It 's a little over 400 pages . In most Clancy stories that 's just the prologue . The idea for the story is a good one , the whole independent spy shop deal . The problem is the characters , why must the main characters be related to Jack Ryan Sr. ? There is no reason for them to be related . It is about time you move away from Ryan and start something else . Nobody says you ca n't write the techno-thrillers , just not with Ryan . Also everyone is a genius , they are all super super smart people who turned down the millions they could have made to either work for the US government or the `` Shop '' . Everyone is a PHD or CPA , even the security guard at the door is a ex-Special Forces operator . Another thing that has started to get on my nerves is the way everyone talks . If I have to hear `` she 's a doc '' or `` when I had a fighter plane strapped to my back '' again I think I 'm going to scream ! ! ! Nobody talks like that.Now having said that , I would like to say again that the idea of the book is pretty good and could be expanded into a few good tales ( the 1200+ page kind ) .Also the information we are given about the Ryan Sr. story arc seemed rather interesting . Would have been nice to got into that a bit more . So in closing , please drop the Jack Jr. ... and move on ... ... ... ...	-1
This one is a miserable disappointment . No plot , no decent characters ; in short , it is a bore . The notion that the Government would commission a couple of idiots like this to run around illegally killing people is , well , who knows ? At any rate , pass this one by . I have thoroughly enjoyed many of Clancy 's novels . Not this one . RJB .	-1
About a decade ago Niall Ferguson wrote an economic history of early 20th century Hamburg . This got him the respect of his fellow historians , but not lots of money . In 1998 he published `` The Pity of War '' which , while less thoroughly researched , earned him considerable public notice . Ferguson became one of the most prominent historians in Britain , and he has now published `` Empire '' . This book purports to show that the British Empire was an ultimately beneficial endeavour that benefited the world by showering it with the benefits of globalization and free trade in labor and capital . As such , it is a model the United States should consider as it faces the threat of Al-Qaidya.Empire is not a vulgar apology for imperialism . Indeed , it is not much of an apology for anything , since argument does n't play that much of a part in it . This is a book for a television series , and , ultimately , is not much more than a coffee table book . [ It seems ] More care has been taken to choose the illustrations than provide a coherent narrative . What we have basically is a narrative that starts with Sir Francis Drake and then hits the high points up until the Suez crisis . It is very much a `` great man '' history . We learn a lot about Dr. Livingstone and his missionary efforts . We learn little about the people he converted , or for that matter the vast majority he did n't convert . We are told that there were racists , but we learn little about racism or nationalist ideologies . Nor does Ferguson mention the many colonial subjects who immigrated to Britain , and their effect on the country . Come to think of it , various parts of the empire flit in and out of the narrative for half-centuries at a time , whether it is the Caribbean , South Africa , Canada or Burma . ( And did Ferguson ever actually mention Nigeria , a country whose 130 million people is that of Britain 's ? ) With its focus on battles and spectacles , this might make an interesting television series , but it adds nothing to our knowledge of the empire.For a historian known for his enthusiasm for neoclassical economics , Ferguson does not really draw up a balance sheet for empire . To be fair , it 's not that he ignores the dark side . Were n't the Pequots and Tasmanians massacred ? Pretty much , he says . Were n't the Caribbean colonies founded on the vicious exploitation of hundreds of thousands of slaves ? You ca n't deny that . What about the Irish Potato famine and the Boer concentration camps ? Pretty bad . Once emancipated , were n't the Caribbean slaves denied political liberty and forced into new unjust economic arrangements ? Yeah , that 's not pretty . What about the Indian famines in the late 19th century that killed anywhere from 12 to 30 million people ? Yeah , that was n't nice . What about Imperialist opposition to Home Rule for Ireland ? Ok , that was wrong . Did n't Baden-Powell , founder of the Boy Scouts , systematically starve the native population of Mafeking so that the white settlers could live out the Boer siege in comfort ? Now that you mention it , that 's kind of embarrassing . There are some interesting details , such as the 6,000 servants for the Viceroy 's Palace in India , of whom 50 were employed solely to shew birds away . We are n't told how many people were killed when the British suppressed the Sepoy rebellion in 1857 , but Ferguson tells us that they hanged 150 people from one very large tree in Cawnpore alone . We listen to Anthony Trollope say with pseudo-stoic Tory humbug of the Australian aborigines that `` it was their fate to be abolished . '' We learn Hitler 's view that if he ran the British Empire he would have Gandhi summarily shot . Ferguson actually suggests that much of the notorious `` Thugee '' murders were not caused by the infamous Kali cult but by demobilized soldiers engaging in humdrum highway robbery.Ferguson tries to make an argument that British rule was good for India . Irrigation boomed , there were new coal and jute industries . But he also admits that India basically stagnated for two centuries , at a time when British living standards more than quadrupled . The truth is even worse . In 1750 India had a quarter of the world 's GDP . By 1900 it had only 1.7 % . And its industrial production collapsed . Rather feebly , Ferguson points out that independence did n't help China , although elsewhere he notes British aggression and interference in that country . ( The most outrageous being the Opium wars , in which a Liberal Britain forced China to import narcotics . ) More important he ignores the counter-example of Japan , which is clearly better off for avoiding imperialist rule altogether . He manages to ignore a whole host of historians of India , such as Parthasarathi , Guha , Sarkar and Hardiman , while the late Christopher Thorne is also missing from his shallow bibliography . The most Ferguson can say is to suggest that `` things might conceivably have been worse '' under native rule . The same problems occur in his conclusion when he suggests that immigration would have been less without a British empire , though in the 19th century immigrants overwhelmingly went to the United States . We are told that capital exports and free trade are unalloyed benefits , though whether Latin America has ever benefited from Britain and the United States ' financial arrangements is very much open to question . He writes that Britain sacrificed their empire to defeat Hitler and asks rhetorically `` Did not that sacrifice alone expunge all the Empire 's other sins ? '' Leaving aside the fact that Churchill did not know he was making this sacrifice in 1940 , I ca n't help but notice that the Soviet Union sacrificed even more . Where the British lots hundreds of thousands , they lost tens of millions . What atonement will Ferguson give them ? So if the British received absolution for their conquests , aggressions , famines and genocides they got it at an excellent bargain . And it is a bargain that , like so much in the history of the `` good '' empire , the British paid with other people 's lives .	-1
Started it , attempted it , many times lately but just could n't get through the web of confusion . Perhaps I like my histories a little more linear ... .	-1
Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was not the type of book I enjoy . I rarely ever start a book that I dont finish ! ! ! However with this one the thoughts were so unjointed the plot jumped from place to place- I couldnt keep up with the dialog . One main reason I quit reading the book halfway through- I dont like bad language- and this particular book was full of bad language- cussing etc . To me the young man had an anger problem- and it didnt impress me to like the book ! ! ! One of the few books I have quit reading in the middle of it- and I wouldnt go to see the movie either ! ! ! !	-1
I generally pick books at random and did n't have any idea what this book was about when I bought it . At first it seemed interesting when I discovered that it was about 9/11 , but that quickly changed into mild annoyance . The characters all seem insane and I ca n't relate to any of them . The boy 's grandmother or grandfather ( It was a bit hard to follow ) talked about using certain spaces in their apartment as private or 'invisible ' spaces , or something like that , and the couple would get confused about which spaces they were invisible in , and they were so modest that they could n't see eachother naked , they had to be in the 'invisible ' space to change their clothes , etc . I just do n't get it . I did n't read too much past that . It seemed like everyone in the story was screwed up in some way . It was a waste of money in my opinion beause I will probably never finish it .	-1
This is the hardest plot/story line to follow . It bounces around in time and lacks threads . The author did capture the dyslexic mind of a teenager but it made for a dyslexic reading experience . The Tom Hanks movie trailers suggested an interesting story but I would n't buy this book -- get it at a free library if it interests you .	-1
I bought `` You Shall Know Our Velocity '' based on my loving `` What is the What '' , which was my first Eggers book . I thought `` What is the What '' was really powerful stuff , well-written , gripping , a 5-star book all day . I realize this novel preceded that one and it definitely shows.As you probably know , the story centers on 2 friends , Will the narrator and 'Hand ' , who need to give away appx $ 32,000 in one week . They set off determined to travel the world trying to do so . Now to me , that sounds like a fun , wild caper of a tale . Something that should make a tremendous story , an epic trek . But unfortunately there 's also their 3rd friend Jack , who has recently died . The aftermath of Jack 's death is driving them in this desperation to get rid of the money.The characters came off depressing to me . The lead narrator Will is black-and-blued depressed , and not in the funny sort of neurotic way . His stream of consciousness/ conversations within his head were frankly too long and too frequent for my taste . I found them very irritating after awhile . Hand is supposed to be the cool guy/ good looking guy , but never really takes it to that next level . Sadly , I never got that sense of `` Wow ! '' in this book.I will agree that there was some great writing here and there , a few memorable incidents , but overall I came away let down and uninspired . And SAD , which is not good - `` What is the What '' deals with horribly depressing events , but that left me feeling moved and emotional and touched to the core . But with YSKOV , not at all .	-1
For some it may help , but for me I did n't agree with what was written . But hey try it . You may like it !	-1
I think I 've found my true calling in life . Create a joke of a new age cult and get a self absorbed talk show host to peddle it and then the sheep will line up to purchase it . I couldnt get through chapter one . Please , a moment of silence for everyone throwing their money away , feel the oneness with your fellow sheep . I wish there was a zero star option ! ! !	-1
I read this book before the charges against Mortenson came out . I loved it , it was inspiring , but unfortunately it was a lie . Mortenson even admits there was some `` license '' in the way the stories were told . For one example , he says he was not in Korphe for many days ( as portrayed in this book ) , but only like a few hours . Of course , that is assuming he was there at all , which it now seem he was not until much later than claimed . Considering this `` defining moment '' of his was a lie it should definitely make you question everything else . If you read `` Three Cups of Deceit '' by Jon Krakauer you get a lot of documented evidence of Mortenson 's deceit . These are named people including former CAI employees and board members who all quit because of Mortenson 's absolute refusal to show any type of financial accountability . It 's just sad CAI , which has a noble organization , gets caught up in all of this . Also , Outside Online , which initially published Mortenson 's rebuttal of the charges and one of his former climbing partner 's support for him , later even admitted that Mortenson was most likely lying about the Korphe episode.It seems some of the diehard fans of this book do n't want to accept the facts and still try to uphold Mortenson as some sort of hero . He might have started out with good intentions ( maybe ) , but his deceit and lies are still not justified . It 's too bad this is another false hero , but there is nothing wrong with admitting you were duped . I would advise you to not contribute to CAI unless Mortenson steps aside and they hire a board of directors that is financially transparent . And remember if you buy this book , 100 % of the proceeds will go to Mortenson and his co-writier and ZERO percent go to CAI ... even though CAI pays for ALL the book advertising and all Mortenson 's trips to promote his book .	-1
Trials and tribulations , Herculean efforts and almost too-good-to-be true stories of how one man tackled world peace through building schools in the most remote part of the Himalayas . After becoming lost and left for ( almost ) dead after failing to climb K2 , Mortensen claims to have befriended a village which launched his quest to build schools as a means to achieve world peace . The ideals seem to be real , yet the book is poorly written and at times inconsistent . I read it when it first came out and found the story inspirational . When Mortensen traveled around giving talks tickets sold out at many places , and it all sounded grand . Although I understand that a good story can have some creative leeway in the telling , I found many things that did not sit right , for example the way he seemed to ignore his family/wife and yet purport to make family values a high priority - even while abandoning them to take on his projects half way round the world . Later , when 60 minutes revealed fraud behind the stories and the self-promoting aspect of Greg 's false claims , I was disappointed but not too surprised . It is unfortunate as the concepts and ideas are sound , but the black mark leaves doubt that casts a shadow on all such efforts	-1
Wow . Now that 's some bad writing . Seriously . This book should have been a paragraph long article in Time Magazine . Unfortunately I had to read this for my book club . What an agonizing amount of work to plow through this one ... .But on the positive side , the deeds of Greg are commendable and I feel grateful for my comfortable life .	-1
The book is about the life cum work done by Greg Mortenson . The beginning of the book is about his life growing up , his love for hiking and his family . The second part of the book is about work he has done as the head of Central Asia Institute ( CAI ) in promoting education and women empowerment in Pakistan and Afghanistan . CAI has been involved in establishing numerous schools in the northern region of Pakistan and Afghanistan . The entire work started when Mr.Mortenson stumbled in a remote area by accident , was treated very generously and made a promise to establish a school . He faced a lot of odds at personal level and financial level to get the task done , but in the end it was finished . Recently , it has been reported that Mr.Mortenson is a fraud and the schools do n't exist . I am not quite sure about the credibility of the story nor Mr.Mortenson . So the review has been edited treating the book like a story book.While the story of the book is impressive and is very well written , there are pieces with which I do n't quite agree or like . To me personally the book gives a hint of a political bias towards Pakistan in the entire conflict in the subcontinent region ( Disclaimer : I am an Indian , but at the same time consider myself to be level headed ) . The authors talks about the shelling from Indian army and consequently the refuge situation in Pakistan . Has the author even cared to ponder about the situation across the border ? There are thousands of families in India of Kashmiri Pandits living like refugees due to Islamic extremism , shelling and violence from Pakistan . These families have faced persecution at the hand of terrorists sponsored by Pakistan since the two countries were created . I am not expecting Mr. Mortenson to write a political book , but at the same time , a statement of paragraph to balance the bias might have helped.When someone is doing this kind of work , it is always interesting to see what their families go through and how they survive . He gives brief glimpse into it , every now and then . But the book ends without any more details about how his wife Tara and kids are coping.There is no summary of how much money has been spent till now , how many schools were opened in total . Are all schools functional ? Any schools went down after all the chaos ? There are plenty of unanswered questions . The book seems to be missing a lot of stuff.I do appreciate what he has been trying to do and the objective of the mission . Still I am giving it a four star , because I feel the book can be written in a much better way .	-1
This is a kum-bah-ya book . Building schools is n't going to change the game . The Taliban and their supporters hate us no matter how many coloring books and boxes of crayons that we provide . The French tried it in Algeria , then the US tried it in Vietnam . Why should anybody expect this to work again against a determined foe ?	-1
After reading `` Fooled By Randomness '' , I eagerly looked forward to reading Taleb 's latest book , only to be disappointed . He mentions both in the prologue and acknowledgments , `` the book just wrote itself '' , and it shows . He could have fitted most of the 300 pages into 50 and gotten his points across . In any event , this book does not add anything more to `` Fooled By Randomness '' ( 194 pages ) and is often rambling and incoherent . Perhaps if one read The Black Swan first , it may have been interesting but not if you read Taleb 's previous excellent book .	-1
Starting with the good ( chapters 15 - 17 ) , within chapter 15 Taleb explains where the Bell curve works and where it does not . The Bell curve captures well variables that do n't deviate much from the mean . Otherwise , it does not work . Taleb suggests we often fool ourselves in believing that correlation , regression coefficients , or standard deviation convey much information . This is because those coefficients are unstable ( and can flip sign when possible ) depending on the time selected . This is because the underlying variables are often not stationary enough for these coefficients to be stable.Chapter 16 is excellent as an introduction to Mandelbrot 's fractal geometry as an alternative to Gaussian based investment theory . He supports well that these mathematical tools do capture randomness ( of non-stationary variables ) far better than the Normal distribution . However , he admits that Mandelbrotian models are not predictive . When looking at the same data set , he and numerous colleagues each came up with different underlying parameters to build fractal-like models . And a small difference in such parameters makes a huge difference in outcome . That 's why you will not hear much of fractal geometry within the quantitative financial community . Nevertheless , this is a fascinating subject that deserves further exploration . For this purpose , I recommend Mandelbrot'sThe Misbehavior of MarketsWithin Chapter 17 , Taleb further elaborates on the flaws of the Normal distribution . He underlines that half of the return of the stock market over the past 50 years was associated with just 10 days with the greatest daily change . This is an example where stock returns have outliers of such magnitude that using the Normal distribution is not appropriate . Taleb describes the run-ins he experienced with the living legends of modern finance including Myron Scholes and Robert Merton due to his rejection of the Normal distribution assumption that underlies all their models.The remainder of the book is not nearly as good . Hundreds of pages can be summed up in just stating that we ca n't predict rare events . Taleb goes way overboard in attributing everything to luck . He thinks MicroSoft beat out Apple just due to luck . Taleb does not consider that MicroSoft open system allowed it to mushroom while Apple locked itself into a proprietary corner . Also , according to Taleb both the rise and fall of Rome were due entirely to luck . But , Rome was best at developing military strategy and transportation networks . However , it eventually suffered from imperial overstretch . Explanations are not always narrative fallacies as Taleb believes . They often beat out ignorance.When it comes to advice , Taleb 's recommendation is interesting . It consists in an asset allocation of 85 % risk free investments ( T-bill ) and the 15 % remainder into buying way out of the money Calls and Puts . By doing so , he positions his portfolio to capture the occasional mispriced Black Swans.This book is somewhat uneven in quality and is not nearly as good as his first book : Fooled by Randomness Revision ( Not Available in US ) : The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and Lifethat has become a classic on Wall Street . Otherwise , it still is an interesting reading.If you find the subject of this book intriguing , let me suggest a few other books that are more rewarding . Scott Plous'sThe Psychology of Judgment and Decision Makingexplores the flaws in human judgments far more thoroughly and clearly than Taleb in ` The Black Swan . ' Perry Mehrling'sFischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Financeis also an excellent book . Ideally , that may be who Taleb would have liked to become . Fischer Black was brilliant and as skeptical as Taleb regarding much of the body of economics and finance . Yet , he left a great legacy of elegant models that people still use extensively including the famous Black-Scholes option model . Yes those models were often based on Taleb 's dreaded Normal distribution . But , with minor modifications those models have remained valuable . Another recommendation is William Poundstone'sFortune 's Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Streetthat describes the career of a bright MIT mathematician , Ed Thorp . The latter showed how to successfully deal with uncertainty in gambling and investing . Even Taleb recognized Thorp 's unique expertise within ` Black Swan . '	-1
At first this book lulls you into a sense of something important . The writer talks about the ways our minds react to great and shocking events in history . First there 's surprise . Then there 's a processing and afterwards we fool ourselves into believing that we knew it was coming all along . His examples include 9/11 , the Lebanese war , the great stock market crash of 1987 and WWI . His biographical material about living in Lebanon when it was a paragon of stability is particularly fascinating.However , the book does n't really say much of anything besides the fact that people are usually shocked by the big events . Well , they really would n't be the big events if they did n't shock everyone . And his biographical material about taking trading jobs that offer him a chance at sabbaticals seems like he 's still advertising himself - as if it 's not enough that we bought the book - he 's still trying to convince us that he 's a smart philosopher . He even gives himself props for predicting the 1987 crash when he predicted that S -- - Happens.Sadly , once he gets to a biography of an innovative writer who wrote philosophical novels with the dialogue in different languages and a real distaste for modern creative writing programs , he crashes into the brick wall of inanity . The biography is basically about an unknown but stubborn writer who gets a lot of notes from editors and agents about what she should change . But she 's not going to change anything because she 's that stubborn . Then she posts it on a Web site and a small press publisher decides to make her an offer . Then the book breaks through the zeitgeist and causes a sensation and changes everything . This is his example of a Black Swan in literary circles.This example is irritating for many reasons.First , she 's a fictional character . Some of the story aspects mirror his career but a lot of that is wishful thinking.Second , philosophical novels are nothing new . Aldous Huxley , Simone Beauvoir and Ayn Rand wrote them and they only wrote them . They are without a doubt some of the most tedious excuses for fiction in the world . I would sooner read a romance novel where the word `` hunk '' is used without irony than another page ofAfter Many a Summer Dies the Swan.Third , that awful little story is the same story that every hack writer tells him or herself . They are n't getting published because they are too good and too innovative and ONE DAY , their awful little book will find a publisher and make everyone a ton of money . I 've read enough slush forTeddy Bear Cannibal Massacreto know that most writers are simply bad . Encouraging writers with this crap keeps the Vanity Presses hopping but it offers nothing to the literary world.Fourth , when discussing literature the `` black swan '' is nothing new . Many authors become `` overnight bestsellers '' and offer innovative books that change the market dramatically . The literary establishment thrives on these books and is always looking for the next big thing . However , several classics are solidly within the literary market traditions of the time . Wuthering Heights is a gothic romance . The Big Sleep is a murder mystery.As soon as the author taxes the reader 's patience with this garbage story , it 's almost impossible to get it back . You know how you meet someone and you think they are the coolest person in the world . And suddenly they do or say one stupid thing and suddenly everything that you thought was cool is really sad and pathetic ? That 's this book . Suddenly , nothing in the beginning of the book is all that great . And the author talking about circular logic and the way its impossible to predict future events based on past events because logically you are never certain of anything but the negative - I learned all this in Logic 101 . Great to see it restated , but I 'm not really on a nostalgic kick.All in all , this is one of those books in the `` Duh '' school of thought . There 's nothing particularly deep or innovative but the prose is convoluted enough to make it sound deep . Once you realize that it 's not deep , you realize that you 've just wasted your time with a day trader that has too much time on his hands .	-1
It is a mystery to me how such an excellent writer as Silva obviously is could write such a interesting story and then put the whole thing into the tank with an unbelievably bad ending . Nothing gets resolved . Maybe he 's setting up the reader for a sequel . this reader wo n't be reading it though . I was looking to see if some pages had been torn out of the book . Two stars at best .	-1
I rarely write a negative review . It just does n't help the promotion of the book or the author . But this one was a non-finisher for me . Could n't get past the sugar . Could n't get past the fact that through all that STUFF none of the characters learned a thing . Could n't get past the cute phonetic vernacular . I thought that went out with Mark Twain . That was the major reason I found this novel an annoying read . The author could have taken one small step further and , with care and thought , created the sound of the south through syntax rather than desecrating the English language.This lady is a fine writer . I would like to see her get past her mannerisms , study the form , and become a fine novelist .	-1
I grew up an hour 's drive from Jackson , Mississippi , albeit a generation before that of Ms. Stockett , and this slight novel did not ring true in any way for me . I found the characters stock and unengaging , and the writing arch and contrived for cheap laughs . I was assured that I would recognize the characters , but I did not . The white women were a tiny bit more believable than the black women . The book 's only real humor , for me , was in the parody of `` high society '' in the utterly provincial town of Jackson . I strongly suggest reading Eudora Welty to discover something more than the surface of Mississippi 's shameful racist past ( and present ? ) .A good comparison for this work would be John Kennedy Toole 's `` A Confederacy of Dunces '' which brilliantly succeeds in interpreting life in New Orleans . Fanny Flagg 's work is far far funnier , and more real .	-1
Found it impossibly slow , difficult and boring reading ... .not my idea of a classic ! I do n't have 7 more words to say about it as required	-1
This book comes highly recommended to me however I find it a little to long a lot to boring for me .	-1
I 'm sure if I had n't seen the movie , ( DVD ) I would n't have had the least understanding of what was going on half the time.The book was very boring , with long unending sentences and characters that made no sense . Yet , I kept reading and reading until I was done . I think I was determined to make some sense out of it . After words and words of whatever , the ending came to a short , brief end . To this day , I 'm not sure if Marianne was ever in love with Mr. Brandon , or she just admired him and married him because her family thought it best . Nor could I find one single reason why Elinor who was to have had some sense would have fallen for an idiot like Edward.The long silly relationship between Edward and Lucy was ridiculous , and made no sense at all . For the older sister to even care for a nerd like Edward when she was the one who was supposed to have some sense , made no sense . As to the rest of the characters , they were all ridiculous , pompous or stupid , and had no sense or sensibility at all.The film was much better . Do n't bother with the book .	-1
I have read all of Kuzneski 's books and I think of him as one of the weaker writers of this genre . That said , this novel was a large waste of time . I kept waiting for something to happen . It never had a pay off . Much of this book is filled with what the author must think of as clever dialogue and over the top bragging about his characters . His characters never demonstrate the prowess he maintains they possess.He also built up this awesome cache of treasure and at the end we got no specific description and no history altering discovery . I think he was better off having the character Maria confirm that Jesus had been to preColumbian meso America .	-1
Ella and her estranged husband Sebastian live next door to each other . Ella lives in the farmhouse which was their family home and Sebastian lives in a converted granary across the farmyard . Ottoline , Sebastian & # 8217 ; s eccentric aunt also lives in another converted outbuilding . With stroppy teenage children , a mother who seems to have gone off the rails and who has come to stay and a chicken with an identity crisis , Ella has her hands full.This should have been an entertaining read but for me it missed the boat . I found long stretches of it quite boring and I found I had no sympathy with Ella at all and felt she was making excuses for not sorting out her life . I did find flashes of humour from time to time and I liked Ottoline who seemed the most interesting character in the book & # 8211 ; along with Ladyboy , the transsexual chicken.The story seemed to plod along and not having any sympathy with the narrator spoiled the whole thing for me . I & # 8217 ; m sure Catherine Alliot & # 8217 ; s many fans will love this book but it didn & # 8217 ; t do much for me and I think I shan & # 8217 ; t be reading any more books by this author .	-1
I had heard so much about this book that I had been wanting to read it for years . Somehow it always escaped me but when I found it sitting at a used book store I decided to quench my curiosity about it.I know it 's a true story and that 's what 's supposed to make it so great but as terrible as it sounds I think this story should have been left to wilt in the memories of the people of Holcomb Kansas . There was nothing at all interesting about this book . The people involved were not interesting , the random act of violence itself was not interesting , and the setting was enough to drive anyone bonkers . One more description of a flowing wheat ( or was it corn ? ) field and I 'd have permanent twitches.The only interesting thing in this entire book was a little poem quoted in it by one of the killers . That 's IT . I could n't have been more thoroughly disappointed with a classic of literature but I did learn one thing ... If I were a teenage girl living in 1950 's Kansas I would have surely either died of boredom or killed myself for something to do . There 's nothing less appetizing then basing your teenage life on teaching other children how to cook pies . That was indeed how uninteresting that character was ...	-1
Not being an English Literature major , nor an avid reader , I nevertheless decided to read the entire top 100 novels . I would start with the top novel , Ulysses . In that fashion , of reading the best novel first , I could excite myself , that is to kickstart myself , into reading quality material . Prior to this adventure , I mostly focused on the books I could understand , like calculus or structural engineering . Ulysses is far more complex than those references.To ask : Did I finish the book ? I must say yes , times one point five . And I accomplished the feat in under three years . After a severe mental breakdown from trying to choke down the book in two bites , I started over after being half finished . I was sure that I had missed something in the first half , so I wanted to return and see what I missed . I searched hard , taking time to savor every word , often looking up words that I thought I may be misinterpreting , But to no avail . But I persisted.I made it through the chapter about Stephen Dedalus for the second time , and was encouraged that more exciting events were sure to surface.Then , through the second chapter about Bloom , I began to get very worried that I would just give up my quest for fine arts . But survived , realizing that I only had several hundred more pages to wade through , to the climax , and forthcoming literary rewards.So I finally approached the end of the novel , reaching the last chapter , paragraph , or sentence , whatever it may be considered , being that it was devoid of punctuation for nearly 100 pages . Apparently it was the authors form of providing the run-on thoughts of a mixed up middle-aged woman , in the middle of non-fulfilling acts of sleeping , half sleeping , dreaming , or other non-physical event.In conclusion , Do n't read the book . Burn it hard . Do not let your children read the book -- -it will mutilate their brain cells . Run fast to the local library and check out a nice text about advanced vector calculus , and a nice bottle of wine . It will be so much more pleasurable .	-1
I can not think about any book that was written more for the writer himself and possibly aspiring authors of future generations but with so much disregard for the interests of normal readers.Communication is possible when the parties agree on the need to be comprehendible . When one willingly breaks every law of the language of the time at will , the jibber-jabber that comes out may be aesthetically pleasing but can not maketh a story for ordinary people . The author clearly proves his extraordinary skills at writing through the sheer variety of the writing style absurdities used , language distortions , the raw depiction of thoughts , crazy description of the most banal etc . There are many others ever since the book has been written who prove their intelligence by trying to de-codify or understand at least some of what the author has written.All that said , the real life folks are entitled to wonder what 's all the fuss despite some good human interactions and family/feminist/psychological issues raised . A modern art painting with hidden messages is different and easy to appreciate : this book is equivalent of a series of the most inscrutable of such paintings for every page where the degree of complexity compounds because of the reliance on everything understood , misunderstood or not understood before.Essentially , the book is a super-genius ' indulgence . Apart from the writing , the genius is also visible ( and again not comprehendible always ) in the subtle and contrasting parallels drawn with the Odyssey , the topics raised through the conversations of the Dubliners on a single days etc . One should marvel at what is attempted . And accept the challenge of trying to comprehend at least some . Even reading others ' understanding is mildly interesting . But overall , this is not a book for all . It is easy to see why the best writers of the last few decades love the work as there is a lot for some types of aspiring writers but that 's about it .	-1
I was so disspointed with this book considering i read and enoyied Dubliners and Portrait of a Artist as a Young Man and it is on alot of best books of all time list . The reason i liked Joyce 's previous work is that both are not too long , he was a good writer and i am against the catholic church so any book that critizes it is okay with me . With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style . But trying to read Ulysses is such a chore you end up scratching your head and having to read passages over and over again untill you get it . I gave up after after 300 pages and just went to [ ... ] to read the study guide instead .	-1
As much as The Fountainhead was a stunning , original piece of literature , Atlas Shrugged falls flat in comparison . It is overly long and extremely repetitive in hammering home the same basic concepts without adding anything substantial in the process . Let 's not even get into the preposterousness of the basic plot of the book itself : an attempt at secession by the world 's greatest minds to recreate their own perfect society from scratch . Never mind the fact that with what we now know about Mendelian genetics , a couple like John Galt and Dagny Taggart could have kids and ... have them turn out to be a couple of Wesley Mouchs and Jim Taggarts.Also , Rand 's writing style in this book has n't aged well . It could be seen as quiant and dated , or in many cases , simply corny and outdated.If Ayn Rand would have you know her perfect world , Galt 's Gulch would be populated by nothing but chain-smoking , tall , thin , angular , beautiful Aryan egotists . So which topflight secessionist doctor would take care of all their eventual cases of lung cancer ? Anecdotally , many of the smartest people I 've met have often been short , pudgy and unattractive ... while some of the tall , beautiful people Rand seemed to worship turned out to be real boneheads . There are n't many of them , but the true intellectual elite come in all kinds shapes , sizes and colors.Also , I find it interesting that the protagonist Dagny Taggart beds ALL the leading men in ascending order of importance ... and they all work it out happily in the end . I find it completely implausible that these three great men ( D'Ancona , Reardon , and Galt ) would all fall madly in love with a woman who thinks and acts ... just like a man . If history has taught us anything , it 's that the world 's great statesmen and industrialists usually marry women for their beauty and fertility , not necessarily their minds.As an unabashed stand-in for Rand 's own view of herself , Dagny Taggart 's actions and the endless romantic mind games that she goes through with the three men only reflect the fact that Rand herself was in an open marriage ... an open marriage that she basically imposed upon her cuckolded , resentful husband ... and sought to rationalize and legitimize it by including it clumsily in her work.None of the concepts of Rand 's pseudo-philosophical `` objectivism '' are furthered in this book . You could read the Fountainhead and get all that you will ever get out of Rand out of that book . What Atlas Shrugged has done is spawn almost an entire generation of egomaniacs who pretended to understand her works and identify themselves with her superhuman protagonists , only to find that people are human and have weaknesses . They sought to live up to Rand 's Superhuman ideal , only to find themselves fallible , but still with the massive ego . In fact , the sheer MASS of overinflated egotism in this book made it painful to read at times.We all know now that you ca n't have a society with all Chiefs and no Indians . We also now know that though Ayn Rand/Dagny Taggart may find nothing more beautiful than a smokestack billowing greenhouse gases , the Earth 's environment is indeed finite and limited and not just another resource to be exploited by man in the name of the almighty $ $ . Rand tried to elevate her worship of Capitalism -- and thus her concept of `` Objectivism '' -- to a form of philosophy or religion , but seemed to not grasp the fundamental limitations of it to as merely for only human political and socialogical ends . I found particularly specious and laughable her attempt to somehow attribute Capitalistic motivations behind Richard Halley 's classical musical compositions ... as if every superior human endeavour , including artistic ones , could be attributed to Capitalism.Just read The Fountainhead . It 's so superior to this book in every way , and it is written so much more succinctly . Rand seemed to be able to identify with superhuman men , she should 've hired one to edit this book .	-1
Oh wow I could not get past the 1st page . The style was cold and dense . I should have known better if she is a proponent of Objectivism .	-1
I can not figure out why this novel was/is so popular . The writing is absolutely horrible . The characters have no depth . Ayn Rand could have saved herself a lot of time by cutting half the speeches , which are endlessly redundant . She hits you over the head with her philosophy . By page 600 I got it ! I did not need another 600 pages for further explanation . There are so many wonderful books to be read , if you are interested in her philosophy , read her shorter book , save your time and move on to something good .	-1
Ayn Rand 's excruciatingly long diatribe on how the vast majority of the world is mooching off a few talented people ( called the prime movers ) . She creates these god like beings who , despite the books insistence on them being perfectly rational , go about doing and thinking absurd things.The climax of absurdity is when we discover the secret utopian valley of these prime movers . These men are so hard working and brilliant that they are able to do the work of hundreds of men in a six hour work day . Ayn Rand 's theory of art is said to be that of `` romantic realism '' , she tends more towards romance then realism.Second only to this in absurdity is where the heroine , Dagny , shoots a man for being indecisive . Given that Rand goes on about the need for a rational basis for morality this struck me as more then hypocritical.Other interesting aspects : Insistence on a gold standard , desire for the complete abolition of taxes , and the world wide domination of communism . The `` proof '' of all these things was reported , by Dagny , to be in John Galts 5000 page ( at least that 's how long it seemed ) speech . I dare anyone to find anything resembling a proof proving Ayn Rand 's philosophy.Atlas Shrugged will appeal only to those as deluded and narcissistic as Ayn Rand..	-1
When I see a bumper sticker & # 34 ; Who is John Galt ? & # 34 ; I always wonder if the rest of the bumper sticker -- & # 34 ; He 's a poorly written , less-than-one-dimensional character in a poorly written book that appeals to 15-year-old boys and misanthropes & # 34 ; -- somehow got lost in the printing process.This is a god-awful book . You do n't get polemics like this outside of Pravda . Just a book with a haranguing , endlessly forced viewpoint with wooden characters and the worst dialogue you will ever read .	-1
This is political doctrine in the form of a novel . Unsurprisingly , characters are psychologically flat . Everything is way too simple for the author , the people , the values , the economy . If you are a devoted Libertarian and like to indulge in the warm , fuzzy feeling that this young person 's philosophy ( gun-ho simplistic and optimistic ) , you will like Atlas Shrugged . Otherwise , you will find it difficult to deal with all the ideology that this book really is . I give this books two shrugs .	-1
I read this to my seven year old son , and he enjoyed it . Dahl does have a gift for language , and the story about a young boy and the father who loves him dearly is very charming , made even more so by Quentin Blake 's delightful illustrations.But , as I explained to my son , the story glorifies stealing ( romanticized as poaching ) . It does n't matter if the victim is a hideous , cruel human being who deserves a grand comeuppance , it 's still stealing . Another point worth mentioning is that Danny , the young boy , is the most grown-up person in the cast of characters -- he 's the one who instinctively knows the right thing to do , while it 's the impulsive adults who act like children . Good points to bring up with one 's own children , if you 're going to read this to them.The Roald Dahl Brigade surely will go after me for this .	-1
Maybe it 's just me . I 've wormed my way past the drama of the teenage years with never having much of the drama that popular media is so happy to display as the norm . Not that what happens in this novel is n't serious or horrible , but goodness , did it take an entire book to tell us that ? We have a girl . We do n't see much of her personality ( does she have one ? ) or character . She 's miserable , and it 's pretty clear from the beginning why . Unfortunately , I was only able to give her the smallest hint of pity because , hey , I did n't care about her . That 's important for writing : make us care ! Another mistake of teen novels : stereotypes . It was sickening to behold . No one is given a chance to develop , no one is anything but what society says they are . It 's PATHETIC and needs to stop.Still , the author made a good attempt , and the writing itself was quite lovely . Still not enough to merit a recommendation .	-1
I read `` My Side of the Mountain '' as a child . It remained one of the few children 's books that I reread once a decade or so . Then I read the second book . Not as good , but sequels seldom are . Then I read this piece of excrement . Thankfully , I borrowed it from the library and did n't pay any money for it.Mrs . George takes her wonderful tale and turns it into this tiresome ham-fisted tirade against business and government . There 's an awkward screed against one group or another in every chapter - with only a few of the `` enlightened '' not tarred and feathered.I used to be a fan . Now , I doubt I 'll give my niece and nephew any of her books for fear they might read this one .	-1
The movie did n't flow well , felt disjointed , not horrible but could have been much better . Hopefully they wont try to make all the books into films , quit while you 're ahead .	-1
It is a known fact that I did not care for the first book . I was n't able to connect with Belly . The way she would string along all the guys in her life irritated me beyond belief . Not only that but she came across as self centered and childish . I do n't think she changed much from the first book.This book finds Belly and Jeremiah in search for Conrad . Their search leads them to Cousins Beach . When they find Conrad everyone has decisions to make that will forever change them.While writing that short summary I realized that not much has happened in this book.Belly 's relationship with Conrad is not perfect . He is flawed in many ways , but I felt like Belly does n't want to accept that . She refuses to see how Conrad is not the & # 34 ; perfect & # 34 ; guy and that he is struggling with the death of his mother , the potential loss of their beach house , and anger at his father . Most girlfriends or even friends would want to help or at least stand by their friend through these tough times , not Belly . She wants Conrad 's entire focus.I felt like as I read this Belly would be jumping in a corner yelling , & # 34 ; look at me , look at me ! & # 34 ; I have a major problem with Belly jumping from one brother to the next . Yeah , both boys have feelings for Belly , but who asks their brother if they are done with a girl so they can have them ? ? ? I struggle with that . Maybe it 's the fact that I grew up with 2 brothers as good friends and I ca n't see dating both , or even one for that matter.It just feels wrong ... like you are forever driving a wedge between family members , forever destroying that bond.The thing that irritates me beyond belief is Belly . She is 17 , but I felt as though I was listening to a 13 year old tell her story . Where was the growth from the last book ? ? ? Why has n't she matured ? ? The storyline was lacking . Looking back nothing happened . There was a party , a fight , a few flash backs , a smaller fight and that was it . I was looking for more.. more meat.. something ... anything.I will find myself reading the final installment because some sick part of me needs to know who Belly ends up with and in what manner . Is she going to destroy Conrad or Jeremiah on her journey for the perfect boyfriend ? ? I wish I were continuing to read because it was good story , but I ca n't say that .	-1
Just to put it out there , this is definitely not my favorite book of the series . This book turned out to be super slow and not as much action as I liked . It did n't even have the usual Rose humor that carried me through the previous books . No , what this book was a revisit of New Moon , in which I want to gouge my eye out.First , we get the recap of previous books , which takes up a huge chunk of the beginning and happens throughout the book . It 's not even exciting recaps , but just endless paragraphs reciting what had happened before . I know it 's the 4th book , and readers are going to read through that or just skip it , but at least try to make it a bit less painful for us . After that , Rose spent the first half of the book brooding about whether she could kill Dimitri . Then there 're endless flashbacks of scenes of her and Dimitri in the past that we never saw . Then there 're times when she was just looking at Lissa to see what Lissa was doing , which was also nothing exciting until the very end.The second half gets just a bit better . There was a bit more of Dimitri and them together , but also lacked action . I felt mostly that this book was just what Rose reciting the events to us . The best part of the book was when I reached maybe 75 % when the action really started . I mean , by then , I could n't put the book down because every word was important.That 's not to say I did n't like the book at all . It was an OK book . I loved Russia and Dimitri 's family , but I did n't really see the point , unless they show up again later . The bit about blood whores always annoy me . I liked meeting Abe ( that was the only curveball in the end ) . I liked seeing Rose kind of grow up and find purpose in her life . There 're more spirit users and we find a bit more about spirit - well , let me take that back . Because spirit is so `` new '' , the author can do whatever she wants with it without fully explaining anything . The best we get is `` I do n't know . That 's never happened before . `` Anyway , this is a great book for those of you that love Rose and Dimitri together . For me , their romance just never felt right or that exciting . It might have something to do with Rose always telling me about their connection every time they interact . Please stop saying that , let me judge by myself . OK ? Dimitri is not my type of hero also . I love the sarcastic and witty with skeletons in the closet kind , but he 's just there . I do n't ever feel like he actually does anything . I like the current evil Dimitri more than the previous one . Now that 's kick-ass ! Some of you might be mad that I 'm giving this such a low rating , but seriously , after the ending , I felt like I wasted several hours of my life , because Rose did n't accomplish what she set out to do ( I should 've expected it ) , so what was the point of the book ? Ning @ Reading by Kindle Fire	-1
I bought the complete collection volume after reading the first book . The first two were great , the 3rd very good and had some interesting and exciting action . This one has too many coincidences right from the start , nobody is as lucky as Rose.The first maybe third of Blood Promise was a recap book and when it finally got down to it 's own plot it made me mumble `` perils of Pauline '' several times . Some books I do n't want to end , with this one I was afraid it would never end . I 'll read the last two of this series but there is no rush since it seems that when most authors continue a series past 3 that the quality goes down . I was planning on reading the Bloodlines series but now I 'm not so sure .	-1
We wo n't be reading this book . Not thrilled with the character plots - series went from family friendly to discussing issues I 'm not ready do discuss with my little boys . I wo n't be buying the next one either . Riordan - why did you cave ? Honestly the whole series is all about dating/kissing/feelings anymore anyways and I should have ditched at book one . I do n't want my kid 's focusing on those topics .	-1
I understand this is fiction but most fiction in this genre is realistic and believeable . The characters here are pretentious and unlikeable and definitely do not act like teenagers ( or anyone for that matter ) stricken with cancer . I realize this is n't a story about cancer but if the author wants to include that as part of the storyline , he should at least show cancer in its true light . Three of my four children are cancer survivors so that may influence my feelings regarding this book . To show these characters traveling around the world , dancing , drinking etc . - where does that energy come from when you 're full of chemo drugs and cancer cells ? Anyway , I 'm sure many readers will enjoy it - I do n't think many cancer patients or their loved ones will find it entertaining .	-1
ok , so this book is really dramatic but the author writes it in a weird way.I mean , the writing is so cheap and tacky , as if a teenager wrote it.I cant believe that every 16 year old is all like omg omg im crying ! The romance=disgusting because its weird and inappropriate for children.No way its a bestseller.This book should 've not even been published.By the way I would recommend the maze runner series way better.Maze runner is awesome	-1
****POSSIBLE SPOILERS****After a lot of thought , I think I have nailed down why I was not blown away by this book . I read it because my young teenaged daughter wants to read it , and I always try to know what she is reading . I also had been told how awesome the story was by adults in my life . Please keep in mind , that this is how I feel about the book and I am in no way trying to say that no one should read it ( everyone should read what they want and then make up their own mind ) or that if you loved it , as an attack on you.First I will say why I gave the book a generous two stars:1 . The pace was good and did n't drag-that helped me get to the end a lot faster.2 . I loved it when Augustus ' parents would n't let them watch a movie in his basement.Now for why I was so disappointed:1 . The characters ' development was non-existent . I never connected with Hazel nor Augustus . The fact that they had cancer was almost an after thought ; and the struggle , arc and growth that you would expect from a plot with two teenage cancer patients was just not there . I also feel like we were never even given a chance to get to know their families either . The supporting characters were more like stage props than the SUPPORT that a supporting character provides a story.2 . I figured out the dramatic/ & # 34 ; traumatic & # 34 ; twist of the story half way through . Not only did I figure it out , but when the scene happened , I found it to be very ANTI-climatic.3 . Language ... I am adult and when I read an adult book , I am totally prepared for language . This is advertised as a teen/young adult book and let me remind you that one reason I read it was to see if it was appropriate for my daughter to read . I do n't necessarily mind when a book meant for teens has one or two little profanities , especially if it is in the correct context of the situation the character may be facing ; but the language in this book is ridiculous . There is no good reason for the majority of the cussing other than to have teenagers cussing . Ironically , the one instance that I DID NOT have a problem with is when Augustus drops an f-bomb . It fit the scene and what his character was experiencing in that moment . Now , I am in no way saying that it is RIDDLED with profanity , because it is n't . I just did n't see the reason for the cussing that IS there . To me , it had no purpose.4 . The pain did n't seem real . Cancer , and especially cancer in children is a horrific thing to contemplate . I never felt their pain , their fear of dying , there anxiety . That the fact that either one of them could die soon was the reason for their utterly fast and all engrossing relationship was not communicated well . The cancer was made to be more of an annoyance and the parents of the children with cancer especially so . I HATED how Hazel and Augustus treated their parents ' concern for their wellbeing and how their parents were written to be these blubbering , annoying individuals with no depth . I was especially disappointed in the idea of & # 34 ; cancer perks & # 34 ; . Even if that is true , the fact that Augustus at one points acts like he thinks it is ridiculous in one part of the book , only to manipulate people with it later in order to get what he wants ( like champagne on a plane ) really got under my skin.So , there it is . I am sure that most people wont like my review because they love a book that I do n't , but that 's ok . I do n't expect everyone to love the books that I do and that 's just fine . That is what makes people and people who write about people so special . If we all liked the same things , there would be nothing left to write/read about .	-1
OK , I 'm not sure what it is about me and Sarah Dessen books but this is the third one I have read and the third one I 've been less than impressed with . Maybe I 've just read the worst ones of the bunch because I always hear people talking about her great books . Please tell me which ones to read . The theme running through her books that I have read are dysfunctional parents and I 'm annoyed by that . Ca n't there be one parent or parental figure that 's a good role model ? The Moon and More tells the story of Emaline over the summer before college starts and her loves , friends , work and family . I liked Emaline and Luke , I liked Theo at first and then he just got weird . How many themed dates does one guy have to plan ? Emaline 's father is a disappointment and I 'm upset he never really answered for his decisions . Emaline getting shut in her room while her Dad worked on the house got old , also people being in her bedroom when she came home-overdone . This book is at least 150 pages longer than it should be . Emaline 's relationship with her stepbrother Benji was sweet and the best part of the book .	-1
I recently saw the movie and wanted to see the book version . I purchased the Kindle version and was surprised to see the introduction was almost longer than the book itself . I thought maybe Amazon had a technical difficulty . Nope . At least this version of this book is one brief , 4 page story.Not sure what 's up ...	-1
From the Jane Austen books that I have read , this one was a disappointment , since I really enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and Reason and Sensibility . I did n't feel anything while reading the book , the main characters did n't seemed all that interested in each other , and I could n't even root for them to be together . It was quite boring .	-1
I enjoyed watching the 1960 version of the movie as a child . I thought that if I read the book , that it would enhance my movie watching experience . Boy , was I wrong ! This book was a slow tedious read . I kept waiting for something interesting to happen . Anything . It never did . All I wanted was for the book to end . Reading it was like dying a slow agonizing death . I forced myself to read the first seventy pages , then I could not stand it any more.The characters were uninteresting and had no personality whatsoever . The plot was way too basic and uneventful . Even the descriptions of the locations were bland.This book is good to read before bedtime . It will put you right to sleep .	-1
This book was quite boring and did n't make sense in many portions of the book . I was quite disturbed by the inconsistant flow of the book , quite irritating .	-1
This HGW novel is not as satisfying as his more famoussci fi pieces , but it is representative of turn-of-the-centuryinterest in galactic exploration . Related in the first person by an impoverished would-be playwright , Mr. Bedford ( for whom no first name is given ) , the story opens as he makes the acquaintance of an eccentric scientist named Cavor in a coastal area of England . Gradually persuaded by the latter 's dreams of conquering gravity by means of a substance he will eventually invent , Bedford soon becomes an enthusiastic convert to theoretical astronomy ; he injects some practical ideas-as well as his private dreams of avarice and proprietary empire . Ah , the temptation of creating one 's little sphere of power.Embarking on an odyssey in a sphere made of Cavorite the partners in adventure land in a crater on the moon , where they encounter odd vegetation which flourishes during the two-week lunar day . But even more amazing is their discovery of a species of intelligent beings ( described by Cavor as ant-men ) who dwell in the moon 's interior . When captured the two men fight their way back to the surface , but become separated . Assuming that Cavor has been killed by the native Selenites ( Cavor ; s term for them ) , Bedford manages to return to Earth , but the story does not quite end there . What is the source of mysterious transmissions from the moon and -- equally curious -- what causes them to cease ? Wells ' protagonists express the author 's commentary on man 's propensity for warfare and injudicious zeal to modulate alien civilizations due to our anthropomorphic egocentrism . Nevertheless , this book offers great sci fi lore which will appeal to kids of all ages !	-1
I ca n't believe this is the best Turgenev could do for a nihilist character : a grumpy geek who loves frogs . Compared to the extremism of characters in Nabokov , Mailer , Rushdie etc . this Bazorov guy could n't possibly be more boring .	-1
The Unsuspecting Reader beware , this book is the literal subversive open trap.The writing style of Mr. Reed is highly eccentric , spiked with crude , crass intellectual contrivance , that is impossible to determine where fact and fiction begin and end.The authors preface states his purpose was to observe the events while `` SETTING '' down the truth.The Author in a Freudian slip unaccountably forgets his self imposed purpose and launches into `` HIS '' StoryThe `` RED FLAG ' that exposes this for what it is the lack of chronological events , instead the reader issubjected to bombastic propaganda , and word psychological warfare in the form of the `` GLORIOUS REVOLUTION '' format that originates from the mind of Mr . Reed. , far to much of Mr. Reeds account is supposition , hearsay , andconjecture if not pure fantasy and imagination , that the reader is 'ASKED '' to believe , the supporting `` Documents '' or Proclamations included in the book can not be VERIFIED as AUTHENTIC by any means.Before examining this 'work '' , the Reader must recognize certain factors , if the grandiose writing `` captures '' your attention , Mr . Reed then has control of you . So be on Guard , by having a CLEAR understanding of the HISTORICAL FACTS . The book does not read in a consistent pattern that can be followed in a LOGICAL MANNER that AUTHENTICACCOUNTS AND RESPECTED AUTHORS PROVIDE . The extent Mr. Reeds ACTUAL involvement is anyone guess.Yes the Russian Revolution did happen , Mr. Reeds version is highly dramatic , or exaggerated , with a heavy dose ofpersuasion provided by the authors own STRONG Communist ideology or Manifesto of the 10 Planks.The Russian Revolution was led by Con Artists , Political Opportunists who wanted Power not Freedom for the Russian People and replaced the Czar with POLITICAL Masters instead .	-1
Ken Follett , who wrote the brilliant & quot ; Pillars of the Earth & quot ; and the excellent novels , & quot ; Key to Rebecca & quot ; and & quot ; The Eye of the Needle & quot ; , has cranked out a quickie that misses badly , in my view . The basic idea is okay - a man wakes up , dressed like a bum , in Washington D.C. , with no idea who he is or how he got there . Turns out he 's actually a rocket scientist involved with the launch of the United States ' first satellite . Unfortunately the story is filled with anachronisms ( a Ford Fiesta in 1958 is one glaring one ) and highly improbable plot devices . In one segment , a CIA agent fires several shots at our hero , in the dark , behind a large Washington hotel , then runs out and gathers up the spent bullets ! However , the absolute worst , the point at which I felt like hurling the book against the wall , was the final chapter in which the moon landings took place . Follett has it happening on July 20 , 1968 ! 1968 ! Is there anyone who does n't know that the moon landings happened in 1969 ? ? Is there an editor or fact checker working at this publishing house ? Mr. Follett , I 've been a fan of yours ever since & quot ; Key to Rebecca & quot ; but you 're going to have to do a hell of a lot better than & quot ; Code to Zero & quot ; to keep me . This book is a dud .	-1
I read this book initially during my younger , agnostic years , and I liked it a lot . Inventive , crazy , disturbing , and definitely entertaining . Tried to re-read it recently and found it deeply offensive , now that I am a Christian . In this book the Holy Spirit is likened to a virus . I threw it in the trash , could not finish it . So , if you are an atheist and like books that trash Christianity and reinforce your world view , then this one is for you . I do n't require the promotion of my world view in the books I read , but I 'd rather not have it attacked . I do n't understand why so many sci-fi authors do that these days , given that the super majority of Americans self identify as Christians .	-1
Could not come close to finishing this boring book . Forget about this nerdy , weirdo , modern day crystal ball gazing stuff that is really no better than flipping a coin . Read `` Antifragile '' instead .	-1
Being former Singleton & big fan of Bridget Jones ' Diary ( book & movie ... oooh , Mr . Darcy ! ) , I bought this `` Guide to Life '' hoping for another gem . Humph . The best section is entitled `` The Art of Conversation '' & it covers about 2 pages . Is mostly gobble-de-gook & lame B & W ; pictures of getting mold off cheese & how to order pizza . ( what Singleton does n't already have these down pat ? ) Good thing about book : Hurrah , is only 55 pages & will be over soon !	-1
It took me several chapters to realize that the author was backtracking to a wedding that had been eluded to ... two books ago in the series ! ! This ruined the suspense for me since I knew it had already taken place . I did not feel this book was up to the author 's general standards .	-1
This book , about a third the size of the others in the series , appears to be something left over or deleted from about the second volume . `` A Common Life '' is way out of sequence and just is n't very interesting . It deals solely with the marriage of Father Tim and has little to do with Mitford or the other characters . I found the novel ( it is scarcely that ) a real disappointment , compared with the first four books of the series . If the author felt that the information therein was significant , why was it not included at the appropriate place in time ? The question is never answered .	-1
Although Ms. Sobel has a great ability to write , this particular work was disappointing in that although the theme of explaining and introducing the lay reader to the solar system has it merits , she fails to really keep you interested . The book is not very long and I really had a hard time finishing it after getting to the middle . It is a decent overview of the planets , but I could have been more interested in the subject by just doing a wikipedia search .	-1
I have nothing against the manipulative intentions set forth in this massive book . However , what I find difficult is it 's sheer inaccessibility . It 's long winded and over complicated . At 450 pages , with small type and margins filled with historical quotes , it 's not something most men can readily use . The author is a literature buff . It has a historic/literary feel to it all.This is meant more for the type who are willing to dedicate their whole life , depth and soul to seducing , manipulating and taking advantage of women . It seems like an awful lot of work.I 'm a shy guy myself without much relationship/sex experience , even at 30 . What I 'm looking for is to have the confidence and power to be able to connect with women , make close friendships , and have sex when I want it . I just want to have free choice over which women I can be with.I 'd rather recommendHow to Succeed with Women , it 's much more accessible to every day people with personal lives . It 's more analytical and to-the-point than so artsy/whimsical , with step by step overview of the seduction/dating process . Plus it can help you all around , with dating , relationships , making female friends , or just sex . I dunno about other men , but one day I 'm going to meet that one incredible girl I want all to myself for the rest of my life . There 's no need to mess around for eternity . Seems awful lonely .	-1
The premise is interesting , and it could have been the means for exploring ( and providing fictional answers to ) many interesting questions . However , I could not finish this book . The protagonist is a terribly boring , solitary person , and in the first 150 pages , the holy houseguest does n't do anything interesting enough to keep me reading . The snippets of Marian history are interesting , but that 's about it .	-1
Year of Wonders grips the reader in from its first page . This work opens the world of the seventeenth century to the reader and allows one to experience the horror , the fright , and the superstition that wreaked havoc across the plague ridden areas of Darbyshire England . The characters , to begin with , are intriguing . HOWEVER - The work suffers the most horrific anti-climax of almost any work that I have read . The story completely unravels at the end as the main characters make decisions that are completely out of keeping with the philosophies and the mindset of the seventeenth century . The ending of this book is not shocking , nor a bold twist in the tale - it is a pathetic conclusion that is so poor in its creativity that it diminishes the story that began so well earlier in the book . If you want an enjoyable read of this time period , I would reccommend that you real Neal Stephenson 's Quicksilver .	-1
Actually , the Nuremberg Trials were a complete sham in terms of following international law and legal procedures and unfortunately Overy just adds to the sham . Basing their evidence upon a prisoner 's interrogation , who will say anything to his interrogators to save his own skin , was pretty outrageous and illegal in its own right . In fact , the unusual rules that these allies implemented for the trial could be applied against our leaders who conducted the Vietnam War . But the biggest tragedy of the Nuremberg Trials was the myths it had created and has sustained about what really happened in Germany and why .	-1
At first I was a little intrigued by the many detours that what I thought was the central story took . Soon I came to realize that there is really no central story . This is a trail head with many different possibilities . After a while , I just could n't keep up . The story line was dispersed and many of the characters were so black and white that I lost interest .	-1
Based on the reviews I read here at Amazon I believed that a new author has emerged with profound sensitive insight . I was completely disappointed . The story was predictable , the characters stereotypical . It was almost painful to read through this book , as I was embarrassed for the characters in the book , because that is all they were , just characters without a sense of true being. -- -Am adding to my original review becuase I realized I was being too nice.This book sucks . It is ignorant and racist . Do n't bother with it. -- -That should add to more people finding that my review was not helpful to them , if you know what I mean .	-1
The metaphor is thin at best ; the characters are unidimensional and generally uninteresting . I do n't understand what all the fuss is about .	-1
I felt this book was too predictable and there were too many 'themes ' - racism , religion , feminism , traumatic childhood , romance ... the list goes on . It seems as if it 's trying too hard . That said , the interactions between the characters was nice , I 'll admit , but not nice enough for me to tell a friend to spend a day reading this book .	-1
Littell spins a good yarn , but he ca n't write dialogue to save his life . The inanities and cliches he puts in his characters ' mouths are groan-producing and virtually destroy any sense of reality he creates with his plotting .	-1
After reading his : Stalingrad : The Fateful Siege : 1942-1943 , was very disappointed with this effort ! Just not up to par with it at all . Just the overall read did n't grab me , and felt the Russian side was n't giventhe credit or depth they deserved . Seem to dwell too much on both sides atrocities but emphasized the Russians too much .	-1
A book well written but unfortunately highly biased justifying the russian atrocities . Certainly war is by itself an atrocity , but that do not allows an army to commit barbaric actions against women and children .	-1
I found this short novel a disappointing read . The style , while often elegant , reminded me of so many 19th century novels where all the characters repress their feelings throughout their tedious lives . Trevor did an excellent job , though , as I found my own chest hurting from the tension of nothing happening . At times I wanted to shake the characters into action . I have to agree with a couple other reviewers that the plot was completely unbelievable . In our time of Amber Alerts and hordes of volunteers scouring the countryside for missing persons , it 's difficult to accept that parents would just assume their child drowned herself , without exploring other possibilities . Who gives up a child that easily ? And who can go for 30 years with NO contact ? I 'm sure Heloise was `` delicate '' but really , her husband 's indulgence was just ridiculous . Everyone , except the hard working Henry and Bridgett , seemed to drift through their lives without touching reality , tightly guarding their own repressed wishes and thoughts . I found the prose style distant and aloof , the characters , ghosts , and the ending vacuous .	-1
Steven Pinker upsets me tremendously , both for his style and for the implicit presupposition of his over-arching argument.Pinker 's the Blank Slate , like all of his writing , is characterized by an artless simplicity that , to a learned reader , is almost embarrassing . Pinker comes across in this book to the unlearned as a very learned man . He seems to have read everything and thought about every idea . He seems to see how it all hangs together and how the world makes perfect sense when seen in the `` big picture '' . Best of all , Pinker is able to explain it all to his readers using only a modest vocabulary and really simple sentences . The world seems so clear , and ideas previously considered hard seem so easy after reading Pinker.But that is precisely where Pinker becomes embarrassing , to himself , to those he attempts to vindicate and justify , and to his supporters . My mind is not a particularly widely cast net , but there are a couple of points of knowledge and understanding at which my mind goes deep , much deeper than Pinker 's . And it is when I see Pinker talk about topics and ideas which I understand better than he does that I realize what he is up to and the kind of academic charade he is engaged in . In one case in point , on page 291 , Pinker puts forward an argument that there is an innate or self-evident connection between , on the one hand , judicial activism and what in the late 20th century/ early 21st century we conceive as liberal social justice and other the other hand between judicial restraint and conservative politics . Well ... this happens to be one area where I like to think I know a lot more than Pinker . Pinker is simply wrong , dreadfully wrong . Historically , there is no clear link between alleged political agendas of the Supreme Court justices and ideas about proper judicial behavior . To argue Pinker 's position is simply to ignore the whole history of the Supreme Court in this country , the Lochner era , the legacy of O. W. Holmes , not to mention the role of courts in any other country of the world at any other time in history . There are other areas as well where Pinker clearly misunderstands the subject matter which he is discussing . I do n't think he understands Durkheim , for example , and he definitely misunderstands Rousseau ( I almost wonder if he actually read these authors , or if he just hired some eager-to-please grad student to do the research for him and right a five page summary for him ) . But , if he has such a poor grasp of the areas of knowledge that I know about and understand , what does that say of his grasp of areas of knowledge that I do n't know much about ? Can I trust him as a teacher or a guide through the wilderness of knowledge ? No , I can not .This would be bad enough , but what disturbs me most about Pinker is not his shallow analysis and constant name dropping . It is the implicit moral , ethical , and political argument that motivates and permeates his entire book ( and other books ) . If you tease out what his ideas and arguments mean for us , as people and citizens , it becomes apparent how radically conservative , even reactionary , Pinker 's agenda is , in defense of the status quo of contemporary society . Pinker 's argument is a strong defense of the world as it is , because , in the end , the world is as it is because human beings are as they are , and any effort to change the world is doomed to fail unless it takes account of and accomodates the fact that there are some things in human beings that can not be changed because they are the product of 1 million years of hard-wiring in our genes . I find such a message quite unattractive . If it were not so obvious what the logical error of such a project is , I might even be inclined to choose ignorance over knowledge , if knowing how the world is meant accepting Pinker 's ideas . Fortunately , I do n't have to make that decision . It is obvious to me , and hope it becomes obvious to others when they read Pinker , that the entire project of cognitive neuroscience and evolutionary psychology is a circular pseudoscience that presupposes certain ideas that themselves are only true if the conclusions of cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology are true.In his life , academia has been good to Pinker . Pinker has come as close as an academic can come to being a rock star and stay in academia . For humanity 's sake , I hope posterity has a very different plan for Pinker .	-1
America 's first victory in the Pacific was accommplished at Midway . Nelson , the author should be commended for calling attention to the valor and patriotism of all those who participated in this raid . However , as a military operation , it was a complete failure , from the planning , effective military operation and loss of all B-25 's . Death , injury , and imprisionment ended the efffective service of the highly trained and expended airmen.The author could have concentrated on the actual `` mission '' of this raid . The President , Franklin D. Roosevelt needed a publicity stunt to show that the country could strike back at the homeland of the enemy . The uneccessary details , such as the names of each and everyone of the crewmembers may be of interest to the families of these men , who were heroes , but the real question to be asked and answered is how far can the leader of our nation use American material and lives to achieve a propaganda goal . And should historians and authors ignore this issue.The author is short of knowledge regarding his subject , which is obvious to myself , a former USAF pilot with combat expererience . His lack of knowledge regarding flying , degrades his understanding that this mission was the American version of the Japanesse pilots who became suicide pilots when they defended their nation.The story that I would have written is how the warriors are the ones sacrificed at the discretion of the political leaders and the Generals . The public at large has such a vague understanding of battles , victories , losses , and whether in fact we won or lost the objectives that brought us into our wars . The comments made by our current politicians , media and comedians , ( sometimes difficult to determine the difference ) are sadly misinformed.How many of today 's generation of leaders , teachers and students have been misinformed by authors who are short of the topic of their books . Some of the author 's statements do not require a pilot 's knowledge , but do require common sense . Soon after the Wright Brothers sold their first aircraft to the US Army , ground crews have been standing by to put out engine fires . The the time the B-25 arrived , this was a standard procedure in all the military services , including the enemy . To state that a twin engine plane had only three gunners , while the 4 engine B-17 had more should be a no brainer to any ground pounder . One of the phrases that pilots , including myself applied to any non flyer.The `` Nordin '' Bombsight was more valuable as a propaganda tool than as an efficient bombsight . Ask the Germans and Japanesse Civilians who were bombed by US crews who really were trying to bomb military tarkets , unlike our British cousins who deliberately bombed British cities . Contrary to popular opinion , the British were the first to deliberately bomb German cities . But as inhumane as it may sound today , it was an essential military decision that caused the Germans to divert their attacks to London and other cities . This sacrifice of British civilians allowed the RAF to rebuild and train and win the Battle of Britan.The Doolittle raid , on the otherhand had little affect on military planing by the enemy . It did not affect the Midway Battle . Admiral Yamamoto knew that Japan could not win a war with the US , but if they neutralized the American Navy before our production overwhelmed Japan , Japan could sued for peace , and continue its military domination of the East . The Battle of Midway was to be the make or break point for Japan . The Doolittle raid was understood by the military on both sides . It was a political , not military action . Military Historians have designated Midway as one of the most important battles of all time . The Doolittle raid is on par with the Bombing of Fort Sumpter , in which nobody died , but is forever sighted ( by Northern historians who write the majority of text books ) as the begining of our civil war . Fort Sumpter , like the Doolittle raid had political , not a military objective . It was Lincoln 's call for 75,000 troops to enforce Federal rights over state rights which caused our worst tragedy . There are other political , not miltary events that brought us into wars . The sinking of the Maine in Cuba lead to the Spanish American War . We later have learned that the Maine 's deathblow came from within the Maine , not from a mine planted by the Spanish which would have caved the hull inward . The Luisitania sinking by German U Boats lead us into WWI . The anti-German histeria by our primarily Anglo-Saxon nation ignored British violations , but went to war over German violations . The War to end All Wars , and ensure that all nations who wanted to be free were set free excluded the British , French , Dutch and Belgian Empires . All American loss of men and material was a waste . The worst affect of WWI is hardly ever mentioned by anyone . The world wide flue epidemic , euphamistically called the Spanish Flu , actually became a pandemic caused by American training camps which held more troops than the medical corps felt invited a pandemic tragedy because a flu strain was already identified and suspected of growing inside these camps . Rather than follow common sense , the desire to inflict defeat on Germany overode the advice of experts . Once again , politicians and our leaders lead us down a path to disaster.The disaster of WWI lead to the `` lost generation '' . Writers and those who identified themselves as `` intellectuals '' including students at Oxford , stated that they would never fight in another war . This time , some of the leaders of Britian like Winston Churchill who was wrong about WWI and failed as the Lord of the Admirality did recognize that Hitler and the Nazi party . Germany had not lost the war . WWI would have ended if the US had not entered in 1917 . After nearly 4 years of war , the combatants had run out of men and material . Mutiny on all sides , food shortages and the end of the Russians as allies made an armistice the only course left for the original combatants . Germans did not surrender , they agreed to an end to combat . President Wilson was more popular in Germany than anywhere else in Europe . Until he began to act as a conqueror . His 14 points vanished as quickly as the allies could make their power grabs . Italy which was promised land in the Italian speaking parts of Austria if they joined Britan and France , was unable to obtain its war aims . It took but a few years for Mussolini to gain power over what he and his party called the allies double cross . Britan continued its blocade of Germany after hostilities ended . Thousands of civilians died . Many Germans fell for the message of Adolph Hitler . His rise to power was as much as responsibility of the unjust peace , as the definition of the Germans as uncivilized barbarians . We and our allies had made a bad peace , and as a result we had to fight again twenty years later . As a result of the chaos of WWII , the West entered a cold war that lasted 50 years . The US , which has never benefited from an overseas empire , supported Western domination of half the world , including most of the Moslem world . We carry the burden of that support , however undeserved , in our current battle with terroists who are lead by a few of woefully misinformed radicals whose most adept weapon is their ability to talk young men into committing suicide and kill non-combatants.The Doolittle Raid is but one example of young men willing to die for their nations colors . All to often , wars are uneccesary , and those that are , usually are to correct a bad peace . The discussion of the Doolittle in the light of whether a military action is a true military action , or a stunt would be an important addition to the study of war.The author 's decriptions of flying the B-25 off the deck of a carrier , although unusual to say the least , nonethe less is part of the ordinary training of any pilot . Its called `` short field takeoff '' procedures . Nearly all pilots , myself included , ran up the engines to full thrust before releasing the brakes . The rotate speed of any aircraft occurs at roughly the stall speed . Flaps are set as conditions require . Single engine landings , and simulated dead engine landings are standard for Cessna and Pipers as well as Mustangs and B-25s.The descriptions of crew responsibilities was universal to all mulit-crewed aircraft . Pilots had to learn how to navigate before they won their wings . Pilots and co-pilots routinely switched responsibilites , except for the fact that somebody had to be the ultimate boss , and sat in the left seat.Utimately , the only difference to the pilots was they were going to make an extremely short field take off . However as any Navy carrier pilot will confirm , taking off from a carrier always meant you could count on a headwind , at least as fast as the carrier could manage . The carrier would always head directly into the wind , and you could generally count on some natural headwind . Thus , the B-25 already had some built in airspeed before brakes were released . All this was taken into account before this plan became reality , Murphy 's law aside . ( Murphy 's law=If something can go wrong , it probably will go wrong ) .The author has named one observation about pilots . They are picked for pilot training and earn their wings for a strange variety of qualities . Number one was estimates by senior pilots during interviews whether the candidates had the `` right stuff '' . Health , physical coordination , `` guts '' ability to make quick and correct decisions , and others , were all secondary to the desire to fly and fight . Most people at the time thought that taking the train or bus was the method of transportation sensible people used . You had to be right on the edge between santity and insanity to voulunteer , even if your flight pay was a substantial part of your salary . The men who volunteered for this mission were all young men who were convinced that others would die , but they were invinceable . Until it was too late to realize that the odds were against anyone who flew in units like the 8th AirForce flying out of Britian into Germany in 1943 . Hardly anyone managed to fly the magic 25 missions that meant a ticket home , usually to a training command . This seemed tame to combat , although training school was so deadly that when I went , I could not obtain life insurance until I won my wings.This review has evolved into a biography . One word of advice , unless you have the time , never ask a pilot about flying .	-1
The new book by Drosnin is what could be expected if you knew his previous despicable output . I was especially amused by the appendix to Drosnin 's new opus wherein he painted a picture which is blatantly untrue , being a fantastic concoction about noble and highly qualified code defenders fighting against a few malicious attackers of low intelligence who , in Drosnin 's learned opinion , either do not understand the codes ( while he does ) or intentionally try to discredit a high quality research allegedly proving the reality of the code . In fact the opposite is true . Contrary to Drosnin 's assertion , the overwhelming majority of experts in mathematical statistics decisively rejected the claims by the code proponents . As to Drosnin 's own contribution to the code lore , even professor Rips himself , to whom Drosnin refers with admiration and who ( actually together with Witztum , whose name Drosnin does not seem to deem worth mentioning ) is the originator of the code affair , has expressed his disapproval of Drosnin 's atempts to predict the future by means of the alleged code sequences . In an interview to Newsweek a few years ago Drosnin claimed that he would admit his error if somebody found the `` prediction '' of a prime minister assasination `` encoded '' in a non-biblical text . A number of such `` codes '' was demonstrated . McKay found a whole bunch of them in Moby Dick . I found a set of `` codes '' spelling `` Amir Will Kill Prime MInister Hero Rabin '' in a Hebrew book by an Israeli writer Dahn Ben Amotz , published in 1979 , this `` code '' being much better than Drosnin 's acclaimed `` prediction '' of Rabin 's assassination in the Bible . Drosnin never aknowledged this finding although it has been widely known and invoked multiple responses . That much about Drosnin 's integrity . Especially obnoxious is Drosnin 's one-sided story about the behavior of the Statistical Science journal . Drosnin omits in his story the threat of litigation against that journal made by Rips ' attorneys , something unheard of in the history of scientific disputes . Overall , his new book is a piece of arrogant nonsense which of course will find thousands of gullible readers on whose ignorance and eagerness to believe in miracles journalist of Drosnin 's type can always rely so he can laugh all the way to the bank .	-1
I thought this might be another FTL travel speculation book when I picked it up . I was very dissapointed to learn the book has almost nothing to say about FTL travel at all . Instead this is an attempt to convey a theory other than inflation to explain how the universe got from the big bang to the state we see today.The first half of the book is a good recap of the theories os inflation and general and special relativity . This part of the book is well written , concrete , and easy to follow . The second half of the book is very dissapointing . It starts to get very squishy in a hurry . After reading it I had no idea what the theory was or what it stood for , other than being a direct frontal assault on Einstein 's work . The second half of the book is filled with rants about other scientists , journal editors , and university administrators , but there is very little science.I think that without a catchy title , this book would never have been printed at all .	-1
The stars I did give were for the content of the book but I could not give it very many because the dynamics of the book itself make it impossible to use effectively in the Kindle version.For one thing throughout the ENTIRE book , the author tells the reader to look on a certain page for the information they need . This Kindle version does NOT have page numbers . The Table of Contents does not have these `` important '' pages listed with a link either.The author also states that several pages need to be printed out to be able to use her methods appropriately . Printing is not an option with Kindle content ( at least not with this book ) so if you do not have the physical book , you are just out of luck.Couple these with the fact that the Kindle version is more expensive than the paper version + shipping , and you have a major fail.Please either add links in the Kindle version text where it states you need to skip to a certain page or add them to the TOC . And if it is not possible to allow printing from this version , add a website address where we may be able to print the forms .	-1
I was hesitant to read this book- but after seeing the good reviews it got online- I decided to give it a try . I did NOT like this book . It was so boring- I could not get into it at all and i regret the time I spent to read it . Other people liked it , but it was not for me . I found the plot and writing to be very unimaginative and slow . Even a really bad chick lit book can hold my attention better than this !	-1
Lucinda Trout , a New York TV producer on an assignment in the Midwest , falls in love with little Prairie City . The reason she has been originally sent there is to examine the huge meth problem they seem to have . Otherwise , Prairie City seems like your typical Midwestern town , although it does seem to have an excess of lesbians . That aside , the Lucida you meet at the beginning of the book is bored with her life , and wants to change it . She convinces her bosses that she should live in Prairie City for a year and sent `` Quality of Life Reports , & quot ; back home to show New Yorkers what life is like . Somehow that Lucinda from the beginning of the novel quickly finds herself with a house in the middle of nowhere , an irritating boyfriend , and his three children ( from three different women ) who float in and out of their lives . By the end of the book I really wanted to just slap the main character across the face ! Not a recommend read .	-1
An amoral and immoral book , with worse pseudo-historical nonsense than all of Oliver Stone 's movies put together . The & quot ; Weathermen & quot ; were spoiled , dangerous brats , who fortunately never got more than miniscule attention and support . When others did n't adopt their agenda upon its announcement , they went violent and started bombing without regard to the consequences . The author uses lots of cheap tricks to try to make them suitable protagonists . One is to announce , repeatedly , that anyone who got violent was automatically expelled from the Weatherman the second he or she did so -- never mind that they instigated it all . Then there 's the guilty revolutionary who sends money anonymmously to her victim 's family ( never happened ) , and another who is sugar-coated as the world 's best parent to try to gin up some faux sympathy . Every 20 pages or so the author shoves a political tract in your face by having the journalist character make a political speech about how the Weathermen were really just premature ecologists ( which they never cared about ) and the violence was excusable ... This is a trendy left political pamphlet disguised ( thinly ) as fiction . ( The author likes to weave back and forth between real characters and his fictional ones ) . It is a revolting attempt to rewrite history and is not good fiction either . A repellent , immoral , and trivial book about people cut from the same cloth .	-1
I was looking for a new series to read , so thought I would try this one , since it 's the first . After reading all the complimentary reviews , I expected to really enjoy the book and to go on to others . I did n't like any of the characters , including the main one , so this is it for me . Many of the characters seemed like poorly developed stereotypes .	-1
I have a 4 yr old female cat who has never been an only cat , after her friend died , we got a kitten , but the older cat attacks the kitten every chance she gets . A friend recommended this book , but if was n't helpful at all ... the only thing I got out of it was to medicate her , which has n't worked . I have heard these are tough cases , but I tried everything it said in the book , and nothing worked . I was n't impressed by the book , really disappointing !	-1
Although quite a few paragraphs were poignantly written , I honestly did not get major chunks of this book . The nuanced philosophical discussions & historical references were beyond my level of sophistication .	-1
I was shocked to see other reviewers stating that major portions of this book were copied from `` Behind the Scenes in the Lincoln White House : Memoirs of an African-American Seamstress ( Civil War ) '' I did n't believe it at first , but when I downloaded the free kindle version of Mrs. Keckley 's book , I saw that their allegations were indeed true . Not only large paragraphs , but whole multiple pages were lifted straight out of Elizabeth 's book , word for word . And those were the best parts too , the dialogue , the events that brought that story to life.Thumbs DOWN to Jennifer Chiaverini . Better stick to Elm Creek , where the story is , I hope , entirely your own .	-1
Instead of a story of a blossoming inter-racial friendship , `` Mrs. Lincoln 's Dressmaker '' is one story told over and over and over again . Elizabeth , who purchased her freedom and establishes a dressmaking business in Washington , D. C. , becomes dressmaker to Mary Todd Lincoln . If this historical fiction is to be believed , the relationship is primarily one where Elizabeth comes to the White House to fit dresses in progress or to prepare Mrs. Lincoln for levees , Mrs. Lincoln whines/complains/reveals intemperate actions , Elizabeth modestly says something she hopes will distract Mrs. Lincoln and about half the time Mr. Lincoln comes into the room as well . Whine/complain , hopeful statement , whine/complain , hopeful statement . Nothing gets better after Lincoln is assassinated , either . For being based on a memoir written to help rehabilitate Mrs. Lincoln 's public image , this version leaves me wondering what ever appealed to Mr. Lincoln about Mary Todd.There is a wealth of well-written , well-researched Civil War non-fiction on the market right now . Spend your time and money on all those other better options .	-1
I made it through the first 3 chapters of this book and seriously ? I persevered as it 's on a list for students at a college where I teach ; my job is to recommend it . This is what passes for historical fiction these days ? THIS was a NYTimes best selling novel ? It 's flat . The writing has no style whatsoever . This writer moves her characters around like paper-dolls in a poorly drawn set . It should be half as long as it is . It should MOVE . The people should BREATHE and live . Awful , awful , awful , pasty , washed out , blah .	-1
This novel read more like an historical essay . The facts were there in laborious detail , but the story lacked personality . I wanted to care about the former slave who became a successful dressmaker during the Civil War , but as the character of Elizabeth was written , I was bored . I hate to say this ! I 'm a big fan of historical fiction , but this just missed the mark..	-1
Bravo & thank-you Dr. Lustig ! Your knowledge , passion & compassion are amazing . I have used your advice to change how we eat , indeed how we think ... of food . I have been advocating & practicing the lifestyle you write about for 6 months . Thus far , besides my husband , who is a psychologist who specializes in successful aging research , and a fellow elder abuse consultant , have adopted this wisdom - we are all reaping the benefits . Let 's hope this message reaches others before it 's too late . It saddens me especially , that kids are suffering from the repercussions of sugar & other dreadful nutrition issues . Keep up your efforts !	-1
I 'll be honest , I could n't finish this book . I found out about it from my sister , and I had high hopes for it being really interesting and relevant . And some of the information *was* interesting ... but I just could n't get into it . The impression I get is the author trying to connect with the common person outside of her ivory tower and failing . Some parts of it felt like a textbook ( In this chapter you 'll learn about ... ) . It felt more like required reading than leisure reading . There was something seriously left to be desired by this book . Perhaps it belongs more on a college-level psychology reading list . I wo n't be finishing it though .	-1
Karen Joy Fowler clearly cares a lot about animals ' rights and , just as clearly , did a ton of research on the subject prior to writing this book.The problem is that she then tried to develop a novel around that research but , seemingly , was n't willing leave even one iota of all that research out . So , we end up with a narrator who periodically slips out of the story to deliver long , long lectures to us . Wait , I mean - LONG , LONG , LONG lectures.This book is just a very long slog . The point of research is to advance and support the plot ; here , though , the plot is just a flimsy construct to frame all that research . So , we get a narrator whose most pronounced characteristic is that she 's hell-bent on data-dumping on us , weakly-drawn supporting characters , and arbitrary plot twist aiming at setting us up for - yep - anther lecture.Skip it . The only reason I even gave it 2 stars is because I support animal rights , too .	-1
I was looking for something new to read and took a chance on this one based on the reviews . This was definitely not my favorite , and not what I expected . Very disappointing .	-1
poorly written , awkward and one dimensional characters . There are much better books of this genre out there !	-1
The main part of the book tells the story of how Rome went from pagan to Christian . Kirsch 's description of Constantine , Julian the Apostate , Constantius II , Theodius , and others , are interesting and well-written . But when Kirsch goes beyond telling what happened and tries to explain it , or generalizes from a single series of events over couple hundred years of Roman history , the book heads towards Hades in a hand-basket.Problems begin on page one . `` Modern medical science proposes that the idea of 'god ' is literally hard-wired into the anatomy of the brain . '' First , this is sloppy -- scientists propose , sometimes foolishly , `` science '' does not . And the usual claim is that mystical experiences -- not an `` idea of god '' -- have a physical basis . Other writers blur the line between the two , true , but even a reasonably sophisticated ( though sometimes dubious ) secularist explanation of religion like that of Pascal Boyer is quite a bit more complex than this suggests.Kirsch 's most important error appears on the very next page . `` Only very late in the development of Homo religiosus did monotheism first appear . '' He makes no mention of Andrew Lang or Wilhelm Schdmit , who showed that primitive peoples are often aware of a Supreme God remarkably like the God of the Bible . Karen Armstrong , whose History of God he mentions on page 1 , begins her book by mentioning Schmidt -- though she ignores the implications of his work . But Kirsch appears to have never heard of either scholar -- or of Durkheim , who reluctantly admitted that Australian aborigines knew about God , John Mbiti , who showed Africans did , too , or James Legge , the great sinologist who showed that early Chinese worshiped a Being who was `` exactly the same as God was to our ancestors . '' ( See my Jesus and the Religions of Man , chapter nine , `` The Non-History of God , '' for the story . ) To tell the story of `` God '' and make no mention of the fact ( and it is a fact ) that hundreds of peoples around the world appear to have developed almost identical understandings of Him , is a crushing oversight . How can you make a universal argument about God and the gods by ignoring all data outside of Israel , Greece , Egypt , and Rome ? Nor is Kirsch ' discussion of Mediterranean religions always reliable . He blows a few Biblical references . He errs on the library in Alexandria -- a Christian mob did not burn down the main library , with `` 700,000 books , '' but a smaller annex.Kirsch also badly errs by assuming that Christian theology is completely hostile to paganism , portrayed merely as a `` parade of horribles . '' This is bad history and worse theology . I 've written two books on the subject , and am planning others , but will try to be concise . Early Christian thinkers ( whom Kirsch ought to have read ) often called Greek philosophy a `` tutor '' to bring the world to Christ : Justin Martyr , Augustine , and many others did in fact become Christians by following Plato and other `` pagan '' philosopher to what they saw as their logical conclusion . Anyone who writes on this subject should read the Church Fathers carefully , and also what Jaroslav Pelikan , Paul Tillich , G. K. Chesterton , and C. S. Lewis have written on teh subject . ( I also recommend two of my own books : `` Jesus and the Religions of Man , '' and `` True Son of Heaven : How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture , '' along with G. Ronald Murphy 's `` The Owl , the Raven , and the Dove . '' ) Many of the most influential Christian thinkers have had a deep love of pagan virtue . As Dante said to Virgil , `` Through you I became a poet ; through you , a Christian . '' And the seeds of this appreciation , like the seeds of anger at human sacrifice and untruth wherever it lies , can also be found in the Christian Scriptures.Perhaps the greatest weakness of Kirsch ' argument , though , is his own honesty . His generalization dies the death of a thousand qualifications . I mean , he is surprisingly fair in relating the transition from paganism to Christianity . But as he tells the story , the exceptions to his thesis -- monotheists harsh , polytheists mild and gentle -- grow so that you begin to worry for the thesis . He shows how Greek and Roman pagans abused Jewish monotheists . He details how Romans persecuted Christians for 250 years . He admits that some early Christian rulers were pretty mild . Why , then , not entertain alternative solutions to the puzzle ? Maybe some rulers are just nicer than others . Maybe `` Christians '' learned what Nero taught them -- traditional Roman cruelty . ( They were still Romans , after all . ) Or maybe , as a civilization sinks -- and Rome had been sinking for more than a century before Christians took over -- it begins to circle wagons and lash out -- as people naturally do . Failing to mention alternative explanations , Kirsch does not even begin to connect his story with his thesis in a persuasive way.Kirsch could not save his theory by appealing to other cultures , either . Christians were killed not only in Rome , but also in China , Korea , Japan , Tibet , communist Russia , and many tribal cultures . Sometimes Christians have committed terrible crimes . But `` Christian '' America has not burnt a witch or heretic for several centuries , now . Kirsch argues that `` cultural diversity and religious liberty '' are `` pagan values . '' He can only maintain such absurd generalizations ( both ways ) by ignoring a great deal of history.And then at the end , he describes Naziism and Communism as an `` enduring legacy of monotheism . '' What , were Mao and Pol Pott raised by Jesuits ? ( In fact , probably the greatest ruler in all Chinese history , the moderate and tolerant Kang Xi emeperor , really was educated by Jesuits ! ) Stalin killed more innocents on an average snowy day , every day for 25 years , than the Spanish inquisitors in all of six centuries . Stalin was an atheist , heavily influenced by Enlightenment philosophy . ( Marx wrote his doctoral dissertation on the pagan story of Prometheus ; and Mao loved the polytheistic story of Monkey King that parallels it in Chinese literature . ) Far better books on this subject , which give both sides and connect evidence to argument much more tightly , would be sociologist Rodney Stark 's series on Christianity and western culture . ( The Rise of Christianity , One True God , and For the Glory of God -- and the new one , which I have n't read yet . ) Stark agrees that monotheism can lead to intolerance , but explains everything a much more sophisticated manner.The story Kirsch tells , like most history , is a long story of bad behavior by almost everyone . To generalize from that story takes a great deal more knowledge , caution , and care than this author seems to possess . As a record of an interesting period in Roman history , however , this book seemed pretty good .	-1
I wanted to start a new exercise regimen so I picked up this book for inspiration . Unless you 've been in a coma since grade school and have learned nothing new in the ensuing decades about fitness , everything within these pages and its never ending paragraphs will give you no updated information . I even checked the publication date to see if The First Twenty Minutes had been released several years ago . Nope , it 's a new release.I would love to copy and paste any paragraph at random from the book just to prove how tedious this book is . But I digress . If you 're writing a term paper or pursuing a degree in physiology , this book might be helpful to you . If you want inspiration or information you can use in your quest for fitness and living longer or something to spur you into getting off the couch , keep looking.Do n't even get me started about the title . I thought this book would explain how I could get more out of the first 20 minutes of my workout . After muddling through the gigantic paragraphs -- this tome averages 3 per page -- I believe The First Twenty Minutes refers to the amount of time most people will give to reading the book .	-1
While aimed at the `` tween '' 9-12 year girl set , there are sufficiently disturbing elements and sprawling unoriginality in the Lily Quench series to recommend a pass.1 ) The main antagonist is a scheming torturess . No descriptions of torture are made , but the threat is constant . This caused real conflict in our family , as I was put on the spot trying not to explain to an 9-year old what an Iron Maiden is.2 ) The males are either retiring , passive nerds , or raging-male figures -- hardly a wholesome palette from which to form positive opinions of boys and men.3 ) Bald-faced ripoffs from the Harry Potter series and Lord of the Rings crop up quite often . `` Derivative '' is putting it mildly.I imagine the author fancies herself Roald Dahl 's literary heir . Whereas Dahl 's works are often entertaining-subversive , Ms . Prior 's stuff is merely tiresome-perverse .	-1
disturbing messages for kids . would NOT recommend to any kid without serious discussion afterwards of how these messages are so wrong.1 . the father is verbally abusive and the mother tells Marcy that it 's okay and that he loves her . WHAT ? ? Abuse is NOT love , never , in no way shape or form . When that mother is telling her child to put up with abuse , it 's like saying the child deserves to be treated that way . NO WAY . That mom should be saying the dad is wrong and the child should never feel that she deserves to be abused.2 . The mom is a horribly passive doormat . She enables the father 's abuse just to keep things calm . She allows her child to be abused just to keep the father calm . And then she dumps her marriage problems on the kid and expects the kid to be her marriage councilor . WHAT ? ? what a lousy parent . She should NEVER put her adult marriage problems on the shoulders of her child and then try to make the kid feel guilty for not helping her deal with the father . And she expects the child to help her change her own passive behavior . Seek an adult councilor , not your child ! 3 . the kid talks about being fat all through the book , so much so that it gets to the point where i want to yell at her to shut up and do something about it . i never could sympathize with this character even though my childhood had similar issues . She was just too depressing and whiny to listen to and care about . Even when she does start to act on her own , she still lets her boyfriend make all the decisions . From one male figure to the next . He decides what the group should do and he gets them together to help the teacher . Marcy is very passive and reactive in her role even to the end . it was very disappointing . She should have made more decisions for herself.4 . Even though this was written many years ago , i never felt this child was any older than 10 . Plus , the facts are a mess . Thirteen is not starting in ninth grade , it 's eighth . Ninth grade is high school , not junior high . I was in school , at thirteen , when this book was written . Poor research on author 's part . also , no gym teacher would allow a student to get a zero in class every day for a year without notifying the parents at some point early on , and at least on report cards . This was just not realistic and her jokes about it were n't even funny.My family was similar to this when i was growing up , and this was in the same time frame as when this book was published . But I 'm so glad i did n't read this book back then ! I would hate to think this would have reinforced the idea that abuse is a form of love and i should help my mom deal with her passive behavior with my dad . YUK.I will never recommend this book to any kid unless you intend to point out how wrong these messages are .	-1
I heard great things about this book , so when we saw it in the library , we decided to borrow it . Unfortunately , I did n't see what was so great about this book after all . Just was n't my cup of tea.Miles goes to boarding school to find his `` Great Perhaps '' and then meets some kids . He becomes friends with them , crushes on one of them , and they all mess around causing trouble.The whole time I was reading , I was asking myself , `` Why am I reading about a couple of school kids messing around ? '' . There was n't a point to the story until `` after '' something happened , which happens more than halfway through the book.The `` after '' part does stir some things up and kind of makes the book interesting . I do n't want to spoil anything so I wo n't talk much about the `` after '' event . It was a shock , and held great meaning towards the end , but overall I was just disappointed .	-1
My kid 's really enjoy SkippyJon Jones and especially the Audio versions . Unfortunately the narrator for this book is the author , who is n't bad , but is nowhere near as entertaining as the narrator of Lost in Spice , In the Doghouse , etc .	-1
I am an avid reader , and I read books based on whether they peak my interest or not . Despite this being written for young adults , the series peaked my interest so I read it . Overall , it 's an excellent series and Cate Tiernan has now become one of my favorite authors as she is wonderful at weaving her stories as her characters are at weaving their magick . That being said , it 's time to get down to the nitty gritty.I initially became concerned when the Epilogue of Sweep # 14 was written in the third person instead of the first . My concerns became well founded as the entirety of Sweep # 15 is written in third person as well . I felt like I had been shoved away from the characters , where previously I had been drawn into all the other books and felt an affinity with the characters in the series prior to reading this one.There are twists and turns in this book that make you feel uncomfortable and sad . I did n't feel them to be out of place exceptionally -- or cliched for that matter -- but I got the feeling that this final book was rushed . Whether the publisher was rushing Tiernan to end her series , or Tiernan hersef was in a hurry to end it , I ca n't be sure.Many new characters are introduced out of the blue while many old ones , Alisa in particular , that you may have devloped an affinity for were just dumped , unexplained , unfinished , leaving you wondering what happened to them.The book not only rushes an end to the series , but it rushes itself . There is no more development or reconciliation between Hunter and Morgan . No serious dialogue between Moira and Hunter of any significance . One minute they save Hunter , then it goes to fighting off a dark wave , and then it skips ahead to him asking Morgan to marry him again almost a year later . It 's a happy ending , but a excessively anti-climatic happy ending.You also get the impression that Iona had something to do with the death of Morgan 's husband , Colm , but it never says for sure one way or another.In any event , this book was disappointing . It would have been better as the beginning of an entirely new series with more in depth dialgue and character developement , or the continuation of Sweep if there had been another book in between , bridging the gap . There still would have been a need for more in depth dialogue and character developement , though , even with a book between # 14 and this one . Basically , too many changes , too many things left unexplained , and not enough relatiobship development between the characters . For example , Hunter never came off as a dead beat before who would live off of anyone 's steam but his own , but the ending of this book sure makes him come off that way . On top of that , he has been living with Morgan and his daughter for a year , I believe , and the daughter , Moira , still comes off as uncomforatble . You do n't even get the feeling they are at least friends . Nothing about their relationship is explained . No dialgue . No resolution.When writing about serious tragedies , I believe serious joys are needed to balance them . This book did n't have that balance , and the series ended without it . This book was actually a sad way to end a wonderful series despite it 's happy ending . I seriously hope Tiernan does n't end her Immortal Beloved series like this . It would be such a let down .	-1
I absolutely LOVE & lt ; u > Someone Like You & lt ; /u > and & lt ; u > This Lullaby & lt ; /u > but this book was horrible ! I thought it was never going to end , the plot was just stupid and the characters were developed poorly and there was n't really any relationships formed . It was a waste of time and money !	-1
Rae `` Sunshine '' Seddon is the world 's best cinnamon roll baker , or at least she will smack you over the head with that idea until you start believing it . She 's a pastry chef in a conspicuous diner filled with possibly-quirky regulars that we do n't get to hear much of because we spend our time in Sunshine 's head , either in long expository paragraphs about her world of the paranormal ( which reminds me : McKinley gives no reason for the explanation role of the narrator . There is no , `` I am writing this story for a legal case and must explain this paranormal creature to you . '' There is no reasoning behind the narrator 's exposition role , and there really needs to be one because she is a character within the story itself ) , or else traipsing off into uninteresting and unnecessary anecdotes on baking.I 'm sorry to say I could n't get beyond the first half of the book , so this review is only of what I read : Sunshine goes off to her lake house to think some things over , gets kidnapped by a gang of vampires , and while in captivity meets Constantine , the only vamp who does n't want to drink her blood . She manages to escape through her own considerable abilities as a `` Magic Handler '' and decides to save Constantine ( though she does n't know why she did that , although she will whine about this decision for the next hundred pages ) . When she gets back to civilization , things about her town of New Arcadia and her own self are not quite what they should be ... Here are the inexcusable flaws : good and likable subject matter ( vampire with a heart of gold , average girl who finds herself with extraordinary powers ) that proceeds with the most drawn-out exposition I 've read in a while , and a failure to flesh out any other character . I just . could n't . read . any . more.Go back and read some of the old Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles rather than pick up this plodding vampire romance .	-1
I 've never read this author before , but I have read a lot of vampire fiction . And while she is a better author that Anne Rice , this book did n't sweep me off my feet like I hoped it might . Too much plot , too many character and no sympathy for anyone.There is some good stuff here . Alternate universe detail , interesting magic that felt like reality , and I really , really want one of those cinnamon rolls . But in the end , too frustrating to want to own .	-1
I have read other books by Robin McKinley and enjoyed them very much but her writing style does take some getting used to . So at first I thought that my frustration was that I have n't read one of her books in a while and just needed to keep reading , but this book was so random . Sunshine is an interesting concept but the author rambles on and on and on about meaningless topics that really have nothing to do with anything ! I kept finding myself thinking `` what have I missed ? '' Well ... Nothing she is just talking about random stuff again that hasnt been explained ! UGH , Frustrating !	-1
I have n't eaten a muffin since I read this book . All `` sunshine `` does is makes cakes and muffins and talks about it forever . This book was a let down , in the middle it had potential but the relationship between the vamp and the heroine never really goes anywhere , there is a small teaser but it falls flat . Do n't waste your time , I almost did n't finish this book .	-1
I 'm not sure why this book deserved starred reviews . I honestly found the voice of the portagonist so grating , his usage of slang and emoticon/text-message-speak so distracting , that I could n't finish the book . I felt the protagonist so unlikeable in his shallowness , pettiness , and obsession for fashion and appearances , that I could not relate or care what transpires to him . I welcome YA treatments of queer characters and themes , but I just could not survive the visual glare of the text ( with so many capital letters and exclamation points , it seems written by an attention-starved tween ) .	-1
This book is nothing short of bland and has never even considered the word subplot . For me , reading is an adventure . Sure , I want to get to know my character ( s ) , but I do n't need to spend three pages on details like 'opening and closing the doors ' or 'taking blank steps forward , backward , sideways ' . This book is certainly suited for an audience with simpler tastes . Were I one of those people , I 'm certain I would have found Anne Osterlund 's style more endearing . Overall , just remember this book has very little to offer in twists and turns so if you 're looking for excitement , subplots , romantic angst you 're not going to get it here . This book is pretty straightforward . Beginning to end .	-1
DISCLOSURE : I gave up on the book on Page 15.NOTE : I read constantly . I love books . I , literally , have given up on attempting to read less than a dozen books in my life ( and one of them was Dickens ' `` A Tale of Two Cities '' ) - and I gave up on this one.I 've read a lot of fantasy books , 8-to-12 , YA & adult . I 've also read a lot of McKinley books . I consider `` The Twelve Dancing Princesses '' in `` The Door in the Hedge '' to be one of the best versions of that story I 've read . I enjoyed the Damar/Blue Sword series , & the first Beauty version ( 1978 ) . Some others , not so much , but they were readable . But THIS book ! I will persist far longer in reading a book than I should , in hopes that it 'll improve ( I 'm stubborn ) - but I draw the line at bad writing . I totally gave up on `` Dragonhaven '' on PAGE 15 . I JUST DID N'T CARE about the story or the characters - not to mention the awful writing itself . IN this book , the writing is choppy , half her sentences are actually phrases , the prose is obtuse , & her grammar is worse than a badly-educated high schoolers . WHERE WAS HER EDITOR ? Did n't anyone tell Ms. McKinley that her writing is becoming impossible to read ? The whole feel of the book is disorganized and careless - and that 's what I got in the first 15 pages . What has happened to her ? Please , someone find out ! Her plotlines are good , but the best plotline in the world can not survive bad grammar and messy prose.I 'm sorry to say this , but it 's true : I once read a very bad , very formulaic 8-to-12 paperback book about a cursed dollhouse ( the title of this book is lost in time ) that looked like the house a family had just moved into . It was a silly `` plot '' , it was knocked off quickly , and it was pedestrian at best . But that book was more readable , and thus , more enjoyable , than `` Dragonhaven '' ! This is not a good thing .	-1
Okay , first off , I 'm kind of a Twilight fan so when I kept reading and hearing about how this is like Twilight , that seriously annoyed . This is nothing like Twilight ! Even the romance between the main characters is nothing like Bella and Edward 's romance ! But besides that , I could not get interested in this book . No offense , but Mia seemed like a boring character and pretty serious and the only interesting thing about her was that she played the cello . Even when she said she skipped school with her friend , it was to see some art show ( if I skipped school , I 'd go shopping and goof off ( which I have done ) ) and she just did n't seem like someone who 'd be easy talk to in real life . I do n't know , she was just a hard character to like or relate to . I did read Where She Went though , and liked that a lot better though ( I think it 's because the guy is 1000x more interesting than her . ) I just did n't enjoy it as much as I thought I would .	-1
I got this book after reading so many positive reviews , especially since it was compared to `` The Lovely Bones '' which I loved but this book is nothing like that book . `` The Lovely Bones '' was so emotionally charged but this book just falls flat , I was half-way through the book yet did not care at all for any of the characters . I agree about the other reviewers ' take on the protagonist 's parents who were supposed to be all hip and modern ( allowing their teens to drink and paying for their contraceptives , freely cursing , etc ) but it all came off really badly . It did n't get any better towards the end either and the ending , of course , was predictable.If you still want to read it , I suggest taking it out from the library which is thankfully what I did . It 's not worth the money .	-1
This book had what could have been a good storyline . Depressing of course but still heartwrenching . I did not feel that raw emotion though . This book jumps from past to present and takes place over a 24 hour period . We did not have time to love Adam and Mia or even Mia and her family . Relationships need to gross for a reader in order to truly feel their loss . It ends with a cliffhanger so even though I could n't wait to finish `` If I Stay '' I am forced to read `` Where She Went . '' Hoping for more in the sequel ...	-1
Meh . It was okay . I did n't care for Fire personally . She 's not the kind of girl I 'd be friend with . Blah .	-1
Grisham should stick to writing for adults . Theo is an unrealistic teen from a cardboard family . All they live for is being or becoming lawyers . Even their dog is named Judge and their entertainment is watching old Perry Mason reruns . Really ? ? The plot is plodding , never thrilling , crammed with long paragraphs explaining the legal system . One character named Omar is supposed to be scary but he never makes a move . The presumed murderer is n't even scary . The ending is flat . Nothing is at stake for Theo , and after a few chapters , the reader does n't care anymore . Grisham should read some books for kids to understand you need to hook them early and keep the pressure on with page-turning excitement . This book does none of that .	-1
I was excited when I saw that John Grisham had created this series and so sure it would be excellent that I made the mistake of purchasing two of the tiles . I will be returning the 2nd purchase and I was sorry it is not possible to do zero stars . Grisham has a talent for developing strong believable characters with exciting plot lines . The main characters are not believable and the story dragged . Grisham creates a main plot and several subplots , but leaves the only interesting plots completely unresolved . What happens to the illegal Hispanic witness and his family ? There are two dangerous bad guys who have every intention of causing a problem for the new trial and one is left with the impression that Theo and the Hispanic witness are in serious danger . But it ends with no further `` danger '' than an evil look toward Theo . Why did he introduce the sinister bad guys if he had no intention of having them do anything relevant ? What happens to Theo 's friend April and how does the judge rule for her custody ? What happens with the uncle 's renewed relationship with his family ? Grisham leaves the reader with lots of unresolved questions and thus an unsatisfactory experience . Grisham clearly has not read a young teen book as this story is not fast paced enough , exciting enough , or believable enough to keep the attention of his intended audience . It seems as though Grisham had some good ideas and became scared of scaring the audience and backed off from giving a full story . Or perhaps he bored himself with the dull parts and just stopped before it was complete . Grisham should read some young teen books before writing more . If this book had not had Grisham 's name on it , I do not think it would have been published.Ripped off in GA	-1
I have n't read a lot of mysteries for adults , so I do n't know Grisham 's other writing , but as a children 's librarian , I have read quite a few mysteries for children , and I think this one falls short . He tells us emotions rather than showing them . The characters are not well-differentiated , and they just do n't have much pizazz to them . Theo is a Nancy-Drew-like throwback , granted very polite and earnest , but without much character himself . It was n't really a page-turner . I was mildly interested in how things would turn out , and found the ending unsatisfying ( I knew I was in trouble when I had only 2 pages left & the mystery had n't really been solved . ) Is this just the 1st half of the story ? I do n't think I care enough to get the sequel.Other series are much better written : Shane Peacock 's The Boy Sherlock Holmes ; Nancy Springer 's Enola Holmes ; Elise Broach 's books `` Shakespeare 's Secret '' and `` Masterpiece ''	-1
I have n't read anything by Fisher before , so I decided to take a chance on this novel and it was well below what I hoped . The plot was very predictable , character development poor , dialogue simple . I guess I do n't really have much positive to say , sometimes the book at least grabs you , but even that was a stretch with this one . As I got to the end I had to muster all of my motivation to finish reading it .	-1
How could any best friend steal their best friend 's boyfriend ? ? ? ? ? And use a lame excuse as `` soul mate '' to do it ? No . No matter what , put yourself in the shoes of the person who is betrayed by her best friend . It hurts no matter how the Author choose to end the story . Someone needs to write a book about how the betrayer gets what she truly deserve like maybe get her OWN boyfriend STOLEN too ! I will never be able to understand why my best friend would steal my boyfriend . I will never be able to forgive her or trust her ever again no matter what . 10 years from now , even if she does end up with the boyfriend she stole from me in the name of soul mate , I would never be able to trust her with my husband . This is not how this story should have ended . Instead of this book , try reading `` Something Borrowed '' by Emily Griffin . Way better . I steal do n't like the whole 'steal your friend 's boyfriend deal ' but at least the ending makes more sense .	-1
Now I may be a little harsh on this but I 'm going to be honest . I read the Monster Blood Tatoo and to this day it is still one of my favorite books , so when the Foundling came out I jumped at the chance and purchased it . I do n't know what happened to the author after book one but book two and three are EXTREMELY hard to read.At first I thought it was my imagination but no the style of writing literally feels like there are two different writers . It 's like the author decided that since the first book was a hit let 's fill the next two with vocabulary only an English professor will easliy understand then we 'll throw in a thesaurus full of new words to boot . How these books are for young adults I 'll never know , they should be catagorized for adults . I am an avid reader but when I start a book I do n't want to have my dictionary within grabbing distance everytime I turn a page .	-1
I purchased this book for my fourth grade classroom as it was nominated for the Nutmeg Book Award in Connecticut for the intermediate grades . While the book started off entertainingly and I enjoyed the narrator 's interjections throughout the text , the content was very disturbing and a bit much for elementary students . The book was well-written and each fairy tale was cleverly woven in with the next , but I might think twice if I were buying it for a child that is sensitive to violent content .	-1
After coming across various reviews and tweets raving about this series I just had to get my hand on it . I waited for all the three books in the trilogy to be released before starting on it and only recently finished reading them.Cassia is born into a Society where everything is controlled - from the amount of food they get , to their clothes to their Matches . In a way Cassia is lucky because at her matching ceremony she finds out that not only is her match from her own sector , which is very rare , but her match is her best friend Xander . But , there 's a glitch and the memory card with Xander 's details has a flash of another face - face of Ky Markham . In her confusion about the Society 's mistake , she feels attracted towards Ky . But the Society has more in store for her . Through a series of events , Cassie gets closer to Ky - as if fate or Society kept throwing them together - and they fall in love only to be ripped apart.I must admit that it was an enchanting dystopian world that Ms.Condie has created . The detailed description of how the Society worked spanned over all the three books so that every time you pick up a book , you learn more about the Society . I have heard that the concept of the Society is lifted from a Lois Lowry series , but since I have n't read that series myself , I do n't know if that 's true . You guys might wan na check it out for yourself.The characters are pretty well developed . Cassie , the protagonist , comes across as a confused girl at the beginning . But then as the story progresses , her character develops and you realize that being under the Society 's control all her life , a simple mistake from the seemingly perfect Society can throw a person off balance . I liked Ky too for his brave heart . But I loved Xander the most . Why do the best friends , the most caring soul , get left behind by the girls ? Do n't get me wrong but even Ky is a good guy too , but Xander was such a sweet heart . I was glad to see that there was some hope for him in the end.My problem with this series is that it was very slow . None of the books are less than 350 pages ( I think the last one was over 500 pages ) . But when it comes down to it the plot is n't that complex to need three books . As a result I had the drag feeling throughout the three books and it felt really tedious to complete the series . As a single story with a faster pace , I might have enjoyed it.Overall , I do n't think the books have much to offer .	-1
This book was just plain awful . It did n't have much of a plot to follow and the characters did n't have any depth . I am just glad i borrowed it instead of buying . Sure i will admit that it had potential to be epic but it sure was n't .	-1
I bought Matched because it sounded right up my ally and I read some of the high praising reviews . I wish I would have read some of the 2 and 3 stars instead ... note to self , always read the in between reviews : ) Unfortunately the idea of matched was spectacular but poorly executed . It was n't until more than halfway through the book that I felt anything AT ALL negative about the control of the government . I do n't know why it is such a bad thing to be perfectly matched with someone who is your true love ... sounds awesome.Maybe I should n't be writing a revew , because I did n't finish this book . I read 60 % of this book and just honestly did not care anymore . The main character was ... in a word ... boring . I did n't care about her enough to continue reading her story.The plot is slow . There is very little to gain attachment to . There is nothing that makes me FEEL . Maybe the book gets spectacular in the end , but it would n't be worth the time spent on the first half.If you are looking for and ADULT book in YA fiction that deals in dystopian societies may I recommend : '' The Hunger Games '' by Suzanne Collins '' Across the Universe '' by Beth Revisor you can always go old school with `` Brave New World '' by Aldous Huxsley or even `` 1984 '' or `` The Handmaids Tale '' .The Hunger GamesAcross the UniverseBrave New WorldNineteen Eighty-FourThe Handmaid 's Tale ( Everyman 's Library )	-1
Calla is a werewolf or well she prefers Guardian . She saves someone by feeding him some of her blood ( surprise ! werewolf blood has healing properties ) . This is the first event in a series seemingly designed to bring Calla 's carefully organized life down in shambles . She 's supposed to marry Ren , but now there is a Shay . What you expect happens.The consensus seems to be that it 's full of awesome , but quite honestly I thought it was awful . It gets a star because the cover is so pretty.Where do I start ? The exchanges between Calla and Shay are so incredibly contrived . `` Hi ! I just met you and telling you things is going to get me killed but let me pour out EVERYTHING about what I am and how my society functions anyway . '' This happens at least twice which really detracts from the rest of the story in general . The author really should have found a better way to give the reader that information without resorting to such unnatural dialogue.Calla as a whole comes across as ambivalent . She does n't have much of an opinion on what is going on besides that both Ren and Shay are incredibly attractive and fill her with longing ( well , she does hate skirts and frills ) . The earth shattering revelation that her masters are lying to her does n't seem to have much impact . Only when Shay is endangered , does she have a reaction.So ... I did n't like this book , and I ca n't recommend it .	-1
Briony Larkin deals with self hatred all the time . She believes she 's bad because after all her name comes from a poisonous vine . Plus , villainous creatures in the swamp refer to her as their mistress . She 's been told that no one is to know of her being a witch . So when an engineer and his son come to drain the swamp that is vital to her sister 's protection she must face the difficulty of revealing her secret to save her twin.This book is difficult to review . Was it mysterious ? Did it keep me guessing ? Was it different ? Yes , yes , and yes , however I would n't say I liked this book . It 's odd to say , but I think it was the writing style that threw me . There were parts where Briony would randomly break into weird little poems . They were kind of nonsensical to me . I guess if you were seeing a movie you 'd imagine those parts as being eerie and creepy and it would work , but reading those parts were just annoying to me . The reading flow just seemed hindered.Another problem for me was too much action would take place in the swamp , and I would be lost as to what just happened . I guess because Briony is such an unreliable narrator and guarded , we the reader only know so much , and what we do know gets confusing.Rose is her identical twin who seems a bit slow , but in reality is pretty smart.That is one good thing about this book though . The characters are well fleshed out and despite being confused , I felt sympathetic towards them . As the book goes on you 'll probably go through three of four different scenarios of what could have happened and that was a bit fun.Towards the end it was more exciting , but the first half just complicated the experience for me.Overall the book was just okay to me , but all over the net the reviews are just glowing with praise . So maybe it 's just not my cup of tea , maybe it will be yours . Judge for yourself peeps .	-1
However , I believe it was meant for a young audiance and I did n't know this before I bought the book .	-1
Words can not express how much of a disappointment Reached was to me . The book was on my most anticipated books of 2012 list . However , I am glad that I borrowed it from the library instead of wasting money on it . The only reason I even finished the book is because I wanted to know how the series ended . The book had quite a few obvious plot holes that I caught right away . Just because Cassia slips a piece of paper that says remember , she is able to remember everything that happens to her . That was the biggest plot hole that bothered me . Normal people that lose their memory would look at the piece of paper and think ` Why the heck do I have a piece of paper that says remember ? ' . It just seemed like a cop out . I expected more action from the Rising taking over the Society . It was anticlimactic . The book gives a reason for it being so quick . However , with two books leading up to this , you would think that it would be an epic battle . The only thing that I even somewhat liked about the book was the ending . Cassia chose who I thought she would . It was pretty obvious throughout the book who she was going to choose . Even though she could only choose one person , the person she did n't choose got a happy ending as well . What the reader finds out about Lei towards the end of the book made me really happy . I was astounded . It was probably the only thing in the book I did n't see happening before it was revealed . However , an okay ending does not make up for a horrible book . Reached was one of the most disappointing books of 2012 , if not one of the most disappointing books I have ever read . It had so much potential but it fell flat .	-1
This book does have a lot going for it . It 's very appealing and has an intriguing- albeit not original- plot and I can see a lot of people liking it . It 's disturbing . Dark . Scary . And has a feel of desperation that you ca n't help but cling to . With Politics and mind-blowing twists . Plus we have a little forbidden romance as well . This , coupled with a few other things- is just one example of how it failed for me . *goes and sits in the minority corner*Black City is still in devastation from the war that had previously ended . Tensions are still high , with both sides still in disagreement and with the return of the Emissary . On top of all that , the `` Religious Leader '' is trying to pass a law to ban the Darklings entirely . It was a little hard to follow at first , I was confused about several things . I 'm still not sure if this is a case of bad execution or my slow brain at the time . Eventually , I got the in the swing of things and it all started to make sense.. Kind of . The different types of Darklings were fascinating . More or less different `` breeds '' of them-all with obvious , distinguishable physical features to tell them apart . They had their own.. culture , which was interesting to learn about.The books alternates between Natalie and Ash 's POV . Though you can tell small distinct differences between the two , their voices were pretty similar . The two meet early on and the tension and dislike was palpable . Which is why I think I had a hard time with their `` romance '' . I 'm sure a lot of people found it swoon worthy and romantic , I found it reeking of insta love . After Ash 's little epiphany about their physical reaction to each other- which was just shrugged off and accepted too soon for my liking- they acted like love-sick children . It was odd to me , that he would even have a human blood mate . Then when that little twist was thrown in , it explained a little , though I feel like it 's too vague and does n't make sense to me . If their attraction was because of the heart thing- why did he still have `` feelings '' or whatever for Evangeline ? Because it was HERS ? Or because it was just the heart ? I do n't understand.Their relationship is already taboo , so I was a little put off by Evangeline 's role . I suppose it is n't a full-out love triangle but still . It 's irritating to make a couple `` soul mates '' or something or other , with so much standing in between them . When you throw obstacle after obstacle on a couple , it does n't do ANYTHING for me but cause irritation . No , it should n't be easy because NOTHING is that easy . But there are trials and truths every relationship goes through , without all that added bull s*** . Then , Ash 's little test theory to `` make sure '' he had no feelings for Evangeline pissed me off . AND- goes to show he did n't ( at least at the time ) `` love '' Natalie because he would NOT have done that . Natalie was way too forgiving and accepting with everyone , especially with Ash and Evangeline . Evangeline was psycho . Plain and simple.Of course , you ca n't have a political figure without twists and deception . And these are there ten fold . Natalie 's mom is one twisted witch . She explains her actions in a way to expect pity , but I did n't . AT ALL . There are plenty of other things that could have been done but she choose to do what she did . Which in turn , might be the point . The scientist ; man , not only is what he does SICK he has a sweet and charismatic tone towards Natalie . ANYONE that is that twisted and sweet at the same time is S-C-A-R-Y . Although we do n't get to see much of this Rose guy , he sounds like a freaking winner too.Aside from disliking the romances , the Religious aspects make me uncomfortable . Squirm worthy uncomfortable . Not a fan . The implications , ways they execute the people and Darklings alike- just NO . As well as the whole segregation part . The ending too , had me scratching my head . It did n't follow- maybe because I was seething about Ash 's `` Resurrection '' . *snorts*Overall- I really liked the idea of this sad , destructive world . With the Darklings and all . Everything else , NO . The romance , the religions implications and segregation make me uneasy . No , I wont read Phoenix .	-1
The story is a fun read . There 's plenty of sleuthing and action . The major fault of the book is that you have to dumb yourself down to read it . Otherwise , you 're always 2 or 3 steps ahead of the protagonist which is excruciating in a suspense novel . I found myself constantly saying , `` Really , you do n't get that ? Then why are you making such risky choices if you do n't get what 's going on ? `` Small spoilers below ( reveals some of the early plot but not the juicy stuff ) As examples : The kids make a rather shocking discovery on an island just as they are set on and shot at by an armed team clad in black . At the end of the encounter , the kids decide not to tell their parents about it until the morning ( Are you kidding me ! ) because they say they are too tired to endure the grilling their parents will give them . I 've never been shot at , but I ca n't imagine a group of teenagers tucking themselves in for a good night 's sleep before they tell their parents . Then , when they do report the crime , they report it to an enforcement agency that they already believe are a joke ( rather than going to the state police or the SLEC , the state version of the FBI ) . Finally , when they show the officers the scene of the crime they 've uncovered , they 're shocked to see that the evidence they found has been tampered with or stolen . This is just beyond belief . Did the kids really think that a group would drive them off with weapons and leave the scene intact until the next day ? The kids liberate ( steal ) a puppy infected with a highly contagious animal virus from a secure research facility . When the director of the facility sees them next , he refers only slightly obliquely to the theft implying that he knows they took the puppy . The main character recognizes the implications of his statements in an internal dialogue . The next day the director interrogates the kids , asking each one if they feel sick or `` fluish '' ? And they 're perplexed . Why would he think we were sick ? Sure the virus is only supposed to attack dogs . But they 're at a research facility and someone has already tried to drive them away at gun point . Can they not put two and two together ? Apparently they ca n't , even though they 're supposed to be so bright that they estrange themselves from other kids at their school.The book is filled with these incongruities.It feels as though you 're mentally dragging the main characters along or waiting for them to catch up.It makes it a very frustrating read .	-1
The rise of fantasy has , in my opinion , produced two kinds of cliche-oriented reactions within the publishing spectrum : entertaining , inventive , and/or enjoyably derivative trilogies , and fascinating ideas and worlds mired by barely serviceable prose , lackluster plotting , and/or a general failure to maintain cohesion ( in the plot , worldbuilding , character development , and/or the writing ) . Both groups are n't always separate , since sometimes a book with weak prose can still be a thrilling read , but usually they are . Unfortunately , I think The Left Hand of God fits into the latter of the two groups.The novel sounds intriguing enough , and Hoffman 's book does deliver on a number of the points described in the synopsis for the U.S. edition , but overall , The Left Hand of God falls desperately short in three key ways.The first failure has to do with point of view . While the synopsis indicates that Cale is the main character , Hoffman 's writing fails to adequately display that , almost as if Hoffman did n't seem to know who the book was supposed to be about either . The first quarter of the book does focus on Cale , but the rest of the novel switches randomly from POV to POV to give the reader the thoughts of basically anyone in the room at that moment , or even people who are completely insignificant to the actual plot . None of this is done between chapters , which might have been okay , but within chapters , sometimes between paragraphs , and sometimes between sentences . One second we 're hearing Cale 's inner thoughts , and the next it 's someone else . And before you can grow used to the transition , Hoffman switches again.From a purely stylistic standpoint , this is simply poor writing for two reasons : 1 ) trying to tell your readers everything everyone is feeling about everything sucks the life right out of the story , because very little remains a mystery , and 2 ) switching POVs in the middle of paragraphs is unnecessarily jarring and almost as annoying as inconsistent tenses . Sadly , Hoffman violates one of the golden rules of writing on a routine basis in order to give as many perspectives as possible -- i.e . `` show , do n't tell . '' I suppose you 'd have to in order to perform the aforementioned task , but breaking the rule so clearly , with no regard for its eccentricities and ambiguities , is careless . The prose suffers as a result.The Left Hand of God also suffers from narrative inconsistencies . For example , the synopsis indicates that Cale is n't aware of the world outside of the sanctuary . The problem ? This is n't actually true . He does n't understand the customs of the cultures that exist beyond the walls of sanctuary , sure , but , as we learn later in the book , he is both aware of the outside world and instrumental in the Redeemer 's plans for those places ( i.e . he actually designed their plans ) . This leads me to another inconsistency , which is Cale 's fighting ability . When Cale first exhibits these abilities , it 's a shock both to the reader and to the non-Redeemer characters . Why ? Because it 's never mentioned beforehand . One moment he 's just some poor , beaten-up , grumpy guy , and the next he 's the Roman equivalent of a ninja . It 's all rather convenient , and obviously so . Narratives are n't supposed to be convenient . They 're supposed to feel believable . Nothing should feel as though it does n't belong.The last problem I had with The Left Hand of God was the general unbelievability of some of the events that occur throughout the narrative . Characters do things that are completely contrary to who they are , despite Hoffman 's attempts to establish them as pretty clearly in one particular form . Perhaps the worst instance of this is when Hoffman writes the Materazzi as a Spartan-esque warrior class , but then proceeds to have them lose a battle in the most idiotic manner conceivable -- a thing that no military of the Materazzi 's caliber would do . Likewise , characters fall in love at random , sometimes despite legitimate reasons why they should n't . I may have rolled my eyes more than once while reading . The point is , Hoffman 's novel regularly devolves into nonsensical plot points , which sucks it dry of the potential established in the first chapters -- the strongest part of the book is the beginning.The Left Hand of God is n't without positive qualities . Hoffman does have a knack for tension , and , as I 've just mentioned , the beginning third of the book , while a tad long , is quite strong and intriguing . Plus , the interior of the book is quite beautiful , with nice texture for the pages , an awesome map , and a good design for the pages and chapter headings . But it 's not enough to have some great ideas , a relatively strong beginning , a nice interior , and a few generally entertaining sections . A novel needs to be more than that , and , unfortunately , I do n't think The Left Hand of God comes close to meeting the burden of minimums . The biggest problem for me is that I had high hopes for the book . It had a lot of potential and there truly were some good moments . But I ended up being disappointed and thinking that this is n't the right direction for fantasy at all . Let 's keep the mediocre writing standards to the vanity presses , please .	-1
*Warning* MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ! Like many who have given this book a poor review I was very excited at the prospect of Ken Follett making a trilogy of the 20th century . However , some 400 pages in this book has fallen flat . Unlike KF 's past books , from his thrillers to `` Pillars '' and `` World `` , which were charecter driven , this book seemed to exist for KF to give himself the opportunity to share his liberal , socialist attitudes at every turn . The Peer is of course a clueless , entitled jerk , his wife a 20th century Marie Antionette archetype , and his sister , the suffragette and women 's rights activist , would have worn out her welcome in early 20th century England long before this book starts . The German has world views I would deem impossible for the son of an early 20th century Prussian aristocrat . His cousin , for example , a minor Austrian charecter , is gay , which the German charecter accepts without the bat of an eyelash . Sorry KF , but there was no Rainbow Coalition back then . Then there is the uneducated Welsh miners kids who are , of course , the smaretst people in whatever room they happen to be in . Of the Russian brothers , one is as tiresome in his simpering lack of backbone as Hamlet , and the other is just plain loathsome . The actions of the charecters are improbable , and the coincidences difficult to swallow . For example , the German charecter starts out as Ludendorf 's aide-de-camp at Tannenberg , but 5 months later is inexplicably on the Western Front in time for the Christmas Truce . This is where , of course , he stumbles upon his freind the Peer , who has gone from French Liason to skulking about in the trenches , all in the course of the same 5 months . I wanted to scream ! ! This is where I could n't take this book anymore and stopped reading it.I love Ken Follet 's books and it pains me to have to give this one a poor review . But I 'm afraid he trotted out a clunker this time .	-1
I started this novel but just could n't do it and gave up part way through . I understand that this series is hugely popular , and in fact , the book was lent to me by a coworker who is a fan . I have to admit , the novel was highly readable and I found the pages turning quickly . It became an issue of quality for me . As I was reading it , I just kept thinking 'This is just a big old cheesy soap opera'.It was hard to read because my eyes were always rolling . Take this sequence from the end of Chapter 2 : He gazed back at her . `` You are absolutely enchanting , '' he said in a low voice ; then he kissed her again.This time she pushed him away . `` My lord , what are you doing ? '' she said in a shocked whisper . `` I do n't know . `` `` But what can you be thinking of ? `` `` I 'm not thinking at all . `` She stared up at his chiseled face . The green eyes studied her intently , as if trying to read her mind . She realized she adored him . Suddenly she was flooded with excitement and desire . `` I ca n't help myself , '' he said.She sighed happily . `` Kiss me again then , '' she said.I read a few more chapters after this , but it was just sooo baaad . I guess a lot of people like this sort of thing but it just does n't appeal to me . I found the writing pedestrian , the dialogue clunky , and the story too melodramatic for my tastes .	-1
I bought this book because it 's historical fiction , but it was too much history and not enough fiction for me . I found myself liking the stories about the different characters and skipping over the details about the war . It just got too political for me and I was bored on those parts .	-1

I do n't think I 've ever encountered a more status-obsessed person than Amy Chua . She 's smart , but relentlessly shallow . She has her kids playing music not because she loves music , but because it 's status-appropriate to her class and because there are easy markers of excellence . That is , she does n't love Mozart , she loves Julliard . She does n't love law , or justice , she loves Yale . They travel , but it 's a just a list of cities she can rattle off.It 's a really dispiriting book . She 's slick -- making it about being `` chinese '' was a good way to sell books , but there is nothing at all Chinese about what she describes . It 's the same behavior of ruthless stage mothers and status-obsessed climbers of all ethnicities.Look here 's the thing -- driving your kids really hard might work out really well for you , depending on what you want . Or it might not . It 's kind of a crapshoot . You can go through life saying things like `` I ca n't be a shallow status obsessed airhead ! I teach at Yale ! '' But it wo n't necessarily be true	-1
Ugh , this book is way way to long . So much so , that I could n't finish reading it . I am over 50 % done but I think I lost interested at the first couple chapters of Diana just researching , rowing , and doing yoga . Nothing suspenseful happens in this book , it just drags on . And , after reading some reviews that nothing ever happens in this book I decided to end my suffering and just stop reading it.There were a couple good parts in the book that peaked my interest a bit , and made me think , oh now we are going somewhere ! But , then it was followed by pages and pages and pages of dull details of how Diana slept , or went riding , or did research . 600 page is way to long and I just could n't finish it .	-1
I am disappointed in this book . I downloaded it on my kindle and was anticipating a delicious read of witches and other worldly creatures.The book starts off good enough about a witch who has the ability to break a spell on a manuscript that delves into the origins of creatures ... . she falls in love with a vampire and they are attacked by other creatures and that 's pretty much where I start disliking this book . First off , the main character is supposed to portray this rock solid , hard core female who can take care of herself , needs no man to protect her , is resilient and so on ... .. oooooooofff course , it do n't work out that way . She is this overly fragile thing , always on the verge of passing out or is weak because she had to use her craft or because she walked up a flight of stairs , etc . Her character is really starting to get on my nerves . The main vampire dude is an Edward Cullen wannabe . Gawd ! So , annoying . I wish the author could have stayed focused on the manuscript and the intrigue into the origins of the creatures . She totally disappointed me with this book . I will read it finished just because I do n't like to leave it unread , but geesh ! I am disappointed that I bought the download .	-1
I count myself among those who really wanted to like this book , and actually I was fairly sure I would like it until about halfway through . It starts out with a great premise -- Diana is a historian , doing research on alchemy . Great , I love research , I love libraries , I love books and the supernatural . I thought it would be like The Historian ( which I LOVED ) . Sadly , it sort of dissolves into a second-rate , not-very exciting romance . People compare it to Twilight , but even though Twilight is not without flaws , it was a much more engaging story . I never really understood the attraction between Diana and Matthew . There is no tension -- they meet and that 's it . I thought Edward from Twilight was more appealing -- at least he saved Bella 's life . Then , there 's a lot of nothing . Diana takes a lot of naps , which is mostly what I felt like doing when reading it . I also found Diana annoying . I mean , so he 's a vampire -- he explains this means he 's in charge , blah blah blah . Diana basically says , `` Oh , okay . '' Here is an opportunity for tension -- what woman would just bat her eyelashes and say , `` Oh , you 're so wonderful -- okay honey ! '' But that 's what Diana does . Did she really get to be a respected scholar by rolling over and being such a doormat ? I do n't think I 'm reading the sequel . I do n't think I care .	-1
Dr. Diana Bishop , descendant of the famous Bridget Bishop of Salem , Massachusetts , turned her back on her natural powers after her parents were killed when she was a child . Instead , she relied on her brain power , went to Oxford and Yale , and became a well-known researcher in the field of history of science . Now she 's back at Oxford , spending the year studying old alchemical texts archived at the Bodleian Library . But when she calls the book known as Ashmole 782 from the stacks , she can feel its power and she can see hidden writing moving on its pages . It frightens her a bit and she notices that soon after returning it to the stacks , she 's attracted the attention of many creatures -- vampires , daemons , and other witches -- who are suddenly hanging around the Bodleian . One vampire in particular , Matthew Clairmont , an attractive professor of biochemistry and neuroscience , just wo n't leave her alone . What is so special about Ashmole 782 and why are all these creatures hoping she 'll call it back ? After reading the blurbs about A Discovery of Witches , this was a book I was eagerly waiting for . I love academic settings ( especially Oxford ) , old libraries , and the blend of history and science . And I did enjoy much of A Discovery of Witches for this reason . Diana Bishop is an urban fantasy heroine that I can relate to . She spends her time in libraries instead of tattoo parlors ; she prepares lectures and writes letters of recommendation instead of training with weapons and kicking peoples ' butts . I understood her goals and interests and the way that her focus on academic pursuits makes her slightly awkward and absent-minded elsewhere . I was also much intrigued by Matthew Clairmont 's genetic research into the evolution of witches , vampires , and daemons and how this related to Diana 's research in alchemy.Thus , A Discovery of Witches had a lot of potential for me , but there were three problems that sapped my enjoyment : The first is that the book is simply way too long . With nearly 600 pages to work with , Deborah Harkness should have been able to get these interesting ideas farther off the ground . I was frustrated that , by the end , it had become clear that A Discovery of Witches is the first novel in a series . In this first installment , Harkness carefully develops the characters and sets up the romance . There is a lot of sitting in the library , hanging around various houses , talking , drinking tea , and eating . The story covers only about a month of time and I think I witnessed nearly everything Diana ate and drank during that month.Secondly -- and this is a common problem for me in urban fantasies -- I could n't appreciate the romance which dominated the plot . Vampires are just not sexy to me and I had a hard time believing that an overprotective , angry , admittedly murderous vampire would be attractive to an independently-minded academic . Not to mention that his body is cold and his heart beats only rarely . He spends a lot of time growling , bossing her around , speaking roughly , giving everyone dark looks , and displaying mate-guarding behaviors -- steering her around by her elbow and with his hand at the small of her back , hovering over her , blocking her path , pushing her up against barriers , `` scooping '' her up , tossing her on horses , grabbing her by the chin and twisting her neck , telling her she 'll catch cold if she sits on the ground ( a guy who sequences DNA thinks that sitting on the ground will make her sick ? ) . He even binds her with an oath without her permission . I find this kind of behavior in a courting male insufferable . This is a common problem for me , and one of the reasons I do n't read much vampire lit , but I was n't expecting to encounter this issue in such magnitude in a book about a famous researcher from Oxford and Yale . I know she 's scared of what 's going on in her life , but where is this woman 's self-respect ? In some ways , A Discovery of Witches felt like Twilight for middle-aged academics . The most unbelievable part of the entire romance , though is that [ removed spoiler -- please visit my website . ] Thirdly , there are a lot of minor plot issues that just do n't fit into a well-developed fantasy , especially once we leave the academic atmosphere of Oxford and the book starts to feel like Harry Potter . Magic in this world seems arbitrary . We 're told that each power has a genetic marker , which is cool , but its practice is not sufficiently explained . It 's the snap-your-fingers-to-clean-the-dishes , close-your-eyes-and-concentrate-to-fly type . Sparks fly from Diana 's fingers , she cries rivers of tears , witchfire bursts from her outstretched arm . She is suddenly accumulating a host of new skills that make her the most powerful witch alive , but she does n't respond with the awe we 'd expect . When she finds out that she can time-travel , she practically shrugs it off ( and the physics of time-travel do n't even try to make sense ) .I truly enjoyed the first part of A Discovery of Witches -- the relatable heroine , the university setting , the focus on the history of science . But once the romance got going and we left Oxford , A Discovery of Witches lost its charm . I 'm still curious about the blend of genetics , evolution , and alchemy , but the long sick romance dominated this intriguing mystery and the plot could not hold up against it . I may take a look at the sequel , though , just because I really want to know what 's inside Ashmole 782 .	-1
I just could n't get into the story or the couple . Nothing about it reeled me in . First half of the book was painfully boring . That 's a big chunk for an almost 600 page book .	-1
Wish I 'd read some of the other reviews before I read the book . It 's an adult version of the popular overheated teenage vampire romances . And somehow I missed that this was Book One of a trilogy . My library copy had tape over that part of the sleeve . I grew suspicious when I was past page 500 and they were n't even close to wrapping it up . Sure enough , I discovered that the nearly 600 pages were spent introducing the characters and laying the foundation for an actual plot , which I assume will occur in Book Two.Agreeing with the other reviewers ' comments about the attention to detail paid to mundane and repetitive events such as picking out clothes or practicing yoga , I also loved the over-dramatization of Diana 's and Matthew 's conversations . Every time he said some trivial thing she did n't like , she became `` furious '' with him , then switched back to lovey-dovey as soon as Matthew made some conciliatory gesture . Pretty teenager-ish for 35 and 1500 year old adults.Another howler is Diana 's rescue from a kidnapping , imprisonment and beating ( which , at that point , I actually enjoyed reading about ) . Her rescuers simply discuss it for a minute , pick a location out of thin air , and race there to free her.This book falls solidly into the Women 's Fantasy Literature category , with a protagonist who is smart , pretty , accomplished , snags a hunky boyfriend , and who stands to inherit ( if he dies , which is difficult but not impossible ) one third of what he owns , which is pretty much one third of everything on planet Earth.If that 's your thing , I guess this is a workmanlike example of the genre . If you are looking for something with the same literary and creative possibilities as something like `` Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell '' , keep looking .	-1
I read quite a bit of sci fi and fantasy and do n't often dislike books . After the first few chapters I had to force myself though to the end . I kept thinking it would get better , something 's got to give ... nope . Contrived , boring , and pretentious . Skip it . Read Night Circus instead .	-1
I have read every Richard Jury novel and always look forward to new ones . I read Cold Flat Junction ( though not Belle Ruin ) and found it to be atmospheric . I obtained a copy of Fadeaway Girl on CD to listen to while I traveled , and yes , this one is also atmospheric , and yes , the descriptions and characters are distinctively drawn . I particularly liked the descriptions of the meals that Emma 's mother prepares . But I have to say , I listened for over nine hours to this book and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen . There is much fluff and detail added in with the presumed intent of fleshing out characters , but there is really no action to speak of . I kept thinking while I drove , `` Get on with it ! '' I 'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in this latest venture of one of my favorite authors . Ms. Grimes spends a lot of time in the book talking about writer 's block and I can only assume she had it here .	-1
This is a great book , but the Signet version is a disgrace to Twain 's memory -- cheap paper , messy undersized print , and narrow margins all make reading it torture.Do yourself a favor and buy the Modern Library version instead : The Innocents Abroad : or , The New Pilgrims ' Progress ( Modern Library Classics ) . You 'll end up buying it anyway .	-1
It started with a great plot ... until he actually wrote it . It was overwritten ( it takes pages before something happens ) and the protagonists were hard to like . Boring , sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose . There are a couple twists , but the main characters are such morons , it underscores the little action that does happen .	-1
Moses Herzog is a middle-aged man who left his wife and a son a few years back to marry a woman half his age . So far so good . Now at some point this young woman dumps Herzog to marry one of his friends . Surprise , surprise . Or is it really ? One way or another , Herzog gets so upset by this unfortunate turn of events that he uses the word `` bitch '' 28 times on some 400 pages of this book . He 's close to nervous breakdown , yes , all 400 pages.Still Herzog has a girlfriend , Ramona , who 's willing to comfort him in his abject desperation . He does accept her favors , albeit grudgingly : he suspects that she has matrimonial intentions . Otherwise he respects her a lot , especially her intellect : `` Actually she was far from stupid . She had fine eyes , a bosom , good legs . '' Further on he adds : `` She was a clever woman and , even better , a dear woman . She had a good heart . And she had on black lace underpants . He knew she did . '' Another thing Herzog likes about Ramona is her culinary skills . He likes it so much that he mentions shrimps Arnaud she cooks 4 ( four ! ) times , and as if this is not enough he mentions three more times shrimp remoulade.Herzog ( or is it Saul Bellow ? ) knows a thing or two about good life in general . For instance a few times in the book he mentions bone china in the sentences like this : `` She took the plate , good bone china with a cobalt rim ( the steady spread of luxury into all ranks of society since the fifteenth century , noted by the famous Sombart , inter alia ) . '' This way the reader learns that Herzog/Bellow read Sombart and knows some Latin . That 's why he would n't say `` among other things '' in plain English instead of Latin inter alia.On the back cover of this edition of `` Herzog '' there 's a quote from Chicago Tribune , where Bellow 's prose is compared with that of Tolstoy . There 's a lot of dialog in French in `` War and Peace '' . In `` Herzog '' there 's a lot of text in French too . Russian aristocracy spoke French better than Russian in the beginning of XIX century , which is why Tolstoy used so much French in his book . I 'm not sure whether in New York in the mid XX century Jewish population was so fluent in French though . Even if the protagonist is fluent in French , is it a good enough reason to put whole sentences in that language in the book about a middle-aged Jew on New York circa 1960 ? I gave two stars to this book rather than one only because there 's a chapter about Herzog being accidentally present in a courtroom listening to some random proceedings , which gives the reader vivid details of life in New York during those years . Otherwise the book is quite boring , the main character does n't evoke any feelings - neither empathy nor indignation . Lots of space is spent on descriptions of Herzog 's house qualities and state of repairs . I do n't know what interest it can represent for an average reader , for me it represented none.Herzog loves his children , but he hates the mother of one child and is indifferent to the mother of another one . He loves his brothers and is fond of other members of his family , he describes his childhood , his family life in New York ; but Jewish family life in America has been described so many times that in `` Herzog '' it reads as a commonplace . To me this side of the book is significantly weaker than , for instance , respective sections of `` The American Pastoral '' by Roth.Herzog is an educated man , he 's an academic , a university professor and a writer . Bellow goes to great lengths to prove that . The whole book is interspersed with the notes and letter Herzog writes in his depression/desperation to anybody and everybody , to his friends and acquaintances , to ancient and contemporary writers and philosophers . But those letters essentially do n't rise above the level of pop-philosophy.For instance when writing to Erwin Schrodinger Herzog dwells upon the apparent contradiction between humans being the only animals , reluctant ( according to Schrodinger ) to inflict pain , and at the same time ( again according to Schrodinger ) compelled to `` suck what it needs from its environment , attracting a negative stream of entropy , ... To bite , to swallow . At the same time to pity your food . To have sentiment . ... And even pious old women who trod the path of ancient duty , still , buying kosher meat . '' Similarly designed to appear deep , but in fact shallow and superficial are other Herzog 's notes , and many great people and events mentioned throughout the book look more like name-dropping designed to impress the reader with Herzog 's ( or Bellow 's ? intellectual prowess .	-1
When I was a kid I really liked Fire Bringer by David Clement-Davies , and thought I 'd give The Sight a try as it 's in a similar vein . Bad call on my part -- it 's simplistically written and all but I could n't get even 60 % of the way through with any enjoyment . It 's like he did n't even try . Seriously .	-1
I have tried for a long time to like Stephen King ... starting quite a few books ( simply because all my friends read him ) and seldom finishing them . This was no exception . I guess this simply is n't my cup-of-tea style of book , although I assume he is a good writer .	-1
Reviewing `` Eats , Shoots , & Leaves '' in The New Yorker , one of the world 's most carefully edited literary magazines , Louis Menand notes that the first punctuation error in this book `` appears in the dedication , where a nonrestrictive clause is not preceded by a comma . It is a wild ride downhill from there . '' The rest of Menand 's article proceeds to tear Lynee Truss a new one , pointing out dozens of unforgivable grammar mistakes . To top it all off , Gotham Books chose not to make any changes to the American edition of this British book . We all know that British English is a horse of a different colour and follows slightly different `` rules '' . It sure takes guts for a book like this to advocate the intolerance of grammar gaffes .	-1
Lynne Truss spends an interminable amount of the reader 's time grousing about misplaced apostrophes , but scattered throughout her book are misplaced quote marks , one of my pet peeves . I had to tie my hand behind my back to keep from transposing them with a pencil . Why did n't the publisher also produce a book for American readers ? I understand the book has sold well , so it could n't have been for monetary reasons.Maybe it 's sort of a snobby thing like Alex Trebek 's penchant for misplaced quote marks in the Jeopardy answers . People used to write to him about it ; he made it very clear to his audience that he was n't changing them . Apparently , people have given up because he does n't mention it anymore.For a superb critique of this book , read the one that appeared in the New Yorker . I did , and I learned more about punctuation than Lynne Truss knows .	-1
Not sure why this book has 2 different posts for reviews.This is one of my mom 's favorite authors . I am 44 & we do n't really have the same taste in books . I keep trying to give this author a chance because my mom loves her so much . Do n't get me wrong I would love to see the landscape that she describes so beautifully in this book . I 'm sure this Greek seaside village is beautiful . The characters in the book I could n't connect with . I was totally bored & waiting for Adonis to show up - yes , that is really his name.I ca n't stand to not finish a book & frankly I am glad this one is over so I can start another one .	-1
Alexander Hamilton , Ron Chernow [ 1949- ] ; The Penguin Press ( 2004 hardcover ) '' Deletion can be as important & useful [ in the editing of films ] as intensification , & is much more common . A frequently encountered fault in all scripts , good & bad , is overwriting . The cure is obvious : Surgery . '' -- - Edward Dmytryk , Film Director [ 1908-1999 ] Chernow 's verbosity is equal to Hamilton 's tenacity.Many promising horses start out on the Derby Trail , but few make it to Kentucky on the First Saturday in May . So fared `` Alexander Hamilton . `` I made it to page 201 , which would be right around the time of the Florida Derby in Hallandale , & then reshelved the book for future use as a reference book.The revised & eventual goal is to read James Flexnor 's `` The Young Hamilton '' & `` Washington : The Indispensible Man . ''	-1
The book is quite well written . However the author seems to struggle with a massive Oedipus complex of his own . He includes six father characters in the book . Four of them are evil and the remaining two just non-understanding and mostly useless . Not a single 'good father ' to see anywhere ...	-1
In the end , the reader is left wondering why the Who , What , Where , When is not complemented with the longed-for Why . Namely , why a book that slams to a dead-end ? Fuller attempts unsuccessfully ( as an afterthought ? ) to depict herself as someone much in need of `` closure '' ( not her term ) with respect to her white-colonial childhood in war-torn Zimbabwe , and in so doing is overly obtuse in sporadic representations of empathy with ruined lives , black and white . Her stylish , semi-metaphorical descriptions of African ambiance too often seem detached from larger literary purpose , amounting on the whole to high-flown travelogue . The impulsiveness of her travels with a psychically ( pre ? ) -damaged war veteran leads her , and us , nowhere except to disgruntling uncertainties about her , the narrator . Irresolution , multifariously manifested , unfortunately scribbles the book .	-1
I checked this book out of the library , hoping , like many other people , that it would be of the same caliber as the Bridget Jones novels . I was extremely diappointed . The character of Olivia Joules is like cardboard , a cheap imitation of BJ . While there were some funny moments , I found the entire story line way too implausable , and a plot that seemed like it should have been in the movies . I felt as though Helen Fielding catered entirely too much to the Al Queda theme which has appeared lately in fiction and movies . In this , she looses her originality .	-1
It seems to me that most reviews are positive - usually written by readers who enjoyed the book . Therefore I 'm not suprised that `` Uprising '' has four stars.However , this book was truly bad . I was hoping to read a detailed history of a little-known event . Instead this book is a overly lenghty diatribe about valiant Poles being betrayed by , well , everyone else . Davies loses all pretense at objectivity , and in an amazingly juvenile fashion persistenly substitutes the phrase `` the first Ally '' for the word `` Polish ; '' as in `` the First Ally 's tanks ... '' Anyone hoping to actually learn much about the Warsaw uprising will be very disappointed .	-1
The best thing about this book is Max Beerbohm 's jacket caricature . Downhill after that.Novels about writers are really only possible when dealing with frauds like Hemingway or Fitzgerald whose non-cerebral off-hour roisterings provide the raw material of fiction . Mr. Lodge serves up , in a somewhat different sauce , much the same gray fleshed entr & eacute ; e earlier sauteed by Coim Toibin in `` The Master '' . ( The main difference seems to be Lodge 's ambivalence as to HJ 's sexuality vs. Toibin 's certainties . ) James was reportedly a charming fellow , a great get for fashionable hostesses , witty , urbane , -- none of which travels well in these works.Unlike his contemporary Oscar Wilde , he was neither given to quotable epigram nor offered up to popular tragedy . And it really does n't matter whether Lodge 's handling is masterful or several pitches too journalese , or whatever . HJ is the Edsel of fictive persons . `` Caviar to the general '' may be a lugubrious summing up of a writer 's life , but it is hardly the makings of anyone else 's care.Reading this book is like watching the Congressional Testimony of Alan Greenspan dry on the hearing room carpet .	-1
I am still in somewhat of a 'drunken daze ' from reading this book . The writing style alone made me dizzy- she jumps all over the place ! This book is upsetting because Koren blames everyone but herself for her destructive drinking . Drinking is a choice we make . We are responsible for our actions . No one forces us to consume alcohol in the amounts Koren CHOSE to . I cant feel sorry for her , nor do I think her story is a good one . She continued to abuse herself and put herself in horrible situations because she convinced herself that she could n't do anything without her `` first love '' alcohol . This in and of itself is a huge problem- a DRINKING problem , not just someone who binge drinks . She makes so many generalizations about people its unreal . Like this is what all sorority girls do , or the pretty girls or the girls on the cheerleading squad..etc etc . No one forced her to do anything . I hope that with time she will realize its not healthy to be angry @ everyone else ( referring specifically to the end of the book where she lists whom she is angry at concerning drinking ) and be happy with herself as an independent strong woman . I was extremely let down with this book and this is why I am of the opinion I did waste my time and money .	-1
I tried , I really did . I read the first chapter and learned something I had n't realized before : Jeffrey Sachs saved the world.Okay , I was a little biased starting out in the first place , because I had heard unfavorable comments about him since I was a young woman . But as soon as I started , the book became almost unbearably arrogant.I respect Jeffrey Sachs . I really do . He 's done some interesting things in his life . But I have seen for myself that his influence has impacted several aid agencies very negatively.I was traveling in southern Ghana a few years ago , and a woman that was the head of a branch of a worldwide NGO in that area described to me and other people in my group how Jeffrey Sachs had `` helped '' them , by creating deadlines that were n't achievable , and by creating top-down goals that were frankly ridiculous . I witnessed community centres that were being abandoned because of Sachs ' misadvice.So please , when you read this book , be critical to his ideas . Be open to people that disagree with him . Take into account how his theories have affected the people of the world , especially the people of Latin America or Eastern Europe . A person to read to get a more rounded outlook might be William Easterly . He has some interesting comments , although is sometimes equally frustrating . I 'm sure there are others . If you want a balanced view , read more than Jeffrey Sachs .	-1
Having read the first volume of Pelikan 's history of Christianity , which I thought was the best account of the early Church which I 've ever come across , I had great expectations for this book . But , like a previous reviewer , I really still do n't know what this book is `` about '' . Obviously , the subject is the Bible , but it 's not a history , it 's not a literary criticism , it 's not an examination of its authorship , development , compilation or historicity , or at least not in any depth . Pelikan gives mention to a thousand different subjects and obliquely alludes to a thousand more , but_never_expands on any , even superficially . It seems like the whole point of this scattershot book was to tell us that # 1- The Jews refer to their Bible as the `` Tanakh '' , not the `` Old Testament '' and # 2- the Bible has been a very influential book through the ages . Well gee , thanks a lot for the news flash . Do n't waste your time on this book . You 're not going to learn anything new , if you even have an elementary knowledge of the Bible .	-1
I got this book because I liked Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil . This book should have been titled `` What I did on my vacation in Venice '' . I have a rule to give up on a book after 100 pages but I broke my own rule because I kept thinking the book was going somewhere . It was n't . It was like Midnight in that it gave you lots of side events in Venice but in Midnight there was an overarching crime . There was an attempt in this book to make the burning of the Fenice Opera House a similar overarching theme but it really was n't nearly as interesting . I should have given up after 100 pages ... ... ... ...	-1
Being an opera singer myself the La Fenice fire was a topic that was compelling for me . I had also recently visited Venice and the newly restored La Fenice so it was high on my list of books to read . What 's more I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil . So what was stopping this book from becoming an unputdownable adventure ? It seemed to me that Berendt simply ran out of ideas . What we ended up with was a boring litany of squabbles amongst a pack of mad rich socialites who are n't interesting and who , for the most part , are n't even Venetian.I stayed to the end just out of curiosity - to find out the end of the La Fenice story - but was quite relieved when I finally reached the last page .	-1
The plotline for this book had such great potential but it was lost in plodding , boring details rather than character development . I was disappointed at the way it dragged on and I found myself skipping over big chunks of the story because they were completely unnecessary . The endless comparisons between photography and life had me saying out loud , `` All right , already ! ! I get it ! ! '' Too bad it took too long to get to a rather unsatisfying conclusion .	-1
A doctor makes a life-altering decision at the time of his twins ' births , and everyone in his life ever after pays a hefty psychological price for it , including himself . The subtitle of this story might have been : `` Oh , what a tangled web we weave ... '' This is a story of people who are supposed to be more than reasonably intelligent who make some pretty questionable life choices.Perhaps it was because I was , from the very outset of the book , unable to get my head around this doctor 's MONUMENTAL split-second decision -- the one that catapults and sets in motion all other events in this novel -- that I felt kind of adrift throughout this story . I could relate to NO ONE in this plot . I could n't understand behaviors of ANY of the principal characters , except possibly daughter Phoebe , and I found the exceptional circumstances that befell and surrounded this eclectic group of people to be far-fetched . This is a novel populated by a cast of utterly unhappy , alienated people . I continued to the end , certain there would be a redemptive factor of the sort that one comes to expect in a piece of literature that casts such a web of unrelenting human angst . However , I found none . In my opinion , this work is long on complication and short on believability . I ca n't honestly say that it 's a bad read , but it 's one that does n't hold up too well under common-sense scrutiny .	-1
I read the back of the book and thought the story would grip me . I have a daughter with Down Syndrome , and this was the first work of fiction I 'd seen with DS playing such a significant role . It 's hard to say where the book went wrong exactly , but somewhere along the line the book lost wind until it finally came to a stop.Edwards does a good job at giving depth to her characters , all except Phoebe . Edwards treats Phoebe like a subject , like an inanimate object , and not like the person she is . She gives thoughts and feelings to every other character except Phoebe . The book does tell of parallel stories , David 's life after he gives Phoebe away and Caroline 's life raising Phoebe , but somewhere along the line Edwards minimizes Caroline 's and Phoebe 's role in the story . She chooses instead to focus on the rapidly unraveling lives of David , Nora and Paul , until she brings Caroline and Phoebe to wrap it all up in a nice neat little package.I thought the plot , and the story line itself was great , and could have been great in the hands of a more experienced and talented author . Her redundant use of analogy was quickly annoying . Far too many mentions of water , warmth , weight , quicksilver , etc ... I found myself skimming through the majority of the narrative just trying to get to the dialogue . There were too many subplots to be contained in such a short book . Her use of quick fixes to fill plot holes took away from it 's spirit . I do n't want to give too much away , but the way some things just sort of `` happend '' in a way to keep it from being complicated ( Doro giving the house the Caroline ... .who does that ? really now ? ) The book does have some good points . Edwards managed to perfectly illustrate Caroline 's frustration with the challenge of raising a child with Down Syndrome . The fear of letting Phoebe go , the exhaustion of keeping her , the constant fight to pave a road in society for a child that society did n't want . Had she included more of that instead of some other sub-plot ( Rosemary and Jack for instance ) I think it would have given a bit more to the story.All in all it was a decent read , for what it was . It took a long time for me to finish just because I kept getting annoyed with her overly feminine attention to ridiculous detail , or just with the constant idea of someone not wanting their child just because she had an extra chromosome . Other than that it was alright .	-1
I could not put this book down ! Yet , for all of that , once I finished it , I felt cheated and DEEPLY saddened . The only happy part of the book is Phoebe . Everything else is just ... sad . And there are a couple of plot twists that I ca n't stomach , either because they take away from the story or because they make no sense . I ca n't say anything more without spoilers , so I wo n't ; but I did not like this book very much and I do not recommend it .	-1
This book inspires about as much sorrow and pathos as a freshly dead fish . That is to say , some -- but not a lot . The introduction was elegant and spare , leaving me curious about the outcome of the good doctor 's deception ; the book then descends into an extended whining period . Edwards feels it necessary to connect every little bump in a 20 year marriage to the initial lie , which the couple never recovers from . Ostensibly this is because it was never admitted , but after years of marriage ( and what feels like years of reading ) it just is n't believable.The inclusion of Downs ' syndrome in this book was just the first in a serious of pitiful attempts by the author to be current or meaningful . Her actual portrayal of Phoebe , the young lady with Downs , makes me wonder if she 's ever spoken with a person dealing with this condition . Phoebe is described in the most glowing and romantic of terms ( never is she seen to have tantrums or irritate her surrogate mother , Caroline ) . Her interests ? A cat . A husband . She 's honestly as flat a character as I 've ever encountered . I suspect that Edwards wanted to be edgy by including her , but was too afraid of offending people who actually deal with Downs and so neglected to make Phoebe a real human character rather than a two dimensional saint.The women 's lib subplot in this book is also painfully weak . Early on we see Norah 's beautiful sister Bree doing all the things Norah wants to do ; participating in protests , taking lovers , looking sexy . Then later in the book , with no explaination , Bree has found religion and started dressing conservatively . What 's the lesson here ? Even Norah asks Bree what 's going on , and Bree replies evasively . It 's like Edwards realized that her readers would wonder what was going on -- and decided that she did n't feel like telling ! Just as grating was Norah 's sudden and inexplicable religious experience . Why does Bree ( of all people ) take her to some random monastary ? She does n't have any believable conversion or history with the church ( besides remembering how great those ladies were that brought her caseroles when she was pregnant ) . And yet , she ends up remarrying the convenient french guy at the church . Fishy . I think that Edwards would like to have us believe that with maturity comes religion , but she in no way supports that . Forcing your heretofore secular characters to drop everything and head for chuch is not good writing by any stretch of the imagination.Of course , most of the deus ex machina resolutions in this book force radical and unpleasant stretches of the imagination : David 's unlikely death ( not even directly narrated -- told as a memory ! ) , Caroline 's odd and timely visit JUST as Norah is cleaning out the house , son Paul 's sudden impulse to drop classical music for pop because he 's `` not angry anymore '' ... it 's all so unbelievable.In the middle of this book I had the strange impression that I 'd stumbled upon Edward 's personal statement . David , as a photographer , has had enough success that he 's on display in a prominent museum . An art historian approaches him and asks about his theories , why he photographs what he does . His response : `` I do n't operate by theories . I just photograph what pleases me . '' That is certainly not David talking . His character is meticulous and studious , certainly able to discuss an intelligent question without blowing off his critics with a washout answer like that . So whose answer is that , voiced through the hijacked character ? It 's Kim Edwards . I 'm sorry , Kim , but I 'm going to have to agree with that critic . You can pull some sentimental strings , but it 's not going to exempt you from the need for good solid plot construction . No one , not even you , can live outside of theory .	-1
I know this puts me in the minority , but I could n't stand this book . It 's full of long-suffering people in a long-suffering environment , and it requires a long-suffering time to get to the end of their plight .	-1
I agree with all of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book . What I had hoped for was a final visit to Mitford with stories about all my favorite characters and a nice tying up of loose ends . Instead we are introduced to a myriad of new characters who are n't very interesting especially as this is the final book in the series and their stories will go no further . What was Ms. Karon thinking ? I wanted so much for the final book in the Mitford series to be about Mitford ! Definitely wait and get this book from the library - its not worth adding to your Mitford collection .	-1

The full title of this book is `` The Singularity Is Near : When Humans Transcend Biology , '' and like its title , the book is verbose and very , very speculative . I know , I know . What should I expect from futurist Ray Kurzweil other than futuristic foo from the future ? How about a book with a coherent structure ? How about a book that does n't repeat its fundamental premises multiple times in each chapter ? Maybe a book that leaves out a few unsupported theoretical assumptions stated as foregone conclusions ? Singularity has a few fascinating passages , some really interesting ideas , and a collection of delightfully eclectic quotes . Sadly , all the good stuff is surrounded by a repetitious screed with nearly as much substance in the footnotes as in the text.Kurzweil starts off on the wrong foot with some wrong predictions for technological advances to appear `` by the end of the decade . '' Given that the book was published in 2005 , and as I write this it is 2011 , we should be able to fact-check some of these predictions . `` We will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence with supercomputers ... '' Nope . `` Computers ... will become essentially invisible : woven into our clothing , embedded in our furniture and environment ... '' Nuh uh . Yes , lots of smart devices exist now , but wearable computing turned into the smartphone , and pervasive computing is n't all that pervasive . There 's also a claim that the Web will become the `` worldwide mesh ... once all of its linked devices become communicating web servers ... . '' The only real approximation of this is botnets , created with malware and harnessed by malcontents . While a few impressive networked computing projects currently exist , most folks still do n't give up their CPU 's background cycles to anything productive.After a rocky start predicting the near future , how are we expected to follow along as Kurzweil turns us into plugged-in cyborgs with nanobot blood who can merge and reform our identities at will ? One example : virtual reality . Over and over again we are reminded that we will soon be using fully immersive virtual reality . `` By early in the 2nd decade of this century '' we will have fully immersive 3D environments beamed into our eyeballs , and shortly thereafter we will be plugged in using devices that directly stimulate our sense centers in the brain . But who is going to build these environments ? Are we doomed to socialize using virtual meeting places as bizarre as Second Life , furries and ambulatory vegetation and penises everywhere you look , only with more fidelity than we can currently imagine and plugged in to our brains ? Who wants that ? There 's a lot more way-out-there stuff I could bring up from the book , but that 's really not its worst failing . The thing that bothered me most about it was the repetition . It 's almost as though Kurzweil at some point abandoned a reasoned thesis for truth by repetition . He goes on and on again and again about how we will know the brain 's inmost secrets , and how nanobots will solve ecological problems , and how superintelligent sentient machines will treat us wetware humans with respect and care . It 's all very Pollyanna , and in some cases more than a little disturbing . Kurzweil 's vision of the ultimate goal of humanity is a nanobot swarm with superintelligent AI flying at near the speed of light and colonizing wherever it lands without regard for existing life of any kind . If that 's my future , I want out .	-1
I 'm probably the only person in the world that feels this way , but I was not impressed with this book . Despite the stories being interrelated , they felt disjoined and random . There was no central plot that I could find to make the book a success in my mind .	-1
This book was a big disappointment . As a fully persuaded atheist , the title of the book intrigued me but the substance just was n't there . It begins with about a hundred pages of rambling where he ponders out loud endlessly about whether he should actually get to the point and then when he does he pretty much just re-states what is already well known and obvious to most reflective people in his own tedious , circumlocutious way and offers us precious little insight or interesting discussion . I think the rave reviews from readers here just reflects how desperate we secularists are for a voice to dispell religious delusions even where it falls far short of the mark of good work . This book desperately needed an infusion of substance , a good team of editors and some substantial re-writes . I have heard Dennett lecture before and been well impressed . Maybe he 's just a poor writer . At any rate , reading this book was pretty much a waste of time .	-1
I usually do n't just read a book ; I devour it , and one of this size usually requires a second highlighter and more blank pages than usually allotted at the back for my own index of quotable quotes . Alas , nothing memorable emerged from this exercise in self-indulgent wit . I 'm completely sympathetic with the author 's view of natural religion , but if I found this a burdensome , dreary read , I doubt any religious devotee would waste their precious time considering his argument . I have read previous work by Dennett that I thoroughly enjoyed . He must have been under his own spell when he wrote this monologue . If you are contemplating this one , put on the brakes and save your money and time .	-1
Apart from the section on Shannon , who is not covered well by others , I found very little to recommend this book . Much of the material is popularized elsewhere and Seife is not a compelling writer who can clarify concepts . I remain to be convinced that conceits equating the universe with a giant quantum computer really enhance our understanding of the universe , or its contents . Particularly as we still have no idea what 96 % of the universe is made of ( dark matter ) ! ! ! In essence , saying that information explains everything is rather like saying language is made up of words that have to be in specific patterns to make sense ... a worthless tautology that sounds great but whose information content is zero .	-1
I was very turned off that the woman walked out on her marriage . Maybe if she had tried to `` find herself '' spiritually before she considered leaving her husband , I would have been more sympathetic . Basically , it looked like she traveled around the world , ate a lot of food , vegetated in India and then shacked up with a Himbo guy . Notice that relationship does n't last , either . She does n't seem to have learned much about commitment ! Maybe she 's taking her cues from Hollywood.Really do n't see the appeal of this book and have no interest in watching the movie .	-1
I really wanted to like this book , but I gave up at the end of the India section . Italy section was enjoyable , but the author 's whining , crying , and unending self-exploration did me in . I wish I had not bought this book .	-1
I am baffled as to how so many people can rave about this book . In my assessment , it was simply an account of a highly neurotic woman dealing with a divorce . And she finally pulls herself together at the end , when she finds another relationship . The only pleasure I got out of the book was following a fantasy of traveling for a year , with no apparent financial concerns .	-1
I was interested in reading this book because someone told me it changed her life . It changed my life too , because now I have resolved not to ever read this author again . She is a talented writer , but the level of self-involvement and navel-gazing in this book is not to be believed . No matter how the author dresses it up , my take on her novel is that she dumped her husband , was dumped by her subsequent boyfriend , then embarked on a world trek to find another man . Once that mission was accomplished , her `` spiritual journey '' ended and she came right home . The longer I read the novel , the less I liked it , and my sentiment as I closed the book was , who cares ?	-1
this novel was given me to read by a friend who lives in Bali . It has had its ' share of bad reviews , and I am afraid , I 'm going to add another . Although she writes reasonably well , I found that the main effect of this book was to make me want to give this woman a slap ! She was 'happily married ' and had a husband and a dog . Fair enough . The marriage broke up , also fair enough , but she casts herself as the good guy by giving the ex all her money . Not once does she mention the dog ! It may seem a little thing , but it sets the tone for the book as she swans around , first , Italy , where she eats a lot and learns Italian . This was the best part of the book actually . Then onto India , where people only merit a mention if they are in some way 'spiritual ' . Never mind the worse than grinding poverty , our plucky , adventurous lady writer is n't actually going to dirty her hands . Though she did wash a floor once ... sigh ! Why ca n't these writers ever connect with God in their own city ? And so , onto Indonesia , where she finds love . Not hard to do over there , where new agers flock like mosquitos and are usually white , European and loaded . they also usually get chronically ripped off by the locals , but that does n't make for an exotic story ... I have the feeling that this book is going to - if it has n't already - generate a million dollar industry in lectures and workshops on how to 'eat , pray , love . ' Spiritual - not .	-1
I have to agree with the reviewers who said they were n't wowed by this book . It was recommended to me by two friends who claimed it was the best book they read all year but I knew I was going to be disappointed as soon as the author said she would n't discuss the reasons for her marital unhappiness and eagerness to rid herself of her husband and , without taking a cleansing breath , fall into the arms of another lover . When he could n't abide her neediness ( which she described in the book 's best line as `` somewhere between a golden retriever and a barnacle '' ) , she took her publisher 's advance and went off to find God.So Ms. Gilbert went to Italy and ate lots of pasta . So she went to an ashram in India and learned to meditate . So she went to Bali , hit up all her friends back home to raise $ 18,000 in seven days so her healer friend could buy a house ( which only made me think about how many starving children could have had school supplies in seven days ) , and found an older lover who , knowing which buttons to push , apparently allowed her to end her spiritual journey by finding good sex.I have to wonder about those readers who found the author 's search for God enlightening and life-changing . What makes them ( or the author ) think the meditation-induced trances were conversations with God ? Maybe they were nothing more than simple states of mental serenity . Maybe they have more issues than any book can meet . I think the publisher who expected a travel book was robbed but those readers who enjoy this kind of thing are making the publisher loads of money anyway .	-1
I really tried to get into this book , but I agree with the 400+ other 1 star ratings that the character is all about herself and woo is me . Let 's get the Klennex out and cry some more . The book was depressing , all about herself and did n't really care about anything else . I had no empathy for the dear women even after she listed her various anti-depression drugs . I 've been in a depressed state at one point in my left and I certainly did n't leave my family and run off to Italy and the likes ! Stay home and deal with it ! I did n't find the book have any spirituality value AT ALL . The movie had better find some quality plot or it will be a flop too .	-1
I really tried to like this book and literally gave up half way through . Although the author is a decent *writer* , her insights were like reading the thoughts of a college student . Maybe it was because I read `` Eat , Pray , Love '' immediately after reading `` Three Cups of Tea '' , but I could n't suppress my irritation over someone who had a great life , some problems , and presented her story as if it was an epic journey . I guess you either identify with the author and love the book , or find her whiny and self-absorbed and dislike the book .	-1
I thought this book would be good because it was made into a movie . That is not the case . I could not even finish this book it was so bad . I usually can read any type of books . I even gave it to a friend to read and she could not get through it either . I did n't even bother with the sequel to it . Not worth the money .	-1
I belong to a book club of 15 highly educated women . We picked this book based on publishers ' reviews . We can not comprehend how it got such great reviews . With the exception of one group member , all of us thought the book was shallow , contrived and irritating . We did not find the author likable . None of us would ever want to take a trip with her because of her endless chatter . She did not illicit sympathy from the group , we think because she just was n't real . She skidded on the surface with little depth of feelings . Her story might have been more believable if we had n't known about her $ 200,000 advance to write the book . It seems the money was her real motivation , and not to honestly share her journey . We gave it 14 thumbs down , 1 thumb up .	-1
Ms. Gilbert comes across as a most self-absorbed , egocentric person and , beyond this , expects the rest of the world to coo and cluck in pity . Here 's a thought : perhaps she should have volunteered with the Peace Corps , Habitat for Humanity , or the International Red Cross . Perhaps this would have lifted her out of her wallowing self-pity and benefited the truly desperate . But wait - of course not . She would never have been advanced the big bucks from her publisher to finance a soujourn in the slums . How I wish I 'd contributed the price of this book to charity , instead ... especially since I could not force myself to finish it .	-1
At first , I was excited by The Omnivore 's Dilemma , although aware that it was sparse on numbers and analysis . That 's journalism for you . The reporting is a quick and easy read that held my interest while bashing things I did n't like and holding out hope for a better food system that would still give us access to tastey meats and fresh veggies.However , as I read through to the end of the book , my annoyance with Pollan -- writing from the perspective of a rationalist and ecologist -- over his off-hand but serious references to notions like `` karmic debt '' combined with his inconsistent prose left me thinking I should give the book no more than 3 stars . And after reading some of the other Amazon reviews , I feel the book deserves something more like 1 or 2 stars . While I accept that journalism is intellectually thin , I expect reported `` facts '' to be accurate . If you read through some of these reviews , however , you will find a multidude of relevant criticisms.In Pollan 's defense , many of the negative reviews are people who were n't interested in reading about Pollan 's personal experiences , and these experiences were part of the point of the book . It is a personal account , and such an approach fits perfectly with Pollan 's view of ethics and aesthetics . While all of his hand-wringing over hunting , for example , is laughable for those not confined by his class biases , everyone is confined by biases and Pollan 's attempt to report his own experience is acceptable.Other negative reviews criticize Pollan for lacking depth in addressing problems or not addressing questions that interested the reviewer , such as whether or not it would be easy for corn farmers to switch to something else . But this depth in narrow analysis is not what the book aimed to do . It aimed to give unknowedgeable readers an introduction to a variety of topics related to food by way of first-person investigation . If you are already well versed in economic and ecologic problems of our food supply chain , this book was n't written for you . If you are n't , it may be a fascinating read.But it 's the fact that the book is aimed at the general reader that makes factual problems so gross . If it were a work of fiction , Omnivore 's Dilemma would be absolutely worthless since it relies on revelation for literary impact . It is only as non-fiction that it has value . So , for example , if it is true , as one reviewer claims , that he did the math and that a bushel of corn does not , in fact , contain fewer calories than the petroleum that went into producing it ( as Pollan claims ) , that 's a serious problem for the book . Pollan should have stuck to reporting what he saw rather than quoting analysis , which is n't what the book is , or could be , about.Would I recommend this book ? I guess , yes , but only because I share some of the biases that Pollan does . For example , I think it would be okay if Americans spent a larger proportion of their income on their food , but that 's a personal choice . Like Pollan , my real problem with the beef industry is that I want better beef . In Omnivore 's Dilemma , Pollan tries to put moral spin on our joint preferences , but I ca n't entirely buy it.In the end , I would have to say that Omnivore 's Dilemma is something like food snob porn . If your reservations about fast food are primarily economic or medical and not gustatory , you 're not going to care about this book . On the other hand , if you 're willing to spend your leisure time and expendable cash to improve the quality of your diet , you may find -- as I did -- a wealth of small revelations that make the book a page-turner despite its drawbacks .	-1
Some interesting -but definitely not new- insights into autism , wrapped around a totally implausible mystery that was definitely not `` thrilling ! '' I wish I had n't wasted my precious reading time trying to finish this silliness .	-1
I usually save two stars for books that I feel have isses with the plot or weak characters , etc . I do n't feel that this book had any issues except I found most of it completely boring . It made me want to beat my forhead against things and rock back and forth like Rain Man in an attempt to pay attention to the story . Guess too fancy and historical for my ADHD brain.I picked this book in honor of Banned Book Week so I felt guilty to not finish it , like if I stop somewhere some evil people will start squishing little mewlling kittens and mail me their little furry bodies in a box with a letter saying , `` IT 'S ALL YOUR FAULT ... YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS BUT NOOOOOO . `` I did n't give up on LCL , it kind of read like waves in the ocean . It started off dull , and then it got interesting for a while , then down and back goes the wave of interest . I can understand the reasoning for banning it , all those challenging thoughts on pretty much everything including the certainty and necessity of the Iron Age ... but there is a gianormous amount of whininess that is barely tolerable.It 's very comical to read the description of the sex scenes . First there was the lover that got mad at her for that he had to wait and hold still after he came so she could get off , like it was all her fault . Then her grounds keeper lover 's sexual attraction to her was said as `` his bowels stirred for her '' and his cumming described as an `` evacuating crisis '' ... which kind of sounds like the guy had explosive diarrhea , not sex . Yeah , that 's sexy , lol .	-1
It 's a major drawback for publishers that Amazon 's system links the reviews and promotional material for all versions of a book indiscriminately , so that an old , flawed , bowdlerized , and misleading translation such as this one from 1919 by Hanna Astrup Larsen is allowed to profit from the comments made for the new translation by Tiina Nunnally published by Fjord Press in 1990 . With Fjord 's demise this definitive and superior translation is now available from Penguin Classics -- buy it instead !	-1
I generally enjoy Scandinavian mysteries , could n't get through this one . Read the first 50 pages and gave up . Annoying main character , confusing story-telling , not worth it .	-1
I love to find new authors , and I will look to see what else they have written so that I can enjoy this new storyteller-but , I ca n't with this book . This had been a bookclub pick , so I did n't have a choice in reading this book . It was very hard to get into-seriously-the book got somewhat engaging at around page 300 or so . I felt that it was a step above a `` typical '' bodice-ripping book , but not by much . It was a very `` fluff-filled '' book . It was very easy chick lit and a little to blah for me .	-1
Honest to Pete - Lamott blows it with this book . I quit reading it when I was half way through as I wondered why I was bothering - why continue to be assaulted like this ? Other books by Lamott have been invigorating and fun - this one bashes our President repeatedly ( Ok for a chapter - but in almost every chapter ? ) , flaunts the use of vulgarity ( just because she 's free to do so , does n't mean she should ) , and champions rebellion . Lamott is a smart sassy woman - and I love her and I have enjoyed reading about her jaunty walk with Jesus . But this time around I simply wanted to yell at her `` Oh , Anne , CUT IT OUT ! ''	-1
Suze Ormon 's advice is important to pay attention to , but in my opinion it 's possible to get elswhere in abetter package . If you like Suze 's presentation , fine , but she just seems overly chirpy to me . She 's FAR betterIMHO than Mr. Kiyosaki of the two Dads , or real estatepromoter Robert Allen , for instance , butmy taste runs more to the Dolans , Jane Bryant Quinn , orAndrew Tobias ... .or Benjamin Graham , though he 's far lessentertaining.Do n't spend all you make ! Pay yourself first ! Hey , maybe I should write a book . LoL ...	-1
This is definitely a book you would be advised to pass on . Could not become interested in the characters . Very contrived tale with no hook to hold it together . There are many more interesting tales to read .	-1
It has been quite some time that I read a Dr. Kay Scarpetta novel from Patricia Cornwell . I always looked upon them as exceptionally crafted - with fascinating stories and more importantly - very interesting forensic pathology insights . The books were never boring - and I remember really caring about Dr. Kay , Benton , Marino and Lucy.I just finished this book - and all I can say is WHAT HAPPENED ? # @ ! ! ? The characterization seemed to be all wrong . The dialogue at times was hopeless . There were multiple story arcs opened and never dealt with later . There was a specific instance when a character seemed to attack Dr. Kay - and then 5 pages later - she is back in action - with no explanation at all of what happened . The ending did not make sense - and seemed to be rushed and crammed into the last 2 pages . It seemed obvious to me that whoever edited this manuscript was asleep on the job.Do yourself a favor - if you have never read a Dr. Kay novel - DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK . Go back to some of the first novels in the series - and you will find some stories that are really worth your time and effort .	-1
Predator by Patricia Cornwell is SO BAD that it is hard to know where to start . Just when I thought she could n't possibly get any worse , she proves me wrong , and I have to wonder , is anyone at her publishing house actually reading these things before they rush them to print ? As usual , there is a bad guy who has a personal vendetta against Scarpetta and is intent on ruining her . We 've only seen this in , like , the last ten Scarpetta novels so there 's nothing new here.As usual , we have the idiotic Lucy , the most annoying fictional character ever created , with her typical annoying Lucy angst . This time she 's got angst because she 's got a tumor which , even though it is completely treatable and unfortunately not a real threat to her life , is ruining her oh so perfect physique and is devastating her life . And , of course , she ca n't tell her beloved Aunt Kay about it because she just can't.As usual we have the Benton Wesley and Kay Scarpetta long-simmering feud . She 's mad at him because he did n't tell her about Lucy . He 's mad at her because she 's not there when he needs her . They are both mad at each other . Given that they 've been furious with each other ever since Wesley came back from the dead , I do n't know why they do n't just split -- but if they did , then that would give Scarpetta one less thing to be ticked off about , and she seems to be someone who NEEDS a reason to be permanently ticked off.Oh , and let 's not forget Marino who is still slavering all over Scarpetta . Now he 's actually seeing a shrink who is , of course , jealous of Scarpetta ( is n't everybody ? ) and who tries to pump him for info about her.Somewhere in here , there is a mystery or two , but quite honestly , I could n't tell you what it is or why it happens -- yes , there are dead bodies , including one that has perfectly painted red handprints in suggestive places on the body , but Cornwell is so busy focusing on her sickening little cast of regulars that it 's almost as though every once in a while she remembers that she is supposed to be writing a mystery and tosses a sentence or two about it in there . The end , when it mercifully comes , leaves more questions about the murders unanswered than resolved.As far as I 'm concerned , this is the last Scarpetta book I plan to read . I no longer like nor care for any of the characters -- they 've all become a pathetic rendition of what I suspect might be the way Cornwell sees herself and the people around her . I 'd give it zero stars if that were possible but as it is , it barely deserves the one star I am giving it .	-1
This is not the Patricia Cornwell I 've been reading . The story does n't flow ; the animosity between Scarpetta and Marino is overwhelming . No , I could n't write the story any better but I know Ms. Cornwell can .	-1
If I could give this book zero stars , I would . Cornwell has fallen victim to `` The Cat Who.. '' disease , where the author decides it 's enough to just have familiar characters in the storyline , no matter how weak or badly plotted the storyline.I liked the first books in the Scarpetta series enough , the forensic science was fascinating and while Scarpetta 's character was n't very well defined , she was a good foil for the streetwise Marino . Now the characters have become caricatures of themselves , and Cornwell thinks it 's clever to string the reader along with little clues about how a character has changed ( Lucy gaining weight on her medication , yawn ) .And what is up with changing the voice ? Cornwell used to write in the first-person past tense , and now she 's writing in third-person present tense which is the most annoying tense to use as a writer . It 's very distracting , especially in novels where we 're more interested in action , not clever writing.I 'm glad I borrowed this from the library . I was surprised that it was even available , and now i know why .	-1
I was so disappointed with this book I can barely find the words to describe it . I thought it would be all about what the author did to create the sounds that revolutionized rock and roll recording -- and make no mistake , Geoff Emerick deserves plenty of credit for innovation and fearless experimentation -- but that 's not what we get with this book . Sure , he tells us a few choice details , like how he got Paul 's huge bass sound on `` Rain '' and `` Paperback Writer , '' and how he managed to make John sound like something from your greatest acid trip on `` Tomorrow Never Knows , '' but this book is n't about recording The Beatles so much as it is about slighting everyone Emerick feels did n't treat him with great respect from the word go . The more you read , the more you suspect that even the best intentioned person would become cannon fodder for Emerick 's pen if he did n't smile warmly and say something incredibly kind during their first handshake . The ratio of people he dislikes to those he likes is way out of whack . My theory has always been that anyone who ca n't seem to find anyone to talk about in a positive way is probably the problem himself.Very early in the book Emerick lets us know that George Harrison did n't give him the time of day . Uh oh . He spends the rest of the book mercilessly trashing George with accusations that are certainly easy to make now that George is dead and therefore unavailable to demand a retraction . According the Emerick , George Harrison was a mediocre guitarist at best . Interesting , then , that he should become so influential . Hell , there 's a whole branch of the power pop genre that owes everything to Harrison . But Emerick says he could n't play , so I guess it must be true , right ? Except ... would n't the greatest band in the world have kicked him out if he was n't a killer player who was bringing important stuff to the table ? Ask Pete Best about that . You remember Pete , right ? He was n't good enough to make it to that final rung on the ladder of success , so they brought in Ringo Starr , widely considered the best drummer in Liverpool . Ah , but Emerick does n't like poor Ringo , either . Makes him out to be a shoddy drummer and a blithering idiot who reads comic books and plays checkers because ... well , that 's his level of intellect . He also says he has n't much of a personality . Ringo . The guy who was # 1 on all the best party lists in the 60s becauseAs for John Lennon , well , Emerick seems to have been fascinated by John , and he certainly thought him greatly talented , but he paints a picture of an unpredictable guy who might be gentle or vicious , depending on the mood , and it might be both in the same hour . In short , he got Lennon right . Hey , he had to get SOMETHING right.That leaves Paul , who came up to the little room Emerick was restricted to in the early days and spent his break times talking music , comparing notes on the latest records on the radio . They became friends , and more importantly , Paul showed Emerick mega-respect.The result of all of the above is an entire , long book with repetitive comments belittling George and Ringo , wondering over John and being sentimental about Paul to the point of nearly being romantic . It wears thin very fast . Sometimes it is creepy . And when it gets to the point where you cringe every time he starts to write about a session because you know he 's going to make George out to be a non-musical , hostile , bumbling fool , you start to ask yourself why you 're still reading the book ... and why so many people , people you would have to assume are fans of the band , are giving it five stars .	-1
I am yet another `` Cat Who ... '' fan who found this book to be beyond disappointing and have felt that Braun has not actually been writing the most recent books . If there had to be a ghostwriter then why not hire a cat ? He or she would have worked for kibble and the writing would have been far superior to the shabby efforts of this latest installment . I think the greatest blame should rest on the editor 's shoulders for allowing an established , beloved author to be embarrassed in this way and go out on such a whimpering note .	-1
Unfortunately , the publisher is reduced to using a not very good ghost writer . Mrs. Braun has passed thewriting age , but the publisher ca n't give up those fast-selling titles ! Better just to let the series die a natural death . It was great while it lasted , but no substitute can give us what Mrs. Braun did . We are fortunate to have had so many great books from her .	-1
So - there was a mystery happening somewhere in Moose County , and Qwill had nothing to do with it , but heard about it vaguely once or twice ? Polly moved to Paris with no notice , and a week later Qwill found someone new to take to dinner , no trouble or emotion involved ? The barn burned down thanks to random arson that had nothing to do with what little plot there was ? And Koko and YumYum make the occasional appearance to reinforce their existence , but do little in regards to the story itself ? The side plots took over ! Do n't read this book , it 's just a disappointment .	-1
The only reason I 've given this one star is it 's impossible to give no stars . This book was awful . Thank goodness it was so short - I HAD to finish it to discover if there was any redeeming value to the book . There was n't . Using a previous reviewers words - it 's totally disjointed . The book just does n't make sense .	-1
I have been a avid reader of this author since I firsat read `` The Day of the Jackal '' . Unfortunately since `` The Fist of God '' his writing skills seem to have diminished . His books are shorter and show considerably less skill in plot development . `` The Afghan '' spends and unreaasonable amount of time re-acquainting the reader with Major Martin , wholly wasted . The ending is not one that I would expect from an author of Mr. Forsyth 's reputation.Alas , Mr Forsyth is not alone in showing diminishing talents . W.E.B . Griffin 's latest book , '' The Saboteurs '' was similarly flawed . Maybe the authors are just getting older , and their older readership , myself included , is not as forgiving .	-1
`` Col Mike Martin '' raised in Iraq , speaks fluent arabic ... ... ... The Taliban are Pashtoon , they are not arabs , they do n't speak arabic , they do n't even like arabs very much . They are a totaly closed tribal society . I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province . There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon . The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan , the Tajik and the Hazara , are opposed to the Taliban.Mike Martin would not have the correct family , clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off.Sorry , but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one .	-1
`` The Last Templar '' by Raymond Khoury began with real excitement and a creative early story line . The opening pages were sensational . The `` Templar '' raid on the Metropolitan Museum of Art was a great beginning . Soon , however , it devolved-evolved-dissolved into a sappy , soap opera love story.There are way too many accidental and coincidental events and phenomena to suffer through , the sum of which renders the entire story unbelievable . Coupled with sophomoric writing during those times , these amazing events and good Samaritans save poor Tess and Reilly from their ( and others ' ) stupidity . The two chief antagonists were properly disgusting , and Vance had the added role of providing the anti-Church lectures.The best parts of the book ( in addition to the clever beginning ) are those pages which chronicle the Templar escape from Palestine in 1291 and the subsequent travels , tales and travails of those surviving few men . Khoury unabashedly condemns ( and does his best writing at these points ) the Catholic Church . Those pages are extremely believable . Kudos ! The `` bad guys '' were interesting , but the `` good guys and gals '' were not . In fact , during the core build up of the plot in the first half of the book , I sensed a hint of misogyny , a too-often weird characterization of poor intelligent , educated , working-woman Tess , as `` on the verge of tears , '' when some difficult task or catastrophe faced her , whereas , all the men were always stereotypically macho . But fear not , all the primary characters are all not only seriously flawed humans but make irrational and stupid decisions throughout the story.Be prepared for considerable Templar history and a lot of on-target criticism of Christianity and the `` Church . '' And then , be further prepared for a huge let-down at the end , when once again characters who should know better and have good reason to act forthrightly on what they know and have discovered ( Reilly and Tess ) lose their backbone and once again keep their found truth about Jesus forever unknown to those who should know it . Yuk ! All these right-wing modern day paeans to the establishment in the name of espionage or terrorist novels are enough to drive an intelligent reader crazy ! This novel is sort of a Dirk Pitt adventure ( early Clive Cussler novels ) gone horribly bad . What a shame , because the book starts out like a house on fire ! Just a `` 2 , '' sadly , but not for the reasons of so many outraged Christian reviewers .	-1
Imagine Dan Brown , amidst writing his historical ... ish ... novels tore out all the uninteresting and predictable parts and tossed them on the floor , where they were later collected by migrant birds , who built a nest out of the scraps . Years later , after some of those pages were lost , some editor came back and took the nest and published it.This is how The Last Templar came to be . History proves it . *I unfortunately did not get to read reviews for this book , as I picked it up at the airport in Reno when I had run out of reading materials . I 'm a sucker for medieval storytelling , so what the heck.Man , what a mistake . The book 's biggest problem is straightforward , cookie-cutter characters . Characters like this then lend to trite , hackneyed dialogue.The premise of the book is this : Four masked men steal a strange Vatican artifact while it is on displayed at the Met . This leads an investigator ... a beaten-down , Catholic-background , trying-to-do-the-right-thing investigator ( a Bruce Willis character if there ever was one ) ... to team up with a girl-power , know-it-all , secular archaeologist to hunt down this artifact . The fate of the Catholic church ( and the world , the book assumes ) hangs in the balance . Every cliche character the author can manage is squeezed in , including the power-hungry Catholic official and the old man wronged by the church who 's back with a vengeance.The story manages to be both boring and straightforward . Pretty much every event happens as you would expect it . The dialogue is awful . Sentences are broken up to be dramatic . Like this . It 's as if the author wanted a Law & Order dun-dun after every chapter ( which just happen to be modeled after Dan Brown 's two-page , oh-you're-reading-so-much chapters ) . Want some examples ? `` Sitting in the second boat , watching them with a look of muted delight . . . was William Vance.He was cradling a shotgun. '' . . . . .DUN-DUN -- - '' There in front of her was a brick wall.It was a dead end. '' . . . . .DUN-DUNSo we come to the worst part of the book : the MOST formulaic , the MOST smug , the most oversimplified . I 'm about to ruin the story , but I 'm saving you $ 12 and a world of literary hurt . The female protagonist finds the artifact that could dismantle the entire Catholic church . But ... she was just rescued by these kind islanders , who happen to be ... Catholic . They also happen to be poor fishermen who live on an island with their kindly , gentle fishermen wives . They are the only characters in the book who do n't speak English , and they attend a whitewashed , homely cathedral from centuries past . I swear I am not making this part of the story up.So when the main character gets her chance to reveal the Catholic faith for the scourge it is , she thinks about these kind villagers , at which point , she tosses the artifact into the ocean . She ca n't bear to unveil to these poor ignorant fishermen the truth behind their faith because , well ... because they 're so nice ! The Last Templar is awful . Please do n't read it , unless you are willing to buy my copy.The Last Templar Rating : 21 / 100Subratings : Story Idea : 4 / 10Writing Style : 2 / 10Excitement Level : 3 / 10*Just as history has proven The DaVinci Code .	-1
This certainly is n't the worst novel I 've read recently ( I read another supposed historical thriller before this one that takes that title ) but it 's not very good.The plot is interesting . It had the potential to be a decent genre novel , but from the start I was troubled by the just plain basic lack of writing skill of the author . The characters are all pretty shallow and clich & eacute ; and the dialog is pretty mediocre.I kind of had to force myself to finish the novel , but I 'll admit by the very end , I was actually drawn in enough to enjoy it.From this novel , I would surmise that plot is Khoury 's strength , but he needs to work on the many other aspects of the craft of writing . If he can do this , I think he could become an enjoyable writer .	-1
The book starts off at a fast pace and catches your attention . But the further you read the more you can tell this is the first time the author has written a book . And he does not have a natural talent for it.The story takes us back and forth between the present and the past as he tries to use the mysterious Templar History in both subplots . We start in present day as Knights ride into a Vatican exhibit at the New York City Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Knights takes an object with them . Our subplot is the flash back to 1291 Acre where the Templar 's Stronghold is being destroyed by the Muslim onslaught . And one Knight escapes with a chest on the only ship left intact in the harbor.This was a good try and I look forward to the next book as the author learns to keep his writing at the same quality as the first third of this novel was written . And he needs to not force plots but let them develop naturally . He tries to add a twist . The book is worth reading for the beginning if nothing else .	-1
This book started off with a bang , even if it was an unbelievable one ( knights who ride horses into a museum in the middle of NYC ? ) , but unfortunately it went down hill from there . It just kinda ran out of steam for me , mired in people and chapters jumping around , until by page 100 the book had found itself in the worst place a book could be in my house ... underneath the bed . It hung around there for a few days ( weeks ) while I tried to screw up enough courage to plow on , but alas , the last templar has found it 's way down to the cardboard box in the basement marked `` Goodwill . ''	-1
This book is another in a series of novels which use a conspiring church as the backdrop for their plot . In a sense , another attmept at da Vinci Code , perhaps inspired by the Code 's phenomenal success . The author also uses more or less the same formula : a ghastly event at a museum , an attractive female archaeologist , a straight male companion ( this time an FBI detective ) , a wicked priest ( ? ) , and a deadly church secret in the background.Some of the touches that the author uses are an improvment on Dan Brown . For instance , there is a philosophical duel between faith and ratinality that the FBI detective fights within himself . Similarly , the initial scene about the museum robbery is quite vivid and spectacular and you can easily visualise the drama that goes on . Instead of being a sample of what is to come , the author gets a little lost thereafter , stretching coincidences across two continents , so that they all start looking extremely contrived . Possibly the museum scene comes out so well because Khoury is primarily a screen-writer.In terms of characterisation , the FBI detective comes out very well . Similarly , the older archaelogist comes through with some conviction . The lady archaelogist is done in a weaker manner . However , the weakest work is the priest ( ? ) . His motivation , the background to his skills , is never filled in . Therefore , it is more difficult to understand his character . In fact , it may not be easy to figure out whether he was really a priest or a secret agent.Talking of secrets , the Templar secret , over which they are supposed to have blackmailed the Church , itself comes out as a bit of a disappointment . The ending is interesting , in the sense that it is not anti-faith , but is somewhat disappointing , because the build-up is weak.The weakest part of the book is the plot , which is full of unbeliveable coincidences . In Angels and Demons , Dan Brown does some manipulation of laws of probability to accomodate the development of his plot . In this book , Raymond Khoury simply assumes that no such laws exist . He also ignores how the US Government works ( brining a priest into FBI meetings , and allowing him to dominate the meetings ) , and how the Vatican works ( the link between CIA , the priest and the Vatican is never cleared up ) .The result is a book which you can enjoy if you treat it as children 's fiction .	-1
Very interesting beginning , decent , if somewhat formulaic middle , and a complete disaster of an ending . The ending left me frustrated and angry by his complete cop out . Angry enough that I ca n't bring myself to read anything else of his to see if his writing has improved . Even if it has , I do n't think I can forgive him for the ending of this one .	-1
I have read books that sacrifice plot for character or character for plot , but this is the first book I 've ever read that sacrifices both for setting . Kiran Desai 's The Inheritance of Loss is beautifully written , full of vivid descriptions from the Himalayas to the streets of New York City . To say it moves slowly would be generous . The story does n't really start until the last fifty pages or so . The only character I had any fondness for was the dog and there 's no resolution to her story.I only purchased this book because it won the Man Booker Prize in 2006 . I only finished it because of a Goodreads review that said it had one of the best endings she 'd ever read . I am boggled on both points . Basically , this author spent 350 pages meticulously describing an empty room.-Katie O'Rourke , author of Monsoon Season	-1
I finally read `` Excellent Women '' after a devoted Pym fan finally bought me the book and convinced me to give it a try.I *tried* to like it , I really did , but it just was n't my cup of tea . It is a somewhat interesting look at daily life in London post-World War II -- I will give it that . As for a plot ... well , there is n't one . And the characters are nothing more than a group of oh-so-wacky caricatures.Frankly , I found `` Excellent Women '' as bland as the boiled potatoes and macaroni the characters were constantly eating.Now , I know some people will love this book . If you like British comedies where the characters have a lot of quirkiness but not too much substance , you will probably like this book . If you like old black-and-white movies where not much happens but there are bunch of silly character actors and mildly funny lines , you will probably like this book . If you like Jane Austen , you will probably like this book.My personal tastes include none of the above , and so my reaction to `` Excellent Women '' was a resounding `` meh . '' I just prefer books with deeper character development , more conflict , more color , more emotion .	-1
Being a fan of science fiction and some of the old classics , I felt a need to try one of E.T . Burroughs novels about Mars . John Carter is a vet of the American Civil War and a Captain who fought for Virginia ( and therefore the wrong side ) . He ends up , after some adventures , on Mars . A stranger in a very strange land , he tries to better his position , mostly by killing others natives who attack him or attack other natives.First , this is soft science fiction , fantasy fiction at best . Star Wars is hard science fiction when compared to this book . More swords than laser guns , the Hero spends most of his time explaining how backwards the people of Mars are , all the cities are in ruins , the landscape a wasteland and so on . Mars is full of wild men , wild creatures and states at war . John Carter , being from Earth , can jump farther , run faster , fight better than anybody else.This is a male 's fantasy not REAL science fiction . There is nothing here but a male point of view , mixed with wish fulfillment , tons of action and adventure , a weak plot and no theme ( unless you count some racism and sexism ) . You know when somebody says they could write a better story ? Well , anybody could have done a better story . Add some more realistic details , better names , and cut down on the bad B-movie lines pouring out of the characters ' lips and you could improve on it without even thinking.Why does it seem so dated when other books from the same period still hold up ? Oh , by the way , the book itself was very nice and well made . Print On Demand is great .	-1
I have not read this entire translation , but I did review the sample chapter online . I compared it with the version with which I 'm familiar , [ ... ] , and I must say , I much prefer the older to this one.I distinctly remember , when reading the older , how amazing was the translation . I really wondered if Dumas had not translated it himself , so full of vocabulary and style . Its immensely powerful and almost orgiastic reading . Very heady stuff indeed . Some of the finest action/adventure literature ever produced.The wikipedia entry says there were three original English translations - one still in print by William Barrow . I 'm not sure if the one I read is his or not , but I 'll tell you , its astounding in its style and ability . ( And regardless of whether Pevear 's comments about them being `` textbook examples of bad translation practices , '' the one I read is FANTASTIC ! ) Dumas was the KING of this kind of writing . Absolutely beyond anything of its day , or since . It is storytelling at its finest , and I 'm thinking most of the positive reviews belong to Mssr . Dumas , rather than Mr. Pevear .	-1
And if you 're not currently among the ranks of the depressed , you will be after reading this novel . Seriously , I did not find the novel either a ) beautiful or b ) worth reading . Perhaps it would have been very moving in a tragic sense if I had bought any of Wharton 's feeble attempts at painting a story of forbidden love gone wrong . The novel entirely lacked any real connection with human emotions and behaviors . Perhaps , if the storyline of the book were my life , it would depress me very much . The pointlessness and ironic misfortune of these characters lives is remarkable , but I was left feeling too apathetic to be upset by this fact . I do not suggest you torture yourself by reading this novel , unless you have a flair for masochism .	-1
On and on about a bunch of precocious , bratty high school seniors , most certainly heading for disaster , but after reading and mostly suffering through 40 % of this pretentious novel , I threw in the towel , so I would never know except that Pessl tells you right at the beginning . Maybe if you are young , this would serve , but otherwise the world does not need one more of these . It 's been done over and over and certainly better .	-1
This is a mystery novel and the mystery centers around why it got good reviews . A knockoff of ` The Secret History ' ( even the weekly dinners ! Could n't you have made it breakfast , just as a gesture ? ) with an extra helping of that book 's more obnoxious elements , this one should probably not have been so well received . Why it was written is less of a mystery , this is the book most of us consider writing or try to write during the summer after college when feeling quite sophisticated from having learned the names of twenty authors and gotten an A on a lit paper . Luckily for most of us , a cruel but true friend ridicules the draft and we start over or give up . Where Ms. Pessl 's chums were on THAT important assignment only they know for sure . What they might have told her is that if you are going to drop 14 pompous allusions for every fifty words it makes you look like such a snob that you really have to be presenting a quality product to back it up . Much like working French phrases into a conversation , it can be pretty neat but it had better be done right . The writing in this book falls short.Never mind the ` modern email ' editing style of allowing properly spelled but nonetheless wrong words into the final edition ( there/their , vane/vein , & c ; ) the writing itself reminds me of my daughter 's first knock knock joke : Knock Knock/Who 's There ? /Cadillac/Cadillac Who ? /Cadillac Not Your Mom ! . She understood the mechanics of the device but not the meaning or art behind them . Without my daughter 's ( pretty solid ) excuse of being three years old , Ms. Pessl looks ridiculous writing ` my memory stutters and stalls like a motor which refused to turn over ' . Well , pal , if something refuses to turn over it ca n't get going and it needs first to get going before it can stutter and stall . It 's like saying ` I crashed down as hard as an airplane that never took off'.Hey , no one can really stand the scrutiny of a million pedantic jerks like me without a few weaknesses showing up , that 's no crime , but whether or not you have the goods is something one really ought to consider before making a superior and self-congratulatory drama of it . Ms. Pessl may well become a good author someday but she will always have this thing lurking in her past , as will the gaggle of supposedly sophisticated reviewers who ended up looking just as amateurish falling all over it . In fairness , many have said the last 200 pages were the good stuff and I never got that far . But even assuming it 's true , you show me a five hundred page book with two hundred good pages and I 'll show you a poor job .	-1
Hung in there through page 89 , then realized I 'm not immortal and do n't have time to deal with this . Am willing to start a charitable foundation to provide Ms. Pessl a lifetime supply of Ritalin and a scholarship to the Iowa Writers Workshop . Care to join me ?	-1
The book does n't get much better than okay , despite some cute turns of phrase . There 's way too much cute , and not enough copyediting . About a hundred pages could have been cut , which would have made the story a lot better , tighter , not an endless ramble through pointless made-up quotations . By page 200 , I was ready to give up . There was too much set up and nothing happening . Finally , the story got under way , and then turned out to be so far-fetched , that it felt like a completely different book . Parts of the book were a ripoff of The Secret History , including the charismatic teacher and the special students . In addition to copyediting , the book lacked decent proofreading : Olduvai gorge is rendered as `` Oldupai , '' a horse 's reins come out as `` reigns '' and climactic comes out as `` climatic '' -- perhaps the book is ultimately about global warming , just about the only subject that did n't somehow get crammed into it . I think there is a good and readable story buried in this book somewhere . It 's not easy to find , however , and the typos are doubly disappointing in a book with such pretensions to erudition.Once the story gets going , things pick up a bit , but it 's still encumbered by details that should have been included sooner , if at all . A decent freshman attempt , this is not the book of the year .	-1
Andrew Carnegie was both the Bill Gates and Thomas Friedman of the Gilded Age . An industrial visionary and brilliant business practitioner with a ruthless drive to be the best and most efficient Andrew Carnegie would semi-retire in middle age , and in his later years focus on giving away his vast fortune to remedy what he believed were the most perplexing problems of his age . But Mr. Carnegie was also the Gilded Age 's prophet and messiah , borrowing Herbert Spencer 's philosophy to hail America 's Gilded Age as progressive and splendid , and to justify the worst abuses of the age as necessary and right.In his preface the historian David Nasaw notes that much of what has been written about Carnegie has been overly sympathetic , or -- in the case of Mr. Carnegie 's autobiography -- just plain self-interested . So we could happily expect a more balanced and nuanced view of the great man , or at least some juicy gossip . Unfortunately , Mr. Nasaw 's book is yet another overly sympathetic portrait , and a sedated and boring one at that.Here is a man who did not marry until he was fifty , and who did not give his young bride ( almost thirty years his junior ) a child until she desperately begged for one -- and so how could Mr. Nasaw not speculate once that Carnegie was possibly a closet homosexual ? His fanatical devotion to his mother and his narcissm -- he wanted to be respected as a writer and a thinker , and often paid for his writings to be published -- are hints as well.What 's most annoying about the book is Mr. Nasaw 's presumptive tone . He tells us that Mr. Carnegie 's greatest mission before he died was to give back to his community all the wealth he had accumulated . How could anyone know what really went on Carnegie 's mind , and who would dare to presume Carnegie 's priorities ? Throughout the book Mr. Nasaw would claim that Carnegie had a very good rationale in banishing the unions from his steel mills , and in forcing his workers to work for long hours and little pay -- because he wanted to make as much money to give back to his community as possible.Considering that Carnegie was a prime subscriber to Herbert Spencer 's Social Darwinism , that he was competitive ( he worked hard to create the most efficient and profitable steel mill in the world ) , that he was a control freak ( he would wrest back control of his corporation from his lieutenant Henry Clay Frick , who had proven himself nothing but loyal and competent ) , and that he was a megalomaniac ( in his final years he would single-handedly attempt to solve all of the world 's problems ) it 's fair to say that Carnegie in his heart felt he did not have to justify himself to anyone : he was just right . Breaking unions and exploiting workers meant efficient and profitable enterprises , and efficient entrepreneurs meant progress , modernity , and civilization.Even if David Nasaw considered reasons for Carnegie 's asexuality and considered the extent of Carnegie 's narcissm and megalomania it would still have a pretty boring book , and it 's because Carnegie -- despite all his greatness -- is not deserving of an 801-page biography . A naturally optimistic and positive individual his life did nothing but justify his worldview . An early beneficiary of the cronyism in the railroads he became a beneficiary of the U.S. government 's tariffs to protect the steel industry against British competition . The only bumps in Carnegie 's otherwise charmed life ( the 1892 Homestead affair where Carnegie viciously and violently broke the unions and his nasty break with Henry Clay Frick , who then publicly declared how the tariff regime was grossly enriching Carnegie at the expense of American consumers ) are interesting but did nothing to change the course of Carnegie 's life . There is no conflict and climax in Carnegie 's life , just one assured ascent borne of his work ethic and his optimism and his incredible luck.The real star of the book should not have been Carnegie but the Gilded Age itself . Unfortunately and surprisingly Mr. Nasaw talks little of the Gilded Age , and instead chooses to write a a year-by-year account of Mr. Carnegie 's life , including the tedious trivia of Carnegie 's vacations . And do we really need to know every huge estate Carnegie bought and renovated ? I have n't read enough of Mr. Nasaw to know his ability as a historian but the problem with biographers is that they often internalize the values and thinking of their subjects . And this is a book that Carnegie could have easily written himself : be charming and be glib , stray and amuse with the trivial and personal , and talk for a long , long time until your readers have no choice but to agree with you .	-1
This is an extraordinarily boring book , unless you are interested in reading about chaos and the people involved , blow by blow . It is about the people who somehow contributed in some way to the development of the theory but you will find very little about the theory itself , and much tangential comments and anecdotes . There are other MUCH better books about chaos . My advise is to skip this one .	-1
Most of this has been said before , but I figured one more negative review would n't hurt if it kept you from reading this book . I probably would n't have written a review for this book at all except for one line the author included that drove me nuts . Towards the end of the book the narrator of the story is trying to explain why he was fooled & while he admits his faults he then throws it back at the reader that `` she fooled you , too . '' That annoyed me so much , because from the very beginning I was not fooled & this just means that the author thinks her readers are extremely stupid & would fall for her poorly hidden who-done-it . I liked the first quarter of this book and the writing is good , but the story is so obvious . It annoyed me a great deal that the main characters did n't pick up on a weapon as soon as it was mentioned ( took them a month ! ) or the inappropriateness of one of the characters right away . I also did not get the relationship of the 2 main characters . They are like 2 siblings & it just seemed a little odd that 2 murder detectives would come together in that way . The negative reaction of one of the characters when their relationship takes an unexpected ( for them ) turn was completely immature & made me really not like the character . I could go on & on , but I do n't want to give away too many plot points . I do n't know if the author wanted this to be one of those stories that the reader figures out first , but that fact that the detectives were so inept just angered me . The description of the book also leads you to believe that 2 mysteries will be solved , but the older one is just there to explain why a character is messed up & nothing about the actual crime is dealt with or progressed , which annoyed me . I 'm not sure if the author intends a series of books since there is a second one about the lead female detective , but after this poor & obvious storyline I wo n't be reading anymore of her stuff .	-1
Sadly , it felt more like a poor `` Law and Order '' episode - the end was way too easy to figure out . It could have been summed up in half the pages , especially considering the major mystery of the novel was n't addressed .	-1
( spoiler ) Was this book written by two different authors ? Like most of the other readers I thought this book was great when I first started it-I found the mystery of the boy in the bloody shoes intriguing and at first the book was so suspense filled I could n't put it down . I had a few minor quibbles with the story , for instance I thought detective Ryan 's views on things , especially women , were more like a female than any male I have ever met . ( This did n't bother me too much , however , as I agreed with his views and decided I may just not give men enough credit ) Some of the story was also unbelievable but hey , this is a mystery , so I gave it some leeway . Then around the late middle of the book I started getting bored . I was tired of details about bits that were irrelevant to the story and began to wonder why the author was going on in such depth about these minute details . I had also figured out who the killer was and began to grow impatient for Ryan to figure it out so that I could find out the connection to the first murders ( if any ) and find out who had committed them . However , this is when things really started to go downhill . Ryan , who up until now has been insightful ( perhaps too insightful for belief ) about women ( especially Cassie ) turns into an idiot who suddenly displays both no understanding of his partner and believes all the worst sexist stereotypes about women . I was also left confused as to why Rosalind had him fooled . Maybe I could have bought the possibility of her manipulation , but to believe it I needed a lot more than the few encounters that French invested in . Instead of putting in the time and detail to really fool both the reader about Rosalind and show how Ryan could have been fooled she takes for granted that a couple of encounters ( all in which Rosalind acts fishy ) have convinced everyone . Much of the attention to needless detail could have been used there , and the implication that the reader was fooled is insulting and a little embarrassing . The final insult , though , is of course that the main mystery which is central to both the main character and the plot line of the book and which so many ( muddled ) hints are dropped about and solutions dangled like a carrot is left unsolved except for the hint that some magical Pan creature whisked the kids away ( which does not at all jive with the tone of the rest of the book and offers no explanation at all for the blood in the shoes ) . Donna Tarrt 's book works because it is predominantly a work of fiction containing a mystery . The writing in French 's book is good for a murder mystery but it is not good enough , nor is the plot strong enough , to make it anything other than a murder mystery and murder mysteries need to either have a solution that is solved for the reader or one that is at least solvable . French gives a lot of conflicting meaningless clues but in the end none of them add up to anything and the plot disappears , like the children , in the woods .	-1
Tana French is one of those writers who is very good at the craft of writing , but very bad at constructing a convincing novel . A good novel requires that the characters be believable , the logic consistent , and the events plausible . Unfortunately , In the Woods was weak in all of these areas.The story is told in first person from the perspective of Rob Ryan , who is supposed to be a 30-something detective with amnesia . ( He was the survivor of an assumed child abduction case in which two of his friends were never found . ) There were three major flaws in this character , 1 ) he does not act like a detective ( it is very unprofessional to interview the sibling of a murder victim and then not tell your partner the details because you `` do n't feel like it '' ) , 2 ) he does not act like an adult ( silly practical jokes are more typical of an adolescent ) , and 3 ) his `` voice '' is distinctly female . Rob 's endless reflections on his low self esteem , his concern for fashion , his self-loathing at having been fat as a young teen , and his self-dramatization are hallmarks of an insecure adolescent female , not an insecure adult male . As a result , I found it nearly impossible to identify with Rob , which is a serious drawback in a novel told in first person.Problems with the internal logic were rife . Rob supposedly ditches his childhood identity by simply using his middle name and switching his accent to `` BBC English '' a week after enrolling in private school . A legal name is a legal name . It appears on all legal documents -- birth certificate , passport , bank accounts , tax returns , job applications . If Rob received a paycheck , then it is simply not plausible that nobody at work knew his real identity . As far as the accent goes , it is actually more difficult to change a childhood accent than it is to learn a new language . Even if Rob had managed it , the process would have taken many years.The pace of the novel was unbelievably slow . Well over a third of it is wasted on trivial and inconsequential details , red herrings ( the `` puka '' demon is picked up and then dropped without explanation ) , and excruciatingly juvenile conversations . Each chapter included at least one instance of rather heavy-handed foreshadowing , which , while fine at the start of a novel , gets old after 300 pages . There can be just so many `` If-I-had-only-known-then-what-I-know-nows '' before you simply have to get on with the plot ( something French clearly struggled with ) .But the biggest let-down of all was the ending . I 'd figured out who the murderer was in the first part of the book ( it was fairly obvious ) , so what I was really interested in was the solution to the disappearance of the two children some two decades earlier . This was the whole crux of the book . Would Rob regain his memory ? Would the trauma be resolved ? Would that old mystery be solved ? French never got around to answering these questions . As a consequence , the book ended not with a bang but a whimper.I do n't hold out a lot of hope for French . The sequel to this book , The Likeness , was even more riddled with flaws than In the Woods . It is a pity that with such literary talent French ca n't manage to bring her ideas to fruition .	-1
Wow , I had so much trouble finishing this book ! I kept falling asleep while trying to get through it . The problem is that I just did n't care about any of the characters , the pace was incredibly slow , and the dialogue was insipid . What a shame , as a book like this could have had so much more potential ( and I do like some of her other books ) .	-1
I purchased this book because it had caught me attention several years ago and it was on my list to read . Although this is not going to be an extensive review , I have to say that I am disappointed on several fronts . First , Wills seems to view American Christianities negatively . Religion in America has had much good in it too . Too read Wills take on it , it seems like evangelicals and orthodox Christian influence has been harmful . I am not sure if the current right-wing has colored his thinking and writing but it just seemed jaundiced and inaccurate . Second criticism , although he cites a lot of research , there are times in the book where he just seems as if he is taking large sections of research from others and just putting it into his own words or even quoting outright at the expense of originality . Third , I do n't think he should be called a Catholic scholar . He seems to have little affinity to traditional Catholic teaching . I am not a Catholic , but with skeptics like him , not sure he looks to be within the boundaries of the faithful .	-1
This woman is a professional journalist ? Honestly , it is horribly written , which made this book hard to stomach ( sorry for pun ) , despite the interesting premise . Really amateurish . Check it out of the library if you must .	-1
I found the unabridged audio version slow going and difficult to follow . The narrator was not nearly as good as John McDonough of the Mitford Series . The transitions from the past to the present were sudden and without introduction which led the listener to wonder what point in time the scene took place . I am a big fan of Jan Karon but I was disappointed in this first book of the new series .	-1
One would expect that a book subtitled `` Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism '' would answer two basic questions : ( 1 ) What is wrong with the economy , and ( 2 ) How did it get that way ? As a bonus , we might also like to know just who is responsible for the incipient Great Depression II , so that we can begin erecting gallows and fashioning enough nooses , and we might like to entertain suggestions as to how the crisis might be solved , but it turns out that Dr. Phillips knows no more about economics than do you or I or your local greengrocer . As a result , the book meanders in a desultory manner around various topics that are at best only tangentially related to our financial woes , and most are irrelevant.In place of specifics about the economy , Kevin Phillips rambles about under the pretense of giving us the `` Big Picture '' or a `` Historical Perspective , '' and thus we are treated to an entire chapter ( chapter 6 ) on not merely what happened during the first Great Depression , but a complete overview of European history , as well . `` In 1618 , the fall of a weak Spanish first minister led to a burst of activism , and several years later . . . '' And blah , blah , blah , followed by an analysis of the situation in Holland in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . It 's all absolutely fascinating ( NOT ! ) , but the trouble with this is that , if one digs hard enough , one can discover any lesson from history that one 's looking for , and when does Phillips get to the economic situation of 2008 ? He does n't . If the fact that in the fifth century the capitals of both Rome and Spain were moved to different cities ( pg.157 ) is pertinent to our present situation , then what , if anything , can be considered irrelevant ? Rin Tin Tin ? Cameron Diaz ? Jujubees ? Throughout `` Bad Money '' Kevin Phillips refers again and again to his previous books ( he wants you to buy them ) , and since he has little information to share with us about the present economic crisis , he begins writing those old books all over again . We get many pages of hisAmerican Dynasty , including the scintillating revelation that `` John Quincy Adams was elected president in 1824 , . . . twenty-four years after his father , John Adams . . . '' and that `` Benjamin Harrison was elected president in 1888 , forty-eight years after his grandfather , William Henry Harrison . . . '' ( This in a book about the economy . ) Phillips has a Mencken-like animosity toward the Christian Right that he vented in hisAmerican Theocracy , so he here he spends a chapter placing the blame of our financial situation at the feet of the devout.Because it 's easier to write about than specifics of the financial system , an entire chapter is devoted to the debate on whether the world has reached Peak Oil production or not , but now ( November , 2008 ) that the price of oil has fallen below $ 50-per-barrel , all that has been rendered moot for the time being.I would fain admit that on random occasions , the stream-of-consciousness Philips writes in stumbles briefly into economic matters , but much of this is material that you have already read in the same papers and magazines that Kevin Phillips reads . There are many graphs and charts from The Financial Times and many quotes from that British journal . Unfortunately , Phillips adds little to the quotes , and he does n't clarify the more abstruse terms . This book desperately needs a glossary , and before you read it ( not that I 'd recommend that you do ) you should first become familiar with such terms as brouses , derivatives , credit default swaps , mercantilism , deleveraging , fixed-leg features and two-step binomial trees . ( If you do n't know what those are , do n't feel bad , neither does Kevin Phillips . ) There is some new and startling information in `` Bad Money , '' but much of it is of a dubious nature and is merely mentioned in passing . Our nation 's conservative masses have followed the lead of their mob masters ( turn-on any radio ) and are blaming `` minorities '' ( you know who ) for the financial crisis , because these high-melanin types purchased homes they could n't afford . But what about the `` Ninja loans '' that Phillips mentions ? These were loans eagerly given to people with no job , no income , no assets . Are the brown people to blame for those , too ? Unfortunately , Phillips cites such loans only in passing . Which lenders made them ? How many such loans were made ? Sorry , no further information is available . Likewise , Phillips mentions bonds that were backed by delinquent credit-card accounts . Phillips informs us that these bonds were given a rating of AAA , but that 's all he knows.Phillips provides a stunning revelation when he quotes several sources about a shadowy Plunge Protection Team within the Federal Reserve that may ( or may not ) have been manipulating the market by secretly buying and selling stocks and futures . On the other hand ( pg.60 ) , `` There 's never been any official confirmation of this . '' That 's quite a serious charge -- the Federal Reserve , a government within the government , buying and selling stocks to influence the market -- and I for one would like to learn more about it . Is it happening or not ? Alas , Phillips admits , `` I have no personal firsthand knowledge and am not interested in becoming a conspiracy investigator . '' In other words , he does n't know . It seems that there is much that Kevin Phillips does n't know about the economy . Read this book and you , too , will know just as little .	-1
This book should have been titled THE PLIGHT AND HARDHIPS OF THE CHINESE WORKERS.I bought this book based on its title and the `` Look Inside '' which gave parts of the first chapter . I ordered it and anxiously waited for it to be delivered , thinking I would learn more about how China is poisoning our products , driving prices to bargain-basement status , forcing workers out of jobs the world over , and how and why it is happening.I closely followed the Mattel lead laden toy fiasco as well as the anti-freeze in toothpaste and hundreds of other threats to the products we buy with confidence . I do n't want to feed my pooch , with his tail wagging , a poisoned doggy biscuit made in China that ravages his kidneys.So , I have been on the search for the truth about THE CHINA PRICE and how it has decimated our confidence in the products we buy.But this book reads like a novel . The author repeats over and over again in each chapter and each paragraph about the poor and downtrodden Chinese worker . I expected a non-fiction book written by a financial reporter . At least that is what this book is touted to be.It seems like global financial analysis of how China has taken over consumer goods is far beyond Alexandra Harney 's scope.Also , If I wanted to read about air pollution and global warming , I would have bought something authored by Al Gore.THE CHINA PRICE is big disappointment .	-1
While I was n't much of a fan of Freakonomics as a whole , the chapter giving an economic analysis of drug gangs was an interesting take on a well-worn subject . When I heard that the chapter had been expanded into an entire book , I made a point to get my hands on a copy , the next time I was in the US.However , the book fell short , and was much less interesting than the shorter take in Freakonomics . Rather than any sort of academic or economic analysis , it felt like more like a collection of anecdotes , perhaps it could have been titled `` my crazy life living amongst the project dwellers . `` I think the author 's outsider perspective is a basic flaw to describing life in an early 90s project - such a book would have been better written by a long-term resident . Additionally , the author is n't a very engaging author , and none of the personalities described felt alive , or like anything more than one-dimensional stereotypes .	-1
Nutritionists often change their minds , as new evidence comes in . Thus , per Pollan , we should stop paying attention to them . Doctors and nuclear scientists also sometimes change their minds - should we also disdain their thoughts ? It 's true that Americans ' health has deteriorated in some ways over recent decades - eg . the alarming growth of obesity . Pollan suggests this also damns nutritionists . Forget about eating TOO MUCH - eg . the larger portions and enticements for super-sizing , reduced physical exertion in our daily lives , and ignoring the universal advice of nutritionists ( avoid animal fats , eat a balanced meal , etc. ) . Pollan also wants to associate ( blame ? ) increasing heart disease on nutritionists - but what about the fact that it is decreasing ? `` In Defense of Food '' can not be defended - too much hair-splitting and absurd logic . I can not be convinced that nutritionists and the marketers that use them do not/can not improve food - eg . niacin added to bread , iodine in salt , etc . We simply do n't know enough to do so as well as in animals because the required scientific testing is often not possible or frowned upon .	-1
A perfume guide : Sounds like a wonderful idea , does n't it ? Something to help you navigate the flood of scents at the department store counters , to help you sort through the dross and pluck out the gold . I hoped that this is what this book would be . But sadly , it is not . This book is hardly `` The Definitive Guide '' to fragrance that it claims to be . It should have been titled `` The Highly Subjective and Personal Opinions of Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez . '' Do a little bit of research and you 'll find that they offer fawning praise to all the work a particular perfumer , while inexplicably tearing apart another . Reading this book , the untutored consumer will believe that all the perfumes by the great old French house of Caron ( no affiliation , I do n't work for them , I just admire them ) have very recently been reformulated and now smell disappointing , terrible , awful . However , I was just at the Caron boutique in New York yesterday , and they smell as wonderful as ever . I even tested them against some of my older samples . No difference . None . Clearly , there 's something fishy going on here . The reviews are influenced by something other than the quality of the perfumes themselves.Not that I would have thought too highly of this book even if it were untainted . The authors ' humor was entertaining at first , but after a few dozen pages of it , the constant avalanche of snark became strained . And the tone of the prose is a bit lowbrow for my taste . Example : Dr. Turin 's favorite descriptive word seems to be `` cr_p . '' I had such high hopes for this book , but I ended up sending it back . If you do happen to pick it up , take it with a mine-full of salt . And most importantly : Trust your own nose .	-1
... who seem to only be able to continuously smoke through this overly long diatribe . Great ending but the reader along with his unlikeable characters are made to suffer continuously . Wish I 'd stuck with Shardlake .	-1
I kept reading all the way through to the end of this , simply because I did n't know much about the Spanish civil war . If you already have a certain knowledge of the war , I do n't think you 'll find much of interest here . Sansom is a decent writer , but I 'm not sure he should be writing fiction . He does an ok job of giving us some insight on the different fractions of the war . But mainly this is obviously meant to be a book about people - their emotions and their faith . Secondly it 's also a sort of crime novel , and I think Sansom fails at both aspects . He does n't manage to give you much of an emotional involvement in the characters . There are several tragic incidents during the story , but as a reader I do n't really feel like I care . I do n't feel any kind of attachment to the people in the book . Especially the main character - Harry - suffers from a total lack of personality . He 's just nice ( and boring ) . A few times he has some kind of outrage - at least that 's what the writer tells us . But these episodes are n't very believable , and they seem to be restricted to one sentence or statement from Harry . Afterwards there is no indication his usual state of mind has been altered ... .As for the `` crime story '' , it just does n't hold water . He does n't manage to build up much excitement as we go along , and the little there is , is totally ruined by the lack of logic towards the end . Sansom introduces a couple of `` surprise twists '' in the last part of the story . And they are kind of surprising - considering they make absolutely no sense at all . I 'm not gon na ruin the story for you , but suffice to say people turn up where you do n't expect them to turn up . And when Sansom tries to explain why they turn up it - as already stated - makes absolutely no sense ! If you want a quick introduction to the Spanish civil war , this might not be your worst choice . But skip the ending , and do n't expect any emotional involvement .	-1
This is another book that mistakes behavioral analysis with economics . The result is advocation of government paternalism . The best of the book is a myriad of examples showing what the authors call 'nudges ' that people are subject to , along with reasoning of why we are susceptible.We do n't always make the best choices for our own interests . There are examples of cognitive dissonances in human perception . We are inconsistent , sometimes engaging in self deception . We are easily 'nudged ' by self serving businesses and other humans . However , the chess metaphor is ignorant and wrong . It 's perception that is required , not more advice.They invent unhelpful terminology of 'Econs ' and 'Humans ' to distinguish between left and right brained operating people . Distinguishing between 'doers ' and 'planners ' is unoriginal.We are subject to social nudges to control voting patterns and purchasing habits . However , these 'nudges ' are with a proverbial elbow , government tends to use a sledgehammer in the form of excessive taxation and ridiculous regulation.This is a case of a good premise with many fine examples leading to a ridiculous conclusion that government paternalism is the answer for human foibles . Trying to convince the reader that `` libertarian paternalism '' is not an oxymoron ( It is ! ) . They even handedly cite objections . The objections are much better than the book 's thesis . I take this as a lesson to guard against subtle nudges as with 'anchoring ' and manipulation of default choices , not as an invitation to submit to the sometimes benign paternalism of government . We have already gone too far down the road advocated by Thaler and Sunstein .	-1
The author 's books seem to be sequential , so you 'd better start with the first and work your way up to this one . This one had a confusing story line because it assumed reader knowledge about the book 's characters . Flashbacks throughout and a required a suspension of disbelief had me racing to get to the end , the last two pages of which I did n't even bother with . Go with C.J . Box or Ridley Pearson instead .	-1
I am a great fan of Andrea Camilleri 's brilliant , funny and moving mysteries set in Sicily featuring Inspector Montalbano . I 'm also a fan of his translations which are extraordinary . I read my first Donna Leon novel and could not believe that this poorly written , apparently unedited book is popular . The plot was thin at best , the writing amateurish , and the characters pale . Do n't waste your time , instead read Camilleri and enjoy yourself .	-1
then you are n't paying attention . This book tells you nothing common sense does n't already tell you - more money coming in than is going out . It 's that simple . Figure out ways to do that . if you insist on getting this book , get it from the library - there ! your first money saving tip . Duh !	-1
Again and again , as I read this book , I asked myself why I had purchased it . Despite the dust jacket hype and the author 's statement of his purposes , the book contained no new information . Everything about Licoln 's function as commander in chief had been said before ( frequently better ) . My old first edition copy of T. Harry Williams 's `` Lincoln and His Generals '' is a far better performance . Add Craig Symonds 's `` Lincoln and His Admirals '' for a complete picture ( and a facet McPherson seems to ignore ) . I feel cheated .	-1
In these hard times , we really could use an up-to-date , thoughtful reappraisal of the history of finance and the role it has played in advancing and periodically severely retarding economic and political development around the world.Unfortunately this is not it.Prof . Ferguson , who divides his time between Harvard and Oxford , has become the `` James Michener '' of world history . He writes effusively on everything from `` Britain 's contributions to civilization '' and `` warfare in the 20th century '' to `` the Rothschilds . '' Having dipped into several of his long-winded tomes , I can honestly say that the game has seldom been worth the candle.And now this . Here a documentary project for Channel 13 evidently drove this `` Ascent '' book project , with predictable consequences -- jump cuts from subject to subject that leave readers almost sea-sick ; topic choices that seem to have been made for video potential and notoriety , not objective importance ; `` mile wide , inch deep '' scholarship that yields a very large pile of half-truths and incomplete thoughts.I did like his chapter on housing finance , though it raised many more questions than it answered , and seemed to suggest that ignorant residential borrowers had more to do with the current debacle than , say , trillions in derivatives issued by Wall Street banks and insured by outfits like AIG.Clearly the faults are not for want of ability . Where Prof. Ferguson actually gets up out of the armchair and does some first-hand research , as in his treatment of the Rothschilds , we get a few moments of serious , original scholarship.Beyond that , and a few colorful tales , the book amounts to coffee table nostrums for readers who want to be reassured that the `` wall is not coming down '' on our Capitalist Empire.Among Prof. Ferguson 's comforting conclusions : ( 1 ) finance capitalism really is the best of all possible worlds , at least in the long run ; ( 2 ) hedge funds and global banks really are wonderful new instruments for `` guarding against risk '' ; ( 3 ) `` financial innovation '' really is `` indispensable '' -- despite all the innovation in REGULATION that this wizardry seems to constantly requires ; and ( 4 ) `` poverty '' is NEVER `` caused by '' financial innovation -- a conclusion that Ferguson repeats over and over , never with any evidence . ( This one may come as a surprise to the 2 billion citizens of low-income countries outside China and India whose incomes utterly failed to grow from the late 1970s to 2000 because of `` Third World sub-prime loans . `` The book also contains any number of factual errors . The dollar has strengthened , not declined , during current financial crisis . China and other Asian countries have hardly `` decoupled ; '' quite the reverse . Chile 's 17-year flirtation with fascism under the corrupt , bloodthirsty Pinochet regime was a horribly costly mistake , not some interesting little experiment with privatized pension funds . China 's economic backwardness in the 19th was not due to a shortage of financial institutions ( which are not an `` uncaused cause '' of anything ) but to -- as Ferguson , contra ipsum , seems to acknowledge -- the impact of Western imperialism on China 's weak state ; Ken Griffin 's Citadel hedge fund is hardly a work of genius , but a monumental failure ; etc . etc . etc.In short , this is a dumbed down , pollyanish , made-for-TV `` hasty pudding '' of a book . Its success - like the mortgage debacle itself - is based largely on hype and the `` impeccable reputation '' of its principle `` securitizer . `` We need to remember two golden rules of book selection -- ( 1 ) always be suspicious whenever a film project leads to a book , rather than the reverse ; and ( 2 ) always be suspicious of any book whose title is printed in a smaller font than that of the author 's own name .	-1
I loved this when it ran in the NY Times . I could n't wait to have the wonderful drawings and subtle text in my possession . And then the book arrived . I was dumbfounded . Whoever designed it ca n't possibly have done a book of art before . Images spilling into gutters , no white space . Why ? To save money ? This should be reprinted by a publisher who can see what damage has been done to this wonderful work . It kills me to say it because the artist , Maira Kalman , deserves every bit of attention she can get and every nickel they pay her . But this book design is a travesty .	-1
When I was in grad school , I signed up for a class called Death and Literature . The description sounded awesome and I was being a bit morbid . What it turned out to be was a philosophy class in literature class clothing , which resulted in me reading Heidegger for weeks at a time , only occasionally broken up by `` She '' or `` Dracula . '' The few moments of awesomeness did not make up for the fact that I was dragged through `` Being and Time . '' And that 's what reading `` Street Gang '' is like.This is not a complete history of Sesame Street . This is a slog through the personal histories of several of the key players who created Sesame Street : Joan Ganz Cooney , Jon Stone , David Connell , Sam Gibbon , and Jim Henson . And when I saw histories , I mean you learn about their parents ' upbringing , their upbringing , schooling , weird relationships , everything ! This book is hyper-detailed , bogging it down . What is n't about family history is about how the show got funded , which has the potential to be interesting if we were n't forced to walk through every step of the process . And , of course , we do . You finally get to the genesis of the show and its characters and stories in Chapter 12 ... so if you want just that , skip to page 166.To finish my complaint on the book 's completeness , it skims a fair amount of the 1980s ( compared to the detail of earlier chapters ) and gives very little info on the mid-1990s and beyond . This is probably because management changed at the CTW and Davis does not fawn over these people . Elmo is the most-covered subject during this time period.I 'd also have to say that the writing structure is incredibly awkward . Readers are flung forward and backward and forward again in time within the span of a few paragraphs , all usually to tell a story that usually does n't need telling . Like did I need to know that Cooney 's personal assistant attended her abusive ex-husband 's funeral for her , so she could report back to her boss on how it went ? Or should the moment Jane Henson steps forward to speak and Jim Henson 's funeral really be the time Davis first brings up that they had had marital problems ? That 's not to say that there are n't fascinating stories about Sesame Street , its creation , and its creators . The book is full of them , but you have to be patient and dig around to get them , and I 'm not sure it 's really worth your time . You do gain an appreciation for how ground-breaking this series was and still is . You also wonder if maybe it was a requirement that you have a terminal illness in your future , as much of the end of the book is dedicated to all the contributors to the show who died of cancer , AIDs , or other diseases . It 's kind of frightening how many people involved in the show have died.I ca n't say that I really recommend this book . Mostly , I recommend the middle of this book . Unless you 're looking for a history and finances lesson , with some Muppets thrown in for good measure .	-1
I think something awfully suspicious with the rating system here on Amazon when a book such as this gets so many 5 star reviews . The composition of this book seems to be approximately two-thirds composed of `` Jewish /Holocaust stories '' & associated `` atrocity `` stories '' during WW2 . This is not just my opinion , but can be shown as a fact for anyone who would like to study this books content . The remaining amount could be described as `` Very scanty '' history on the Third Reich & WW2 ( at best ) ... and leaves out whole sections of the history it advertises on its cover to fit in the usual , very blatant propaganda stories . If anything , there should be more complaint that this books title is definitely misleading .	-1
Wish they spent a little more time on the tactics and battles and such . Should be titled the & # 34 ; Third Reich at War as seen from the viewpoint of the Third Reich & # 34 ; ... .very detailed and thorough ... .but , for example ... .hardly spent any pages on the Battle of Stalingrad , but globs of time on those nasty Nazi 's , with statistics and such .	-1
Some of these reviewers must be disingenuous . This is not the book that is suggested on the back cover . I am very interested in creativity and work in a creative field , so naturally I was drawn to this book . But as some others have noted , this is nothing more than a collection of abbreviated bios of the rich and famous and contains hardly a word about being more creative in our own work , or how to find this apparently illusive `` element '' . One star because it was not what it purported to be and that is fraud ( but a creative way to sell a book , no doubt ) .	-1
Vincent 's mental difficulties began in her late 20s while working as an over-qualified secretary and wondering what the value was of her expensive prior education . He psychiatrist began Norah on Prozac , then tried others , and eventually she ended up on a maintenance dose of Prozac.Then , after 18 months disguised as a man ( subject of her first book ) , Vincent had become severely depressed , and her psychiatrist convinced her to enter a locked mental ward . A four-day stay motivated her to do a year within a mental hospital ( actually three facilities , spread across the socio-economic spectrum ) as the subject for another book.After too many pages of day-to-day reporting on life in a deliberately sterile mental environment in which her main focus was getting off Prozac , she concluded that mental institutions have little impact - a person has to change themselves , most do n't even try . The result is the apathetic staff that she found prevalent.Vincent 's conclusions may be correct , but her methodology is useless . Controlled studies involving a large number of patients with a specific mental problem are required , and that in turn requires clearer definitions and symptoms of mental illness , as well as rigid evaluation of patients at specified time-frames . The analysis must be repeated with each diagnosis that the conclusions are meant to apply to.An even more glaring failure of `` Voluntary Madness '' is her arbitrary dismissal of psychotropic drugs . `` Ignorant '' and `` irresponsible '' are two terms that describe this conclusion.Bottom Line : `` Voluntary Madness '' uses inane methodology to draw potentially seriously harmful conclusions for the mentally ill . It 's boring as well .	-1
great premise for a book ... i was really looking forward to reading it ... trouble is i ca n't say if i was disappointed or not . i note that alot of reviewers are saying that they did not like any of the characters ~ neither did i , but the characters do not have to be likable for a book to be good . personally i found my dislike of the characters to be frustrating at times because of the fact that they were real and honest portrayals of the flawed nature of human beings . i had a couple of issues with the book . firstly that the writer tried to cover so many societal issues instead of sticking to the core subject ... this left me with a feeling of non closure to any of them . secondly , and perhaps my biggest issue , was the use of the c word ! i tend to swear like a trooper , as most aussies do but it 's excessive use was unnecessary and instead of adding to the impact of it 's use it was distracting for me . on the positive side i found the comments made on australian society to ring true to me ... confronting and disappointing sometimes , but honest . i also enjoyed the story being told from numerous points of view/characters . on the whole , would i read it again ... no . would i recommend it to others ... probably not . am i glad i persevered and completed i ... yes .	-1
I found the story boring , moving too slowly and dragging over unnecessary details . Also the characters speech , voice , dialogue was not enjoyable to read . It felt overly dramatic , unnatural and did not flow .	-1
How did a book made up of simple melodramas , weak and uninteresting characters , and unskillful composition and writing win any prizes , as this book has ? ? The story is of the consequences to a handful of family and friends of an impulsive slap by one of them of an unruly four-year-old at a backyard barbecue . Related in eight chapters supposedly from the perspectives of each of eight witnesses , the narrative barely ties the characters and chapters together . What is meant to be `` perspective '' is no more than a moral opinion of whether the kid deserved the slap or not . The expected dramatic highlight -- the criminal prosecution of the slapper -- fizzles in a few pages with a legal dismissal . The rest of the nearly 500 pages of the book is primarily exposition ( third person omniscient ) of the very small life affairs of this group . ( What ever happened to `` show do n't tell '' ? ) Much of the writing consists of gratuitous mundane description with no meaning or relevance to anything.The few themes apparent -- multiculturalism in contemporary Australia , contemporary teenage behavior , and an Australian setting ( Vegemite sandwiches , aborigines , g'day mate ) -- are shallow and simple.If there were dramatic arcs or conflicts of any significance , I missed them . Other reviewers have criticized the book for its profanity and sexual content , but those were the least of the book 's problems , in my view.I really do n't want to be unfair to author , Christos Tsiolkas , but if he is in the `` first rank of Aussie contemporary novelists '' ( as noted in the inside credit blurbs ) than I am a koala bear 's uncle.Sorry ( FTC disclosure ( 16 CFR Part 255 ) : The reviewer has accepted a reviewer 's copy of this book which is his to keep . He intends to provide an honest , independent , and fair evaluation of the book in all circumstances . )	-1
Singlets galore ! Everywhere Christos Tsiolkas looks he sees them . They 've taken over the world and resistance is futile . That 's the main thing I 'm taking away from this dreadfully dull book . I 'm now aware of the singlet invasion , thank you for the public service announcement . Finally I understand why I 've been mysteriously accumulating sleeveless garments . As for the rest , the book is filled with characters who are both unlikeable and unconvincingly written . Yes , I really loved it , ca n't you tell ? Sure , there are issues covered in this book , and for that reason it could lead to a discussion more interesting than anything you 'll encounter within the actual story ; but then why read the book if it 's so dang boring ? You can generate an interesting discussion by reading a better book instead . I suggest you do so .	-1
Van and Linny are sisters , children of Vietnam refugees . They were born in America , and only know of growing up as Americans in Michigan . The sisters are not close and brush it off as being very different from each other when in fact they are alike , making the same mistakes in life . They both fall for the same insensitive , arrogant kind of guy with predictable results.The characters of Van and Linny are flat to say the least . Since the title is Short Girls , I thought that being short would be an integral part of their makeup . It was n't . Not to say that the author did n't make references to it , it 's just that I never really pictured either of them as painfully short . Not tall , just of ordinary height . There was n't anything else about them that endeared me to them.Excuse the pun but Short Girls came up short . I rate it a 2.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short	-1
This is an very weak attempt to write a comic detective story set in the late sixties with lots of sex and drugs . It is n't very funny . It is n't a very interesting detective story . Both the drug scenes and the sex scenes do n't ring true .	-1
I so looked forward to this novel . I ended up disliking the book , intensely . I was unable to relate to the characters , culture and time.I , also , felt the story dragged . So disappointed ... ...	-1
Thought the author mixed apples and oranges..did not think it was well written..all one person 's opinion . Should be written by a doctor or someone with medical experience.Sorry I bought it .	-1
In agreement with these one star reviews .. no big picture , just fragmented novelized narrative that offers no deep explanation of the events that are being described . Clearly Sorkin compiled a lot of data ( gossip ? hearsay ? ) much of which could be material for a good ( great ? ) book ... however he did no work to condense , consolidate , collate this material ie the actual work of authorship to make this into a satisfying informative read . Maybe one day someone will actually write a real 200 page book from these ( quite extensive ) notes .	-1
This book is absolutely one of the worst books I 've ever read . I had to read it for book club , otherwise I would have stopped reading after the first chapter . I found this book trite , banal and a complete waste of time . The story is not at all original . I believe , without some of the profanity , it should be a teenagers book . It is amateurish in its writing style . The characters are not the least bit believable or relatable . The writer is writing from CeeCee 's perspective who is a young girl , but the voice is an adult one . The story is completely predictable and not at all engaging . If I could have given this zero stars , I would have . I learned nothing from this book and indeed felt like it wasted my reading time . I hope this author does n't write anything else -- I certainly wo n't be reading it if she does .	-1
? This has a bit of reality about how children grieve and how they deal with mental illness in a parent but there is a lot of what was worn , what was eaten , how the room was decorated , etc . to be taken too seriously . Happy happy happy . How lucky to be adopted by a wealthy stable relative .	-1
This will probably take off like The Secret Life of Bees . The front cover is gorgeous . The back cover has quotes from six bestselling authors , including Kristin Hannah and Luanne Rice . But the story itself is shallow.The opening line tries to hook you in : `` Momma left her red satin shoes in the middle of the road . That 's what three eyewitnesses told the police . '' But the problem is , now you know Momma is going to die , probably suicide , and also that there 's probably mental illness involved , and yet it takes another 30 pages for this to happen , during which time we are exposed to Cee Cee 's life of sheer misery . But it 's all been done before . Yes , the author presents the mental illness fairly well , but there 's also the cliches of Cee Cee 's refuge in the library , the kindly next door neighbor , the boozing , womanizing father . There 's nothing new here.I do n't want to give away too much of the plot , but the next two characters , the Southern great aunt and her cook , also feel like stereotypes . And the princess fairytale ending ( which most readers will love ) had me rolling my eyes . Even the kindly next door neighbor comes out very very unbelievably on top . It will be a hit , but I wo n't be recommending it to anyone . Also see the Publishers Weekly review , above , which is spot on.For much better books in a similar sort of genre , check out anything by Kaye Gibbons : Ellen Foster , Charms for the Easy Life , Sights Unseen ( in which a daughter also struggles with her mother 's manic depression in the south ) . Also try Massachusetts , California , Timbuktu by Stephanie Rosenfeld -- -another fantastic book about mothers , daughters , mental illness , and survival .	-1
Mercifully , this was a quick enough read to only cost me an afternoon at the pool . While portions were engaging , overall the book was not . I can see why feminists gave it good reviews -- the women were all above-average , spunky and independent ; the men in the book were either criminals , idiots or dead . I personally need a more balanced view .	-1
This is a big disappointment after & # 34 ; Eat , Pray , Love. & # 34 ; It 's mostly a whine-fest and a pity party . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Elizabeth Gilbert memoirs begin in crisis.In Eat , Pray , Love , she 's on her bathroom floor at three in the morning , desperate to end her marriage.In the just-published sequel , Committed : A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage , Felipe -- - the Brazilian she loves too much to marry -- - is detained by Homeland Security as he tries to enter the United States and , six hours of interrogation later , is jailed and deported . ( In fact , not really `` deported '' , because he had a valid visa , a business in America and no criminal past ; Homeland Security just decided he was coming to America too often . ) How can Felipe re-enter the United States ? Well , if he and Liz were married ... Now , if you or I were writing Committed -- - heck , if almost anyone were writing it -- - it would be a closely reported narrative exposing the policies of our government in a time when terrorists seem to enter our country freely and grandmothers are strip-searched . It might include a meditation on love separated and love expatriated . And , I suppose , it would explain how two people who were marriage-phobic came to love the knot.Committed , I am astonished to say , is not that book . Not even close . There are a few memorable vignettes , but it 's mostly a skim-the-surface tour of marriage through the ages . It lacks wisdom . It 's dull . There 's nothing to connect the reader to Gilbert . But Viking is unleashing a Palinesque million-copy first printing , and American women are about to be buried under the hype.Do n't say you were n't warned .	-1
Like many of the reviewers I have been a student of the `` Battle of the Little Big Horn '' for over 50 years . I was really looking forward to this book , but a few pages into `` the Last Stand '' I realized Philbrick was a revisionist historian with no idea at all how to channel the life and times of George Armstrong Custer . This lack of connection to the men and shape of the nation in the 1870 's makes me wonder why Philbrick is even writing `` history books '' .First let me say that Philbrick has the most extensive notes and bibliography ever used on any Custer book . But as a so-called historian , Philbrick 's writing for me has too many `` cardinal sins '' . In plain english if you read the notes , Philbrick blantantly adds facts that are not true , not documented and in many cases outright lies about the `` the Last Stand '' .On page 4 the author makes the politically correct ( for today ) statement that the `` Sioux refused to sell the Black Hills '' and the `` administration chose to instigate a war '' . It is clear from the beginning of the book that Philbrick has a very `` pro '' indian point of view and the `` white man '' in Philbrick 's eyes ' is the thief that stole the Indian 's land . Not true . This is actually the true reason the Sioux Indian war began : The Sioux never owned the Black Hills ( still do n't ) . They never had a deed or title to the land . The Sioux took the Black Hills from the Crow , who took it from the Blackfeet and so on . The Indians of the 19th century were all wards of the US government . There was over 400 tribes and all but 2 tribes were warlike . The government made treaties with these Indians which were contigent on certain rules being followed . The Sioux were given the Black Hills and other areas to use if they reported to the reservations and followed the rules of the treaty . The Sioux would report to these reservations in the winter to receive food and blankets and shelter , but leave in the spring to hunt buffalo in violation of the rules of the treaty ( they would leave their areas and follow the herds ) . During the time the Sioux were off the reservation areas the Indian depredation claims would soar -- as would murders . If the Sioux were in US territory , outside their legal treaty areas and they found a pioneer family traveling or a trapper , you would be murdered and tortured . They were a warlike and vicious tribe . In a 4 year period outside of Denver over 150 horses were stolen ( Sioux and other tribes had no problem stealing horses , to steal a horse in the West meant death to the horse owner , a man without a horse was as good as dead , so this is why this was a hanging offense ) . Homesteaders and miners were murdered and woman and children kidnapped . Now I am married to a wonderful woman who is part Cherokee and I used to attend AIM meetings so I love Indians . But this is the truth , next to the Commanches , the Sioux were the most vicious tribe on the plains . Captives were buried up to their necks next to ant piles , babies were often swung by the heels and smashed against rocks . Woman were raped over and over and when the Sioux were finished they often cut off their noses or ears or used burning sticks and burned their captive 's noses off . It is well documented that some of the Sioux were cannibals and the Calvary chasing the Sioux after the Little Big Horn battle found empty teepees with hearts cooking in pots and foot- stools and tom-toms made out of human skin . Off the reservation the Sioux were `` traveling Serial Killers '' who made Jeffrey Dahmer look tame . Philbrick 's constant efforts to make the Sioux appear like `` happy hippies '' hunting and fishing and peaceful is an out right lie . Read the US Government depredation claims from the period in this area . Utah and Colorado were often the scenes of these crimes and were outside the treaty area . The Black Hills were US territory and the Custer Expedition was legally valid.Philbrick attempts to make the wily old medicine man Sitting Bull into a prophet like St. Paul and a general like Eisenhower -- this is a joke . Philbrick 's constant attempt to stress Sitting Bull 's dreams and visions is laughable . The old chief was well known as a manipulator ( even Buffalo Bill thought he was a clever `` con man '' ) . I could write all day about the things wrong with Philbrick 's story but here are a few : It is doubtful Crazy Horse was ever present at the running retreat with Reno . Although many Indians comment on Crazy Horse being at this battle not one of the soldiers or scouts reported seeing him . Crazy Horse was camped at the far end of the compound and for him to tell his men ( according to Philbrick ) to `` wait and let the soldiers fire till their rifles jam '' is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard . Crazy horse road a paint horse and painted it with `` dots '' . Crazy Horse also wore bright shirts and had dirty blond hair . If he rode from the far end of the Sioux camp ( 5 miles ) to fight with Reno 's men someone would have noted an Indian that looked like this . The Indians also had no idea what rifles the soldiers were carrying or that these rifles would jam . In fact , till after the fight , the Indians thought they were fighting Crook . Also , Philbrick seems to give Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull and the other chiefs the power to command the braves as if they were Napoleon . This indicates that Philbrick was swayed by meeting and interviewing too many `` modern Sioux '' . No chief ordered any Indian warrior how to fight or attack . When a battle started all the braves were independent and fought on their own . Some of the Braves would count coup , some would kill and scalp and some would even fight awhile and quit . This is why the Indians were never going to win a war . It is well documented , during fights or battles some braves would even stop and eat or go back to their teepees and sleep . The truth of the last stand is that Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull get all the credit , but Lame White Man and Gall were the leaders that won the battle . When Reno charged the camp the braves poured out of their teepees and waved blankets and shot arrows at the horses . Lame White Man did the same thing when Custer charged down the coulee . This panicked the horses . Many of the soldiers were `` green '' and not good riders . Once thrown off your horse and out-numbered 20-30 to one they just did n't have enough bullets . That is the battle in a nut-shell . But Philbrick adds so many untruths in between the lines it is pitiful . The story of the killing of Isaiah Dorman was witnessed by over 17 soldiers , who all saw him caught in the open , shot in the legs unable to walk and watched many squaws and young braves stab him and beat him with rocks . Several also said his `` privates '' were cut off while he was alive . Philbrick 's statement the `` Moving Robe Woman '' killed Dorman is not true ( she never made this statement ) and his story of `` Moving Robe Woman '' riding a horse and fighting with the braves is a fairy tale . No Sioux Indian Warrior would have allowed a woman to mount a horse and fight . Sioux squaws were treated as slaves and traded for horses . Braves had numerous wives . Squaws were no more than chattle to Sioux warriors . It is ridiculous to spread this tale . The squaws were well known to attack and mutilate the dead or injured victim ( after the fight ) but no Indian woman was going to mount a horse and fight . It just did n't happen . I could go on and on but one thing that I want to mention -- Philbrick states that the mutilation of the soldiers may have been revenge for the Sand Creek Massacre ! This is the most one sided and blatant attempt I have ever seen to make the Sioux look like decent citizens . The Sand Creek Massacre was in response to Cheyenne and Sioux raiding near Denver for four years from 1864-1868 . Over 200 horses were stolen and at least eight farmers murdered including a 5 year old and 3 year old . All the victims were horribly mutilated . A drunken militia attacked the Cheyenne and mutilated them and they did display scalps and skins . This was an attempt to show the Plains indian that the `` whites '' were going to fight an eye for an eye . The Plains Indian had been mutilating victims for over 100 years . So for Philbrick to make that statement is as slanted as you can get and still call yourself `` a historian '' . I could go on and on but just from an early statement where Philbrick says on page 14 `` in the early 1870 's the Seventh was sent to put down the Klu Klux Klan who were a `` white supremacist organization '' ( paraphrased ) . In the early 1870 's the Klan was not a `` white supremacist group '' but was an insurgent group formed to fight reconstruction and all the crimes committed by the Carpetbaggers and Copperheads . I would like to see a historian write the true story of one of the darkest times in American history and not try to be `` Politically Correct '' about the Klan and other southern groups that later became hate groups and were later `` white supremacist hate groups '' . During Reconstruction freed slaves were made sheriffs and rape of the southern wives was common . Only appointed Yankees could hold office and southerners could n't own firearms . The land and homes of many former slave owners were stolen and countless innocent citizens were murdered . It was so bad that Vicksburg , Mississippi would n't put up an American Flag on their courthouse till World War Two . Philbrick , like many revisionists choses to ignore this crime on American Citizens . Finally , for Philbrick to put so much faith into the words of the Indians of this current time is like the modern revisionists who think Davy Crockett surrendered at the Alamo ( his body was seen by a witness , Mrs. Dickerson , but revisionists have Davy surrending and killed later in the day , I guess Mrs Dickerson was a liar ) . The Indians of that period lived and breathed `` tale tales '' . Many of them will describe brave warriors flying in a battle , or bullets bouncing off a buffalo hide , or -- quite often decapitated heads talking . For him to put so much stock in these words lets me know Philbrick was buffaloed himself by the native American Indian Myth..according to him these are peaceful savages with no fight in them unless provoked ... Balderdash ! ! ! ! Philbrick takes Captain Benteen to task when Benteen was the only commanding officer in the battle who `` obeyed '' orders . Custer ordered Benteen to `` oblique left '' with the pack train . Yes , Benteen stopped to water his animals , anyone who knows horses and mules would realize you ca n't go a whole day and not give an animal water . Philbrick even states that `` Custer waited 20 minutes for Benteen to arrive while the Indians surrounded him '' ... this is according to statements by an Indian . Custer would n't have waited on anyone . What did the Indian do ? Look at his wristwatch ? Indians had no concept of time at all . They never ate , slept , hunted or fought by a clock . When asked by a person to relate time the best an Indian could do would say is : `` it took as long as it took to eat a meal '' ... how long was that ? 10 minutes ? an hour ? Benteen did not tary on the trail and Terence Donovan proved this with scientific fact in his wonderful book `` A Brazen Trumpet '' ... .read it instead of this propaganda ... .	-1
A simple analogy sums up Philbrick 's story best : Indians good , cowboys bad . If you thought Hanoi Jane 's visit with the NVA in 1972 was a hoot then you will love this book . Philbrick hates America . Example : ( page 302 ) he calls America 's Manifest Destiny a `` bloodstained march across the west '' yet he devotes only one sentence ( page 30 ) to the Dakota War of 1862 when Little Crow slaughtered hundreds of settlers in Minnesota . Blood , sweat and tears seems more apropos and fair , sir . The entire book follows suite . Military conquest was n't invented in 1876 but Philbrick wants you to believe it was . I imagine his next offering will detail the plight of Islamists in America and how the US got what it deserved . Please , read A Terrible Glory by James Donovan or Son of the Morning Star by Evan Connell instead . Thank you .	-1
I 'm sorry I ca n't give a thorough review of this book because I could n't make it past page 96 . Ever hopeful that it would become interesting or meaningful , I slogged on , through meaningless repetition and hum-drum writing until , not caring for any of the poorly detailed characters nor for whatever dreadful events were portended , I put the book down -- forever.Reviewers who liked the novel have described the story line , and perhaps they are right that Le Carre has sent a meaningful message of present dangers . But I recall his Cold War novels , purporting to show that the communists were no worse than the free world , at least for their iintelligence services . Just ask those previously tormented by the Stasi and by MI-5 or CIA if there was any comparability !	-1
Taking into account that this was written during the thankfully dying days of groovy hipness . Started off interesting enough , then out of the blue we are introduced to Charlie In Mykonos living on the beach with a troop of too too hip performers and her unbelievably brutal boyfriend . It then digressed into a mess of pretentious hippie twaddle , which was enough to make me put it down after 75 pages and a wasted evening . I give it two stars only because it started off well enough , then lost me , but others seem to enjoy it . I think Le Carre hit his peak with `` The Spy Who Came in From the Cold '' which was great . I have put down `` A Perfect Spy '' and `` A Small Town in Germany , '' both too slow to waste precious reading time on .	-1
I think the first time I read something like this was `` The Machine Stops '' E. M. Forster . 1909 ( note : I read it LONG after it 's first publication ) The whole `` Oh no . I 'm immortal and it 's horrible '' idea has been done to death . ( hah , I made a funny ) and I found this dreary and banal . Nothing new , characters uninteresting . People used to die of old age at 35 or 40 and I do n't hear anyone today moaning about living past 50 . Gasoline is going to run out . Grandpa will have to keep working , the kids are living in the basement and gangs are roaming the street . This is supposed to be NEW ? or frighting ? If you turn on the TV you do n't have to look far to find a city burning . Advice to the author . . .next time you get an idea , keep it too yourself.IMO this is another in a long line of modern science fiction that apparently believes in literary pretension over story telling . And that the only thing that makes literature is stories about how awful the future is going to be . Why not try something original and write a novel about the positive side of the future . This is worth flipping through at the library but not even the price of the bargain bin .	-1
interesting lesson in what the depression really meant to so manyeye opener , thought you knew before reading this , but got a deeper understanding	-1
I only read half of this book because I skimmed over so much of it . There was just too much boring detail . Not just about her research but in describing everything else .	-1
I keep buying the sequels because I like the idea . . . none of the books have come close to the cleverness of the original Eyre Affair ! Sometimes I feel Fforde will include pages of non-essential fiction just to justify one silly pun taking the plot all off course . I like the idea of the alternative reality he created . I wish he would return to some of the original plot lines he left dangling . For example , in the first book we meet Thursday 's father , whose face could `` stop a clock . '' He spends much of that first book trying to avert a disaster which i felt sure that Fforde would allude to again in some later book . Alas , he has n't yet .	-1
I actually do n't want to remember everything . It 's not worth the effort . Instead , I am going with a theory that I read in New Scientist a while ago , namely that 'downtime ' every day is essential for your memory processing . I am clearly not having enough downtime . I certainly do n't want to spend lots of time making up long-winded stories to remember things . An iPhone will do instead . There are n't any particular surprises in the book , which has rather minute text and forgettable anecdotes . I recommend delegating information to a minion or offspring to remember , writing notes and lolling about as much as possible .	-1
Reaching goals such as happiness and financial independence using the indirect approach that John Kay refers to as `` Obliquity '' makes for good thinking but not for good reading , not here anyway . It was n't until he reveals that he wrote a book called `` The Economic Analysis of Accounting Profitability '' that I understood what kind of writer he really was ; the kind that takes interesting ideas and makes books out of them , but eventually lose their audience before the middle of the book by their need to sound really smart .	-1
$ 15.00 for the electronic version ! ? ! ? A joke ? Or an intentional insult from the publisher ? Greed , greed , greed . Do the authors have no input at all ? Is this the way they wish to see their long-term readers treated ? It will only impact negatively on both .	-1
Philip Kerr 's creation , Bernie Gunther , was a brilliant concept : Sam Spade/Philip Marlowe transplanted from the seedy milieu of a corrupt LA to the even more corrupt Nazi Berlin . He was the man with a personal code of honor who stood up to the corruption and criminality all around him.Although the writing is never less than a brilliant parody of Raymond Chandler and he has a bibliographical note at the end which is very helpful , Kerr has clearly been bored with his main character for many years . After retiring Gunther for a number of years in order to publish less successful thrillers and mysteries , Kerr came back with a Gunther who is no longer the private eye in 1930s Berlin , but bounces around from being a Berlin cop in Weimar Germany to a hotel detective to an SS officer to a private eye in postwar Munich to . . .well , let 's just say that although the story line is consistent , Bernie just never seems to be able to hold down a job.But up until now , Bernie Gunther HAD a code of honor . He struggled to find the brightest shade of grey in a world of black and no white . Gunther 's acts at the very end of Field Grey is inconsistent with the Spade/Marlowe code of honor . It is as if Sam Spade shot Miles Archer himself so that he could continue his adultery with Archer 's wife more conveniently.The only way to interpret the ending of the book is that Kerr not only thinks that America is the equivalent of the Nazis and the Communists , but that we are worse than them because we do n't live up to our ideals ( the Nazis and the Communists lived up to their ideals , but their ideals involved theft and murder on a massive scale ; i guess if those were our ideals , Kerr would like us better ) . What 's more , the biggest crime we committed in Kerr 's eyes seems to be in fighting Hitler and the Communists.Although , Kerr 's series was always a favorite of mine , and a lot of my friends received a Bernie Gunther novel from me at Christmas , the ending of this novel so put me off that I will never read or buy any more novels of Philip Kerr . This is a work of moral imbecility.So if you were like me and loved the old Bernie Gunther , I suggest that you skip this installment of the Gunther saga .	-1
Not really sure what the fuss is about . This book was boring , badly written , and the two female characters had no consistency of character . Lots of descriptions of pretty people and what they were wearing : maybe this was a Mills and Boon and I just did n't realise it ?	-1
I was very excited to want to pick up this book and read it . I was in the mood for a good horror story . Unfortunately for me this book missed the mark . It moved very slowly and the characters were uninteresting to me . I thought the back story about each character in regards to where they came from would help with the story . It would shed light as to what prompted them to do what they did but all it showed me was the children grew up in sad families and then started getting in trouble and being trouble makers . I got about almost half way and then I skimmed the rest of the book . Just so I could find out what happened in the end.This book was more about the drawing out of the characters then it was about the scare factor . This is what I wanted . The scare might have been there but it was subtle . However I do have to give it up to the graphic art department for the creepy book cover . If you hold the book at just the right angle you can see the imprinted embossed words that over lay the cover and they say `` If You Tell On Me You 're Dead '' . Now that is creepy .	-1
Since I read this book in English and not in its original French , I ca n't judge whether its weaknesses are Pancol 's or her translator 's . Either way , the strange pacing , herky jerky plotting , characters who I feel I am being & # 34 ; told about & # 34 ; rather than getting to know naturally made for a very unsatisfying read -- much like watching a bad soap opera . If you want an interesting book about sister relationships , I 'd recommend you instead read Liane Moriarty 's Three Wishes ( and all of her other books ) . It 's very surprising to me that this book has such high ratings .	-1
Ferguson maintains the euro west civilization won the world due to its superiority in six apps . Competition , Consumerism , Rule of Law , Medicine , Work Ethics and Science . due to successful application of these `` six apps '' , the west eventually lorded the world over , from india to china , africa to latin america all fell in line , or face elimination , racial cleansing.problem with this thesis is , the west did not win the world with these killer apps . the west won the world with guns and insatiable appetite to hegemony , imperialism.exhibit 1 : Lord McCartney 's `` opening '' of China . McCartney visited the qing emperor to `` open '' china for trade . the Celestial Kingdom told McCartney they had no interest , no need for british `` curiosity '' ( clocks , toys , mechanical widgets ) . McCartney was told to go away . McCartney did go away but later returned with guns and steel boats , literally shot his way into china from south china sea . china immediately turned pussycat and submitted . thru ' out the next 100 yrs , the west continued to rule over china , not with six killer apps but power of gun and hegemony design.exhibit 2 : Commodore Wm Perry `` opening '' of Japan . the same arrangement . Perry went to Japan seeking `` trade '' . Japan declined and told US there is nothing they needed from US . Perry returned with the `` black ship '' and fired a few american guns off the coast . Japan pussycat like instant noodle and signed trade concession . in Meiji Reformation , japan indeed attempted to learn the six killer apps but most significantly , they sent students to euro/US to modern ammo , militarism and hegemony from US . so when US ' nuked Nagasaki , Hiroshima to stop japan 's expansionism in asia , japan was like , `` why you stopped us ? we were doing exactly the same like you , we learned from YOU ... . '' to talk `` six killer apps '' but failed to discuss guns and imperialism is like talking pimples to a cancer patient.six killer apps are minor factors , guns and imperialism are main factors.better and more profound book on this topic is Jared Diamond 's 1997 book , `` Guns , Germs and Steel - The Fate of Human Societies '' .	-1
I am a history buff and seem to gravitate towards well researched books with lots of information . While The End does a credible job discussing the destruction of the 3rd Reich from a unique perspective , and therefore is interesting in its own right , the book falls far short of what I expected . Taking into account the author 's desire to prove his point , the book makes a repeated attempt to state this theme over and over and over . There are many sections that could have been left out with no loss to the content . My guess is 1/3 of the 400 pages discussed information already presented with nothing new . Perhaps if the book was rewritten by a second author adding much more detail and appropriate maps , first hand accounts and archival information the book would have real value . As it is , the book is mostly a dud .	-1
This is one of the worst books I 've ever read . While it wants to be _Discovery of Witches_ , covering multiple disciplines in one novel , it only achieves at being a train wreck . I will grant that the authors showed a couple of paragraphs of very fine writing , but the entire body of the novel was a disaster and the final couple of chapters were so preposterous that they made me irate . Take your precious novel reading time and use it to read something , almost anything , else .	-1
Long , long time ago , books used to be classified by genres . You had your romances , thrillers , horror , science fiction , historical dramas and so forth . Today , all the literary lines blur , as one genre bleeds into another._City of Dark Magic_ is a genre-bending , pseudonymous novel that seems equal parts _Bridget Jones 's Diary_ and _National Treasure_ , but set in the Europe of old -- and present day . Did I mention there was a little _Doctor Who_ thrown in here ? A group of academics work to reassemble the treasures of the Lobkowicz family , Czech royalty gone thin in the ancestry and reduced to failed rock drummer Max Lobkowicz Anderson and a Eurotrash version of Paris Hilton with a little touch of Lucretia Borgia mixed in for good measure , Marchesa Elisa Lobkowicz DeBenedetti . After an apparent suicide at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague removes the expert recruited to examine the family 's Beethoven holding , the expert 's apprentice takes his place . Sarah Weston is young , hot , and looking for not one iota of trouble , but she finds it nonetheless in the strange crew of folks gathered by Max to create a museum from the pile of oddities he has inherited . Sex , drugs , and some early 19th century rock & roll combine with a diabolically horny senator ; a precocious , blind , 12-year-old piano prodigy ; and an oracular dwarf who may be 400 years old to threaten the sanity of Sarah , who finds herself lurching through time and possibly through a doorway to hell itself . Will she find love with the prince ? Or will a couple of .357 slugs find her instead ? And what about Tycho Brahe 's nose for alchemy and Beethoven 's trippy toenails ? _City of Dark Magic_ is a kitchen sink novel , with enough ideas in it to fuel a dozen stories . But is it any good ? PROS : * About those wacky ideas -- from drug-induced time travel to historical reimaginings of famous musicians and astronomers , from sloppy sex to KGB assassinations , from lesbian Texas gun nuts to Beethoven 's Immortal Beloved , from the holy Infant of Prague to the Golden Fleece -- well , this whole book is loopy . If that 's your kind of novel , then you 've found your book of the year . * Because Magnus Flyte ( faux Euro-Latin pseudonym for co-authors Meg Howrey and Christina Lynch ) packs so much into one novel , there 's much to tie up at the end , and that keeps readers reading . * All the quasi-paranormal happenings , weird coincidences , historical and geographical minutia , and flights into Latin , literature , and alchemy will make readers think they 're peering into some gnostic book of secrets that will not only help them unlock the secret of happiness but also win on _Jeopardy_ . * If _Fifty Shades of Grey_ was checked out at the library , well this has got enough sizzle in it to warm a chilly night . * Hey , Conan endorsed it . Right there on the cover.CONS : * Ever read a book where nearly every character is a moral disaster and just downright awful ? This book is packed to the gills with 'em , including the `` hero '' and `` heroine . '' I mean , do we really like our heroines to give it up within an hour of arriving at their destination ? I 'm not a prude , but still . * Someone smoked a lot of something illegal to dream up this storyline . * A preciousness pervades this book , as if it 's in love with itself . There 's clever , and then there 's `` someone slap the grin off that author 's face . `` * It 's really hard to know if any of the history in this novel is true or not . At times , it feels like a disinformation campaign . * The narrative sometimes loads up the details and then skimps elsewhere , so much so that readers will be begging the authors to get a move on in some spots while asking for clarification in others . Sections of it are genius , while other parts are simply stupid . * Like so many novels today , this one needed a better editor , as it drags horribly in its middle and persists for about 100 pages too many for the storyline . * Really , a slimy , oversexed female Republican senator with eyes locked on the White House ? Ladies , why even attempt to veil who she 's based upon ? Way too easy a mark , and yet you went there anyway.When the most intriguing character in a novel is not the main character but an immortal , inscrutable dwarf side character , something 's off in your novel . Truth is , whenever dwarf Nico is in the scene in _City of Dark Magic_ , the book takes on a little of the title 's promise of abracadabra . But when the focus is on heroine Sarah , the book drags ... ... with one exception.After a middle section that commands all one 's willpower to push through , the book explores more of the magical/alchemical nature of the backstory , plus adds a mysterious room . At this point , Sarah becomes interesting and our attention focuses . Rather than some liberal academic who ca n't control her hormones , she takes on more of a Lara Croft-ian personna , and the whole book benefits . That section four-fifths through is the best part of the novel , by far , and hints that while _City of Dark Magic_ is n't a great effort , whatever Howry and Lynch have imagined for a sequel might actually have some wings.What is so maddening about this novel is that readers can sense a better novel lurking within it . That the authors could not get it there is both a disappointment and a hope that whatever they do next will be more polished.I admit I 'm a guy reading a book that contains some guy-like elements but is mostly chick lit at its core . Despite the obvious femaleness of author `` Magnus Flyte , '' _City of Dark Magic_ is truly at its best when it verges into that rare masculine territory and leaves its Bridget Jones-iness behind . That better book is waiting to be written , and I think the authors can pull it off if they work harder . For a female alt-history/fantasy/sf/chick-lit-ish heroine , the authors should check out Jasper Fforde 's Thursday Next and spend a bit more time shaping Sarah Weston into her image and not into some promiscuous , pseudo-Ivy-educated floozie 's .	-1
I suppose if you do not know a single thing about music , this book might be fascinating . I came to it looking for ways to improve the instrument I already play . It seemed to me that he spent a lot of time complaining about how hard everything is . Kudos for learning to do something new , for writing the book , not so much .	-1
But this is n't it . The four reviews written previous to mine were uniform in their praise for this `` Indian Novel '' . It was obvious to me from the beginning that I was sorely lacking in references to Indian culture and simply did n't understand many of the words and phrases peppered throughout this novel . My hat is off to those who took great pleasure in reading this story and were perhaps able to simply relate to it much better than I could . I must admit that I put it down several times and finally had to force myself to finish it . I just could n't get engaged.If the seedy side of India with its corruption , sex , drugs and crime is of interest to you , then you might -- and I emphasize 'might ' -- want to attack this book . Just do n't expect it to ever appear on any `` Best Seller '' list . If it does , I promise to eat this review . At least that wo n't take me long to accomplish .	-1
Gone Girl was intriguing and intelligent . I could not put that book down . I put The Silent Wife down so many times . There were so many irrelevant substories . I kept hoping they would all tie together somehow , but no . Good ideas with potential , but the pieces just do n't fit together .	-1
I really do n't understand how we got from A to B in this one . First she is a poised , sophisticated woman ... and then she 's evil and careless ? ? I just do n't get it . And maybe if she was n't a spoiled brat and was a financially indendepent woman , she would n't have been so desperate . HOW ABOUT GET A REAL JOB AND SUPPORT YOURSELF AT 45 ? ? I also predicted the ending way too soon which always bugs me.Comparing this to Gone Girl is a major stretch for me - the woman in Gone Girl outsmarts everyone , she is brilliant , cunning and interesting ( albeit a bit deranged ) . This woman is a typical , weak , sad & # 34 ; girlfriend & # 34 ; of a cheater - a man who is old , rich and delusion . Needless to say , I did n't care about the characters . I thought they were both morons - WAY different than my reaction to Gone Girl . I would n't waste your time or money .	-1
This book is practically identical to Gone Girl , except that Gone Girl was a more interesting version . The main characters in this book were flat , one-dimensional representations of two people who could have been developed into richer , more nuanced individuals and thus evoked more sympathy from the reader . The plot , and its speedy resolution , were both formulaic AND implausible . Because I was n't particularly invested in any of the characters , I found myself unable to overlook the plot deficiencies . Overall , a fairly disappointing purchase .	-1
If a prize were given for superfluous words employed when writing a novel , Tana French would win hands-down . The frequent , wordy , mind-numbing back-and-forth between Mick and Richie was enough to send you down the pub for a good , stiff Guinness . The premise that the Spain family was living in isolation at the back of beyond could n't be taken too seriously ; this is Ireland we 're talking about not deepest Africa . The entire country can be traversed east to west in about three hours yet living slightly north of Dublin is a hardship to be endured . I continued reading to find out `` whodunit '' and , when I did , rather than feel sympathy , I felt nothing but contempt and anger towards the culprit . So , there you have it . Skip over the wordy parts , grit your teeth at the shallow , obstinate , and frustratingly annoying characters and read it if you can find nothing better .	-1
too much confusion all the time too many words that made no sense saying one thing and meaning another I do n't recommend it and would n't to anyone	-1
I enjoyed `` A Discovery of Witches '' and was really looking forward to this sequel , but it is n't as good . Matthew almost disappears from this book as a character , becoming something of cardboard cut-out in the background . Now that Diana and Matthew are married , all the romantic tension of the first book is gone . Their sex life is described in the most colorless way and they hardly relate to one another with love . The depiction of the big names of Elizabethan England is entertaining and the deepening discussion of alchemy is a nice bonus , but the novel is flat and lifeless for the most part . The one exception is the depiction of Matthew 's father , which is moving and interesting . I will read the third book when it comes out , but will welcome it with much less anticipation now that I have been disappointed by the second . I have in the past referred to `` Discovery '' as `` Twilight '' for intellectuals , but Stephenie Meyer knows how to sustain the suspense and tension through four books and it appears that Deborah Harkness does not .	-1
So , I devoured Discovery of Witches in print and through audible.com , and eagerly anticipated this sequel . Throughout the book , there were glimmers of delight , but it was such an obvious 2nd installment of a three-part series , that I wish I 'd waited until the 3rd book was released so I could read both books back to back . Perhaps the many facets that were lacking in this story would n't be so noticeable if I had the 3rd book to immediately go to once this was finished ... as it is , I have a very anticlimactic , unsettled feeling remaining as I finished Shadow of Night.The story proceeded as expected , but without the intense action and suspense of the first book . The rich historical detail was lovely , but did nothing to enhance this very lukewarm story . There are also a few annoying plot holes that I hope will be filled in once the 3rd book comes out ( I do n't want to get into details and spoil anything for those of you who have n't read it yet , but the holes are pretty significant ) .I wish I had n't had my hopes up so much . I wish I had waited until the 3rd book came out.Sigh ... I am kind of regretting that I did n't just wait for book 3 so I could read them both together .	-1
I 'm finding it hard to express how disappointed I am in 'Shadow of Night ' . I 'm 80 % through and the enchantment of Book 1 , 'A Discovery Of Witches '' , is nowhere to be found . The author gets a big kick out of describing the scenery of the 1500 's but at the expense of fleshing out any real depth of character . Diana 's POV is so weak in this novel . In book one , I knew what Matthew looked , felt , and sounded like before and after he spoke . Since the POV is weak , the book feels hollow because Matthew and Dianna seem disconnected~stranger-like . I think this problem may have been partially solved if Matthew 's POV was presented as it occasionally was in book one . I get that Matthew is distancing himself from Diana in book 2 , but as a reader , I feel distanced from Matthew as well . I keep forcing myself to pick it up only to repeatedly find myself barely skimming through another chapter . I slowly devoured book one because I did n't want it to end , only to pick it up and read it again . As for this book , I just want it to end . This being said , I hope Harkness can bring Matthew and Diana back to life in book 3 .	-1
** spoiler alert ** After struggling through this one , I am going to go back and give the first one 4 stars . I really liked it . This one , not so much . I would have given it 2 1/2 stars , but ca n't . It is better than just two but not a three for me.It started out well , but then became bogged down in so many details that I had to force myself to slog through them.Much of it baffled me . There is no explanation as to why Matthew lets one of his friends try over and over to get someone to kill Diana , and Matthew seems to ignore that . He is willing to kill almost anyone if she gets slighted , but his `` friend '' can try to have her burned as a witch , or other bad things - that is peachy keen.The chess piece subplot confused me , I 'm not sure why it happened . Other things confused me as well , and I kept going back to see what I had missed . I know part of the problem was mine . I would skim over the lengthy discussions amongst Matthew 's friends , as they were often repetitious . What they said seldom had anything to do with what they did . So I probably missed things but I just could n't go back and read it again.Matthew also seemed very moronic in the second half of the book , and treated Diana as though she had no brain.I really enjoyed the part with Matthew 's father . I liked the first half of the book . The father is such a strong character that I wonder why he dies the way he does , in the future . The whole book took place in the 16th century , and the historian in the author took over.I will still read the 3rd because I liked 1/2 of this book and all of book 1 .	-1
I read Discovery of a Witch and it was a really great book . I was happy when this book came out but I do not think i can finish reading it . I am ten chapters into the book and there is no story . Just a lesson in history . I kept reading hoping something would develop but it never does . The characters from the past are boring and I do not even know what happened to Matthew . He seems like a different character . This book is such a disappointment . If i ever finish it , I will not purchase the next book . I do not understand how this book can be listed in the Editors Choice . DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ! ! ! ! If you must read it I recommend checking it out at the public library and use your $ 12.99 for a better book .	-1
Given how much research and imagination Deborah Harkness must bring to the process of writing , I am sorry to give this book such a poor review . I was a huge fan of the first book and recommended to countless friends . And I counted the days until this one was published -- only to be hugely and sadly disappointed because it it is devoid of compelling story -- or really any story at all . While there are instances of action , this books seems largely devoted to historical anecdotes , large swaths of pointless description , and even worse , simplistic dialogue . How often must we be told that Matthew is possessive and prone to anger , and that Diana is awkward and unskilled ? Following up a hit with another must be a lot of pressure -- and the expectations of readers probably weigh heavy on an author . I have to wonder where Harkness ' editor was in this process ? Unless you 're a serious history buff , there is so little happening here . What a disappointment .	-1
This is another English author so of course the event takes place somewhere in England , the use of English words ( why ca n't they say ass instead of arse ? ) and phases just irritates me.I did n't like the going back and forth between past and present and the past written in italics . The characters are n't likable in any way and the story just plods along and I mean -- plod plod plod -- I managed to get the gist of the story and discover the present day killer but then just skipped and skimmed to find something interesting to keep me wanting to read on , but that did n't happen.I like to try new authors but a truly good author will give you a good chapter each time with something happening and leave you wanting more , this book does not do that .	-1
How good can a book be when after a mere 30 days , the reader has to return to the online summaries to be reminded of the plot ? The book is overlong with a drawn out storyline that skips back and forth in time with confusing and unnecessary frequency . Three quarters of the way through the book , all I wanted to do was get to the end , and it was not worth slogging through to get there . The author is a good writer but was sorely in need of a good editor for this manuscript..	-1
I started out reading this book in 100 % absolute total agreement with Mike Lofgren , whose credentials as a moderate Republican seem beyond reproach . He worked for 28 years as a staff member for Ohio Republican Congressman John Kasich and Republican Senator Judd Greg , both respected for their yeoman work on budgeting and national security . I totally agree with his take : ==========================Republican politicians became more and more intransigently dogmatic . They doubled down on advancing policies that transparently favored the top 1 percent of earners in this country while obstructing measures such as the extension of unemployment insurance . They seemed to want to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted in the middle of the worst economic meltdown in eighty years.The Congressional Directory now reads like a casebook of lunacy . This is not to say that such specimens represent all or even most Republicans , but they have managed , through their shrillness , dogmatism , inflexibility , and belligerence , to become the center of gravity of the party.Do Democrats offer a sane alternative ? The explanation is more complicated , but the answer is , finally , no ... .It is not that they are fanatics or zealots ; it is that most do not appear to believe in anything very strongly.These new Democrats will say anything to win an election ... .Many of them last only a term or two , because if people want a Republican , they will vote for the real thing . What has evolved in America over the last three decades is a one-and-a-half-party system , as Democrats opportunistically cleave to the `` center , '' which , in the relativistic universe of American politics , keeps moving further to the right.===========================These points are made 20 % through the book . So far I am in word-for-word absolute agreement with Lofgren . I am as astounded as he is by the stupidity of both parties in worshiping at the altar of failed ideologies . BOTH parties have cheerfully put twenty million Americans out of work by encouraging corporations to replace their American workers with peon labor in Chinese Concentration Camps . Both parties slavishly worship at the `` Free Trade benefits everybody '' altar . Both parties are tools of corporate interests . If President Obama fails of re-election it wo n't be because he 's a Communist . It will be because he has allowed himself to become the puppet of Wall Street interests as much as any Republican . What difference is there between Democrat Tim Geithner and Republican Hank Paulson ? Both are creatures born and bred of Wall Street . Geithner has infiltrated Obama 's administration and subverted it into a `` Government of Wall Street , by Wall Street , and for Wall Street '' every bit as much as Hank Paulson sabotaged the Bush Administration.What Lofgren needs to do at this point is to explain WHY the Republicans ( and the Democrats who follow their lead ) are wrong . Tell us WHY they are wrong about gutting our industrial economy with one-sided foreign trade . Tell us WHY they 're wrong about sending the country into bankruptcy by cutting taxes on the wealthy . Tell us WHY they 're wrong to believe that corporations will stop behaving badly if we deregulate them . Tell us WHY they 're wrong about refusing to raise the minimum wage so as to increase the earnings power of those at the bottom.Tell us WHY all these policies are wrong . Beat us over the head until we understand it completely if you have to . We 're never going to get moving in the right direction until we understand *** WHY *** what we 've been doing up till now has failed.Instead of telling us WHY Republican policies have failed , Lofgren beats us over the head with the idea that the Republicans are just plain nuts . According to him Republicans started going nuts when Newt Gingrich brought them Congressional majorities in 1994 . According to him the Republicans are nuts on everything . They 're gun-crazy , liberty-destroying , Bible-thumping Neanderthals who love the rich and hate the middle class and poor . Their favorite spectator sport is sending the sons of the poor off to foreign countries to kill people who speak other languages and worship in other faiths.In the midst of all these diatribes Lofgren actually does manage to work in a few sentences about why Republican tax cuts are counterproductive in CHAPTER 5 TAXES AND THE RICH . But by then he 's destroyed his credibility . He 's just so over-the-top in his rants about why Republican Conservatives are completely worthless human beings that it is impossible to take anything else he says seriously . Furthermore , it 's a waste of time to rehash issues like the Iraq War , which is now over , when the main priority of Americans now is jobs . We want to know WHY the Republicans and Democrats are still doing everything they can to destroy American jobs by mismanaging foreign trade instead of directing our trade policy so as to create jobs.His diatribe against religion is also childish . I attend Catholic Churches that offer prayers both to prevent abortion ( Conservative value ) and to promote Social Justice ( Liberal value ) . The churches have every right to make their feelings known on these issues.This book is terribly disappointing , especially since it started out being 100 % dead-center , right-on-the-money in describing the malaise that afflicts both our parties . I am a moderate Republican who agrees with Lofgren that the Republicans have been unreasonable in opposing Obama to such an extreme . But they have opposed him on the basis of misguided principle , not because they 're insane.Well-meaning people can be wrong on the issues because they are misinformed or have different life perspectives than those who are better informed or have more complete life experiences . Instead of demonizing Conservative Republicans , Lofgren should have just told us WHY their perspectives are wrong . I think I could give a credible explanation of WHY the Republicans are wrong , but I am reviewing Lofgren 's book , not writing my own.Bottom line is that this book is entirely too much `` WHO '' ( the `` who '' being those demonic Republicans ) and not enough `` WHY '' ( the `` why '' being the REASONS that Republicans are wrong . ) I 'm going to give this book an extra star ( two-stars instead of one-star ) because it is at least intellectually honest in asking towards the end `` Are the Democrats any better ? '' The answer is ( paraphrasing ) : `` No , they 're just as corrupt as the Republicans . Maybe not quite as stupid , but certainly as corrupt . `` ==========================At the suggestion of some of the commenters I reread this book to see if I could get a better handle on the author 's viewpoint . The author IS honest about this book being a `` diatribe '' against BOTH parties : ======Democrats who expect this book to be a diatribe against Republicans alone will be disappointed . The GOP has gone off the rails -- it is the party I know best , and which I will describe in greater detail.======I do have to admit that the book is an EXCELLENT diatribe . If that 's what you 're looking for , you 'll love this book . The reason for my criticism is that I do n't think it will do much of a job of convincing anybody to switch their views . Republicans will be turned off in the first page or two . But then again the author 's intent is n't to change anybody 's views , but to vent his rage against the Republicans ( the party he knows best ) and also against the Democrats . From that perspective it is a GREAT read !	-1
I bought the book because I like other books he has written . This book seems to be just a rehash of things that have been written about before by Diamond or others . His choice of people to study seems to be arbitrary .	-1
You wo n't like this . You wo n't like the reason why you do n't like it , even more . For the last 50 years and more , white Americans have been subjected to vicious , protracted propaganda designed us to have an image of race relations completely different from reality . Most people think what is on TV is real . It is not . It 's a carefully crafted fantasy . What is real is detroit . And what happened in detroit is white people were ethnically cleansed from a city we built ( the richest city in the world at its height ) by vicious criminal black people . They stole a whole city from us . Much to their surprise , the WEALTH of the city was not intrinsic to the buildings , to the land , to the objects inside the city , nor to the city itself . The WEALTH they were looking to steal was intrinsic to the white people they viciously attacked , murdered and eventually drove out of the area . Detroit itself looks much as you would expect had the city been thoroughly nuked . But the city is not uninhabited . Curiously , every & # 34 ; documentary & # 34 ; of the city , shows places with no people . The reason is , all those people you would see are black , and they are all doing very bad things that would make spectacular news , if we were allowed to see but shatter the illusions about race and race relations from the TV.How is this illusion maintained ? Google the term & # 34 ; race map & # 34 ; . You will find the last census data compiled on a fully searchable and scalable map down to the street level . What you will find is that the US is more segregated today , than ever we were under & # 34 ; Jim Crow & # 34 ; ... ..down to the very street . Literally , one side of the street will be one race . The other will be another . And no one crosses that street ( and lives ) . That is the REALITY of race relations in the US today.Multiculturalism does n't exist . Diversity is a lie . Detroit is the fate of any group that thinks different . But we ca n't even have a frank discussion about this because works like & # 34 ; Detroit : An American Autopsy & # 34 ; do everything possible to avoid the only issue that matters .	-1
I loved loved this book until the end . I liked the characters and the character development . I TOTALLY disagreed with the guys decision but I felt it is what he truly wanted to do . UNTIL THE END . His main logic was that he LOVED his life so much before the accident that he just could not see any value in his current life . I did n't agree and felt that he never gave life after the accident a chance , but again he was determined . THEN right before he died , by his own choice , he told the girl that his time with her had been the best of his life EVER . Totally negating his entire logic for killing himself . It then felt like he had been lying to the girl and that he was only trying to do a `` make over '' of her life . I felt cheated and angry with the ending .	-1
If you read the snippet about how statistically most goals are not scored right after the opposing team just scored , you might have thought like I did that this e-book would have some great statistical insight for coaching . It does not.It has a couple tidbits , but the information is not really useful:1 . Take more shots , you 'll get more corner kicks . Have more corner kicks , you 'll get more shots.2 . Want to win a championship ? It 's better to have an amazing defense or an amazing offense than a balanced teamInteresting ? Sure . Helpful ? Not really . GENIUS ? Not exactly.However , the book does give good historical analysis of the 4 top European leagues , so if you 're a fan , that might be interesting .	-1
Apart from being the story of Michael Hess , rather than Philomena Lee , as the cover leads one to believe , this is a pretty compelling book . What really spoils it for me is Martin Sixsmith 's tendency to & # 34 ; novelize. & # 34 ; Whole pages and pages of dialogue are set out as if the author had been present , scribbling away as his characters talked . There are hundreds of details that are added to bring verisimilitude to the story he relates , even though there 's no way he could have witnessed these . Sorry , but that 's not the way non-fiction is supposed to work . Withal , a fascinating book , but readers , take it all as a skillful fiction .	-1
The book was good . However I thought it was going to be about a mother and son 's search for each other not the political career of a gay man .	-1
I liked the story of Nao and would have continued reading but Ruth and Oliver both boring and Ruth and characters on their island are clich & eacute ; . Author manages to fit in the obligatory condemnation of George Bush and the U.S. about half way through . So condescending . How modern .	-1
I swear I thought there was something wrong with my kindle when suddenly this book ended as if LeCarre just decided he got tired of writing.Now , The Sopranos ended the same way , but , it ran for 5 years and you sort of got on board with the idea of & # 34 ; an ending without an ending & # 34 ; .In this case , however , it was more like a cliffhanger.Unless he has a sequel for this book , I 'm gong with two stars .	-1
The number of & # 34 ; favorable & # 34 ; reviews of this much-hyped book , plus the similarity of their plot descriptions and & # 34 ; glowing & # 34 ; adjectives and the many & # 34 ; reviewers & # 34 ; who admit to having received a complimentary copy from the publisher , all lead me to suspect that many are not genuine - i.e . were & # 34 ; bought & # 34 ; in some way or another . Buyers beware !	-1
Like many of the negative reviewers , I found that *This Is Your Brain on Music* did n't enhance either my knowledge of music or of cognitive science . It 's not without any substance , but that substance has been spread pretty thinly , and it offers one of the weakest evolutionary explanations for music as a human phenomenon : it demonstrates fitness because it indicates abundant amounts of free time . Perhaps this is true of the drive to perform , but what about the millions of people addicted to listening to music ? Is n't music in some way *special* ? No one gets a painting `` stuck in their head '' for days as happens with music , and there does n't seem to be a visual corollary to those stroke victims who can no longer speak -- but who can still sing . To be sure , Levitin does n't seem particularly interested in this , but this is part of the problem with the book . I also have to agree with reviewers that felt the book was disorganized and not compellingly written , but I never found Levitin to be particularly egocentric -- I think he 's making the case that he 's well-qualified to discuss both the brain and music . Unfortunately , he does n't convincingly do either , and the book 's most memorable element is probably the title .	-1
I began this book with guarded enthusiasm . I enjoy the history of this time period . The author takes time to lay out a pretty well thought out story line ( although predictable ) and it appears to be fairly factual . My beef however is that he took what could have been a good novel and turned it into a well written porn story . The author writes with such vivid detail in the novels sexual escapades that it dwarfs the competition . The sexual innuendo 's are also rampant within the book.It also appears that the author has very little if any regard for the church at all . The church portrayed is completely corrupt and self serving . While it is true that there was a good deal of corruption in the church during this time period , much of the church was also maintained by believers who were sincere and upright.Bottom line if you like porn with a good but predictable story read this book , otherwise do n't waste your time .	-1
I really tried to get into this book , but with every graphic detail about stabbing and guts spilling out and rape , rape with every detail about who did what to whom and how it was done , I could n't stand it anymore . Who needs those images in their brain ? No one does . I gave up half way through the book and finally threw it in a public trash can . From what I understand this author is really into rape . That is actually very creepy . Plus , the characters were totally one demensional . The only one I really cared about was Philip , but not enought to keep reading . Best book you 've ever read ? ? ? I do n't agree ! ! !	-1
I actually agree with the one stars . But there were some bright spots . Still , I could n't get through the horribly inauthentic language , for instance , that the characters used.. I just do n't picture people of this time period saying that someone was `` hot '' - or many other 20th/21st century vernacular phrases that showed a blatant laziness on the part of this author . It took even the faintest bit of authenticity out of it for me . I could n't get lost in the story because the inattention to detail was so distracting . After seeing the reviews here , a friend also recommended it - before he 'd finished it - so I purchased it . By the time he got to the end , he was sorry he 'd recommended it to me . I agreed , and decided that reading this was not a good use of my time , so stopped reading it about two-thirds through . I even banished it from my Kindle . Bleh .	-1
I came to read this book through a friend who gave it to me as a present . Dutifully I read this book , not expecting too much and I was not disappointed.This book is set in the middle ages . The plot revolves around the building of a cathedral under the reign of Prior Phillip . He is supported by a varied cast of characters , with Jack and Aliena being the main heroes of this book , she the daughter of a disgraced Earl and he the bastard son of a French itinerant entertainer . The bad guys are William , a rapist and murderer and the bad Bishop . In the end - good wins over evil.So much for content.Why is this a bad book ? Firstly the characters are all stock characters reflecting our 20th centuries sensibilities . The good witch . The evil bishop . The kindly monk . The 'idiot savant ' etc . etc.Secondly the story is very predictable and mostly told in a flat and boring narrative . There are few cliches or stock phrases which Follett is not using . Bosoms are heaving , swords are mighty , faces grim . The bad are truly bad and the good truly good . There are no shades of grey.If I were to point out the logical and historical inconcistencies I would have to write here a novel as long as this book . Yet - how long can a woman survive in the wild on a diet of mostly apples ? Even though the middle ages were more tolerant of witches than commonly assumed , how long could a woman walk around and slaughter chicken in public places as part of a witch ritual before the authorities would have taken steps about it ? Moder Anglosaxon prudery might think the sexual endavours described in the book to be tittilating , but the Middle Ages were not that prudish . Therefore the constant astonishment of the onlookers in the book on seeing sex , bare breasts etc. , is more a proof of modern inhibitions . And , by the way , why are bosoms always heaving ? The lurid prose of the sex scenes reminds me of the cheap novels with their colorful title pages sold at supermarket counters in former times.The speech patterns and way of thinking were clearly 20th century . Yes , one can and maybe if should write historical novel in suitable modern prose , rather than assuming a pseudo-historical way of speech . But with this novel I was constantly worried that one of the characters would suddenly exclaim 'Gosh ' or say 'OMG'.Strong women abound in this book , a sort of 'women 's lib ' set in mediaeval times . This already grates . But obviously for a woman to be strong she must be one of the following : hideous and evil or raped noblemans daughter or a witch.If at least the book were well written . But blandly the language rolls on and on and on , like endless grey waves.All in all it is anjoyable in the same way a dime novel is enjoyable .	-1
This book was too long and too crude for my taste . The only reason that I finished it is that I wanted to see how it all turned out . I wo n't be reading any more books by Mr. Follett .	-1
I do n't mind reading books with 1000+ pages , but this book was definitely 500 pages too long ( and these `` golden eyes '' just became very repetitive after a while ) .Unfortunately I had bought the hardcover version , so I kept reading , hoping at some point I would get into this story , but it just became less and less interesting.Well , I thoroughly enjoyed Ken Follett 's `` Night Over Water '' , `` The Needle '' and other WW II thrillers and I read lots of historical novels with close to 800 or more pages , but this one just does n't do it for me.Of course I will continue reading Ken Follett , just not his historical novels . And definitely not the sequel to `` Pillars of the Earth '' ! Certainly not a keeper ( I sold my copy at a yard sale later on ) .	-1
Could n't get through this one . After buying and getting half way through it , I learned that it had been recommended by Oprah . That surprised me given how tedious and violent it was . I even taped and watched some of the miniseries episodes , but did n't want to waste my time watching the last few . Historical fiction has always seemed like a relatively painless way to learn something if I 'm going to spend hours reading , but this one was just too burdensome . I ca n't believe this cost several dollars -- what a waste !	-1
Too violent for my sensitivities , which is to be spiritually focused . Could n't get past the violence , so quit reading the book . In general I do n't like Oprah 's Book Club choices .	-1
I can not believe there are so many good critics about this book ! Yes , it is a good book , but not so wonderful as many people write so . It is more usual that people complain about the World Without End . They say they were fed up with the story after a time , but I have had the same feeling with the Pillars of the Earth as well . I enjoyed reading it until about the three-quaters of the story , but later it started to bore me that the characters were not developping , and the story became slow and repetitive . The story was unbalanced : the good characters were suffering incrediblement , the bad ones were always successful . I was waiting for a bit of justice in favor of the good ones but it has arrived so late that it became entirelly indifferent for me . The story beginns with misteries and intrigues , but this line of the story is lost for a good while and until the writer starts to write about it again it is too late , it has became indifferent in view of the whole story . Altogether I think it is not a waste of time to read it , but it is not well balanced at all and boring after a while .	-1
I absolutely love Dick Francis novels . I love the horses and the English countryside and the deeply ethical young men who always pass the test , bloody but unbowed.But I also love the English language.OK , passive voice has its place , in British English particularly , but the long-winded sentences it generates can be gruesome . Are gruesome . And when there is an active sentence here , it comes with a veritable orchard of dangling modifiers . Comma splices and ambiguous pronouns abound , along with several examples of incomplete comparatives - i.e. , `` it was so frustrating to read . `` So Francis is a jockey and son - hulking over dad on the back cover - is a physics teacher ( advanced level ) ; but were they all asleep at the wheel down at Putnam ? A good copy editor could have saved this . Then I could complain only about it being formulaic.No , the plot was n't much to write home about , but then Francis is n't famous for his plots . The characters generally make up for any other deficiencies . Sadly , that is n't the case here , as Max the chef is very lightly drawn . The plot is worse than generic ; it 's so predictable that the reader can see things coming a mile off . On the whole , there 's not much to recommend this read.But I do love Dick Francis novels . If you have n't read the others , you 've got a treat coming . Start with Banker -- or Bolt or Straight or even To the Hilt . You 'll love them .	-1
I 'm a big fan of South Florida crime novels but strangely I have n't ( until now ) read anything by Randy Wayne White . When Black Widow hit the library shelves I was keen to read it . Unfortunately it was a big disappointment . Not only did it lack the quirky humor that novels of this genre typically revel in , it was n't even a decent crime novel . I found it formulaic , simplistic , and silly.While the drugging , seducing , videotaping and blackmailing of women is , without question , a terrible thing , I ca n't say that I was overly concerned about the impact these videos would have on the women being blackmailed . The problem for me was that at least two of the women were unsympathetic characters . They struck me as manipulative and self absorbed . The potential that these videos would ruin their love lives and career opportunities just did n't matter enough to me . The fact that their men were even less likeable than they were made it all the more difficult to care about their plight.White dedicates a number of pages in this novel to inform his readers about the evils of massage therapists who use their seductive fingers to lure customers into compromising sexual situations . Doc 's first-person narrative takes a rather clunky detour so that he can rail against these unscrupulous masseuses . This multi-page tirade does n't flow well with the rest of the narrative , standing out like a bad 60 Minutes expose.But the biggest problem with Black Widow is its formulaic and silly plot . The plot is predictable , simplistic , and riddled with holes . The story zips along but generates virtually no suspense . Doc Ford is a decent enough leading man , and his hippy sidekick has some potential , but the villains in this novel are just silly.Unless fans of the author can convince me otherwise , I do n't think I 'll be reading anything else by Randy Wayne White anytime soon . Based on the positive reviews posted for this novel so far on this site it appears the fans are happy with this effort and are n't likely to agree with me.Trust me though . This one is n't worth reading . Try something by Hiassen or Hall instead .	-1
I have read all of White 's books and it appears he is running out of bad guys . I have a vivid imagination but the plots seem increasingly far fetched with the & # 34 ; bad guy & # 34 ; nearly unbelievable . He obviously does n't like Catholics or the Church , either . This started out somewhat promising , but quickly degenerated and I could n't finish it . Action does n't always translate into believability and this is a pure example of that . More science , more Florida , less ridiculousness .	-1
As an atheist , I looked forward to reading this book to find what an intellectual and sophisticated believer would say to a skeptic . Keller leads with a convincing presentation of both skeptical and dogmatic viewpoints , and leads the reader to believe that he will `` explode '' the case for atheism and otherwise answer skepticism with convincing and highly reasoned arguments . However , for all his good writing and insistent good will , the intellectual tenor of this book is as hackneyed as they come- as classic an apologia as one might want to find from the last decade or the last century . His coups de grace generally invoke C. S. Lewis , whose chestnuts of apology hardly break new intellectual ground.On the problem of evil , he concludes : `` Just because you ca n't see or imagine a good reason why God might allow something to happen does n't mean that ca n't be one . '' This is of course the old panglossian argument that all is for the good , at least by the mysterious ways of god . The problem is that scripture and religious believers have very definite ideas about what is just and unjust , to the point of a license to kill ( the just war , not to mention the inquisition ) . So this cognitive humility foisted on the skeptic suddenly evaporates when the issue is , say , abortion , or the divinity of Jesus . The fact is that humans have an inborn and cultivated sense of morals , which is what they use to assess whether a religion is beneficial , not the other way around . Indeed , Keller then turns around to give secular reasons ( the liberation of women ) why Christianity was at its origin was more moral than its surrounding community . It is our subjective and evolving moral sense that is the criterion , not words on a page , let alone words from the bronze age.On the problem of multiple religions , Keller presents an equally deficient and hackneyed solution . Quoting Alvin Plantinga in answer to the proposition that a Christian would in all probability be Muslim if raised in a Muslim society , he notes : `` ... If the pluralist had been born in Morocco he probably would n't be a pluralist . Does it follow that ... his pluralist beliefs are produced in him by an unreliable belief-producing process ? '' . The problem with this formulation is that it ignores the reasoning at issue . The `` leap of faith '' that is required to take on religious belief is notoriously non-intellectual ( as Keller admits in his introduction as being the `` second barrier '' to his personal faith , which was overcome with a personal experience of god 's presence ) . This leap is socially conditioned , as is the expression of religious emotions generally . Thus the religious person takes on the religious forms she was born into with few exceptions . On the other hand , the skeptical reasoning process applies equally to all cultural settings , and results in a dismissal of each of the religious forms , resulting in a logically consistent and universal viewpoint rather than a parochially artistic product . There is no harm in valuing the many expressions of religious sentiment that humanity has generated over the millennia , but we should not mistake those expressions for intellect.Ultimately , you should read this book if you want uplifting stories of how urban , hip ( yet gullible ) people joined the Redeemer church . But do not read this book if you are looking for deep intellectual discussions of skepticism and why one might honestly reason one 's way to Christianity .	-1
The Rev . Tim Keller deserves credit for tackling the most common complaints about Christianity in his new book , `` The Reason for God . '' Unfortunately , I found the book to be very unsatisfying on both a spiritual and intellectual level . Other readers may disagree , of course , but here 's why I give it only two stars : -- The answers to huge questions seem very shallow to me . Yes Keller is clearly a passionate believer , but his `` Readers Digest '' approach to vast issues of good vs. evil , life vs. death , belief vs. doubt , just do n't rise to the challenge . They work well as superficial `` talking points '' but not as a strong foundation for faith.For example , can anyone really explain the Christian position on `` exclusivity '' in 500 words ? Can we really get a meaningful answer to `` hell vs. salvation '' in an essay that 's shorter ( in page-length ) than `` Pat the Bunny '' ? Can we even have faith based on reason ? As a believer myself , I do n't think so . Someone who 's serious about answering these questions should be willing to spend a whole lot more time digging into the issues -- and debating both sides for greater clarity . I would n't object so much to Keller 's book if the title had been more honest -- such as `` Quick Answers to Common Questions About Christianity . '' By calling it `` The Reason for God , '' he sets expectations pretty high ... yet does n't really deliver.I went out to Keller 's church website to download about 10 of his recent sermons -- just to see if I was missing something in the book . He 's an excellent preacher and seems like an excellent pastor . But his sermons seem to fall into the same mistake : raise an enormous question , then rush through a quick answer that does n't really satisfy . For example , on the question of whether scripture should be `` authoritative , '' Keller concludes that is `` just has to be . '' He does n't explain ( in the book or podcast ) what `` authoritative '' means or what role interpretation plays in Biblical study for the average person. -- Another trap Keller falls into is the tendency to sugar-coat the negatives . It 's undeniably true that Christianity and most world religions have MUCH to atone for in their respective histories ( massive violence , intolerance , torture , greed , fanaticism , etc. ) . At the same time , they have much to be proud about , from St. Francis to the local soup kitchen , from the sacrifices of Job to the wisdom of Solomon . It 's not helpful to minimize these huge examples of light and darkness . We must live with the history of our tradition -- like it or not . ( See James Carroll 's new movie , `` Constantine 's Sword , '' for a moving take on this important topic . ) -- Most importantly , Keller forgets the example of Jesus ' own teaching style , particularly in the first half of his book.Christ was careful to avoid `` reducing '' spirituality and God to a superficial argument that the clever Pharisees could pick apart . He knew that much of what passes for `` logic '' is simply mean-spirited sophistry aimed at humiliation . That 's why Christ often answered questions with more profound questions . His use of parables transcended the inherent limitations of language ( `` that 's just semantics / that 's just how YOU define it '' ) to reach a higher plateau of understanding that still inspires a billion people today.BOTTOM LINE : If Christ were on a stage tonight debating Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens , I think he 'd steer clear of these traps and leave us much more satisfied than Keller 's new book . Ultimately , we do n't need superficial answers to debating points . We need love , faith and humility -- even love for those who disagree with us .	-1
I really , really wanted to like this book because I was such a fan of the early Scarpetta books that focused on forensics and did n't ramble . After being disappointed with the last few books , I told myself I was finished with this series . But nooo , I had to waste my money on Scarpetta Factor . Way too long and rambled way too much . I really am finished with her this time .	-1
I have read all the Scarpetta novels , and at times found myself wondering if Patricia Cornwell had truly written the book . I found it to be disjointed and was astonished that the characters seemed to have changed their stripes , so to speak . When did Scarpetta become so forgetful and vacillating ? I was very disappointed .	-1
I had given up on Scarpetta books completely . Then I was given this one in audio for my birthday . I let it sit for over 6 months and then found myself without a book to read on audio when I made my morning walk . I fired up this book . The Shark ( ala the Happy Days story when Fonzie jumped a shark and you knew the series had run out of gas ) has been jumped again . I guess these latest books sell but I can not figure out why.Kay : Always mad , morose , depressedLucy : Always mad , still lesbian and still an unloveable person.Marino : Not the same guy anymore.Benton : Better off dead and I think he knows it.I honestly tried to complete this book . The narrator is bad but I hung in there . I finally gave up today . Did not make it to the finish when I realized that I did not care what happened . The author is now filling pages with telling the reader what happened in other books : Kay 's problem with Marino , Lucy 's money , Benton 's fake death , Kay 's firing and on and on and on . Just write a mystery like you used to ! I congratulate anyone that made it to the finish . I hope Kay got killed to take her out of her misery . Anyone need a good condition CD ? Just started Buried Prey ... ..Lucas Davenport is back and never disappoints .	-1
I have all of Mr. Griffins book but this is the worst that I have read .	-1
Time was when I would look forward to the release of a new W.E.B . Griffin series with great anticipation and snatch it up as soon as it hit the shelves , knowing that a long night or two of pleasureful , suspenseful reading lay ahead.But the last several novels , several written with his son , have been increasingly disappointing , lacking the strong characters and plots of earlier efforts . `` Black Ops '' is simply awful.It is a travelogue without purpose as the story traverses 17 locations - with essentially no action taking place . Instead it is a narrative of how the already boring character of Lieutenant Colonel `` Charley '' Castillo , the head of a mythical secret unit reporting to the President , spends his time eating well , drinking a lot and bedding exotic women . Griffin , by the way , has little talent for writing sex scenes which is probably why he stayed away from them or so many decades.The story is minimal . In short order , several people are murdered around the world . Of course , they are all connected to Castillo 's glorious past in some tenuous way . Castillo is the wealthy scion of a German woman whose one-night stand with an American Army helicopter pilot produced him . She just happened to inherit a newspaper publishing empire in Europe . His father , killed in Vietnam turns out to a Medal Of Honor recipient and , as you might expect , heir to an oil and ranching empire . In other words , Castillo is filthy rich which helps when he needs to charter a Gulfstream on short notice.Griffin has used this plot device to good effect in many other books . Here it simply falls flat - along with everything else.Without wanting to spoil the lack of fun for anyone , everything in this book turns on coincidences - absolutely unbelievable coincidences . Castillo travels from one city to another on a Gulstream until one of his companions , cut from thin paper , demands they travel by train for the benefit of a dog whose appearance in most of the book is strange . Of course , taking the train results in a coincidence which drives the rest of this boring novel.The scene shifts from Europe to South America , where we meet more uninteresting , predictable and dull characters . There are many meals . There are many drinks poured . There are many boring pages filled with details of boring meals and drinking sessions.Castillo learns of a nasty plot against humanity brewing in Africa . A team is dispatched . Castillo does n't go - some other people do and all we learn is that they were successful . Predictably so.W.E.B . Griffin is in his late seventies or early eighties . He has provided millions across the world with earthy , gritty stories of the military for decades . As I noted , I am a fan and have read and reread his five military series . I respect that at an age where many would be pursuing other activities , Griffin is still writing.The difficulty is that what he is writing today is not as compelling and interesting as what he wrote yesterday.Over the last several Griffin novels , the quality and excitement has been trending down . This is the the worst . `` Black Ops '' is boring , the characters hollow , the plot entirely predictable and the storytelling flat.I do n't think I 'll even bother with the next Griffin book - and I am sorry to say that . Rereading the old ones is more enjoyable.Jerry	-1
I would be very surprised to find out that W.E.B . Griffin actually wrote this book . First of all , there is so much back story that you could eliminate well over 100 pages . Second & most disappointing , since when has this series been more interested in sex than adventure ? Save your money and your time on this one ... .give it a pass . If you give it the effort to read it that the author gave to write it ... .you will read the first 5 pages & throw the rest away .	-1
There were so many technical errors that I had a tough time paying attention to the story . Also , living in Washington DC I found his descriptions of the city so flawed that it threw doubt on all his other descriptions . I have read other Cussler novels that were much better .	-1
After being told by a confessed self-help addict that I would suffer in ignominy until I read this book , I finally caved in and read it . Suffice it to say that I was less than impressed . In fact , so much of what Mr. Hill espouses as avant-garde theory in the field of 'personal achievement ' is nothing more than banal aphorisms that read like an addendum to 'All I Really Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten . ' This discovery left me questioning the basic intelligence of people who need to be told that hard work and positive thinking help one to achieve a goal.What I have discovered is that there is a segment of the population that basically needs and wants this type of rhetorical hand-holding to feel better about things in their lives . Think of it as Stuart Smalley in paperback form . These folks -- the same folks who buy Tony Robbins 's books -- will tell you that this book changed their lives , that it is the key to all their 'success . ' If that 's true , they must not have paid attention in school or have ever read another book or have ever had parents . What the author expounds on at nauseating length are basic life skills : work hard for what you want ; find friends with whom you share common interests ; do n't be a negative person . Honestly , if you did n't pick this up along life 's little journey , I guess it 's better late than never.What bothers me more than anything about this book is the idea that it represents some leap of abstract thought akin to Newton 's Principia or Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity . From a historical perspective , this book was written during a time when many people felt that human systems could be studied , analyzed and understood in a wholly empirical manner . The works of Freud and F.W . Taylor are monuments to this notion of the time . Too often , though , their ideas were facile and unsophisticated , adjectives that come to mind while reading this book . It does n't help my opinion of the book that the author 's research into personal success is based on many of the most notorious and despicable robber barons of all time . If I 'm going to pattern my life after another human being , it wo n't be someone named Rockefeller or Carnegie . But then , this book appeals to the types of people who are overly impressed by material wealth and who tend to believe they are one magical scheme away from attaining fantastic success.The bottom line is that if you love self-help/success manuals , you 'll probably like this book . To the majority of readers , though , most of what the author espouses will seem trite and self-indulgent . Attempting to codify the sure path to success and riches is a fool 's errand . One may as well try to quantify love or calculate the meaning of life .	-1
For the 3rd time , I 've tried to read this book . I ca n't . It 's unreadable . Outdated , trite , and does n't speak to me , here in the 21st century . Burn all your income bridges to reach a goal ? How does that work in a recession ? NOT .	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . It seemed childish in many ways . Also a bit euphoric and unrealistic , as if the author was indeed still suffering from the effects of her stroke .	-1
Stuart Woods has written some great novels . This is n't one of them . He seems to be running out of gas . There was a time when you were whisked along at a spellbinding pace . But lately , his books come across tired and listless .	-1
Many of the reviewers have already stated that this book is riddled with technical errors which should never have made it past a good technical proofreading by anyone within smelling distance of an engineering or physics degree . I 'm simply posting to give it the lowest possible rating to save someone else from making the mistake I did of buying this book ( fortunately deeply discounted ... go figure ) . At least this book offers an object lesson in that if I were ever to write a non-fiction work myself , I 'll have it checked over by several reviewers educated in the subject material before I would let it see the light of day . Many of the mistakes here are beyond embarrassing . It 's almost as if some of the people Nelson had interviewed were pulling his leg and made up some technical gibberish on the fly to see how much drivel he would fall for . As accurate journalism , this is truly a failure , though it does offer the `` flavor '' of the era rather than much in the way of substance .	-1
There 's an old con game whereby the perpetrators claim to be expert at picking stocks . They send a million letters worldwide to prospective `` clients '' indicating a future hot stock . Their claim piques interest by asking recipients to track the inevitable rise of their pick at no obligation of course . When the stock does indeed take off it entices a certain percentage of letter holders . The trick is all the letters are n't the same as there are different stock picks on different letters . The law of averages dictate a certain percentage of letters will indicate good picks and some of those letter holders will be enticed to sign over their life savings.Dan Pink uses a variation of this with his Wikipedia analogy . The Wiki model attracts a select group of enthusiasts pooled from a large worldwide audience . Wiki volunteers contribute at their leisure with just a small percentage contributing on a consistent basis . Wikipedia outgunned MS Encarta because pulling in volunteers , even momentarily , from a vast worldwide pool is very powerful due to the law of averages . But applying this to a limited pool of employees who expect to get paid , as Mr . Pink does for writing books and giving lectures , is folly . I 'm quite sure most Wikipedia volunteers are supported by `` real jobs '' which enable them to spend time contributing.The Dan Pink 's of the world , like the aforementioned stock pickers , never create success in the field they are supposedly expert in . Instead their success is derived from revenue gained from drawing people into their colorful , baseless opinions . CEOs and top managers are always looking for ways to make their mark by impressing their bosses or board members . This is especially prevalent when the economy is slow and ideas are in short supply , so they `` buy brains '' from clever sounding individuals.The truth is Top Managers would improve their company processes by attaining and utilizing honest feedback from their employees . Not as easy as it sounds but vastly worthwhile nonetheless.If you 're curious , rather than waste your money on the book look up Dan Pink in Tedtalks.com	-1
Like many other negative reviewers , I wanted to like this book and expected to like it based on the reviews , but I 'm finding I have to force myself to finish it . In gathering my thoughts for this review I am repeatedly asking myself why this story is so flat and uncompelling ( and yet so highly reviewed ) . It is not well-written . Regardless of what happens to them in the war , the characters do n't live on the page . Characters , particularly the doctor and reporter , make life-changing or life-risking decisions out of supposed urgency . As a reader I expect to be emotionally engaged in those decisions but they feel `` heady '' and I 'm consistently emotionally detached . It 's as if the author decided to communicate a passionate demand for justice or personal atonement or a need for society to at least acknowledge the horrors of war by repeatedly writing something like `` S/he felt passionately that something should be done '' . No depth.There are big themes in this book but they just sit there as big themes . My primary impression is that I am reading someone 's research paper dressed up as a novel and that the characters are there to service the information rather than vice versa . Disappointing .	-1
When I bought this book , I guess I expected a book similar to THE HELP ( since Kathryn Stockett had so highly recommended it ) -- one with heart and with characters I could care deeply about . Not so with THE POSTMISTRESS . I agree with the reviewer who said these characters seemed to live on the surface of the story . I never felt connected to any of them , and without some kind of emotional connection , it 's difficult to care . Normally , I love books set against WWII , one of the most fascinating periods of history , but except for Blake 's descriptions of The Blitz and Frankie 's recordings of the displaced Jews fleeing Hitler 's armies , the book was strangely removed . I 've been more involved in newspaper accounts of world events than I was in THE POSTMISTRESS . I did finish the book , but only because I was curious to see how Blake would resolve the various threads . There , too , I was disappointed . Since romantic themes played such an important part of the story , I felt at least one of the characters should have been given a satisfying ending , but no , Blake obviously felt she must be true to literary expectations and give every single character a depressing finish , because after all , unless the characters suffer , how can the book be considered serious ? Certainly Oprah would never pick a book that had any whiff of a happy ending . Recommendation : if you really want to read this book , wait till it comes out in paperback .	-1
After all the excellent reviews I was expecting a well written thrilling novel with great character developement , creative plot lines and insight into modern and 20th century Swedish society . Unfortunately only the first and last parts were somewhat true . The plotting is uneven at best with a storyline that splits in the beginning and very unsatisfactorily comes together , so to speak , in the end . In the middle we are enticed with some thrilling and sometimes gratutisly violent ( an S and M thread that screams plot device ) moments followed by long boring descriptive accounts of international criminal banking , geneology , computer hacking and financial publishing to name few . Characters are early on developed rather well only to become unevolved , stagnant or worse , simplified . The reason I read the entire book is that it does have moments and I hoped it would improve , unfortunately I was wrong . Overall the writing suffers from a lack of editorial economy which is interesting given the fact the main character is both a a writer and an editor .	-1
It starts well with an interesting character in an interesting situation - a journalist found guilty of libel . Then there 's a gigantic family history , including a mysterious disappearance . Then some completely unnecessary scenes of absolute sadism , in which I think in one instance we are supposed to side with the perpetrator . Then more plodding through family relationships . Then it becomes a standard serial killer novel . Finally , there is a wildly implausible , convoluted , embarrassingly bad , uninteresting resolution.Why the fuss about this badly crafted book ?	-1
I had been told that this was a `` you ca n't put it down '' read . I will admit the first couple of chapters were difficult , especially getting used to Sweden names etc ... The overall idea for the story was good but man I was n't expecting such BRUTAL crimes . Multiple rapes and 2 serial killers ? ? I do n't think I will be reading the other books or watch the movies . I skipped over parts because there are some things I read that are difficult to shake .	-1
Like many I wanted to like this book . I was confident it would be the thrilling , clever work of genius that it 's been touted to be . Sadly it was not. ` Dragon Tattoo ' moves at a snail 's pace and has a half dozen plus could-be interesting plotlines that lose steam and eventually sputter out into disjointed meaninglessness or are forgotten altogether.The main protagonist , one Mikael Blomkvist , is a man who alternates between being exasperatingly ignorant and mildly cunning . There are times in the book where you want to reach in and strangle him for not seeing what is right in front of his face and other times you want to shake his hand in congratulations for making a wise decision -- but the latter instances are few and far between.One may think this makes Blomkvist a model character , the everyman rather than some master detective genius type who seems to know and see all . Yet his tendency to make mistakes does not make him seem more human or realistic ; it makes him seem like a clumsy idiot who makes unwise or downright ridiculous decisions that do n't make sense for a character who is supposed to be a journalist well versed in investigation in his late forties.Blomkvist is not a good man . He neglects his daughter , cheated on his wife -- which lead to his divorce , one that he does n't seem to have any feelings about -- has been carrying on a decades-long affair with a married woman ( whose husband is forward thinking and modern enough to be ok with that , apparently -- who also happens to be his business partner -- and strikes up several other affairs with women he would have done better to abstain from . But alas , the women are persistent . Larsson makes sure the women always initiate and leave Blomkvist with no room to resist.His sexual prowess and numerous physical encounters with various women for seemingly no reason at all are a main theme in the book and recurring issue that is never addressed . Blomkvist engages in sexual relationships that are detached and pointless and read more like an older man 's erotic fantasy than a realistic depiction of a character 's exploits . While his own sex scenes are not very descriptive or remotely pornographic , they are numerous . I 'm somewhat lead to believe that Larsson took it upon himself to use this book as a vehicle to not only tell a fictional story , but also of his own fantasies and/or actual sexual exploits.He is all about ethics in his work and in journalism in general but cares not for having such high standards in his personal life . For a paltry sum of about $ 350,000 USD he agrees to cover up the atrocious secrets he uncovers about the Vanger Clan but excuses this glaring ethical violation by claiming that he 's come to know the family too well and does n't want to upset one of his favorite members . A flimsy excuse indeed.And then we have one `` Fr & ouml ; ken '' Lisbeth Salander who is the eponymous ` Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ' and who is given but a fraction of the plot time one would expect . She is smart in some instances but shows severely arrested development in others . She 's violent sometimes without reason -- and often without credibility -- and has a special set of skills that border on absolute superhero-like dexterity . She possesses a photographic memory which -- in the vein of the ` Reluctant Hero ' -- she considers more a less a curse that makes her a freak , even though she makes a good living off of it.But if Mikael Blomkvist is supposed to be realistic , at 5'0 and 90lbs , Lisbeth Salander is a walking talking Deus ex machina , always at hand with an answer or to save the day . It us utterly inconceivable that she would be able to do half of the damage she is either shown or said to have done , even with low-level weaponry at hand . She is not only fierce and strong willed , but whip-smart , extraordinarily tech savvy , rides a motorcycle is skilled in the art of elaborate disguise , foreign accents , is multi-lingual and is willing to engage in open sexual relationships with many people -- not all of them men -- that for the most part remain purely physical without any emotional attachment on her part.She is an outcast , but only because she makes herself so for reasons we are never told . She 's sullen , taciturn ( a word Larsson himself uses several times to describe her ) and often downright rude and still she has dozens of ` friends ' and associates in an intercontinental network willing to break various laws and international treaties at her disposal . She is the ultimate badass whose character teeters perilously close to supernatural incredulity . She is more a caricature than a character , acting out one revenge fantasy after another . She is part male fancy , part superhero to a point that beggars belief.However , though flawed and oftentimes unlikable , I still rooted for her character and found myself sympathizing with throughout . But Stieg Larsson was n't having that . In the span of close nearly 600 pages , Larsson made sure that she suffered a multitude of atrocities and degradation from neglect to molestation to battery to kidnapping culminating in violent sexual assault and sadism that included sodomy and foreign objects . Then it finally ends -- almost as if to pour salt on the wound -- in heartbreak , all at the hands of those who are supposed to have her best interest at heart . And naturally , the few people with whom she is even remotely close to either disappoint her or die.Unfortunately , Blomkvist 's verisimilitude , and Salander 's extraordinary abilities combined can not make this book worth the mental strain it takes to sift through page upon page of mind-numbingly dull dialogue and descriptions of Blomkvist drinking coffee ( which he does ever so often ) , eating sandwiches and having sex ( furious sex , on the work desk no less ) that lead to a listless if not premature climax.But my main gripe is n't even with the ham-handled handling of the climax or the several instances of dialogue that are really little more than exposition . The real issue comes from the long , drawn-out passages regarding financial crime and Hans-Erik Wernnerstr & ouml ; m -- a man we 're obviously supposed to hate but are n't given solid reasons why -- who set his sights on a tiny little financial magazine with a maximum circulation of about 23,000 people . Wernnerstr & ouml ; m is corrupt yes , and towards the end we are quickly told that he has dealings with Russian mobsters , arms dealing and -- just so we 're sure he 's a very bad man -- prostitution . Of course , what with all the horrible men in this book it 's quite hard to hate Wernnerstr & ouml ; m on the level we 're clearly expected to . He never speaks , never appears and is never in direct confrontation with Blomkvist which , if bizarre at the beginning of the book , became a farce at the end.In today 's world , a story about a gangster financier and a multi-million dollar criminal enterprise might have been interesting . A story about a missing , wealthy and sheltered girl who vanished without a trace some forty plus years ago may hold some appeal , but combined , these two things do not a good story make.I 'd like to add , a bit about the clumsy Swedish to English translation . While the book is n't bogged down with translation errors , the translators choice of using terms like 'Herr ' and 'Froken ' rather than Mister or Miss become an annoyance that frequently reminds the reader that they are indeed reading a translated work . Also , be aware that this is a translation from Swedish to British English and as an American reader , prepare yourself for some terms like 'lift ' for elevator , flat as opposed to apartment and unfamiliar spellings of simple words like 'tyre ' and 'gaol ' for tire and jail .	-1
THIS BOOK DID N'T GET STARTED UNTIL ABOUT PAGE 250 . AND EVEN AFTER THAT , HE IS WAY TOO VERBOSE WITH ALOT OF USELESS DESCRIPTIONS , TOO MANY CHARACTERS AND UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED EXPLANATIONS . IN ADDITION TO THAT , EVERY OTHER PAGE ( I 'M EXAGGERATING ) SOMEONE IS MAKING COFFEE . I 'LL BET THE WORD COFFEE SHOWS UP ABOUT 1,000 TIMES . IT IS PAGE-TURNING IN PARTS BUT ALL IN ALL , THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN HALF THE SPACE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER .	-1
I could not get into this book . I read about 20 chapters and it was so slow . I knew where it was leading but could not stick with it . Not sure how it is a best seller .	-1
These books by Stieg Larson are terribly over-rated . His writing style is awful and hard to keep up with , not to mention the reader can not even pronounce all the 'foreign ' names . As a result the reader does n't absorb the story . I hated this book and did not read past the 2nd chapter .	-1
Okay , i 'll admit right now that i could n't get all the way through this book . It reads like its somewhere between a feminist propoganda puff piece produced by SCUM & a self defeatist white hetrosexual male shame decleration : Which is not suprising considering its author is from Sweden.It honestly appears like every single woman in this book is a victim of some sort of sexual assualt , an every single man is some sort of sexual predator . Heck the main character is apparently so charismatic ( though frankly , i 'm not seeing it ) , that every female character either wants to have sex with him , or falls madly in love with him ... An those who do n't do this , secretly have but are fighting off these feelings for some stupidly `` feminist logic '' reason.I mean Lisbeth Salander is revealed to have been raped , which we are all meant to agree is terrible ... She then rapes the guy right on back & we are meant to some how be cheering for this character ? This really was misandric tripe from start to finish , self defeatist white hetrosexual male shame decleration by an author with deep seated unresolved guilt issues over his own part in a rape on a teenage girl with the name of Lisbeth ( hmmmmmm , i wonder who her animus in the novel is ? Its very well disguised ) .As for technical quality , this book is appaling . About one third of it is exposition , with some of the sickest logic & most twisted justifications for actions i 've ever seen in a novel.Yes there is a whole heap of hype aorund this novel ... All the same avoid it like the plague .	-1
For me , this book was too detailed and too confusing to get much enjoyment out of it . After more than 1/2 the way through , I decided to call it quits . I have heard so many people say they liked this book very much , so I assume it is not that poorly written , but if readers have to keep going back to reread sections so it makes sense , they willprobably find it less enjoyable .	-1
This book ponderingly slow . It has one of the worst heroines in lisbeth salander in all of literature . At times I was waiting for her to leap a tall building in single bound . This will be the last Larson novel I read what a waste of time .	-1
I was interested where Larsson was going to take the story . Apparently it was to boring meetings with dry dialog . I was really let down by the CSI like mello-drama surrounding the first half of the story . bottom line : I probably would not recommend this as a follow up to the first book . it was just too boring .	-1
I enjoyed this book much more than I did The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo . That is not to say that I loved it , though . I found the plot of this novel to be better and more engaging . However , I find these books to be extremely long winded and bogged down in details that really do n't affect the primary plot.This book did nothing to help me like/enjoy the characters anymore than I did with the first novel . The bottom line is that these books are just not for me . I wo n't be reading the third book in this series . I know many people have enjoyed these novels , but I am simply not one of them . I would recommend getting these books from the library if you are compelled to read them .	-1
Did n't read the first book , and after reading this one , have no interest in the 3rd.So , having not read the first one , this is a reviw of The Girl Who Played with Fire , as a stand alone novel.Plot spoilers may be contained herein , I 'm not actually sure ... And yes , I AM being snarky for the first part of the review.However , it illustrates the idea that book needed editing ; and perhaps more effort put into it 's translation into the english language.here we go.Some little tiny girl named Svenson , with a big tattoo and a brand new boob job has a troubled past , and is treated poorly by men , all of which were named Svenson , or perhaps Sverngensen.We get great detail into past poor treatment by the men.She 's framed for a crime against someone named Svenson ( or perhaps Svergensen ) , a writer who was about to release an expose about someone named Svenson , which makes sense since Svenson is little troubled girl Svenson 's dad.She is pursued by the local police , all of which were named ... Svenson . There was a dirty cop , however . His name might have been Svergensen . In addition to the police , she 's pursued by her dad , the aforementioned Svenson , and some Bond movie henchman who is her half brother . Guess what HIS name is.The lead male protagonist , Svenson , does not believe that Svenson / Svergensen the tattoo 'd girl committed the crime against Svenson , and does what he can to help prove this , all whilst nailing his boss , Svergensen.He thinks the accused is troubled , and maladjusted , and maybe dangerous , but not a killer of anyone named Svenson.Oh , he nailed her , too , before he started nailing his boss . And she 's mad at him for it , I think . She does not speak well of him , for sure.Oh , and the really short tattoo 'd chick with new boobs ? all she has to do is put on a wig , and she 's unrecognizable by the entire population of Sweden , though her face is plastered ... everywhere.And there was lots of stopping off at 7-11 for random meals , smoking cigarettes , drinking cup after cup of coffee , and a trip to Ikea to furnish a big , shiny apartment , likely located on Svenson street.We spend more time reading about the Ikea trip and the delivery of her purchases , than we would actually spend ... in Ikea.By the time she crawls , bullet-ridden , from her own grave to win the day , I was long past caring.I finished this out of pure stubbornness.The book was at it 's best early on , before the plot moved back to Sweden.Early on , there was action on a tropical island , populated by people with different , non-interchangable last names . I could keep track without graph paper.And what transpired there seemed more concisely written.Of COURSE I exaggerate.But only a little.Lose the 7-11 stops ; the pages of writing that did nothing for the plot or character development ; the far-fetched fight sequences , and the amateurish use of coffee and cigarettes to fill character 's time on the page.Drop a lot of the secondary characters in favor of further developing the primary characters.In other words , this book would have done well to have had someone work on the focus , a bit.Ok , a lot .	-1
This book had an interesting concept and storyline , but the style in which it was carried out was confusing and detrimental to the plot and the concentration of the reader . Even the conclusion makes one wonder where the story went . Why and how did the person who wound up with the money get it ? Those questions are just left hanging in dealing with an internet scam that begins with a father 's death after he has lost his family 's home and savings.There are 3 and even 4 scenarios set up at times . Many of the foreign words and sayings are not explained ; even the included glossary is no real help . Scenes pop back and forth and at places you have to read far into the scene to even know what character is being dealt with.Even after reading all the book one still does not know why a pregnant woman was walking in the desert with a jerry can.It is a revelation to see how these internet scams work and look into the world of those who are trying to pull them off but that is overwhelmed by the constant shifts and jumps in place and with the characters . What is the purpose of all these fluctuations ? They are tied together in the final pages but not in a very satisfying manner .	-1
No dead man , you will not be read `` 100 years from now . `` No , you were never a `` genius '' that nominator is for the applied sciences and complex , theoretical mathematics.Just say no to `` Infinite Jest '' predicated on a missing film that needs to stay missing , or rather excised entirely from the plot because a teenager could have easily imagined David Foster Wallace 's `` the Entertainment '' and put it to better use in a video game.The Suicidal Embrace . This happens when any supposed `` artist '' ( I 'm not singling out Wallace in particular ) comes to realize a diabolical reality . It is this : Insanity is believing a human being can create art.Just as Virginia Woolf waded the River Stone , Hemingway oiled his shotgun in preparation and Wallace did indeed fly for a moment , so too it will always be : suicide is made strong , will go on via its singularity of repetitiveness and endlessly , tirelessly it leads to the next man waiting in self-murderous solitude.Chris Roberts , God of Self-Murder	-1
It might be my fault , but this is one of two books in my lifetime that I failed to finish . I found the first 100 pages or so very tedious and the characters such caricatures that I could not force myself to go on .	-1
I finally somehow managed to finish Snow Falling on Cedars after reading it on and off for months . Guterson is a master of verbal torture , he somehow manages to find a way of describing even the simplest of things , like a snowy tree , using five paragraphs.Eliminate these redundant and tedious descriptions from the text , and you 'll probably be left with about fifty pages ( I 'm serious ) . When you 're finally near the end , and are anticipating the the surprise ending that may make all the painful reading worthile , Guterson slaps you in the face with an ending so predictable it 'll make you feel like an idiot for reading the entire book.I wonder what the readers who gave it five-star reviews ( which made me buy it in the first place ) were thinking . Have they all never seen snow before ?	-1
I was very disappointed in the product quality of this book . Amazon stated this was a Hardcover Book . When I received the book , it is the size of a paperback . The print is very small ! ! And the cover is `` cardboard '' quality , it has no book jacket ! Amazon should have been clearer on the type of book that this was . ( I do love the story . - It is just the product . )	-1
-- only made it to page 30 . I did NOT care what happened to anyone and found the plot too convoluted to hold my interest .	-1
It amazes me that English readers have managed to rave about this book through the fog of what I consider one of the worst translations I 've ever witnessed . Please , please , someone re-translate this book so the English audience can really taste it !	-1
I wish I could get my money back , and the time spent trying to muddle through this wreck of a novel . I did n't mind the style of writing so much as the lack of character . This novel is a great concept VERY poorly executed . I am not a 'rose colored glasses ' kind of person who needs fluff and redemption to a happy ending . What I want from a novel is that it possess character and substance of purpose . This book has little to none of either ... a big disappointment considering the potential of the concept.The suggestion throughout this book that to be blind is to be dead , or even to be better off dead is absurd . The most well defined character retains her sight but to say that she is the most defined character is not to say that there is much developed or explored here . The blind characters are almost like cardboard cutouts -- bland , blank and deprived of any personal and human quality . It 's as if to make the point that ` the eyes are the windows to the soul ' the author deprives them of their personal and collective soul.I find this insulting to the lives of those who are blind . I am not blind , but I have lost one of my five senses , and I know that does n't make me any less alive . Does it make my life harder ? You bet . But such losses do n't erase our inherent character and , perhaps , a case could be made that such losses strengthen character or , at least , carry with them that potential.I get that the situation they all find themselves in is desperate , filthy , inhumane and destructive . Of course they would be plunged into despair and 'survival of the fittest ' mentalities , but this book that had great potential falls flat in relating this story . The author was either too lazy or unqualified to tackle this concept with deftness , and the vital depth of insight it needed.It occurs to me that my accusation that the author was n't up to the task of this storytelling may not be a fair assessment . Perhaps , in the translation from his language to the English version much of the character and substance was lost . This is n't something I could know , not knowing his language , but is a possibility .	-1
As all of the previous reviewers have said , this is a well researched book . The subject matter is almost intrinsically interesting - pirates , the history of a growing New Orleans , historical conflicts in Louisiana and the United States , et cettera . The book is well documented with careful footnotes , though at times ( and especially at the outset ) one is confronted with many uncertain but probable or possible pieces of history ( perhaps this is to be expected , or at least understood as necessary , given the general lack of definitive or authoritative sources on the subject ) .However , unlike other reviewers , I 've found this text to be very poorly written and painful to read . The book is riddled with unclear and poorly written sentences ( `` Pierre Laffite probably visited there with his friends from earlier days when in New Orleans , though most likely he did not meet Marie Louise Villard there , but at one of Coquet 's or Tessier 's balls '' ) and sentences in which the tense needlessly shifts from past to present and back again ( `` Pierre may not have entered into a formal placage arrangement with Marie Villard , for among other things he seems hardly able to afford the upkeep of a woman in New Orleans , but very soon she and Laffite began a relationship that would last for the next sixteen years '' ) . Suffice it to say , Mr. Davis would have been well served by a better editor.The history is engaging ; the writing makes it painful .	-1
_____I could 've sworn I wrote up a full and decent review of this bland blathering book some time ago ... Well , whatever : With some minutes before dinner , I 'll just recap my thoughts on this text . It truly was boring for one thing . For another thing , the book was tangental -- always and again popping from one branching plot development to another . Top it all off with how this book reads more like an anthology with a short attention span , and it does not even qualify as a novel . Having MENDOZA IN HOLLYWOOD published as a novel is something like labeling oatmeal a sweet and putting it on the candy-store shelf : a deceptive thing to do._____The deception begins when we get to meet a truly awesome set of characters -- awesome a great selection of ways . The main protatonists are cyborgs . Meaning , they have computer-enhanced brains with access to remote knowledge , have bodies endowed with super powers , and they are immortal . One would expect a mighty assemblage of immortal cyborgs to be put to some amazing and appropriate test of abilties . One would therefore expect rip-roaring science fiction . So you are led to believe , ladies and gentlemen , so you are led to believe ... _____OF COURSE YOU DO N'T GET AN AWESOME BOOK . This book , after the first several chapters , degenerates into a haphazard series of events that involve characters alternating between investigating the antics of gun-toting locals and watching movies . That 's right : the super-duper immortal cyborgs spend maybe as much time munching popcorn and watching movies as they do in actually DOING something . I 'll tell you what : If I was an immortal cyborg with super-powers and was sent back in time on a mission , you would not catch me wasting half of my time eating buttered maize . That , and my attention would focus on ONE PLOT DEVELOPMENT AT A TIME._____Yes , in terms of plot development , the book has a hard time getting and keeping a plot . So the protagonist is first sent to collect rare plants . Then the protagonist decides to go help sell some pie-safes . And then the protagonist investigates a time-cave thing ( a la Stephen King 's DARK TOWER series ) . This then meanders into the protagonist deciding to part-time it as a prostitute ... among other things . Only at the very freaking tail-end of this donkey of a book do we a coherent and finalizing plot development -- that which leads to the main protagonist 's professional downfall . It was as if this book was just made up as it was being typed with no real sense of direction . By the way , we all know what comes out the tail-end of a donkey , right ? That would pretty much match the quality of this book 's construction -- plotless , meandering , and pointless._____By the way , before folks think that I 'm just a lone-star madman out to slam random sci-fi novels , have a look at comments posted by other reviewers regarding MENDOZA IN HOLLYWOOD . Was this book boredom-inducing -- as claimed by another reviewer ? Why , YES it was ! `` Meandering , '' somebody else said that . I 'll drink to that sentiment as well . Was there a problem with only the best development in the book happening at the VERY END -- like say , in the last seventy pages ? I see that same problem , and I 'll raise you a five-dollar gold-piece to boot . If you do n't believe my cinnamon-tinged verbal antics regarding the awfulness of this book 's plotlessness , then you are very welcome to browse around at other reviewers ' posts . This guy is not alone in slamming this book._____Maybe the only saving grace of this book was that it had a coherent writing style . What do I mean by that ? Well , there is a problem with a lot of the science fiction novels out of the 1990s . Maybe it is a problem with LSD , because a lot of novels from that decade and beyond have an acid-trip style of writing : writing styles so crazed and incoherent that a person has to pick through the pages like a psychiatrist digging through the dialogue of a serial killer or something . Damien Broderick , Julian May , those are just two authors that come to mind when it comes to mindless madness and senselessness in writing . Kage Baker actually managed to stay coherent for the duration of MENDOZA IN HOLLYWOOD . For that reason , I gave the book two stars instead of one . Now I 'm off to get my dinner -- not popcorn . And somebody get this book something to make it more focused .	-1
This book requires you to spend hundreds of pages inside the head of a violent psychopathic alcoholic who uses murder and double-crossing to get ahead . Apparently he 's supposed to be sympathetic because he 's too self-centered to actually believe in the Nazi cause he advances so brutally . Lots of sex that is either commercial , manipulative or outright rape.From time to time the narrative switches to a mystery set in 1990s Lisbon , and it takes until about page 250 before the storylines interconnect . But because so few pages are devoted to the modern mystery , it never gets going -- it 's little more than a novella , and not at all mysterious.This book has received rave reviews and prizes mainly , I think , because a lot of people like to identify with the Nazi brute . It 's a fantasy of power , rather like a Schwarzenegger movie , with the difference that in this case you 're asked to identify with the bad guy.This would be an excellent book to read if you 're looking for something to buck up your resolution to kill yourself . After reading it , you would feel perfectly justified in concluding that every human being is a monster , all virtue is a sham , and success is never anything but the reward of treachery.The writing is a notch above the merely competent , which is why it gets two stars instead of one .	-1
This book defies genre categories : a mixture of horror and science fiction , but presented in a seductive manner . By the time you realize what this book is about , it is as if you saw a horrific auto accident and are unable to turn your eyes away . It will make you sick to your stomach : seriously . For fans of `` The Crimson Petal and the White '' , this is very different territory . If you are a fan of Stephen King or Camus , you might like this book .	-1
When will they learn that raunchy sex/violence does not make up for poor writing . I have never disliked a character more than little Miss Mary Suanders . I kept hoping the story would pick up , have something redeeming to share , but NO ! I am sure the point was to make a social commentary of the life of this poor lost girl , but the author just did not write a compelling storyline . IMHO	-1
The Life of Pi started irritating me from the get-go ; how someone can insist that ALL religions are good and compatible always riles me . Can they not do the simplest of research and see the contradictions ? The stupid statement about how Jesus is a prophet in Islam and some people say he 's buried in Kashmir is not an argument for universality - if Christians claim him to be the word made flesh , he 's not a prophet and he ca n't be buried ! All it exposes us how superficial Pi 's Christianity is ! How can Pi reconcile his continued polytheistic Hindu faith when the statement of belief in Islam is there is no God but Allah ? I wish I knew more if Hindu tenets just to see how Pi violates them.I want to thank the multitude of reviewers in amazon , even if they did give away the ending . Ye have saved me time , and thank you to those of you who brought up Max and the Cats , a book I 'm desperate to read now ( and will be severely annoyed if it turns out to be a better book ! That 's the inferior copy gaining more attention than the original ! ) I did n't like my experience of Martel 's other work , Beatrice and Virgil . I found him too self-absorbed as a writer ( books are always from a writer 's POV ) , and if the ultimate moral here is to make your own truth , then to follow this shallow `` philosophy '' is to embrace schizophrenic sadists - they are living their own truth , after all .	-1
The kid does n't even get on the boat until about halfway through the book . The attempt to wrap readers up in the trio of religions was lost on me . Page upon page upon page of gore . Hyena eating a still-living zebra- please spare me . And the island with its lovely surprise ? Even though it may have been a figment of imagination , it was just a bit much . And , then , the ending failed terribly to redeem itself . Not a book for me-sorry .	-1
I have read the Life of Pi and found it quite the fantasy . ( SPOILER ALERT ) If you read to the end you will see that Pi admits to making it all up so he would n't have to confront what horribleness really occurred . A sad tale with really no take-away wisdom . The inside cover of the book makes the insane claim that this book may make you believe in God . There is nothing in the book that would substantiate that ludicrous statement . The book is well written and if you are interested in the difference between the two and three toed sloth , you will enjoy the first half . If you like fantasy , you will like the second half .	-1
I am sure the movie is a tour de force of special effects , but sadly think Hollywood has gone astray again in thinking they have their hands on an & # 34 ; important & # 34 ; story that has some deeper meaning . Sadly , it does not . I found very little about the character of Pi to be life affirming or morally informing . Other than the fact that this made-up character is supposed to have survived a ship sinking ( not really a spoiler as they give that away in the first chapter or so ) , I do n't see anything especially significant about this . Read Kon-Tiki if you want a gripping survival story that actually happened . Additionally , this is not a story about altrustic devotion . The only reason the tiger does n't get kicked off the boat right away is because he ca n't figure out how to get rid of him . If you love animals , do n't read this . About every second page or so , another animal bites the dust . I found it very disturbing . The final chapter adds in some strange psychological nonesense to give it a twist . In my opinion , the twist is lame and if you accept the twist as being this character 's truth , then it nullifies everything else you just slogged through reading in the entire story ! The only bright side is that having read the story and found it devoid of significance , I saved myself from having wasted the time and money seeing it in the theater . Were I a book editor or a studio exec , I would have dumped this one in the slag pile .	-1
I was disappointed in this book . The dialogue was stilted , the plot relied to heavily on coincidence , the pacing was off , and characters were too unidimensional . Great idea , though . I believe this is a first novel ; perhaps subsequent efforts will be better .	-1
Have you ever wanted to listen to someone 's every thought ? Neither have I . But that 's what Eco gives us in The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana . A strange and mysterious title that promises some fascinating discovery . Instead we partake in a man 's journey to rediscover his past and nothing else . Our protagonist nicknamed `` Yambo '' ( what an ugly nickname ) suffered some `` incident '' as a result of which he has lost part of his memory , namely that part that pertains to his emotional subjective life . He has retained however his objective downright encyclopedic memory of the world . He does n't connect with anything the he 's supposed to have feelings for , but his mind spews out expanded definitions , poems in various languages , literature , song lyrics , prayers , etc . He works as an antique book dealer , which could lead to exciting esoteric business , but it doesn't.To reconnect and hopefully regain his emotional memory he travels to his summer vacation home , which was also used as such during his childhood . There he finds books , magazines , records , and assorted junk from his parents and grandparents . That 's what the largest section of this book `` Paper Memories '' deals with . An apt title for this dreadful section where Yambo goes through each box takes out every item and describes it . When you hope it will come to an end , he discovers a secret chapel ( ! ) in his house , and more rooms with more boxes of course . And just as you think he 's running out of boxes , there 's another one , and another one ... Yambo , too , struggles with the name of the rose , I mean , the name of the girl of his first infatuation , and more importantly , he ca n't remember her face . Eventually he does what any reasonable person would have done from the beginning , ask his childhood friend . Finally , he finds a valuable book which mercifully puts and end to the lame paper memories.But that book also puts him back in the hospital again . And this time around , Yambo 's life comes back to him , chronologically ; nothing significant but some dull episodes of discovery , war , fascism . And to make sure there 's no real action going on , Eco , puts his character in some vegetative state , where all he has is his past to occupy him- again . It 's like re-reading the previous section but from the first person perspective , while `` Paper Memories '' was written from the perspective of an unconnected observer.Around 100 pages before the end , finally we get another voice . Yambo recalls an episode during the war where he meets some guy who asks him for help in rescuing some resistance guys before the Germans get them . The little Yambo performs his mission heroically and it also confronts him for the first time with death . Here we finally get some interesting philosophical bits about religion.I got this book when it first came out , but put it aside after reading the first chapter . This time around , years later , I forced myself to read it in the hopes it would be worthwhile after all . It was n't . I ended up glancing over paragraphs , my eyes looking for any hint that something interesting would happen.A man endowed with a remarkable memory like Eco writing about a man with no memory is of course ironic but it could also be Eco 's journey of trying to discover the mystery behind his memory . As the sources of the images provided in this book point out , Eco is also a hoarder of old stuff . So I think we are allowed to draw parallels between Yambo and Eco . And this book is a typical circumspect way of Eco telling us about his youth , a veiled autobiography of mostly irrelevant events . Unfortunately , Yambo is n't nearly as interesting as Eco . And that is a terrible weakness in a book- to give us a main character for which the reader ca n't care . Another weakness is that this book tells nothing but what goes on in Yambo 's head . How can anyone without memory not want to discover himself through the world and re-discover things about the world and others he has forgotten . Not Yambo , he isolates himself and us in his past , which is n't remotely interesting or entertaining . But more than anything this is a book were Eco also breaks with his past as a writer . No more excitement , no more fascinating adventures , no more fantastic events , no more esotericism , no more play with languages , no more humor . Although there was plenty of opportunity to turn this book into a page-turner , Eco avoids it . At least he could have given us some interesting cooking recipes from the 20s and 30s . Instead we get a lot of tedious thought processes that go nowhere . Such as Yambo rehearsing all sorts of imaginary scenarios of him and his beautiful assistant . He 's been told he 's a ladies man and that he cheats on his loving wife , so he speculates endlessly about how he could have gotten involved with the girl . For every piece of junk he finds in a box , his mind concocts hypothesis of who used it and how it was used . He speculates endlessly about how this or that may have affected him in his childhood.Sure , even this book retains some of Eco 's charm , but just some of it . And it is endearing to read about a main character in a coma and reaching the unavoidable . Unfortunately , there 's so few ideas , so little abstract thought , almost nothing to learn here , but the names of stuff that mattered to Eco decades ago .	-1
I purchased this book for my book club . While interesting , it is not my typical read . We have not yet discussed the book .	-1
American Stomach is a real mess . It 's a rambling hodge-podge of ideas and topics as they occur ( very randomly ) to the author . The topics themselves have very little to them . It 's mostly ruminations that are hard to follow , with very little meat . The author seems most intent on impressing the reader with his vocabulary , literary allusions , and cleverness . Transitions from one topic to another were particularly jarring and haphazard.Here 's a sample of what you can expect : '' American religion , American economics , American politics , and American media had all been devoured by the great maw . At the Plymouth harvest dinner reenactment [ the topic of the chapter ] , where nothing was real except the food , the primal , eldest origins of the country had met the American stomach and gone down the hatch too . And still , the enteric brain pushed forward . It wanted more . `` Breezy , clever-sounding - but what does it all mean , if anything ?	-1
I 've never thought highly of sequels , and this book certainly lived down to that tacit outlook . But I have to admit that I still maintained a cautiously high expectation when I chose to read Seeing , having been written by Saramago , currently on my Top Ten list of favorite authors . The pedigree of the author kept me reading to the end , hoping for some redeeming value to the long hours spent getting through this ( hours I 'll never get back ) , but I 've been left with precious little positive to say.This novel takes place in the unspecified capital of an unspecified Western country ( Lisbon , Portugal ) , four years after the end of the blind plague , an event that Saramago so masterfully documented for us in the extraordinary Blindness . The problem afflicting this nation now is directed toward the government . An overwhelming majority of the population has seen fit to cast a `` blank '' vote during elections , and the officials in office find little recourse with which to fight back . This takes us through one unrealistic situation to another , where those in power seek to find ways to dispel phantom conspiracies by casting suspicion upon others.As he did before in Blindness , the author manages to get through the entire book without mentioning anyone by name . People are most commonly referred to by their title or civil status ( wife of , and such ) . I found that technique worked well in the former novel , but poorly in this one . He seemed to be dragging it out as much as possible ; seeing how far he could take things . It felt like he was trying too hard.But the biggest shortcoming this book has is its lack of story . There is simply nothing of interest going on . The people opted to cast blank votes . Great . So what ? There is a sense that the blank voting is taking place due to apathy , but we never get to see that side of the coin , Only the government 's take . This just drags on aimlessly until an ending is forcefully concocted and the book mercifully concludes.The bottom line is that this was an unnecessary book , particularly for such an accomplished writer . I believe his name would have been better served had he not written it and I would have been better served not having read it .	-1
A somewhat shy and reclusive fisheries scientist in Britain is contacted through the British government bureaucracy by a Yemeni sheikh for the absurd project of creating a salmon industry in his country . Meanwhile , his childless marriage to a successful economist is crumbling.This book has been a huge success but I must say I was n't too impressed with it . It is supposed to be a satire , but I did n't find it particularly funny or witty , or even well written for that matter . While it is easily read , the characters lack depth . I think the book has some amusing insights about such matters as the absurd workings of the British bureaucracy , the difficulties in a modern marriage when the wife is more professionally successful than the husband , the insularity of much scientific research and the general uselessness ( not to mention smugness ) of much of international cooperation projects , but this could have been much better written .	-1
I have always enjoyed the subject matter of this book . Ever since I was a kid , it is interesting to me how some people seemed to be able to get others to do anything , while others cant talk water out of a Fireman . When I had the opportunity to get an advanced copy of this book I jumped at it.There is a lot of valuable information in this book . The author is obviously knowledgeable on the subject . The problem is that the author goes into too much detail , way too much . What should have been , in my opinion , a couple page intro into persuasion in the animal world , just seemed to go on and on and on . The book continued that way.It seems as though the author was writing a doctoral thesis or item for publishing in a peer reviewed journal . This would be an excellent book for resource if you were writing a college paper on the subject . For casual reading and insight , this book is just too long winded.I was personally hoping for a slightly deeper version ofInfluence : Science and Practice ( 5th Edition ) or something along those lines . WhileInfluence : Science and Practice ( 5th Edition ) is a must read in my mind , I personally wanted to go a bit deeper , but not as deep as this book took me .	-1
This is a strange book , and I 'm not even sure why I finished it , except that it is a short , fast read . The device of having Changez speak the whole time is odd . His love interest is just bizarre . He continues to pursue her , even though she clearly is emotionally unavailable . Finally , I could not figure out what happened at the very end of the book . I would really like to know if anyone thinks they know what happened in the final scene of the book .	-1
I am not shy about criticizing US foreign policy and our nation 's hubris . There are many legitimate reasons to dislike the US government . This book is based on none of them . In contrast to millions of people around the world , the protagonist was issued a visa to come to the US , attended one of the top colleges in the US and was selected over hundreds of applicants for a plum US job with a high salary . He is surrounded by people who like him , look out for him and care for him . Yet when the 9/11 attacks happen , he smiles and is pleased . Why ? He does n't really say - it appears to be based on his personal , cultural identity crisis and a reference to American belligerence ( which , though true , is not tied in personally to the protagonist at all ) . He seethes with anger when the US attacks the Taliban in Afghanistan . He apparently but inexplicably sympathizes with his murderous , iron-fisted , women-hating neighbors . This book seems to have been written in a hurry , the author neglecting to provide any legitimate foundation for the protagonist 's antipathy to the US . Certainly it could have been done and the reader is truly left wondering why the author chose to omit history in favor of assuming that the reader would agree the protagonist 's feelings were justified . It is particularly confusing when told from the viewpoint of a well-educated , supposedly intellectual man who should have seen that hard diplomacy is a much sharper weapon than violence.I found the author 's writing style ( the protagonist speaking to a man with no voice and no apparent reason to be there other than as an excuse to poke more fun at Americans ) annoying and disruptive of what little flow the book had . Another stylistic tool - the dash ! - is ubiquitous and entirely distracting . Truly , this book could have been so much more had the author put more time ( and perhaps research ) into it . It could have been a bridge to explain to a mass audience Muslims ' frustration with America . It utterly fails in this regard and in the end I fear it will only be used as fuel by those who believe that Islam is a violent faith .	-1
I really wanted to enjoy this book . It sounded like a cute story but it was a little too bland . The story never really picks up and it turns to every cliche possible . Oh well .	-1
The book feels more like a series of vignettes . The chapters feel somewhat disconnected . The historical context was interesting . What I really disliked was several quite unbelievable plot twists . Some events portrayed are too far fetched and take away from the overall story.Interesting at times but hard to recommend .	-1
This book just does n't measure up to Cook 's usual standard . S-l-o-w pacing and a dislikeable lead character in the static form of Lucas Page combine to make this a truly lamentable effort . It 's nearly impossible to care about Page and his family 's dismal history -- all brought to the fore by the rather hapless Lola Faye . And the resolution ... Never mind ! Read Cook 's early books . This one never gels .	-1
This book had a lot of promise . The plot sounded interesting , as it is premised on French women traveling to the New World to marry colonists . Unfortunately , only the premise was interesting . The execution was terrible and I could only bear to read about half of it before I decided to read something else . Life is too short to waste on a bad book ! The book centers on two main characters . Elisabeth is one of the girls who travels to France and falls in love - the author tells us this , but never shows us - despite her skepticism about her prospects in New France . It jumps from portraying Elisabeth as a reluctant participant in the venture to a snotty , love-sick wife . The book also deals with Auguste , a young French boy who travels to New France and ends up living with the Native Americans.I just got so bored with Elisabeth 's whining and disatissfaction . She alienates everyone around her . I also could not enjoy her infatuation wtih her husband as it came out of nowhere . Auguste 's parts were really boring and I just did n't care about him.Thus , I did something I rarely do and abandoned the book .	-1
I bought this book because my book club was reading it . I did n't much care for the movie and I found the book even less appealing . It was a boring and dissappointing tale about a group of people who are n't even well enough developed for you to care about . I particularly did n't like the author 's device of pretending to be abridging a book he had enjoyed having read to him as a child . What a cowardly device ! ! I do n't have the courage to admit that this is my own work just in case you do n't like it . If you do n't like my book I can always blame the supposed original author .	-1
Very , very , very few movies are better than the book . Having watched The Princess Bride approximately 546 times , I thought it was high time to read the actual book . I thought it was high time to read the actual book . A few years I go , I took the leap and assumed , of course , it would be just as riveting.It is still inconceivable to me that the book was such a far cry from the magic of the movie . After I finished reading it , I almost cried . No , wait , I actually did cry.The book and film essentially tell the same storyline . The author writes two stories in one ; one tale is a archetypal fairy tale adventure , the other one is a contemporary story of how such timeless fantasies keep us spellbound , no matter our age , location or shoe size.The Princess Bride has includes so many themes it 's hard to keep up , but that 's part of the adventure . True Love , Revenge , Giants , Poison , Brave Men , Beautiful Women , Rodents , Torture.Let me sum up . Princess Buttercup and servant boy Wesley embark upon a true love story . Life circumstances initially draw them apart , yet ultimately they come together in fairy-tale romance style through a series of clever trials and tribulations . Inigo Montoya and Prince Humperdinck excel as supporting antagonist characters , contributing to the witty banter that ensues throughout the movie and film.Things happen along the way . Miracle Max comes to the rescue to revive Wesley after he is tortured and supposedly dead . Ant then finally , Buttercup and Wesley are reunited because nothing can stop True Love.Essentially , the plot and themes of the book and movie are the same . What I could not cope with was Goldman 's use of the fictional tale of the author . Yes , those parts were italicized , but if I wanted to go from one `` scene '' to the next , I had to wade through 50 pages just to get there . Major detraction . The only stylistic credit I 'll give to Goldman is his masterful use of the run-on sentence.Come to think of it , I think I 'll do a review soon that is a 500-word run-on sentence and see if anyone notices.No , reading The Princess Bride did n't put me off books forever . It just reminded me that I had to go back to the beginning.Check out my other reviews at : [ ... ]	-1
the scribe just finished , after a true reader 's via crucis , the long and impressive `` The Name of the Rose '' by Umb & eacute ; rto Eco.The book came to him through his old man , whom got it from somebody he works with at the California Workers ' Compensation Insurance Fund.the scribe has always wanted to read the book : first , for its beguiling name , second for all the great covers depicting a deep medieval ambience , and third because Eco is an Italian intellectual , which the scribe believes makes them kindred spirits , if not seriously linked at some unseen level of things.Nonetheless , the book was more a labor than a love . The beguiling name , it turns out , was chosen for how little it revealed . We know this because Eco has penned a considerable `` postscript '' in excess of 30 pages.If the scribe were allowed that kind of indulgence he would n't take it , because that would be explaining the book . You can explain a book a little - the scribe 's adaption of passages from `` Vedette '' to the wonderful music of Omar Torrez are a case in point - but not too much , as least not as much as Eco has.After all , you 've written a book and that should be explanation enough.The author opens the P.S . with some observations on how titles can give a book away , or worse , mislead readers , and has some fun with classic titles that even a guy as famous as he should n't , at least out of false humility , compare his own book to . `` Perhaps , '' he writes , `` the best course is to be honestly dishonest , as Dumas was : It is clear that ` The Three Musketeers ' is , in reality , the tale of the fourth . `` He chose `` The Name of the Rose '' because , `` the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left ... The title rightly disoriented the reader , who was unable to choose just one interpretation ... '' Which is to say the scribe was tricked , which is no small trick.Beguiled by a title not the book 's own , the scribe hoped the promise of medieval culture , the repairing to a quiet soul-enriching world of chants and hooded monks , grassy quads spreading over a scholastic abbey peopled by pure men , held firm.And there , Eco , a self-described medievalist , keeps his promise , but to the point of distraction.Eco leaves no middle-aged stone unturned and ultimately bludgeons the reader with facts , architectural essays to the minutest detail , and historical reviews of sectarian battles in the Catholic Church of that time so that the story itself seems an afterthought.At least so it seemed to the guy writing this book report who remained focused and oriented through repeated playings of `` Chant : The Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos . `` Among the problems are a cast of monks ( Jorge of Burgos , Salamander of Sweden ) too long and too difficult to distinguish from one another so that you - or maybe just the scribe - have to just kind of trundle along with the ensemble , taking them in and listening when they reappear without ever being sure when their last showing was , or what its narrative significance is.Eco 's architecture leaves something to be desired as well . The narrative , such as it is , meanders along over a few macabre murders and some confusing visits to the impenetrable library of the abbey in which it is set , as co-protagonist William , and the narrator/voice Adso , traverse great swatches of Catholic/European history in conversations most remarkable for the distance between start and end.When Adso takes a backseat to Ubertino , or the Abbot , or one of the many other hooded theologians peopling the interminable text , the form is imposed anew as two elderly men talk at each other in pages-long dissertations that make `` The Sidewalk Smokers Club '' seem like a snappy , noir-yarn shorn of all excess ( which it 's not ) .By this the scribe means to say that if Umberto Eco were not Umberto Eco , and instead were master of the highwayscribery universe , this book might never have seen the light of day , let alone become a bestseller . `` Story of the Rose , '' does have a number of messages and that 's fair reward for someone who grants Eco the respect we are told he 's due and stays the course.What the scribe took from it was a reinforcement of his perception regarding the savagery in European man and the endless and senseless deaths sacrificed to the Christian mono-God.As a non-believer the scribe finds it absolutely astounding that millions of people lost their lives to men of the kind portrayed here , and the cruelty of those deaths horrifying.And it really happened.Eco 's a smart man who 's trying to tell us something about the inquisitorial urge , its unstoppable momentum and irrefutable logic ( they have God on their side ) , as well as the poor uses to which ostensibly spiritual mechanisms have been put to use since the pagan world collapsed.May God help us .	-1
I knew , prior to reading this book , that I did n't like Harold Bloom.I 've encountered him over the years , primarily when he 's condescended to comment on `` popular literature , '' to inform us that we do n't really know what we 're about and are reading the wrong stuff.I 've always believed though that to truly have license to hate something , a fair hearing is required , and so I picked up The Western Canon . Maybe I would find my prejudice inaccurate ( as has happened in the past ) ? Not in this case , as it turns out.There are things to be admired about Mr. Bloom . That he has built a career for himself ; that he cares about promoting great works ; that he sees through what he calls The School of Resentment , which seeks to redefine `` good literature '' according to the ethnicity/gender/social class of authors ; that he has the integrity to fight the tide within his profession ; that he is passionate.This , however , is a poor book.Other reviewers within these pages have already identified some of the reasons why it is poor -- Bloom 's prose is nigh-unreadable , written ( perhaps ) for some incredibly rarefied audience , but not for any professor I 've ever had , let alone a general reader . He uses effusive praise with large and impressive-sounding , but ultimately rather empty , words and phrases . He does all of this according to his own peculiar theories of `` agon '' and influence , which sometimes seem as cryptic and arcane as the criticism schools he dismisses.His worship of Shakespeare , in particular , is just bizarre . I 'm very fond of Shakespeare , but reading Bloom one gets the sense that , had Shakespeare not come about we would n't have a Canon to discuss at all . Indeed , Bloom seems to suggest that our very conscious lives -- yours and mine -- are somehow defined by Shakespeare 's writings ; that Shakespeare , somehow , `` invented '' us . I agree that Hamlet is a great character , but I believe that I could exist without him . Bloom apparently disagrees.This book will not demonstrate to most or many why they truly ought to read the books Bloom mentions -- I find Bloom 's aesthetic metric of influence to be cold , and very far removed from the joys I find in reading . However , I will take it from Bloom that there is *something* to be gained in the writers he cites , and will take value in the appendices he includes as a starting point for a deeper education.Apart from the appendices , I believe that a prospective reader 's time would be far better served reading Shakespeare , or Dante , or Milton , or any of the great writers that Bloom mentions , instead of reading Bloom himself . In short , The Western Canon does not make the western canon.I find myself , at last , wondering what Shakespeare would have made of Bloom 's Western Canon . I somehow suspect that he would decide that it really did n't have much to do with the plays he was writing , dismiss it , and get back to work .	-1
There seem to be two schools of thought on this book - those of us who would give it 0 stars if we could and those who beyond love this 750 page literary hogwash . The author seems to not know where he wants the story to go , when it should take place and who is who in the book . He changes times , locations and character names about as often as one changes their clothes . He tries to be sly and drop hints about what century the action is taking place during , but it just adds confusion to the story . The is novel is not a great love story and of the 750 pages of drivel , maybe 50 are actually related to the cover photo . I had to force myself to get through it all , but really should have given up around page 200 .	-1
I havent seen the masterpiece aspect of this novel yet , but the basic idea of the story caught my attention . The main complaint that I have is that there is too much over dramatic discriptive writing about everything that I tend to get lost and lose perspective on what I have read and why it is important to the story .	-1
This book was about 375 pages too long . Very confusing people introduced that never tied into the story . Just allot of rambling on and on . I love to read and this was the biggest waste of time I have ever read . It was a bill filled with descriptions only no story !	-1
True Christians beware . This book is an obvious mockery of Christ 's birth . The use of the King James Bible , while good , is an obvious ploy to lure Christian parents to purchase this for their children . The angels in this book are portrayed as clumsy ( sometimes idiotic looking ) fairies that interact with Mary and Joseph in human ways ( one angel looks to be 'chatting ' with Mary over coffee ) . In one picture it looks as if a shepherd is looking up the angels robes . Christ as a child is quite ( graphically ) nude . This book is an attempt to drag the history of Christ 's birth down to the level of a silly fairy tale . This is dangerous because any child reading this book will probably find it too ridiculous to be true . Also , when the Wise Men arrive Christ is shown as an infant still . The Wise Men did not arrive to see Jesus until over a year after his birth ( he was most likely two years old at the time ) . But like everything else in this book , while the text is the King James Bible , the art tells a completely different story- a fairy tale.If you want your child to stay grounded in the truth of Christ 's birth , stay away from this foolish book .	-1
I thought that the last 4 pages of the book where better than the rest of the whole book . This book could be a lot shorter and I was n't to amazed by it .	-1
If you 've been introduced to the Disneyfied 1960s movie version of Mary Poppins , prepare to meet the *real* Mary Poppins . And prepare to be shocked , because the real Mary Poppins of 1934 is no smiling Julie Andrews . Of course there must be some appeal , otherwise this book would never have gained its status as a modern classic . Mary Poppins enters the home of the Banks family as a replacement nanny to take care of the four children , and her entrance into the home causes an immediate stir . Her remarkable ability to slide up banisters , walk into pictures , make humans float to the ceiling , and communicate with animals are just a few of her array of startling talents . In her presence the Banks children are never short of magical adventures.It sounds exciting and innocuous enough . But do n't be fooled . These magical adventures are not entirely harmless . Mary Poppins is actually a witch whose heart is far from pure . True , Travers does n't ostensibly present Mary Poppins as a witch , but her magical abilities clearly originate in a form of paganism closely connected to Eastern religions and new age philosophy . Nowhere are Mary Poppins ' credentials as a witch more evident than a night-time incident when the Banks children find themselves in a zoo , with all the roles reversed - the facility is run by animals , and the cages contain humans . The fun is hardly innocuous , because there is talk of animals eating humans , and in the Snake House Mary Poppins ' true heritage is revealed - she is a first cousin ( once removed ) to the serpents , one of whom she regards as the `` Lord of the Jungle '' . Her kinship to the snake with the `` terrible little forked tongue '' is deeply rooted in Eastern philosophy , evident in what the snake hisses : `` The same substance composes us - the tree overhead , the stone beneath us , the bird , the beast , the star - we are all one , all moving to the same end ... Beast and bird and stone and star - we are all one , all one - & quot ; This new age philosophy is far from harmless fantastic fun , but is frighteningly sinister.And if that is n't enough , Mary Poppins is herself a most beastly character . Her vanity knows no limits , as she constantly examines her reflection in every polished doorway . She is must cruel and unkind towards the children , showing them little or no affection . One critical writer once observed that Mary Poppins is ` perhaps the most stodgy , negligent , abusive , elusive , misleading ( and misguided ) , vituperative , vain and priggish beast ever conceived in the mind of an author . ' It 's a cruel assessment of Mary Poppins , but not far from the mark . The Banks children spend most of their time cowering in fear of her , never sure if she is going to treat them with meanness or magic . And whenever they are treated to magic courtesy of her witchcraft , she immediately messes with their minds by denying that it ever happened . Even the old woman in the shoe was more kind than this.Yet that 's not all to the twisted adventures of Mary Poppins . One entire chapter , Bad Tuesday , features one of the Banks children in a most disobedient mood , taking great pleasure and delight in his evil deeds . It gives him a most wonderful feeling . Sadly , this behaviour is encouraged rather than discouraged . In another incident , the children travel around the world and meet stereotyped people from all four corners of the earth . Not surprisingly , this chapter has been majorly ` revised ' in the 1981 edition , which has softened Travers ' original political incorrectness by changing these people to different animals from around the world.Despite her despicable character , when Mary Poppins leaves the Banks family at the end of the novel , the children are surprisingly most distressed at her sudden departure . They reject their mother 's soothing words of comfort , asserting ` Mary Poppins is the only person I want in the world ! ' Please ! What poor fools ! The truth is that the Banks family is a rather disfunctional family , and father and mother Banks play such a limited role in the lives of their children , that these four children would mistakenly rather have this beastly witch than nothing . Surely they are wrong . Despite the lure of her magic , a normal home and functional family is more blessed without the real Mary Poppins . I for one do n't want this haughty and disagreeable character in my home taking care of my children . Keep this woman and this book out of my house !	-1
`` Anything essential is invisible to the eyes . `` ~Ouch.I have no idea why anyone would tamper with Katherine Woods ' original translation , which held up fine for 50 years . In a classroom setting , it would be interesting to use this to compare excerpts to the Woods ' translation and then to the original French . I do n't think it would be the classic it is if this were the original translation , at least not in English.In short , it does for translation what Disney did for illustration on Winnie the Pooh..	-1
My teacher told us that this book was really about death . But for all the inuendoes hidden in a book disguised as a simple children 's book , it just did n't interest me . I just found it bland and odd . It is a very short book , but even my patience was wearing thin in class . We had to read a chapter , then the teacher would discuss it in depth and its hidden messages . I just did n't care . I know many people love this book for whatever reason , but it just did n't do anything for me and I easily forgot about it after finishing it .	-1
Well , it started off funny , a playful mix of fairy-tales retold . Then Cimorene runs off to do housekeeping for a dragon because she does not want to get married to a silly prince.Once the story gets underway the humor fades and the energy of the novel fades with it . I was n't invested in the characters ( Cimorene felt distant and smug at times ) , and although i was surprised 99 % of the time , getting through the second half of the story was hard because it was not that funny anymore.There is little character development , and the story rambles a bit . Talking dragons are nice . Wizards causing trouble are lively antagonists . A witch that defies expectations is a bit trite . But all that was not enough for me . It was unsatisfying.Err , this book was the kind that I was happy to be done with after struggling to read through . The ending was unsatisfying but I do not want to continue and read the author 's other books .	-1
First off , I was surprised by the number of mistakes that should have been caught by the proofreader/editor . Simple spelling errors are truly unforgivable when you start noticing more than one or two in a published book . I was beginning to think I had somehow gotten one of the `` free '' books from Amazon , instead of a library loaner . The whole thing smacked of a vanity press piece.I enjoy stories that are fantasy , but this one was lacking in many ways , mainly not enough fantasy ! The storyline was at times irritating and rambling , with a lack of wit that possibly would have saved it . Not in my top 1,000 .	-1
This book was so boring ... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point .	-1
This books is at best feel good nonsense for brain-washed kids . At worst , this is a traitorous pamphlet.Worst of all , though , is that it is a boring story that tries to brainwash kids and make them lefties .	-1
This book has a strong anti-Christian bias . I would n't call it minor like a previous reviewer . Also , the book made no sense . They had no electricity , and yet they had hot coffee in the mornings . Somehow they baked their own bread with no electricity . One time the electricity came on and they started washing clothes . The electricity went off before the clothes were finished so they had to rinse them off in the bathtub . Without electricity , where did they get water for the bathtub ? ? ? Supposedly they lived in the country with their own well . Wells do n't pump water without electricity . It just was n't a very intelligent , well thought out book . Save your money .	-1
A funny idea with cute drawings , but the ending let me down more than any other book I 've read recently . I do n't know why this book is getting all these five-star reviews . I mean , it 's alright , and the storytime kids liked it , but it certainly was n't as good as Mo Willem 's `` Pigeon '' books , and the kids did n't laugh nearly as hard as they have on other books with lower ratings . The book is just a mystery story about a fat cat and other animals being scared that this cat is going to sit on them . Yeah , it 's a fun idea , but when you finally find out what he 's going to sit on , you want to throw the book across the room because it 's such a dumb way to end the book . Oh , and the last joke is equally lame , and entirely predictable . It works for kids , but you should really spend your money on a better book . This is n't something that the kids are gon na want you to read again .	-1
There are two types of books that are directed at children or young teens : those that have the moral of the story arise naturally out of story and those that are written with the moral in mind rather than the story . This book is an example of the latter . It starts with an intriguing idea : what would be like if stones could talk and were aware of the world around them , but ends up with a preachy `` civilization is bad and nature is good '' theme.The novel concerns the adventures of a group of orphaned children who go off to find the promised land -- -in this case an Eden-type land that is an imitation of a New Ager 's view of Southwest Indian culture . Of course , there are chased by bad guys -- -in this case , Satan himself , and ( just as predictably ) the bad guys run a huge corporation and wear suits.The book claims to be appropriate for ten year olds and up , but do not be fooled by that . The book has some content that is not appropriate for children . Indeed , the book veers between being a children 's book , a young teen book and an older teen/adult book . The book definitely needed a editor with a stronger will and , on the whole , the book reads like a sloppy first draft.All in all it is not really worth reading and you are best advised to pass on this one .	-1
Pfeffer continues her post-apocolyptic moon series with a stark urban counterpart to the rural setting of the first . The main character , Alex , is a New York City boy with a large family -- two younger sisters , an older brother in the service and parents who work hard . When the moon shifts his family is dispersed enough that Alex assumes temporary responsibility for his sisters . Now suddenly thrust into the role of primary caretaker his life alters considerably from the future he envisioned . In this way I thought the book took advantage of it 's greatest strength -- the characters . An ordinary boy his age , with a pizza parlor job , concentrating on school and the future instantly finds himself with a whole different set of responsibilities than envisioned . That drop of a hat shift in his focus overtook and overwhelmed his life.The other great strength of this book was that Pfeffer showed us the other side of the coin . In book one we got to see a family struggle through this catastrophic event from a place where things were so geographically dispersed . It was extremely difficult to get news or see neighbors or get to provisions because of the distance between homes and town . In this version it was easier to maintain some level of communication even if the information shared was n't anything that would necessarily help those struggling with the situation.What struck me as odd , though , is that I was expecting far more chaos in the streets in this version . We got was far more subdued than I had anticipated it would be in such a circumstance . Do n't get me wrong there was the typical ( and some creepy not so typical ) looting and there was rationing and food bank lines that seemed to stretch for days so it was n't completely out of synch with my overall expectations ; but I suppose I had it in my mind things would be a bit more closer to Stephen King 's The Stand where there is violence and car burning in the streets . This softer tone did n't ruin anything for me as a reader it was just different.This book placed a much greater emphasis on religion and faith than its predecessor . Book one did touch lightly on the religious aspect of an apocolyptic event but was surprisingly low key about it . This book , however , felt like it went a bit further to the extreme to make up for it . Not so much so that it was over the top or unrealistic but it was a noticeable change in tone and was a large part of the story as told . The way faith and religion infused within the story allowed for the theme to branch out in several directions across several characters.There was much realism to the story told . We saw famine resulting in starvation , crime , debilitating illness , family squabbles , love and loss . We even got to see heroism in the face of extenuating circumstances . Above all there was hope to be had . Though not my favorite of the series thus far , if you enjoyed book one you 'll likely enjoy book two as well .	-1
There are some books that begin slowly , but the writing is so well done , that you continue on , knowing that anyone who can string words together so masterfully will surely create an interesting story . Then there are books that contain a story or characters that are so spot on , endearing , or enticing , that you ca n't help but read , regardless of the quality of writing . Jekel loves Hyde was none of the above.At the story 's opening , we meet Jill Jekel as she attends her recently murdered father 's funeral . Jill 's mother has withdrawn into herself , and as Jill has no friends , she is feeling alone and despondent . But suddenly , the crowd parts , and Tristan , a boy who she has never even spoken to inside or outside of school , strolls up to her , offers her words of comfort and a shoulder to cry on , then walks back from whence he came.Tristan Hyde is concerned . Prior to his passing , Tristan 's grandfather spoke of a family curse , passed down through the generations , plaguing the men of their family to turn into hideous , killing beasts , waking with no memory of what was done , but haunted by bloodlust . Turns out , what was thought to be a book of fiction , was based in truth , for Tristan is a descendant of the infamous Mr. Hyde.Jill Jekel , like her chemist father , is a nerd . She has been forbade by her family to open the box residing within her father 's office , for it contains the original experiments created by Dr. Jekel , creator of Mr. Hyde . It has been kept hidden within their family for more than a century , but that is about to change.Jekel loves Hyde unravels once Tristan learns about Jill 's own , troubled lineage and the knowledge that she secretly contains . Knowledge that could cure Tristan of his blackouts and ever troubling dreams . Knowledge that could destroy everything.Perhaps I would have enjoyed this story more had I liked the work this book was based upon , `` Dr. Jekel and Mr. Hyde '' . But alas , I thought it was boring , and as such , passed the same judgment upon this book . Furthermore , the characters of both Jill and Tristan are mind-numbingly lackluster . Jill dresses and acts as though she is a long lost cast member of `` Little House on the Prairie '' and Tristan attempts and fails terribly at being enticing . *Note to the author* Your leading men have to be one of three things : really hot and troubled , really hot and bad , but with a hidden heart of gold , or just made of so much awesome that you do n't notice he is n't hot . Lastly this book reads like poorly written fan fiction . I say that as someone who has written crap fan fiction . If you are contemplating this book because you loved Jessica 's Guide to Dating on the Darkside , as I did , spare yourself .	-1
I am a homeschooling parent and wanted to use it as part of our music history study . ( We are listening to a different composer each month . ) The facts are interesting and certainly can stick in your head . There 's just something that rubs me the wrong way . So many of these composers suffered deeply in their lifetimes , and I just think the tone is a little too lighthearted , when discussing these very troubled individuals . I also hate the illustrations . They are ugly , and my kids keep asking me why the heads are so big . I had it out from the library and will not be buying it . It 's an okay believe-or-not-book .	-1
I read alot of books and alot of them are with vampires and this book to me just sucked . I am though a romance at heart though so i prefer to have a more or less happy ending and this was definatly not one . Vampires can be killed by sunlight.. couldnt you be alittle more creative ? And most people , or for me atleast , the main attraction for vampire novels is the overall great romance that comes along with them , i.e Twilight ( had to say it ) , Vampire Academy , Glass Houses , ect . and Companions of the Night definatly didnt have it . The ending sucked ... simple . It might have been good back then but compared to all the books now.. this one doesnt even compete .	-1
I had hoped that this book would give me more exposure to Saint-Exupery , but with only one random quote per page , I was quite disappointed . I wish now that I had spent the same amount of money on one of his full-length books .	-1
This book is n't quite history ; it 's more of a travelogue . The travelogue 's attempts to describe Turkey viewed through fez-colored glasses falls a little short , but the historical aspects of Seal 's wanderings are on-key . The delvings into Western newspaper correspondents he presents are fascinating , if blatantly discriminatory ( we 'll not forget this was in the 1920s , and said correspondents were imperial Brits who still believed in Piltdown Man ) . Seal spends a good deal of time in rural Turkey , running into strange individuals and quietly mocking them in imitable fashion ( we here at History House have come to recognize dry wit ubiquitous to British travel writers ) . To be frank , he made us long for the apparently unavailable 1839 book Character and Costume in Turkey and Italy , by Thomas Allom , which was written at the transitional moment between the turban and the fez and filled with all manner of dress idiosyncrasies . He tries to make it all heartwarming in the end , but the fact of the matter is that he searches Turkey all over for a damn fez and never really finds one . Instead he scratches his head over the Turkish dichotomy of Islamism versus Europeanism , which is a phenomenon that many modern Turkish politicians , and Turks themselves , seem to be trying to straddle . Go figure . [ HistoryHouse.com ]	-1
My skill level is advanced beginner . I am improving day to day and wanted to improve even more . The first few chapters were helpful , however the rest of the book seems more suited for a skill level of intermediate to expert . I appreciate the author 's writing ability and knowledge , but I need a simpler book designed for a lower skill level.Finally , the title of & # 34 ; Standard Book & # 34 ; is a little confusing . The book covers a wide range , but there are many areas that are omitted .	-1
First off , let me say that I am a hug fan of Anita Shreve , of tales of long-lost loves , and of tragic endings . So this book should have been made for me , right ? Sadly , no . I was very disappointed in this novel . Not for one moment did I care about the main characters ; there was nothing in the novel to make me feel any sympathy or understanding for them . I also found some parts of the novel somewhat trite and cliched , especially the parts revolving around the music tape . Still , the writing was very good , and there were some moments of clarity and suspense . There are other Shreve novels that are much more worthwhile .	-1
This book has so many historical distortions , simplistic arguments , and blind-passion its tough to know where to start . So I 'll confine my review to some of the obvious problems she either ignores or skates over ... To begin with , Shlaes completely ignores the international picture . Amazingly , America is the LEAST taxed developed nation in the world , yet has the largest military forces ( bigger than the next 10 nations COMBINED ) , the largest road network , the largest criminal justice system , the largest education system , the largest number of public funded colleges , the largest ( combined ) police force , the largest number of professional fire-fighters and so on and so on . All these huge organisations cost huge amounts of money ; a simple yet devastating fact Shales prefers to ignore . Instead she talks of waste and corruption . Well , those are probably inevitable , given the mind-blowing size and complexity of the organisations the US has.Then there 's the whining and angry ( although passive and prosperous ) American middle class , provided with free education , subsidised housing ( tax cuts for home buyers ) , subsidised gasoline , subsidised roads , and so on . In fact this class has some claim to be the most subsidised group in the country.Shales may well be aware of the major paradoxes I 've outlined above ; how else to explain her hopelessly weak suggestions ( worthy of a High School debate ) on reforming and and streamlining the system ? Ultimately , like every other commentator and politician , Shales can not escape the contradiction that American citizens have grown to demand and expect the best from their government , yet ( unlike any other aspect of national and private life ) they expect the best to be provided for almost nothing , as if by magic , by a mysterious entity called & quot ; Washington. & quot ; Without a major rethink of American citizen 's expectations and the country 's world role , any talk of significant tax cuts will remain limited to misty-eyed dreamers like Shales and her followers .	-1
OK , but the formula wears thin pretty qucikly . Character lacks depth or interest and seem to be overly stock . Washington columnists ca n't be this cardboard !	-1
This book is a prequel to Lewis Sorley 's recent Westmoreland-bashing biography.The title is not very apt . It does n't take long for `` A Better War '' to signal that you are about to read a badly aimed tribute to General Creighton Abrams , who brought us his version of the `` Accelerated Pacification Campaign '' on top of Hamburger Hill 937 . And the hilltops known as Firebase Ripcord . The U.S. Marine Corps Combined Action Program would have been hard-pressed to find Vietnamese villages to pacify in the Ashau Valley , as evidenced by the results of Operation Dewey Canyon . Likewise for the southern corner of the An Hoa Basin - the Marines called this place `` Arizona Territory '' - remembered for countless and bloody patrols of punishing attrition warfare . There were no fixed U.S. bases there , or on Go Noi Island ( a.k.a . `` Dodge City '' ) . The Navy SEALs prowling through the Mekong Delta and the Rung Sat Special Zone were not there to build schools and hospitals , or provide police services for the farmers . Their primary mission was to hunt for and dispose of the enemy as quickly as possible . Names and faces changed , but it was a war of numbers from beginning to end.Airmobile assaults , strafing gunships , napalm strikes , and carpet bombing B-52s never sold democracy and village security to those regions or any other . But that did not stop General Abrams from dispatching the 101st Airborne Division for more of the same ; during Operation Dewey Canyon II ( a return of U.S. troops to the abandoned base at Khe Sanh ) they lost a record high number of helicopters destroyed.There were not many Vietnamese villages in Cambodia either , but General Abrams told President Nixon that Cambodia should be heavily bombed and invaded because enemy bases and supplies were known to be hidden there . This was not a civic action project , it was a grandiose Search-and-Destroy expedition that was done without approval from Congress ( see Cooper-Church Amendment ) . As so often happened before , there was a staggering amount of collateral damage . But this illegal `` Incursion '' by Abrams - Operations Toan Thang 42-45 - and more B-52 strikes did not stop the build-up of the North Vietmamese Army and was little more than a nuisance to the ultimate plans of the Khmer Rouge . The U.S. political and military actions and its aftermath left Cambodia in ruins , and probably accelerated the rise of Pol Pot into power.From July 1968 to July 1971 , at least twenty-five named U.S. military operations marched to the tune of destroying enemy personnel and supplies , rather than holding ground . I would challenge anyone to explain how all this raiding with huge fireworks was in keeping with big changes in tactics that were imagined by Sorley . He is not just wrong about the essence of post-1968 Pacification programs , he is also sadly mistaken about the results . Kevin Boylan 's October 2009 article , `` The Red Queen 's Race : Operation Washington Green and Pacification in Binh Dinh Province , 1969-70 , '' ( The Journal of Military History ) is a scathing indictment of Vietnamization and of General Abrams ' test-tube Pacification program , which was an abortive failure after all.Washington Green was one of few operations where U.S. Army infantry was directly involved in long-term Pacification . The counterinsurgency mission given to the 173rd Airborne Brigade sought to focus on making villages self-sufficient through population control , limited use of firepower and training territorial militias in four districts of Binh Dinh , the second-most populous province of South Vietnam . The methodology was similar to the USMC Combined Action Platoons , and U.S. Army officers hoped to showcase Washington Green as a blueprint for future operations . American troops dispersed into the most troubled hamlets going after the guerrillas and regulars , while the South Vietnamese police and intelligence agencies ( Phoenix Program ) were to ferret out Vietcong spies . Initially , rapid gains were made by the paratroopers as large numbers of enemy personnel were uprooted from their nests , but it was all just a facade , as Boylan clearly demonstrates . The territorial militias were almost completely ineffective , even when the 3rd NVA Division was temporarily absent and could not intervene . The militias were spread thin , poorly motivated , and inefficiently supported by the ARVN , which made them more dependent upon the Americans . Many local recruits had no faith in the government and would not take risks except when U.S. assistance was available . Others were not dependable because civilian jobs held priority over part-time soldiering . American military advisors investigated the spy-hunting Phoenix teams and found incomplete files , dossiers , and other records that exposed a negligible effort made against Vietcong terrorist cells.When NVA troops returned to Binh Dinh , the ultimate goal of making the villages self-reliant was doomed . The 173rd Airborne Brigade was pulled off the dragnets cast on Vietcong agents so they could deal with the North Vietnamese Army . Government control over the Binh Dinh Province eroded and militia activity degenerated into widespread apathy , malingering , desertion , and detente with the Vietcong . Most of the economic development projects stagnated due to internal disagreements about allocation of resources , made worse by the shortage of properly trained police , teachers , doctors , and project managers . The senior U.S. military advisors rightly concluded that a widespread lack of devotion to the Saigon regime would not be corrected with further training . The most bitter irony of Washington Green was that Communist leaders soon copied the concept but made it work , using dispersed bands of NVA regular troops to support the political networks in what Boylan described as a `` Phoenix-in-Reverse '' campaign . Their new tactics hastened the collapse of hamlet security with a spike in kidnappings and assassinations of South Vietnamese officials . Even when at their best , the South Vietnamese politicians , police and armed forces were never capable of fending for themselves.For the Marines , intense fighting in the Quang Nam Province brought a similar outcome for population security . The salesmen from CORDS ( Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support ) confirmed that a preponderance of destruction and homeless refugees prevented meaningful Pacification . Furthermore , MACV did not make a prolonged effort to secure the Que Son Mountains which continued to be another major sanctuary for Communist troops . A CORDS study for the Quang Nam Province , dated February 1972 cited a high number of abandoned hamlets ( 46 % of the total ) and higher percentage of displaced persons ( 65-75 % of the total population ) . The departure of U.S. troops during the previous year left 70 % of the land area under enemy control.The disintegration of local authority following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from direct Pacification programs underlined the flaws of trying to employ lessons of the past from the Philippines , Malaya and the Banana Wars . The enclave strategy and other types of `` clear and hold '' operations did not work consistently in South Vietnam because the government was the weakest link in the chain , when it needed to be the strongest . No ground was secure unless U.S troops were standing on it , and no amount of obfuscation by Lewis Sorley will change that.General Abrams ' command is perhaps better defined by sinking morale of the troops , breakdown in discipline , and growing problems with drug trafficking . Fragging incidents rose sharply , and even more troubling was that Abrams - a tank expert with no professional background in special warfare - wanted the 5th Special Forces Group to be removed from Vietnam , even though this outfit was the most consistently useful anti-guerrilla tool that the U.S Army had furnished to MACV.The way that Abrams handled the Green Beret Affair was a disgrace . First he tried to scapegoat Colonel Robert Rheault who was arrested ( all charges dropped ) . Then Abrams replaced him with Colonel Alexander Lemberes , who was not qualified for the job having no parachute rating or Special Forces experience . Lemberes did not last long in that posting , and it is interesting to note that General Phillip Davidson - MACV intelligence chief for both Westmoreland and Abrams - revealed that Creighton Abrams held a longtime bias against paratroopers and the airborne forces . Davidson said that when parachute-qualified officers left Abrams ' command , he usually tried to replace them with non-airborne types.General Abrams did not significantly improve the performance of the ARVN , which failed another acid test despite having lavish U.S. military support during Operation Lam Son 719 . Abrams did not fundamentally transform CORDS after General Westmoreland completed his Vietnam service . There was less enemy resistance to Pacification , because the Vietcong guerrillas and main forces suffered heavy losses between the Tet holidays of 1968 and 1969 . The limited increase in resources for Pacification was also tethered to President Nixon 's demand that General Abrams must reduce big-unit U.S. infantry operations because he could not afford any more Hamburger Hills.In any case , the South Vietnamese leadership had its own ideas about population control . Ngo Dinh Diem and Nguyen Van Thieu often made independent decisions about Pacification and they did not feel bound by the wishes of foreign governments . The bottom line is that policy choices regarding the time , place , tempo and nature of military action and civil affairs were driven by enemy action , publicity and presidential administrations . It is a stunning departure from reality for anyone to suggest that this `` winning hearts and minds through interdiction '' approach by Abrams was radically different than the `` war of attrition '' that Lewis Sorley has venomously ascribed to Westmoreland and other generals . In fact , General Abrams made only modest gestures at reform . If Abrams truly endorsed a significant shift in Vietnam battlefield doctrines , then he did little or nothing to get it implemented . As Guenter Lewy put it : `` Abrams campaign plan , for the most part , remained a paper exercise '' .	-1
Like the author , I make a living through the use of words . I am therefore sensitive to the careful spin of the language when it is used to influence readers . I was deeply disappointed in this book because of it 's caricature of Hasidic Jews and rural Americans . I have lived in rural America , and found the people to be more open-minded , multi-faceted and complex than the stereotypes the author presents . I currently live in the SF Bay Area and have friends in the Hasidic communties here who also are nothing like the Jews portrayed in this book . Even some of the & quot ; neutral & quot ; information , such as the rules concerning the use of the mikvah by women for one , is simply flat out wrong . There are other simple factual inaccuracies which a reasonably unbiased writer should have been able to report accurately . Other Hasidic practices as explained by the author include a preoccupation with money , drunkenness and oppression of women . I am a woman , and women friends of mine in the Hasidic community near us are cherished , not oppressed . All of them have careers . The & quot ; arranged marriage & quot ; the author disparages in his musings was presented to me by Hasidic women as a positive thing for a woman to choose her prospective mate -- a healthy alternative to the serial sexual encounters American girls must subject themselves to nowadays to get a husband.I think the author 's foci and his shadowed nuances in his presentation say more about his own insecurities as a rootless secular Jew in a largely Christian rural culture . It certainly does n't accurately portray rural Christian Americans or Hasidic Jews as a whole , and I certainly hope that any reader unfamiliar with either or both of those cultures will seek guidance elsewhere . The author does a huge disservice to two large and well-meaning groups of people through his subtle bias .	-1
Aye , me hearties , 't was a sad , sad day when our hero penned this tripe . I love Jimmy 's music as much as the next Parrothead . Nobody does what he does better . Sigh . Mr B never met a piece of clever wordplay he did n't love . I suspect he has them catalogued and cross-referenced like a vaudevillian 's joke library . And they make fine hooks onto which a tunesmith can attach his melodies . So be it . But when they are sprinkled , like powdered sugar , with calculated monotony over the narrative of this book , it 's enough to piss off a Parrothead but good . The dialogue is flat , no sense of suspense or believability is ever reached . It 's a real slog through the mangroves . Two thoughts kept interrupting my attempt to concentrate on the story : here is yet another pop ego run seriously amok , and/or here is a cynical stab by JB , Inc. , to repackage the old stuff and separate even more moolah from the faithful . I assume the movie rights have already been sold , probably & quot ; pre-sold & quot ; , and the man is laughing all the way to the bank . Jimmy , the world needs more fruitcakes and less ( sic ) bakers . Elmore Leonard you ai n't .	-1
I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and could n't continue . NOTHING happens ! Why would I consider reading on ? What 's the first rule of writing a compelling novel ?

Title character Vernon Little is a foul-mouthed teen in a small Texas town when his friend murders 17 high school classmates in a Columbine-like massacre . Vernon 's friend commits suicide , the only other witness to the crime falls into a stupor , and Vernon is fingered for the crime.The story 's premise is intriguing and author Pierre wraps a tight plotline around this main character . The plot even leads to page-turning suspense and a tight denouement that is rather surprising . But , alas , after that it whimpers to a weak close.In Vernon , Pierre has created a character so profane and so unwilling to accept responsibility for his own life that he is unlikeable . Vernon blames his troubles on his single mother . He blames the town 's problems on his mother 's friends . And he blames the crime situation on poor policework . This protrayal of a troubled teen is likely to be highly accurate . But it hinders this novel.The author also creates a smarmy villain who is so morally decrepit that the reader will want to strangle him . But , frustratingly , the villain 's role in the book comes to an unsatisfying finish.Aside from the inexcusable profanity that drenches the first half of this book , DBC Pierre shows a fantastic sense of style and humor . Pierre may be a future star author . But this book is not the one that will take him there .	-1
Imagine an epic struggle between Vampire and Hobbit for control of the Southern Hemisphere , Dragons used as a luxury form of mass air transit , and Cotton Candy promoted as the new super-food . While none of the aforementioned situations are found within the pages of Mrs. Dalloway , serious though , would n't they make a great premise for a book ? We 'll make some calls ... Unfortunately , while reading Virginia Woolf 's famed novel all we could do was imagine a more interesting plot.Going in we knew this was going to be a struggle and after only a few pages our concerns were realized - there would be no conceivable way for us to finish Mrs. Dalloway with a smile . The novel possesses a certain charm , but we just could n't get into the characters or the plot . As interesting as pre-party planning can be ( do n't ask us about The Christmas Extravaganza 2008 ... seriously , do n't ask us . It 's a very sore topic ) , Clarissa Dalloway 's activities and reflections were in a word : quite boring . Do n't say it.The themes addressed in this novel are admirable and quite weighty . However , the way in which the subject matters are presented makes us wonder if addressing FAWR ( Falling Asleep While Reading ) would n't have been a more prudent concern . Fortunately for Mrs. Dalloway , her party is n't a total bust and frankly , we 'd have accepted an invitation . Maybe we 're giving away something here , but we needed a little more content for this review . There 're only so many interesting way to say , `` Thanks , but no thanks . `` Virginia 's Woolf 's , To the Lighthouse is staring longingly from our 2011 TBR pile , but our return gaze reflects heavy eyelids and a small stream of spittle on the left side of our mouth .	-1
I love authenticity in historical fiction and respect the research that authors do in order to achieve an atmosphere rich in accurate detail . Here , though , Martin 's hard work actually gets in the way . This book is so chock full of ca . 1903 railroad terminology and minute details of who did what in an engine yards that it slows down character development and forward movement of the plot . I gave it 60 pages and bailed out . In today 's popular fiction market , the author will be lucky if many readers wait that long . If you 're a train buff , on the other hand , run ( do n't walk ) and grab a copy of this book !	-1
If any literary character has ever come close to climbing into someone else 's psyche , it is Elodie Harrington , a quasi-permanent resident of the infirmary at Brown University , the victim of innumerable diseases , none of which is easily diagnosed , let alone cured : encephalitis , fibromyalgia , seizures , mumps , malarial symptoms , chicken pox , anemia , and assorted bouts of flu ad infinitum . Used to haunting the halls of the infirmary alone , when Chester Hunter III is admitted after an assault on campus , Elodie finds the man of her dreams . It is unclear whether the athletic Chester will walk again , let alone participate in sports , but no problem for Elodie , who thrives on such uncertainty , spreading her own ghoulish brand of happiness through the infirmary . In his pain and delirium , Chester is a willing victim , falling under the young woman 's spell.At the same time , Mark Kirschling , MD , a doctor and professor at the university , begins an intimate study of the girl 's pattern of illnesses , hoping to determine cause and effect or at least offer the victim some comfort . Kirschling attends his patient with a more than sympathetic eye , curiously unscientific and enthralled by the charmless girl , especially when she informs him of the apparitions she has recently been experiencing . The two then embark on research into parapsychology , the doctor sure that Elodie has the gift of second sight , transitioning through a period of `` psychic puberty '' . To what does he owe this assumption ? On the information supplied by Elodie , of course , certainly a reliable barometer.No shrinking violet in the expression of physical love as one might expect , Elodie eagerly consummates her love affair with Chester , although he realizes shortly before his release that it can not be sustained in his normal life , reprieved by a miraculous recovery to his legs . Not to worry , Elodie has her mystical stranger on hand , the dark-haired young man that comes to her ever more frequently . Is he a creature from the past ? Only time will tell , that and a plot that strains believability . In this particular teenage wasteland , Elodie is queen , drifting through her romance-saturated days without any connection to reality . A decidedly unsympathetic character , Elodie is as vapid and sickly as a Victorian drawing room maiden ( albeit not in the bedroom ) , Kirshling a fawning popinjay at her beck and call . Whatever the message of this novel , it reeks of self-indulgence and precocious literary posturing . Luan Gaines/2006 .	-1
How sad I am . _Amnesia Moon_ thrilled me for the first half and more . I was eager to turn the pages and find out more about the bizarre journey of Chaos/Everett . The realms and characters intrigued me . But alas , the story all but collapses in San Francisco . The insertion of highly futuristic technology feels abrupt and unwarranted . Worse , the tale falters into an awkward , mixed-up set of characters and dreams and dead ends . I could n't wait for it to end , and could care less ( unlike so many reviewers ) that the ending is `` incomplete . `` My sense is that Lethem did n't know what to do with his novel . He 'd written something quite good , until he got to San Francisco . And then he suddenly goes Pynchon-esque on us . Lethem neither prepares us for this abysmal confusion , nor did he execute the transition adequately . He stammers and reaches fitfully , until he simply closes the book . This book should not have been published in its current state . Will I read Lethem again after this introduction ? Perhaps : there was enough in the first 100 pages to make me think the guy can tell a good story ... and Amazon readers tell us to focus our Lethem energies elsewhere .	-1
If you are into a lot of facts about history and culture , then this might be the book for you . As for myself , I felt like I was reading college history and sociology textbooks . So many facts , with little or no human connection to Rory Stewart , or the people who accompany him on his trek across Afghanistan . Stewart writes early on in the book , `` I feel like I have been preparing for this all my life '' . To me that is a powerful statement , which in my opinion Stewart never really expounded on , and in the end could have made this book a little more interesting .	-1
I originally bought this book because I so thoroughly enjoyed The Name Of The Rose . I was expecting this book to be as good . As I began to read it , I became concerned about the connection the author was making between the Sefirot and the black arts/demon worship . However , the further I got into the book , the more bored I became until I could no longer concentrate . This book is not at all comparable to The Name Of The Rose , either in content or skill .	-1
For two very large reasons , I was quite disappointed by this book . First , the novel seemed to be a string of obvious set pieces . One narrative was resolved by a predictable , telegraphed deception . An especially under-explored one was resolved by a death . And another by a visit to the mental institution.All of the characters were confronted by the need to start their lives over again . It would have been a better book if he held more tightly to that core , but Morton let too much noise into the narratives . There was just too much chatter establishing the social status of the characters . A point I found espcially annoying was the almost obsessive name dropping of great philosophers . It looked like the results of a Wiki education , although I am quite sure it wasn't.Anyway , that 's enough . Morton wrote one book that I liked immensely and one that I did n't . We 're even.The only sufferable character in the book was a recently divorced woman c	-1
On the strenght of the reviews posted here I purchased `` The Indian Bride '' Some readers even compared this authoress to Henning Mankel and find him lacking ! When I read Mankel I get a clear mental picture of the places he writes about , be it Skane or Riga , not with Fossum . I tried to imagine the meadow and the woods later on I found out that there were some flowers growing there . She could have been writing about an imaginary town in the Midwest for all I gleaned from her writing.I got fatigued reading dialogue that was nothing but filler as the plot was so flimsy that without it the book would n't have amounted to more than 100 pages if that ! Her character are described yet they 're faceless , she does n't have forensics in her book , a man in town turns up with physcal evidence on his person , and his alibi proves false yet the police does n't detain him.Maybe in Norway they do n't collect data from the corpses as scraping under the nails , stomach contents , etc ? Hardly ! but in this book it seems that all the forensic staff does is found traces of something and lament over the state of the victim.A key witness to the crime calls a detective and is terrified when she spots a man outside her home . The girl is alone in the house , yet the detective practically tells her to calm down , lock the doors and go to sleep , and as an afterthought offers to call the police station if she so desires ... .C'mon , how much more amateurish can a detective novel be ! I found myself skimming over the empty banter at Einar 's cafe and found every detective interrogation ringing false.Yet some have criticize Mankel for not being touchy feely ! Maybe he needs some gender sensitivity training ? This book is n't a good detective novel and there 's no suspense , au contraire its like a comedy of errors that lead us to a much spected finalle , if you did n't guess who the killer was after page 80 then you ought to be reading romances .	-1
When I started to read , I was very much taken with the situation of a man on death row going to his final destination guilty or not . When story changed to the point of view of the young girl who swore to a rape which the author decided to describe in pornographic detail I stopped reading and discarded the book . I would not recommend this book .	-1
T.S . Eliot 's poems are wonderful . They were part of my high school English class and have n't lost their poignancy yet . But this set of essays was written in a time when there was still hope of an improving civilization here on earth , based on Christians being dominant and influential in the culture.In this world you will have tribulation , but take heart , I have overcome the world .

TRAVELS IN HYPERREALITY is a hodgepodge collection of magazine and newspaper articles dating from 1967 through 1983 , most of which are concerned with popular culture and changing ideas from that period , though a few are more critical and discuss particulars in keeping with Mr. Eco 's specialty , Semiotics . Most , if not all , were originally published for an Italian audience , though still only a general one , so the technical aspects of his discussions on language are designed for non-specialists . That does n't mean they are simplistic though - I found them quite challenging.And that aspect might very well be enough for those who appreciate Mr. Eco 's previously published work or the field of Semiotics in general . But as I was reading these essays , I could n't quite get it out of my mind that what the author was analyzing was changing methods of communication from forty years ago . I ca n't say that there is n't value there even still , but it was difficult for me to muster up the requisite mental energy to grapple with his points.To my mind , though , if there is worth in this collection , it does have to do with these musings on language - when the essays turned more general , I thought the dated aspect even more apparent , and even less interesting . I believe this is because many of the subjects he tackles are rather inconsequential - purposely so - and that they have little staying power . A writer like Huxley can still reach me with his essays from eighty years ago because he talks about universalities . I doubt Mr. Eco 's efforts were ever that lofty - these were meant to be entertaining.However , the lead essay , 'Travels in Hyperreality ' , strikes me as a bit dishonest , perhaps even mean-spiritedly so . On a trip through the U.S in the mid-seventies , Mr. Eco investigated the various kitsch extravaganzas of DisneyWorld and DisneyLand , Hearst Castle , and sundry wax musuems and other strange collections such as Ripley 's Museum ( from 'Believe-It-Or-Not ' fame ) , the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft and Ringling 's Circus Museum . The point of all these travels was , evidently , to explore the phenomenom of 'Hyperreality ' - places designed to be , as Bono says , 'even better than the real thing ' . The various reproductions , mock-ups , displays , as well as original elements interspersed within the exhibits are evidence of an America of 'furious hyperreality ' , secret from the European Traveler and the American Intellectual , yet a world that 'create a network of references and influences that ... spread to high culture and the entertainment industry'.I do n't doubt that 's true to an extent , perhaps more now than ever . Nor do I really object to someone 's sneering opinion of theme park silliness - I 'd say I even agree up to a point . What is irksome is the bi-polar diagnosis of America as either 'intellectual ' or hoi polloi . As Mr. Eco was writing for a foriegn audience , I especially dislike this characterization . It would be as if I decided there were only two Italys , one Rossellini and Vittorio de Sica , and the other Leone and Corbucci based only on the films I had seen , or else some other purely arbritrary yardstick.Mr . Eco 's larger point - that kitschy realism influences high culture - is a worthwhile subject to explore , but there is an overriding sniffiness to the essay , as if the author condescends to confirm his beliefs by visiting these meccas of mass-market entertainment . Insinuating that this is the salt-of-the-earth America while at the same time ridiculing it feels insulting . Since I would n't be on Mr. Eco 's intellectual list , there 's only one other option presented - I must be clamoring at the pearly gates of DisneyWorld with all my fellow bumpkins.Then again , I 'm probably just too sensitive .	-1

Ask the prof or ask someone who took the class before.If you have to bribe either , why not use the money you are thinking about wasting on this book on that venture ? Also this book will be in your law library ( free reads folks ! ) and will likely also be in the collection of about half the eager beaver 1L students in your class . They are losing nothing by letting you read it , so have at it , but save your own dollar for something worthwhile , like an outline ...	-1
I 've enjoyed dozens of fine books on the Apollo program . Murray 's `` Apollo '' was my favorite , for all of its inside technical info . I had hoped this would be more of the same , including expanding on the fascinating technology of the Saturn engines , and the obstacles the engineers overcame.Instead , it reads like a boring engineering document dump , with no narrative . I found myself skipping chunks of text , hoping to find the `` interesting '' stuff . It never materialized.As a degreed engineer , I can handle geeky tech talk , and I reveled in it when fascinatingly delivered by Murray . I also enjoyed the Gene Kranz book , which gave insights ( especially project management and personnel issues ) I had not learned in countless other books on the topic.Unless you are looking for dry , exhaustive archives of facts without any real context or narrative , skip this one .	-1
I found myself very disappointed in this addition to the VSI series . I have come to expect a very high standard from that series of books and Wilkinson 's book does not come close to that standard.The problem is that Wilkinson seems to have made no attempt to provide anything like a standard overview of a field . That normally requires an author to write a little outside of their subareas of expertise as they attempt to provide a broad and neutral introduction to their field as a whole . Wilkinson decided on a different approach . Instead he chose to give us an impressionistic and partial overview . The book really should have been titled `` A very short ( and occassionally tedious ) overview of what Paul Wilkinson knows of International Relations '' .But , of course , few would buy such a book.What are Wilkinson 's sins ? There is no real attempt to provide a history of the field . Two pages on Machiavelli and Grotius each . That 's pretty much it . As another reviewer noted , what Wilkinson does is largely talk about the types of actors ( states , NGOs , etc . ) and even does that in a very impressionistic manner . For instance , there is no mention of the World Bank or the IMF which seems an odd omission considering Wilkinson 's politics.And let 's talk about those politics . I enjoy Bush bashing as much as anyone . For the time period between 2000-2008 , I was probably the most notorious Bush basher among the large group of mechanics , electricians and process technicians that I work with in a facilities department . The trouble with Bush bashing in a book like this is that it will render the book outdated . This book will become more and more outdated as time goes on.By contrast , a book like Ikle 's Every War Must End will not because his examples are choosen from about a hundred years of foolishness by a dozen or so different countries.So ultimately , the decision by Wilkinson to use the Bush administration as the paragon of foolishness ( while understandable ) renders Wilkinson 's book less useful.Wilkinson frequently argues poorly for his position . Wilkinson even indulges in a Fox News specialty , the `` some people say '' argument on p. 57 : `` there are some international scholars who argue '' . There is no attribution as to who he is talking about so that translates to `` I feel that.. '' .Wilkinson could have done better . He obviously knows his subject and has observed the international scene for a long time . He simply did not want to take the time to write the book he should have written.Perhaps I can described my impression of this work no more succinctly than to say that it appears to have been dashed off during a term break.I hate to say it but for the first time I really can not recommend one of the VSI series .	-1
As a professional philosopher ( the author is a journalist as far as I can tell ) , I wanted a book at my Christian University ( he says only intelligent and educated people are atheists , but I appear to have more education than him ... hum , factual error I guess ) , to introduce my students into the complexities and intellectually honest way some atheists form their view . This book does neither . There are such outstanding scholars out there who could have written such a book I have no idea why OUP chose this , as he says `` crass '' believer . I mean `` friendly atheists '' who are good scholars like Rowe et al.Anyway , here is what you 'll find ( the history chapter is just a bunch of quotes and agreeing with another secondarty source , BTW , no scholarship ) ..In the Preface he says he hopes to `` maintain a high standard of intellectual rigor and integrity . '' You be the judge ... * [ Theism is ... ] `` comforting idiocy '' ( p10 ) * [ Theism is ... ] '' crass simplicity '' ( p10 ) * [ that there is no soul ] `` is so startlingly obvious it is wonder anyone can doubt it '' ( p18 ) `` ... the evidence is overwhelming [ that there is no soul ] '' ( p18 ) * `` mountain of strong evidence '' [ there is no life after death ] ( p21 ) ... `` It smacks of wishful thinking and self-delusion '' ( p21 ) * Only atheists have `` firmly held beliefs '' ( ie 'rational ' ) p22 ) * `` an implausible tale about how non-material ... souls '' ( p30 ) * [ Souls and such are ... ] `` simply preposterous '' ( p30 ) * `` ... for the fact is that atheism just is n't a faith [ earlier defined as `` belief on lack of evidence '' , `` as something that can not be shown '' ] position '' ( p31 ) * `` Christ endorsed [ cf .

Brainwashing and fear ] ( p40 ) * `` the myth that without God everything is permitted '' ( p57 ) * [ If God created us for a purpose ... ] `` we are mere tools '' ( p59 ) * [ Religious believers ' belief that life has meaning ... ] is `` blind trust ... '' `` ... religions do n't have any clue what the meaning of ... life is '' ( p61* [ As for atheists and the good life ... ] `` The person living it just knows it is [ good ] '' ( p66 ) * [ We do n't want the ethics of } `` joyless Bible bashers '' ( p67 ) * `` ... if you want to seriously argue that we should believe in things we have no rational reason to think exists , why not believe in the tooth-fairy ? '' ( p77 ) * [ Religion ... '' `` ... just obviously was superstition and myth grounded in ... human practices '' ( p80 ) * [ Atheism is believed by millions ] `` -especially , it must be said , intelligent and educated people '' ( p87 ) As an academic who tries not use emotional or biased language when presenting any view to my students this books utterly fails . The fact that positive reviewers did n't pick up on this speaks about the powerful intoxicants of self-absorption and self-delusion *anyone* can have - back to Socrates , `` Know thyself . `` A real philosopher .	-1
The title of this book reveals that the translator is not actually knowledgeable about Islam . It is forbidden to make any change , however small , to the Holy Qur'an . That would include translation from Arabic.Legitimate translations will be titled `` The meaning of the Holy Qur'an '' or something along those lines , in order to indicate that the book is not the Qur'an , but a translation.This may seem like a minor point to non-Muslims , but in fact , it is strongly indicative of poor understanding of both the Holy Qur'an , and the laws of Islam.The Meaning Of The Holy Quran by Abdullah Yusuf Ali is an excellent alternative . Beautifully written and annotated by a true Muslim and Scholar .	-1

If it is a choice between plague and re-reading this book . The premise of course is stated in the title , which takes some of the suspense out of it and adds endless depths of melodrama . You know that every character you may grow attached to will die except the narrator . However , this is n't too much of a problem because it 's very difficult to grow attached to these characters who are often the producers of their own melodramas . And the prose is overblown enough to where I 've actually read passages to friends for a laugh . Not recommended except for die hard Shelley and apocalypse fans .	-1
I had to read this book for class . I loved the class , I hated the book -- as did everyone else in the class . We hated reading the book so much that we could n't even give the movie a fair shot.The book is hard to read for multiple reasons . I ca n't talk about the quality of the writing , since that would depend on which translation one is reading , but no matter who did the translation , some things ca n't be fixed . First of all , this novel is made up of only the surviving parts of the original story . There is supposed to be more , but it 's lost to us , and so all we have to read are bits and pieces . This makes it , understandably , difficult to follow the story . But beyond that there was , for me , a greater problem : the bits that were there were unpleasant . They were violent , disgusting , graphically sexual , and otherwise distasteful . I did n't want to find out what had happened in the missing bits , because I did n't enjoy what was happening in the bits there were.Perhaps a different translation might be able to make up for the unpleasantness of the story by having excellent prose that would make me want to keep reading ... perhaps . I 've both loved and hated The Iliad because of different translators , so I ca n't say that it 's impossible . But I doubt it .	-1
I wanted a book that presented and critiqued practical principles for doing the right thing . Being Good did not do the job for me . I think the main problem is the writing style , which I found hard to follow . In many chapters the main point is not stated clearly clearly and concisely ; there is lots of commentary which I suppose must be related to the main point , but unless you understand the main point it is hard follow and be interested in the commentary . I think another problem , for me , is that the writing style is more British than American ; that 's not a major problem , but with a confusing presentation to begin with it just makes it harder to understand and stay interested in the book.By the time I got to the middle of the book , I just could not tell where he was going , so I read the last chapter . The last chapter says , I think , that there is no single answer to the question of what 's the right thing to do . Then I read the rest of the book with a better understanding of what the book was trying to say , and it seemed to me that it was n't trying to say anything except commentary and critique . So in the end I did not come away with any useful conclusions for myself on being good or doing the right thing .	-1
Music is often considered the least representational and the most abstract art form . Despite of ( or perhaps because of ) that , it is still the most widely appreciated and enjoyed of all the arts , and the music industry has remained one of the most robust branches of the pop culture economy . Nonetheless , it is often hard to describe what it is about music that we like , or to verbally share our own appreciation with others . Understanding music can be a very worthwhile effort , and can endow listeners with deeper and more refined appreciation of music . Music schools continue to cater to healthy numbers of music majors , and music appreciation courses are a staple of many undergraduate liberal arts curricula . Even if you are no longer in college , investing a bit of your time into learning about music at a much deeper level could potentially be a very worthwhile effort , and this very short introduction aims to bring the better understanding of music to the wide general audience . Unfortunately , this book falls way short of that intended aim.This book is primarily a critique of various approaches to the understanding and thinking about music , and it presupposes at least a general familiarity on the part of the reader with the schools of thought and the general pedagogical methods that have over centuries been applied to the study of music and music education . Musicians , composers , musical styles and almost any other topic that one would expect to find in an introductory book on music are treated only in passing at best . The author is much more interested in `` problematizing '' our understanding of music then actually imparting any sort of concrete information . The book feels like its primary audience would be graduate students in a seminar in one cultural studies department or another . While reading this book I was seriously concerned that my appreciation of music would actually be diminished . Fortunately , all it took to assuage that fear was listening to my favorite tunes for a few minutes . Even though it is rather well written and provides the reader with some interesting insights , this book fails as an introductory book on music .	-1
Starts out as an interesting read , but becomes long-winded and overly scientific , even though the author stated his intent was to make the book appeal to all audiences . It did , however , expose me to new concepts and ideas .	-1
This book is bad.I am not criticizing Mr . Priest 's credentials , nor his accomplishments ( meticulously catalogued on the back flap ) . I am , however , critiquing what he is doing . His object is to teach logic , but what he really does is propagandize . His anti-religious devil is in the details of the subtext and examples.CASE 1 : He first quotes Noam Chomsky , who suggests that logic is merely hard-wired into our brain ( p. 6 ) . This view of logic , of course , is self-contradictory , and involves the Fallacy of Stolen Concept . If we are evolutionarily determined to believe logic , they why should we trust it ? Why should we trust anything that is the end result of random chance ? This position also implies determinisms , which would make the premises themselves determined , and therefore meaningless . The only way we could come to that conclusion is by having a process that was not determined by evolution , but separate and apart of the process.Logic , in reality , is a description of reality , and must be tied to facts . If it were anything else , it would be meaninglessBy the way , Priest and Chomsky also ignore the Anthropic Principle : the universe seems to be made to produce ham life ( See Hawking , A Brief History of Time , 128-131 ) . Logic , then would be part of this human-friendly phenomenon , and therefore exist prior to any evolutionary conditioning.CASE 2 : Priest uses a faulty description of the Cosmological Argument in teaching about quantifies ( p. 22 ) By his own admission , it is card-stacking : `` [ Thomas Aquinas 's ] version is much more sophisticated than the argument of Chapter 3 , and does not suffer from the problem pointed out there '' ( p. 109 ) . A professor with his stature and resources could have assigned his research assistants to fine a better example , rather than one that betrays an anti-religious bias.CASE 3 : Priest also uses Anselm 's Ontological Argument ( p. 26 ) . He fails to note that this is just one argument for God , and that it was disputed by Thomas Aquinas ( See . Kreeft , Summa of The Summa , 54 ) . Once again , he uses a faulty argument to smear religion.CASE 4 : He mentions Russell 's Paradox ( P. 34 ) , but misses the broader point . If any system comes up with a paradox , or an absurdity , then the system is faulty . This paradox shows that the system of symbolic logic has a hole in it that needs to be resolved.CASE 5 : Priest says `` Truth , then , comes by degrees . '' ( p. 73 ) . He is confusing truth with facts and data . Facts and data change from time to time , and day to day , but truth is eternal and constant . If truth changes , then it is absurd.CASE 6 : He discusses `` The Best Possible Worlds , '' and uses this to disprove the Argument From Design.He says , `` Similarly with god [ sic ] . Conceivably there are many different way the cosmos could have been . And intuitively , relatively few of those are significantly ordered : order is something special . That , after all , is what gives the Argument From Design its bite . But there are relatively few possible cosmoses in which there is an orderer , so a priori , it is much more likely that there is no creator than there is . '' ( p. 90 ) Priest is blowing smoke . He divorces the symbolic logic from the obvious fact that we have only one universe . Any discussion about an hypothetical other cosmos is just a flight of fancy . This is formally called the Fallacy of Hypostatization : a hypothetical is taken for a reality . In other words , Priest 's point only makes sense if you abandon common sense.CASE 7 : The Coin Toss In Hell example is his most obvious anti-religious dig ( p. 99-101 ) He makes the error of Discarded Differentia : he ignores the essential difference between heaven and hell . True if all you focus on is the probably of the coin toss , but you ignore the nature of hell ( which comes from our own choices and character ) and the nature of heaven ( also dependant upon our choices and character ) , the argument is sound.This book is gross propaganda . As I read it , I felt like C. S. Lewis reading The Green Book mentioned in `` The Abolition Of Man . '' To paraphrase him , anyone reading Priest will learn about logic precisely nothing . He is not teaching logic : teaching logic is easy , and what he is actually doing , namely propagandizing in the subtext , is much easier . And the nocive reader will be worse off .	-1

I got distracted for a while into reading about the Bright Young People that seemed to dominate the society pages ( the US or Style or People Magazine pages of their day ) between the first and second world wars . It was the first time I knew of that there was a focus on celebrity that arose out of personal behavior ( and not because the subjects were accomplished or leaders ) that was also simultaneously recorded in the newspapers and followed by the ordinary citizenry . They had fabulous parties , drank too much , shunned routine convention , were led generally by the children of the well to do , and committed all of the excesses and sins of outrageousness that our more current crop indulge in . With one difference . There were actually some accomplished individuals -- writers , artists and critics among the bon vivants . Robert Byron , famous largely for vitriol and being snarky was actually a travel writer , especially concerning architecture and the middle east . So I wanted to read his book . As I am a general reader without a strong foundation in architecture and its history , this left me cold . And the travelogue side of the text is a bit whiny and ( to me anyway ) uninteresting . Were it not for the minor footnote that Byron holds in social history , it would be of no interest to a general reader at all .	-1
If you wish to read the account of the American tragedy from a true historian , and not a socialist mutt , pick up Shelby Foote 's brilliant , un-PC , 3 volume set . There 's really nothing else to say . James McPherson is to history as Lenin is to Russian peasants ... ... ... ..a butcher !	-1
OK , I used to be a student at the college where Robert Pattison taught and there were some rumors that he regretted a lot of this book . God , I hope so ! This is chalk full of straw-man arguments about critics of rock music and , even worse , simplistic and flat-out lazy readings of Marxist and Frankfurt school criticism of mass culture . Also prominent is the stunt of throwing out quotes and dropping names left and right ( here 's a quote by Blake ... here 's a quote by Robert Plant ... you see , they 're the same ! ! ! ) , a mechanized style of analysis that is really all cultural studies is capable of and that does n't add up to any actual insight . Then there 's the whole Walter Benjamin-inspired claim that vulgarity is neither good nor bad but some of both that is about as wise as the average `` compare and contrast '' essay someone writes in high school . I suppose the cherry on the top of this feces sundae is the idea that rock , like romantic art , is n't subject to `` rational analysis '' because it is about `` feeling . '' All in all , I ca n't imagine that someone who likes rock would be much satisfied by the claims in this book , while the critics of rock this book ridicules will find their arguments poorly represented and just end up throwing this book in the fire .	-1
The central argument Worster tries to make in here is that the `` hydraulic society '' of the American West has somehow created an antidemocracy in which technocrats and plutocrats run everything . He asserts in his his book that `` everything begins and ends with water . '' If you accept this premise , his text has some interesting points , but the logical leaps required to accept the premise are difficult to make . As much as anything this book seems to be an attack on capitalism , but even that does not hold up because at different points in the text the author both highlights the need to get the power `` into the hands of as many people as possible '' and the problems people have in making self-regulated decisions . The general ecological message is still reasonably sound - learn to live with nature and do n't fight it or dominate it to the point of damage - but the rest of the book is confusing and suffering from an overly narrow focus . Read it if you have to , but be aware of what you are getting in to .	-1
As a whole , we are an impressionable society . If someone wins awards and garners accolades we immediately think this person must be , beyond a shadow of doubt , a specialist and an authority in his or her chosen field of profession . This is such a false impression . Case in point : Daniel Walker Howe 's `` What Hath God Wrought . '' While the book is a tedious read , a small redeeming quality is the fact that the book is basically divided into three sections ; the War of 1812 , the Texas Revolution , and the Mexican-American War . However , interwovened into these sections is a social and cultural history . Note : ( I personally think social and cultural history belong in the Sociology Dept . at the universities and not in the History Dept . ) Although the book is a tedious read , like I mentioned before , I have no problems with historical accuracy in the sections pertaining to the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War . However , I do have a major problem with the author 's section on the Texas Revolution.Major historical inaccuracies pertaining to the Texas Revolution can be found on pages 663-664 . How the heck is that possible for such a renowned author ? I will now point out each mistake ( it 's embarrassing ) . # 1 ) On page 663 , Mr. Howe claims that the total number of Alamo defenders is 150 ( Texians and Tejanos ) . Wow ... .he is behind on his research ! Since the 1990s , research has established the numbers to be much higher . Even with the total reinforcements of 32 men from the town of Gonzales , the numbers would have placed the Alamo defenders at 182 , a common standard for many years . However , current research places the number of defenders anywhere between 200 , 250 , and presently 257 Alamo defenders . These numbers owe to the fact that a majority of Alamo defenders made a break-out after realizing all and any further defence was not possible . Of course this information can be obtained by using Mexican primary sources , something Mr. Howe seemed to have ignored. # 2 ) On page 664 , Mr. Howe claims Santa Anna entered San Antonio on the 22nd of February . This is incorrect information . Where does this author get off with such faulty research to make such an erroneous statement ? Santa anna entered San Antonio on the 23rd of February . This is such a basic fact , that every student of the Texas Revolution knows this in he sleep.1836 was a leap year , so therefore February had 29 days , making it a 13 day siege . February 23 , through March 6 , 1836 . Had Mr. howe done his research properly and dilingently he would have discovered this interesting fact . Should we blame his editor ? # 3 ) Also on page 664 , Mr. Howe claims that the reinforcements of 32 men from Gonzales entered the alamo on March 5th . This is also incorrect information . It was March 1st when these 32 men from Gonzales were able to evade the Mexican army and successfully enter the Alamo as reinforcements.In conclusion , Mr. Howe not only butchered important information pertaining to the Texas Revolution , but he also destroyed any comprehensive accounting for the events leading up to the massacre at Goliad . Critical events of the Texas Revolution were ignored . Therefore , this book is not for first time readers of the Texas Revolution . This is bad history writing . I do n't care if the author is a Pulitzer Prize winner , or if he 's Jesus Christ incarnated , he is way off in his accounting of the Texas Revolution . The author makes it obvious to me that he does not care about the Texas Revolution , the Texians , and most importantly , the 2nd original inhabitants of Texas , Los Tejanos ! ! ! The author only seems to care about garnering more accolades . He has shown a blatant disrespect to the history of the Texas Revolution . If you do n't know your subject matter , then do n't write about it because you 'll only come across as an incompetent fool.I remember when I was asked by a certain someone as to why was it so important for me to acknowledge historical Dates . ( I was so stunned by the incompetency of the question that I found it hard to answer . ) Well , now I 'll be more than glad to answer that question ... .If dates are not important to the study of history , then why do we need to remember 9/11 , the fourth of July , and our Birthdays ? ? ? ? ? Dates are timelines that give us an account for critical events in our Nation 's past . We need to place these historical accounts in their proper perspective , and only dates will allow us to do so . Why would a university hire a certain Professor ( I 'm not talking about the author of this book , but a colleague ) who did not know this simple fact ? Or , hire a Professor with the audacity to question my appreciation for historical dates ? Teaching history without dates keeps us uneducated and ignorant . Unfortunately , certain universities are not training students to be independent thinkers , or to have an original thought of their own . It 's an unfortunate situtation when serious students of U.S. History are being short-changed by certain universities ; particularly universities that are teaching and promoting a watered down , conservative , politically correct U.S. History . I would not recommend this book at all .	-1
It seems like Bartov decided upon the results of his research first , then cherry-picked whatever sources he could find to `` demonstrate '' that the Wehrmacht became `` nazified '' . He makes sweeping generalisations based upon flimsy evidence and poor logic , then expands upon the results to make even more flawed conclusions.For an excellent critique , see [ ... ]	-1

Because of its popularity and its subject matter , I was very excited to read Chalmers ' The Conscious Mind . I was horribly disappointed.First , Chalmers ' discussion of supervenience and intension in chapter two is horribly convoluted . Of course , Chalmers asterisked some of the more technical parts of this chapter so that the lay reader could skip them , but here 's the problem : if you skip these sections , you are no longer able to critique the most crucial parts of Chalmers 's argument ! Second , Chalmers engages in bizarre and fallacious reasoning . One of his central arguments runs like this : It is possible to imagine a zombie -- -that is , a being who is molecule-by-molecule identical to me , but who lacks phenomenal conscious experiences ( i.e. , qualia ) . Since imagining this involves no obvious logical contradiction , zombies must be logically possible . Since zombies are logically possible , qualia must not supervene on physical facts -- that is , qualia are not logically dependent upon the physical . Since this is true , there can be no possible reductive , materialistic explanation of consciousness.This argument is preposterous on its face , as many reviewers have noted , and it is only the hocus-pocus about supervenience and intension in chapter two which lends it even a little credibility . For example , let 's assume that reductive explanation X can fully explain consciousness in terms of brain functioning . Even if this is true , it is STILL possible for us to imagine zombies right NOW -- -purely because of our ignorance of X . Since the zombie argument is a central pillar of Chalmers 's text , its failure is a failure of the book as a whole.Third , Chalmers has not done his homework when it comes to the arguments of other philosophers . For example ( leaving aside the technical details ) , I would suggest reading Quine 's essay `` Two Dogmas of Empiricism '' in From a Logical Point of View . Then , read Chalmer 's discussion of Quine 's arguments in chapter two of this book . Then reread Quine 's essay ( it 's a tough essay ) . Chalmers utterly fails to refute Quine 's arguments , and these arguments are absolutely fatal to Chalmers 's entire enterprise -- especially his ridiculous zombie argument.Finally , Chalmers does not address previous attempts to explain qualia ( phenomenal conscious experiences ) reductively . Daniel Dennett , for example , spends an entire chapter of Consciousness Explained trying to provide just such a reductive explanation . Since Chalmers 's whole point is to argue that the existence of qualia specifically makes reductive explanations of consciousness impossible , his failure to spend even two pages on Dennett 's explanation is ridiculous . ( Briefly , Dennett argues that qualia just are the sum total of all a person 's visceral , cognitive , emotional , etc . repsonses to a particular object of perception . ) In its foundations , its approach , and its failure to address important arguments by Quine , Dennnett , and others , this book is an abject failure . Instead , I would strongly suggest purchasing the wonderful and varied essay collection Explaining Consciousness : The Hard Problem .	-1
Although I am fascinated by time travel and its physical reality , I just could not continue reading this book . The material is very good , but the problem is that the author intermingled with the subject a novel that is so dull . At first I tried to enjoy the accompanying novel , then I started skipping the story to the real subject , but finally I got tired and I stopped.I just wish that the author had concentrated on the time travel subject and did not accompany a boring novel with it.Do n't buy this book unless you greatly enjoy reading novels .	-1
Complexity a Guided TourReview of Melanie Mitchell 's book `` Complexity : A Guided Tour '' This is a thoroughly disappointing book ; or an eye opener . Or maybe both.Disappointing because the book does not cover much more than many popular science books already in the market ( and it promised a bit more than that ) . An eye opener because the topic surveyed is still fairly fashionable and comes up in the end as fairly vacuus.Who is the author , what are her stated goals ? The author is a well known computer scientist from the world renowned Santa Fe institute . Her goal is to survey what she implicitly holds to be `` the great unexplored frontier of science '' . So far so good . She is actually careful to point out that as she will be talking about work in progress , some of the concepts might be a bit fuzzy around the edges and the book will be as much about clarifying `` whether such interdisciplinary notions and methods [ as complexity , emergence etc ... ] are likely to lead to useful science and to new ideas for addressing the most difficult problems faced by humans such as the spread of disease , the unequal distribution of the world 's natural and economic resources , the proliferation of weapons and conflicts , and the effects of our society on the environment and climate '' .Judge and partyThe first problem with the book is that it is far from being impartial . Mrs. Mitchell does not hide her fascination for the topics that she studies ( as a matter of fact someone not enthusiastic about one own 's work would probably not go very far ) , but this makes her less credible in her attempt to provide an objective assessment of the usefulness of her own field of studies . I found she was doing a credible job until chapter 17 ( out of 19 ) , which would not be too bad if the last chapters were not those dealing most directly with the relevance and prospect of `` complexity science '' . But a couple of sentences really rubbed me the wrong way . More on this in the note about `` the mystery of scaling '' , but suffice it to say at this point I do n't believe anybody deserves my attention who writes with a straight face that the so-called `` metabolic scaling theory '' has `` the potential to unify all of biology '' ( or for that matter anyone relaying such a claim as even credible ) .Surveying old chestnutsFor a book attempting to survey `` the cutting edge of science '' , much is covered that is fairly old and well established . Let us survey the table of content . The chapters 2 to 6 are respectively `` dynamics , chaos and prediction '' , `` information '' , `` computation '' , `` evolution '' and `` genetics , simplified '' . While each chapter in itself is not particularly bad , one would find better introduction to all these topics elsewhere . As I do n't imagine too many readers of Mrs. Mitchell are complete science novices , the material in these chapters is therefore not particularly useful . One could object that maybe the idea is not to expose the readers to the basic facts of these disciplines , but rather to present them within a new framework that would act as an eye opener . Unfortunately , I did not find that the presentation made of these topics was enlightening in this way.Evolution in Computers and `` Computation Writ Large '' These are the parts 2 and 3 of the book and in my view one of the better ones . The presentation of genetic algorithms through one example was one of the more interesting I 've seen ( little robot picking up garbage comes up with a neat trick that one would not necessarily have programmed a-priori ) . Again , I 'll levy the charge that the author does not make it particularly clear how the material she deals with in this part of the book relates to the rest and fits into the big picture . The author also covers cellular automata ( a topic beaten to death by Wolfram 's A New Kind of Science ) and provides some examples of current research in this field that are less likely to have been previously encountered by the reader . Then comes a vanity chapter dealing primarily with the author 's PhD thesis . While not uninteresting in itself , the subject does not warrant being put on equal footing with the other themes dealt within the book , but this is probably one of the lesser shortcomings of the book and one of the most understandable one.Network Thinking and `` The Mystery of Scaling '' : I 'll biteThe next part of the book annoyed me to the extreme . Full disclosure : this is going to get emotional and somewhat ugly . If you do n't like this type of stuff , please move on ! Ok , if you 're still reading , here 's my main issues with this part of the book : the `` science '' it describes is all style no substance . At its mediocre seems to specialize in producing factoids that can be usefully integrated in your average popular science article or Malcolm Gladwell book . At its pathetic worst , it becomes some sort of post-modern science where the clever positioning of the results matters more than their intrinsic worth . I wo n't cover here all the issues I have , but will instead focus only on one example provided by the author ( and already mentioned in my review above ) , the so-called case of the `` mystery of scaling '' . What 's going on here is that big animals have less surface to dissipate heat proportionally to their volume than smaller animals . This is something a high school student can easily understand . Given big animals do not routinely die of overheating , they must have a lower metabolic rate than small animals . One can through some sort of back of the envelope calculation predict how the metabolic rate should vary with size . The naive calculation does not seem to match experimental data very well . Then low and behold , a few heroic complexity theorist come up with a fractal network theory that seems to fit the data a bit better . My view is that this is a `` cute and clever '' explanation for a marginally interesting factoid . The book presents this as a revolution . I mean , come on ! that 's just a bit of basic geometry that does not provide any insight whatsoever into any underlying biological process . Any assertion something like this would play a role in biology `` similar to the theory of genetics '' is either shameless and cynical self promotion , or the result of a total lack of perspective . To be fair , the author mentions that the claims made here are a bit controversial , but I find this part a bit disingenuous to say the least . If this type of theory can in any way be put on equal footing with genetic theory , one would expect at least some sort of application . Look for it and return when you 've found it ... you 're not going to be back any time soon.I said I 'd cover only one example , but the last chapter has a couple of nuggets that I just ca n't avoid mentioning . Basically according to this chapter , biology and genetics are a massive failure ( I 'm exaggerating somewhat , but this is a summary ) . Junk DNA is not junk ( that 's actually possible ) but the most important bit of our genome ( highly speculative but not flagged as such ) and really understanding biology will require understanding biological networks ( well , as the Dude said in the Big Lebowski , that 's like your opinion ) . It 's hard to keep one 's cool when reading things like this . Basically , bench scientists who have sweated all their life to look at the details of how things actually work are wasting their time . All that one needs is a self indulgent theoretician who will come up with suggestive analogies that a biological system is like the internet and then we 'll have the final word . Hmm.Putting It All TogetherOk , I 'm getting carried away a bit , so let 's come back to factual facts . I quoted Mrs. Mitchell when I started my review . Her goal was to clarify `` whether such interdisciplinary notions and methods [ as complexity , emergence etc ... ] are likely to lead to useful science and to new ideas for addressing the most difficult problems faced by humans such as the spread of disease , the unequal distribution of the world 's natural and economic resources , the proliferation of weapons and conflicts , and the effects of our society on the environment and climate '' . Did she clarify this at all ? As a matter of fact , she touched upon these topics only briefly and certainly did not provide any evidence that complexity theory had anything useful to say on these topics . If one is looking for interesting ideas on how to deal with the tragedy of commons for instance , one would be much better served by referring to the work of someone having looked carefully at practical , real world examples . Someone like Elinor Ostrom for example . One will find recommendations on how to manage the complex by understanding the specifics of one complex situation . This looks to me much more promising than drawing remote analogies between non-commensurable systems . How long can scientists get a job to ponder fascinating similarities between fractal exponents ? This would actually be a good subject for a sociology of science study .	-1

Translation : nonsense . Anyone who proclaims that reductionism is dead is woefully ignorant of the enormous breakthroughts , by standard 'reductionist ' methods , in cell biology , including cancer research . See R. Weinberg 's & quot ; One Renegade Cell : How Cancer Begins & quot ; , as an antidote to the anti-scientific philosophy propagated in this book.First , there are no known laws of & quot ; self-organization & quot ; . The only known laws of nature are the laws of physics and consequences deduced from the laws , namely , chemistry and cell biology . Complex adaptable models and other efforts to mathematize Darwinism are so far not falsifiable , hence are not yet science and may never be . Second , no one has yet defined 'emergence ' in any meaningful ( i.e. , falsifiable ) way . Worse , every mathematical model that can be written down is a form of 'reductionism ' , including so-called complex adaptable ones . Let us think clearly and be try to be precise : Quantum theory reduces phenomena to ( explains phenomena via ) atoms and molecules . All of chemistry is about that . Cell biology attempts to reduce observed phenomena to DNA , proteins , and cells . Believers in self-organized criticality try to reduce the important features of nature to the equivalent of sandpiles via the hope for a not yet found universality principle . Network enthusiasts hope to reduce phenomena to nodes and links , and also wish for a universality principle . In order to try to isolate cause and effect , there is no escape from reductionism of one form or another . Holism is an empty illusion : holism can not even be mathematized or falsified . Holism is religion , not science , and should not be advertised as if it would be science.See Schr ? dinger 's & quot ; What is Life & quot ; for a clear explanation why we should not expect to discover macroscopic ( statistical ) laws of biological evolution , the only way to understand evolution being mutation by mutation at the level of DNA . Following Mendel , who was a reductionist in the Galilean spirit of physics , two of those who followed Schr ? dinger 's line of thought discovered the structure of DNA , and the genetic code . Genes and the genetic code are excellent examples of emergent objects that can be studied systematically . The genetic code is the source of the most important complexity in nature : life.Show me one , single , holist contribution to science or medicine , and I 'll eat my words ( without Schmarrn ... ) ! Gene Autry sometimes shot from the hip , but he at least occasionally hit something !	-1

Generally , works of history move at a certain pace , usually slow to start and then picking up steam later on.Born along the Color Line : The 1933 Amenia Conference and the Rise of a National Civil Rights Movementwas so dry , I was unable to finish it for this review . It is the first time in a long time that this reviewer picked up a book and set it aside because the writer was unable to hold sustained interest . There are truly great books about the civil rights movement ( Parting the Waters : America in the King Years 1954-63 , Freedom Summer : The Savage Season of 1964 That Made Mississippi Burn and Made America a Democracy ) . This is not one of them .	-1
I am going to sell this book , as it did not turn out to be helpful . I did n't have a clear idea how I would use it when I bought it , and I should have thought first . English translations are tools for gaining the sense of the original inspired words . One or two English versions are as good as eight.If I could redo this book , I would like to see this lineup : Challoner-Douay-Rheims , NAB , RSV , KJV , Jerusalem or New Jerusalem , Greek , Vulgate , and New Vulgate . Dynamic translations are not very useful for close study of the text : one is enough . Although this is a book for English speakers , there is no reason to pretend that the Latin and Greek are totally inaccessible for us . The Greek and Latin vocabulary for the NT are full of words that have been taken into our language and are familiar to most native English speakers with enough interest in theological matters to consider buying this book , e.g . apostle , ecclesia , concupiscence , metanoia , etc.It is better to try to get some grasp of the Greek , and of the Vulgate , which is important because of the links it helps establish between theological categories in English and the biblical text , e.g . with words such as `` concupiscence '' . I would put in the KJV because with all its faults it is still the major English Bible . Even one like myself with little Latin and less Greek is still better off wrestling with the Vulgate and the original text than going through eight different translations.But my reason for getting rid of it is not because it 's not perfect , but because I find myself being drawn into comparing the different translations to each other and wondering what the motive of the translators was for particular choices of English . That takes up time and distracts me from the business at hand , which is to understand what the inspired writers set down , as much as my limited capabilities allow .	-1
Look at other study Bibles like the Concordia Self-Study Bible , before you get this one . It is very limited in notes and is not a study bible at all . I own one and with so many other better choices out there I can not understand why anyone would bother with this .	-1
Difficult to find the readings for the particular days . Perhaps others who are more familiar with it would not have this problem .	-1
This book is useful if you want to understand the connection between the New Testament and the Old Testament ; it gives numerous Old Testament references . But it explains away any possible criticism of 1st century Jewish religion , culture or customs , and Ms. Levine explicitly states that *any* criticism of them is illegitimate and anti-Semitic . It comes from the Jewish viewpoint that it 's cute that other religions use the Jewish scriptures , but these beliefs can not possibly be genuine and can in no way be viewed as superior or more true than ancient or modern Judaism , not even by their adherents . To Christians who might want to read this- the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament comes from the Old Testament , but you knew that already from reading both . To Jews who might want to read this- the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament come from the Old Testament , but that does n't help you understand Christianity because Christianity is based on Jesus 's divinity and actions rather than his teachings .	-1
Harrison was a USAID official with mainly Latin American experience , who was involved in the Culture Matters conference series with Sam Huntington , and wrote this book as a visiting scholar at Tufts . The work relies heavily on the essays prepared for the Culture Matters Research Project . The comparative data correlating development indicators to Pew World values survey and predominant religion is interesting , if not entirely convincing . The & # 34 ; progress prone & # 34 ; cultural characteristics are fairly convincing even if their origin is an idiosyncratic Argentinean journalist . My main criticism is that & # 34 ; progress & # 34 ; and development are narrowly defined in terms of western capitalist growth , which might be self limiting in more than John Wesley 's sense of prosperity undermining the virtue of hard work ; growth might be catastrophic , and other value systems might help us survive those growth induced catastrophes . If this is true , then propagating the virus of the Anglo-Protestant work ethic is the cultural equivalent of monocultures in agriculture , and maybe not such a good idea . Ultimately , I am a little bit uncomfortable spreading the gospel that the world needs more protestant capitalism like the good stuff found in America . See also Jones , Cultures Merging .	-1
This is a poor sequel to `` The Next Christendom '' ( TNC ) . As a sequel it lacks the innovative seminal foundation of TNC . While TNC gave you unique insights on how the shifting of Christianity 's cultural center from the West to Africa and Asia will affect the geopolitical landscape over the next century ; this more recent book did not offer much more.This book is repetitive and boring as the author goes into arcane details to stretch this book out to 200 painful pages . The main themes , in part covered in TNC , include that Africans do relate to the Old Testament because their lifestyle is similar to the ones of Judaic tribes 2,000 years ago . They both live in an impoverished , violence and sickness ridden primitive agricultural society . Africans do take the Old Testament literally . For them , the Old Testament is more credible than the New Testament and far more credible than contemporary Western interpretation of the later . Their religion accepts miracles , visions , prophecies , animal sacrifice , exorcism , and polygamy . Their religion rejects gay rights , many women 's rights , abortion , and the separation of Church and State . Thus , African Christianity clashes with Western Christianity on most counts . The author mentions a few related interesting geopolitical and demographic trends . But , he already said most of it better in TNC . The latter was a seminal masterpiece that changed our understanding of Christianity 's prospect over the next century . The author should have stopped at the top and skip this book .	-1
Phillip Jenkins , known as a student of the modern history of Christianity inThe Next Christendom , in `` God 's Continent '' aims to argue that the state of Christianity in Europe is not nearly so bad as is generally assumed by the press concerned about an Islamic takeover.Whilst , were it true , this would be useful to remind people , Jenkins arguments can not hold sway . He does point out radically declining fertility rates in Muslim nations surrounding Europe , but in reality this is most likely to suggest a long-term future of radical secularism extending to the Middle East and North Africa and a rapid fading of Islam , especially if the highly centralised EU structure covers those areas ( which Jenkins suggests it could ) .When Jenkins looks at the secularisation of Europe , one already sees he is off-line in the way in which he studies . Whilst he clearly shows the decline in religiosity of the European population , his efforts to find a cause and to explain why the US has not followed suit is very flawed . One possibility is the fact that the US has a much smaller pension system due to Reagan 's reforms . Much worse , though , is how when actually trying to study the secularisation of Europe , Jenkins puts far too little attention towards the causes of that secularisation . Given that he notes the much higher religious observance of those born before the baby boom generation of the 1940s and 1950s , Jenkins ought to have devoted at least a page or two to explaining what might cause this . The way in which conservatives can convincingly suggest a surprising answer likefemale suffrage ( which he does note in the book ) ought to make him think seriously . Instead , he spends too much time ranting on the more recent declines of later generations.His look at the efforts to renew Christianity in Europe via African and Asian immigration is interesting . Given that I know immigrants tend to be very conservative compared to people who remain in their homeland , there is the possibility that migrant renewal could be long-lasting , but the way in which the EU has been so successful at creating a government that could threaten any conservative religion on grounds of discrimination makes this doubtful.His part on Islam , on the other hand , is rather wishy-washy . Given how well conservatives and the politically non-aligned like myself know so well that when religion loses its essential tenets and mystery it ceases to be an effective force , it is very hard to see how Islam will survive any better than Christianity ( or Buddhism , for that matter ) by compromising with militant secularism.Another noteworthy fault is that Jenkins seems to think the popularity of pilgrimages means Europeans are not so secular as people imagine . The way I see it , such `` pilgrimages '' as occur in modern Europe are with a very few exception like Lough Derg basically pure tourism to study a continent 's past which they may find fascinating even if violently repelled by the rigid laws of the Vatican against female ordination or sexual freedom . ( One book whose title I will not disclose distinguished between pilgrimage and tourism in terms of accommodation and way of life : pilgrimage involved staying with locals in private homes and living their lifestyle ; tourism involved living one 's own lifestyle outside ) .All in all , `` God 's Continent '' is most disappointing . In its aim to explain the secularisation of Europe , it fails , and it has another failure in looking at how Islam will evolve .	-1
**Review from Uncorrected Advance Reading Copy**As with most books for the layman of a scientific nature , they usually have what is called `` The Hook '' . For the subject matter of neuroscience of the brain in `` The Overflowing Brain '' , our hook in this case is the typical overworked and over distracted office worker named Linda.Though the author presents some interesting topics , such as Raven Matrices which tests what neurophysiologists call `` working memory '' ( unlike short-term or long-term memory ) , but he does not always connect the topics back to his audience . For example , since Linda is introduced for a reason should she attempt to improve her working memory or just find a new job with less distractions ? In the end , we never really get an answer from my view.Unfortunately and therefore , I have to rate this low because in the end I left thinking about Linda stuck in her cubicle still overworked and over distracted . However , maybe the Editor can correct some areas prior to release . One recommendation is to bring either Chapter 10 ( A Cognitive Gym ) or 11 ( The Everyday Exercising of Our Mental Muscles ) about working memory earlier in the book to hold ones interest longer .	-1
I expected this book to deal with the details of all the subterfuges used by the British , but unfortunately it mainly dealt with camouflage and propaganda . There was so much chronology & discussion about how the two world wars were progressing that I do n't think the title of the book was really addressed . I was particularly disappointed that clever ruses like Q-ships received barely a mention , since most of the book was aimed at land warfare . Heavily reliant on Churchill 's memoirs , I was disappointed with this .	-1
I really wish someone who had the time and inclination would look into the apparent effort by ye olde university press to publish subtle and clever screeds against the United States ' honorable legal tradition against religious tyranny . If one did n't know better , one would think somehow , incredibly , the classic Oxford dons who must have something to say about what gets published had no idea that most of world history is a long paean to that religious intolerance . And further that the American tradition , however imperfect and vexed , represents something real and tangible and worth fighting for , personally and intellectually . But it seems they are determined to publish books that make the same sort of bizarre argument in different ways . Namely that the noble tradition of church-state separation in the US was a mirage , because its history was not perfect . . Huh ? And that the imperfect is the enemy of the should . That is the the `` should '' involved with the idea that we as a country should maintain and honor this tradition and not tamper with it with intellectual acrobatics . And acrobatics are exactly what this production seems like . I do n't have the time , or really the stomach to read these gymnastics all the way through . I am nauseated by the words that open one chapter : `` The rationale for the moral establishment was internally inconsistent , claiming to support religious liberty while in fact promoting religious control. `` ( p. 155 ) One wants to ask what planet this author is from . For such an arrangement is just about the BEST human beings get on this orb . Of course we should try to improve it , and make it ever more impartial . Yet to not to acknowledge the essential massive virtue involved in even the attempt to make such liberty a reality , in the context of actual religious history to the contrary everywhere else for all of human history , is an utterly snot-nosed errand . But the whole presumption of Sehat 's effort is contained in the implicit challenge . `` Claiming '' to support religious liberty , as he says . . Well , in an honest perspective of religious history 's trajectory already merely to `` claim '' such liberty was revolutionary . A big duh ! to this fellow then , instead of a long argument here , which I can not even stand to make , his ingratitude is so offensive . This sheds light on his admitting how `` selective '' he is with information in the beginning of the effort . It is not a big surprise that one can be `` selective '' and come up with a phalanx of instances that militate against really honoring our great tradition for the massive goods it did produce in the context of world religious history . But that sort of commonsense reasoning eludes the ambitious academic apparently . And thus a friend-colleague of his who they provide as a review say he has `` demolished '' the noble tradition . Yuck ! Academic onanism on these topics apparently is the order of the day , and Oxford is the place to get them in print . But why ? One suspects that underneath this whole effort is a subtly reactionary point to it all , which may relate to the author 's erstwhile evangelicalism which he touts at the beginning . I wish someone would look into it more closely , the whole matter is too tedious and predictable for me . Where there is smoke there is usually some academic 's ire . But I will stick with ultimately just registering my simple amazement and pity for the wan thoroughness of an effort like this that it is so `` selective '' that the whole thing can start with a discussion of Ben Franklin and there is no real discussion of the organization to which he belonged that enshrined and still enshrines religious liberty .	-1
This is an excellent book for students of the Battle of Midway . It is very well written , fast paced and interesting throughout , neatly organized and annotated . Buy it for these reasons.However it adds nothing new to our history of the Battle . As the author points out in his Acknowledgments Chapter he has drawn heavily on recently published authors for both source and editing . At the same time he has ignored the work of his predecessor on the Annapolis faculty , Professor E. B. Potter , who wrote the biography of Admiral Chester Nimitz with the admiral 's cooperation.On pages 86-87 of the Nimitz biography Professor Potter describes the meeting of the evening of May 27th at which Admiral Spruance and Fletcher and their staffs were briefed on the plan to ambush the Japanese carriers as they were engaged in attacking the islands of Midway . It specified the dawn ambush station for our Navy 's fleet to be 200 miles north of Midway , with the Japanese carriers well within range of all of our aircraft.1Professor Symonds ignores this meeting and its significance . On page 225 of his new book he reports that Admiral Fletcher launched his CAP and search planes at 4:20 AM on the morning of June 4th from a position `` 320 miles northwest of Midway '' . It was 6:20 AM before Admiral Spruance and Task Force 16 were released to proceed southwesterly and attack the enemy . Our carrier attack planes were launched too late and at extreme range , extended well beyond the range planned for the dawn ambush station 200 miles north of Midway.Professor Symonds support of the theory that the Japanese Kido Butai attack fleet may have been split into two separate task forces is also questionable . Ensign Ady 's initial contact report of two carriers was immediately dismissed by Admiral Nimitz , as stated on page 93 of his biography . From the detailed reports of Cmdr . Rochefort 's code breakers he knew that the number of Japanese destroyers , only eleven committed to the escort of the whole Nagumo force , would have been insufficient to support two separate task forces.Admiral Fletcher presumably would have had the same information . No one really knows why he abandoned the ambush station to go on the defensive that morning , long before receipt of Ensign Ady 's two carriers sighting . There has been much conjecture about his reasons and what he expected to accomplish with a search a mere 100 miles to his north . Using the two carrier report as an excuse for his action has been mentioned so frequently that it is being accepted as fact.This is also true of Chapter 12 's titillating tale of the `` Flight to Nowhere '' .This conjecture is disputed by Clayton Fisher , one of the two veteran dive bomber pilots of the Battle of Midway still alive . Ensign Fisher was Commander Ring 's wingman for the entire flight . Professor Symonds relegates this protest to Note 18 of his book 's Appendix 7 . I would have given more credibility to an actual participant in the event than to writers 70 years after the event pushing their own agenda.It is too bad that this excellent book follows the lead of other `` black shoe '' historians who seem to be determined to absolve Admiral Fletcher of any responsibility by transferring blame to the aviation contingent . Loss of the Yorktown , combat losses due to the lack of co-ordination in the strikes , and the losses of US aircraft , pilots and crews through lack of fuel were the responsibility of Admiral Fletcher , whose days as a fleet commander were soon terminated . Admiral Mitscher and Commander Ring went on to illustrious careers throughout the war.Professor Symonds has done such a beautiful job of writing this book that it bothers me to offer critical comments . To compensate let me say to readers who have reached this point , `` Buy the book , it 's a great read . `` * NOTE '' During the night of June 3d-4th our task forces moved south-southwest to a position about 200 miles north of Midway . It was hoped that they would be able to catch the enemy striking force on the flank when it launched its anticipated attack on the islands . At 0420 on June 4th the Yorktown launched a security search of the sector to the north and put a fighter patrol into the air . The Enterprise , 5 or 10 miles to the southwest with Task Force SUGAR , took over direction of fighters . `` Combat Intelligence Branch , OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE- 1943Cmdr . Edwin T. Layton attended the May 27th briefing and mentions it in his book , `` And I Was There '' .Jon Lundstrom . The First Team , Opening of Chapter 15 '' As Wednesday turned into Thursday , 4 June , Fletcher 's Striking Force steamed southward at an economical 13.5 knots , the two carrier task forces remaining about 10 miles apart . First light ( around 0430 ) was to see Striking Force at a point bearing 013 degrees , 202 miles from Midway . This constituted the famous flank ambush position planned by Nimitz , Fletcher , and Spruance . They expected the Japanese carriers to roar down on Midway from the northwest and launch a massive air strike at dawn to pummel the island 's defenses . `` Other sources confirming the 200 mile north ambush station : The Barrier and the Javelin by H.

Phenomenology of Spirit is not a book to be tossed aside lightly ; it should be hurled with great force . ( And I did do this , I threw this book against the wall when I read it in college ! ) Utterly worthless drivel . `` The height of audacity in serving up pure nonsense , in stringing together senseless and extravagant mazes of words , such as had been only previously known in madhouses , was finally reached in Hegel , and became the instrument of the most barefaced , general mystification that has ever taken place , with a result which will appear fabulous to posterity , as a monument to German stupidity .
