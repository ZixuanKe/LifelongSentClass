I needed a set of jumper cables for my new car and these had good reviews and were at a good price . They have been used a few times already and do what they are supposed to - no complaints there.What I will say is that 12 feet really is n't an ideal length . Sure , if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long , but a lot of times you will be beside another car or ca n't get really close . Because of this , I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16 ' version though .	1
These long cables work fine for my truck , but the quality seems a little on the shabby side . For the money I was not expecting 200 dollar snap-on jumper cables but these seem more like what you would see at a chinese knock off shop like harbor freight for 30 bucks .	1
Ca n't comment much on these since they have not yet been used ( I will come back and update my review is I find any issues after first use ) ... but they are built solid , nice tough big hard clamps and love having a long cable so I never have to move cars around or anything if needed . I bought these to have in my new truck since you always need cables ... but another reason is for when I tow my travel trailer and we run the batteries with no shore power they may die after a couple days ... if you are in need a quick small recharge they are the perfect length to pop my hood , run the cables to the back of the truck and hook up to the batteries that are on the tongue of my travel trailer ... running the truck for 30-45 minutes with this nice large gauge wire connected from my battery tot he trailer battery will give me a bit of a charge if ever in a pinch and I have no shore power , solar , or generator to recharge.Bought the bucket boss 06009 jumper cable bag and it fit this 25 footer Perfectly ! ! ! It has no use and is a waste of money right now ... but will EASILY pay for itself the first time you need it ... always be prepared ! : )	1
I absolutley love Amazon ! ! ! For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store , you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers ! First off , do n't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a `` jump '' but also if they have jumper cables . It 's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing . Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall , or even parked on a one way street . The `` booster car '' ( the car w/o a dead battery ) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position . Or better yet , you wo n't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped . If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you ! Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two , they could pull in front . Now how about gauge ? For those who are n't electricians or engineers , as the number value of gauge decreases , the size and capacity of the cable increases . So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga , and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga , so on and so on . That does n't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though . 4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff . Do n't worry if this does n't make sense , you do n't really need to know all of this , but I 'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can . I 'm not an electrican but I 've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb . First of the enemy of electricty is resistance . Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry . Five things factor into resistance . Temperature , conductor , voltage , load , and distance . Temp we ca n't control , so we have to assume the worst ( HOT ) ... or in other words need heavier cable . Conductor should be copper , or at least a high purity mix of copper ... good there . Voltage ... 12VDC is a low voltage system ... probably the biggest problem we face . Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire . The higher the voltage , the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire ... so again since it 's low voltage need heavier gauge wire . Load ( Amperage ) ... it 's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power . The voltage is a fixed number ( more or less ) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start . And you 'd be surprised how high that can be . Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps . That said even a `` dead '' battery will put out some power . As for distance ... this cables selling point is also a draw back . 25 ' is LONG run for 12VDC . So like I said in the last line 4-ga is n't as much as you think . In fact , if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance . So summing up in layman 's terms ... considering the hot temperatures outside , the fact that it 's 12VDC and we need a long cable , and that we 're trying to start a car engine ( which takes a LOT of power ) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery . Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the `` dead '' car on a frame ground ( something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment . ) Do n't attach it directly to the battery 's NEG post . Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes . This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery . Then attempt to start the car . As soon as it starts remove the cables ( starting with the NEG on the car being jumped . ) If you ever have a dead battery for any reason ... take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge . Most places do it for free . NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery ! ! ! Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system , and/or cause fire , burns , explosion of the battery , damages to your cables ... A couple of final thoughts . Protect your investment . I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk . Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag . And once used , take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again . The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts . These cables are more than worth they weight in gold ! They are inexpensive and top notch quality !	1
I purchased the 12 ' feet long cable set and they arrived in a retail cardboard box with handle , which could be used as a storage and carrying case for these cables , although I will not need to store them with the carry box . These are high quality long cables of high grade materials and I believe worth the price I paid for them . They will store in the back seat storage compartment of my truck easily . Recomend .	1
These Jumper cables are heavy Duty , Yet easy to Store . I keep them in one of my containers on my delivery vehicle . They are high quality . They are 4 gauge cable , so they are perfect and long enough to Start are Utilimaster Diesel trucks when are batteries are run Down . There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables . these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency . The cost is reasonable as well . With 25 feet , you do n't have to get real close to the other vehicle . you can pull up to the back and or side and just run the cables under or down the side of the vehicle .	1
bought these for my k2500 suburban plenty of length front to rear . i ended up using them right out of the box as i for a dead battery in my truck . they worked great . several people have complained about the clamps . they worked well for me and i had no issues with poor connections . cables are well made .	1
these are good enough to get most motorized vehicles up and running , for semi and farm equipment , get solid copper .	1
The Coleman Cable 08665 12-Feet Heavy-Duty Truck and Auto Battery Booster are great , heavy and fit perfectly into the Arsenal 5888 Cable organizer . Hopefully i do n't ever need to use them but better to be prepared than sorry .	1
I have an old car , Its bound to need these sometime . I got a set after I gave my old ones to my boss whose truck was acting up . These are long ( 20 ' ) and heavy duty feeling . Usually I 'm giving someone else a jump . If I ever have a bad experience with these I will come back and update the review .	1
I seem to use jumper cables at least several time every year ; usually on someone else 's car . I 've & # 34 ; rescued & # 34 ; a few strangers in parking lots because I keep cables in my cars . The 20 ' length is a safety feature ; you should n't have to lay these cables across an engine bay to reach a battery . Aluminum wire ? Well , these are consumer grade . They 'll get the job done at reasonable cost .	1
All other jumper cables are not real jumper cables . THESE are jumper cables . Let me explain.When you 're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead , you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that , it 's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables . It 's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan . Now , according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances , you need thicker cable.That 's where these cables come in , they 're long at 25 ' and thick at 2gauge.That 's what these cables provide , maximum length at near maximum gauge cable . And yes , your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that 's what you need -- - just look up the cost of copper on the market ( that stuff is expensive ) .Yes , you can buy a $ 17 set of 10 foot , 18 gauge cables out there but if they ca n't reach between cars or if they ca n't carry enough power to start your car , you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $ 17 for all the false confidence it gave you . I 'm serious , buy an extension cord for $ 5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper ' cables on the market -- - there should be laws against marketing products that can not jump start a car . Worse , having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day , you want a 25 ' or 20 ' cable , so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there . You can go to 6gauge if you 're working your way down to 16 ' cables . But , the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone 's car parked in some tight parking space -- - so you 're back to the 25 ' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these ( more importantly , I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw ) - Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong , but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they 're friggin heavy at near 14lbs , yes that 's a pro ! that means there 's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that 's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river ( no pun intended ) . It 's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps , it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert . I do n't know if that 's a mistake or not . I 'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting . I 'm sure it 's more than enough the way it is.Overall , these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up . He custom made his -- he 's old school.Anyway , if you 're going to carry jumper cables , and you should -- - do n't muck around -- spend the dough , get these -- - they 'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice , after you get a jump do n't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home . There 's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have .	1
I 'm one of those guys who stops and helps people when they need it . While not a pro recovery guy I use my cables more than the average person . These fit the bill just right . Strong clamps with a long cable that stays pliable in the cold .	1
So these are n't the best cables you can buy . For that you 'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY ! Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost ! So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use , I 'd say these are gon na work for you . ( Update : After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car , they do n't really seem that much thicker ... That 's said they are MUCH heavier ! The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I 'm guessing that 's why the thickness is n't much more ... ) What I like : -- Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup . Why ? Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides . Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you. -- Heft - these cables are no joke . It 's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow . When trying to start a 5.7L V8 , that 's kinda important. -- Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews , I do n't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand . But their hardly weak , they 'll clamp solid and stay put ! ( Update : If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these , Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $ 150 . I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good . ) What I do n't like : -- Stiffness - They 're not as flexible as I was hoping . But about as flexible as I expected . True welding cable in 2ga is about $ 3 per foot and per cable . That 's why the best jumper cables cost $ 200+ . Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty. -- Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable does n't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws . Instead . It 's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body . Still fine I 'm sure.So why buy these cables are n't they overkill ? I 've had this argument with people before : `` My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine . '' Well I will attempt to addess this . As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases . In other words 2ga has more ( perhaps 50-100 % more ) conductor than 4ga . This does n't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely . For those that are n't aware ( and I 'm not an electrical engineer here ) , resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts . Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together . Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size . Ambient temperature , conductor , line distance , voltage , and amperage . Ambient temp we have no control over . Hot is bad so just assume the worst . This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing . Conductor of these is copper so that 's good . You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor . Distance and voltage . One of these cable 's strengths also happens to be a weakness . Total run length for this circut is 50 ' . Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC . The higher the voltage , the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop . 12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance . So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this . Amperage is also a big consideration . The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate . Basically on a small wire , a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen . 1 ) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire . 2 ) The load your trying to power wo n't work . And make no mistake , starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy ! So bringing it all together . Large load , low voltage ( that we do n't want to make in lower ) , and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find . Addressing the orignal question and statment . 6 ' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine . But if you want or need the extra length , you need to consider heavy gauge cables . That said I 've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you ? So these will run you close to $ 100 shipped ... do you actaully need them ? I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25 ' booster cables . Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this . The 4ga will do you fine at the 25 ' length for engines up to 5-liters or so ( and honestly probably up to about 6L as well . ) Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment . Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected . Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag . I have the Arsenal # 5888 cable organizer and it works great for this . Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe .	1
It is hard to find pure copper cabled jumper cables . The add for these gave me the confidence that I was getting just that . After arrival I noticed the plated copped aluminum wire : ( . Not a deal breaker as they are well built and will most likely do what I request of them .	1
These are an insurance policy for my Land Rover . An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . These are heavy weight and appear to be solidly built . As I have n't used them , it 's difficult to talk about function . That being said , I 'm happy enough with the construction to give them a solid 4 . You get what you pay for , and this is certainly worth it .	1
Hitch extender is good for Kayak transport and allows me to secure slippery kayaks to bed , with minimal effort . There are rings on Tee , allow straps and Bunge Cords to effortlessly secure boats to bed . After securing Kayaks in place with Rope and cords , this method of support and tiedown of ends of Kayaks just makes sense . Good product , Well made and painted with good coating for corrosion resistance . Stores easily or hangs from hooks on Garage wall , though it is somewhat weighty . Yo lil ' mamma will struggle to move it , but that 's why you have one ! Also mounts to support cab level or bed rack level loads like ladders . The ladies will like it 's slender frame . You yakkers with hitches , should get you one !	1
Package arrived a bit ragged but it was all there , easy to install , takes less than 5 minutes , works as described . We used it on my F150 crew cab truck to haul my wife 's paddle board . Would suggest to anyone looking for a product like this .	1
This was exactly what I needed for transporting my fishing kayak in the bed of my F-150 . Easy to assemble and works great !	1
I bought these to haul my two kayaks . Works great . I would have given 5 stars , but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material . Also , the flag it comes with was missing my first order , Amazon sent me a new one , but the flag is real cheap ... just a piece of red thin plastic .	1
I have owned trucks for many years and gotten by with long lumber though not without some problems from time to time . I originally bought this for use with my kayaks which are 14 ' long to carry them in the back of the truck with its 6.5 ' bed . Instead I have been using this extender at least 3 times a month to transport long items.The two pieces fit one inside the other and the overall length is short enough that I can store it behind the seat of the truck until needed . The tubing is heavy enough gauge to support the rated load with no flexing . The two pins needed to attach it to a hitch receiver and to connect the two pieces are provided . The cross bar as multiple holes so I could adjust it for the height of the bed of my truck.There are end loops to use to tie a load and secure it to the bar . The center post also works well as an attachment point for lumber and pipe.I saw similar racks selling for more than twice as much that provided often less strength and no more versatility than this one . Usually after I have tried something like this I see things that I would improve in the design but not so with this bed extender .	1
This is a must for anybody who wants to keep their car clean between washes . My car sits outside , in parking garages , and old sheds . All of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car . This model comes with the wood handle . Others out there have a cheap plastic one . Read the directions on the cover . You 're suppose to let it air out after shipping . It has something to do with the wax on the brush . It also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty . In fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier . The duster will work even better if you put a sealant and/or wax on your car . You 'll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car . The duster will easily remove pollen , dust , and any other light coating of material . It will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits , but you 'll still see the marks if you look carefully . Buy this product . You 're call will thank you !	1
I own the Original California Car Duster and it works very well . It is great for touch up cleaning in between car washes . It is true what they say about the more you use it the better it cleans . If you use it a lot it will start to turn black but it will start cleaning better than ever . It is great to wipe light dirt and dust off your car and makes it look like you just waxed your car . If you take care of it then it should last for many years .	1
Like most car detail enthusiasts , I never liked to see 3 hours of detailing work destroyed in a couple of days of driving and parking . With this brush , my detail jobs last longer . The brush is gentle on the clear coat but it does sweep the dust away , leaving water and and bird droppings behind.For best results , I recommend that you clay clean the car with a good car clay and wax it with S100 car wax every few months . Then using this brush , you can maintain your car in show room condition for a long time without having to wash it .	1
Takes the dust off my car without leaving any streaking that some report with other brands . Just do n't press real hard .	1
Really the best car duster out there in my opinion . Used others and they are cheap and fall apart easily . This one really gets the job done . Had it for almost two years now . Too bad I ca n't find where I put it : /	1
I 've been using one of these for years and I 'm on my second one . This duster works exceptionally well and lifts the dust without dragging it around . I will NOT make a filthy car that has n't been washed in weeks or months look clean . You must either keep your car in a garage , or use a cover like I do , and dust it daily to keep it looking clean . If I wash , clay bar , and wax my car I can go two months or perhaps more without washing it again , as long as I keep it covered , dust daily , and wipe it down weekly with an instant detailer . The fibers are impregnated with a paraffin wax so do n't just lay it on something if you do n't want it to be stained because of the wax and dirt . Also , if there is condensation on the car it really renders the duster ineffective so make sure it 's dry before using it .	1
This thing is great . I had another one from a different company that broke because the handle was plastic . This is wood and it feel a lot more solid . I have a black car and this takes the dust right off . Great buy ! 10 out of 10	1
The California Car Duster has been so much more than I expected . I keep a good finish on my car and it is garaged year-round . Washing the car was ( many times ) simply a matter of hosing off the dust . This does a damn nice job of dusting all of the car surfaces quickly and easily . Sometimes I get lazy and the car duster saves me a full car wash . Try it !	1
As we all know , dust gets over your rides in the garage , and is nice to be able to dust it off instead of complete re-detail ! .	1
Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes , from black to white . This duster keeps a relatively clean , maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use . How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes ? The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided . You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use . It has a waxy coating on the fibers ( all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish ) and it has to dry out before initial use . Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches , but suspect it is because they did n't let it dry out . The one time I forgot to do that , it looked liked it scratched ( scared the daylights out of me ! ) , but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed . And , if there is moisture on the car 's surface , it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second , it is is a DUSTER , NOT a scrub brush . Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them . If you scrub with it to remove mud , splotches , bird droppings , etc. , it WILL scratch , just as dry rubbing a car 's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it . You let the Duster do the work , lifting the dust right off the car . Does n't just push it around , but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt , but of course ca n't figure out how that could be true . BUT , have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation . Tried washing once , which maker says you can do , but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness . Ya , it may last forever , but I buy a new one once a year - hey it 's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors , get one of these and be as amazed as they will .	1
This product is an effective way to remove dust and pollen in between car washes . I have used it for several years without any problems , and recently bought a new one to replace the one that got ruined in Hurricane Irene this past summer ( my garage was flooded ) . Here is why I like it:1 . This cleans without harming the car finish or leaving streaks.IMPORTANT : Follow the directions to place this on newspaper for 48 hours before first use . That is to get rid of excess wax that can cause streaking.2 . This covers a large area , so the time to clean is reduced.3 . This is easy to clean ( just shake it out ) and works great no matter how dirty it gets.4 . This is well made and durable.Note : This is not a substitute for going to a car wash or using other cleaners . It does nothing , for example , to remove water spots or bird droppings . It also does nothing to give your car the shine that only wax can do . But it is a great way to maintain your car in between car washes .	1
The first worked so well I decided to purchase a second to keep in the car . Not why , but as advertised the dirtier it gets the better seems to work . As long as you use as suggested , dust your car , and not try to clean heavy dirt with it , it will leave your car spotless .	1
Amazingly wipes off dust keeping your car cleaner between washes . If you have a black car , you want to buy this product and use it often .	1
You can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint . I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car . But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me . He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed . And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on . He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage , and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it . It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car , yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover . If you have a garage , it 's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night , even garaged . You wo n't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster . And dust wo n't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster , I found that after washing my car , I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over . Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer , which in turn means I do n't have to wash the car nearly as often.I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered . Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer , the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy , for the value oriented , get the plastic handle one since it 's the exact same brush anyway ! I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle . Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty . My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia .	1
I gave a five star rating because of past expierence using this product.The first California car duster I had recieved as a gift lasted 15 yrs.I bought a new one 5 yrs ago its still doing a good job and use that for my work truck.t I wanted to buy one for my wife 's vehicle..I like the wooden handle FYI follow instructions about putting it on a newpaper for 48 hrs.It will show some streaks the few times of use.They have to get broken in and it does a great job.I highly recommend this product .	1
People were complaining about streaks but this works just as good as my 10 year old model it replaced . The handle feels a little cheaper but I have n't had any issues . Then again my car is white and maybe any streaking is harder to see . Just be sure to leave it out on some newspaper for a few days for best results .	1
I purchased this item for dusting on my Harley . It easily gets into hard to reach areas to keep them dust free . I also have used it for dusting in my automobile where it works well . I would recommend this product to all my friends . I do own the full sized California Duster for exterior dusting and the full size interior duster . They all work perfectly .	1
The mk4 Beetles have a dashboard made of a ridiculous rubber/plastic material that gets sticky when the sun heats it up . Why VW chose to use this material is beyond me , but I know that the mini california duster is the ONLY product I 've found that can successfully clean the dust off of the dashboard . It sounds trivial , but this is a really great product for the reason that it achieves what no other product can ( or so I 've found ) .	1
I Love it . Takes a while to break in until then you may get some wax streaks and not pick up all the dust but within a month it is perfect and like they say only improves the dirtier it becomes just shake off outside before putting back in the case and stuffing it in the trunk or map pocket .	1
One of the best things I have bought to keep the inside of my car clean and looking new . I recommend this for everyone .	1
The dash of my black car is anthracite gray , and it shows dust easily . The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax . This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior , picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean . It 's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car , or for someone who likes doing their own detailing .	1
I 've used a California Duster in the past with other vehicles and loved how it sucked up dust and dirt and held without scratching my finish . I had gotten away from super-anal car care the last few years but with a recent purchase of a brand new 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek , my Automotive wishlist her on Amazon has been growing and another California Duster has been towards the top of the & # 34 ; Really Want & # 34 ; list.I still have my old Original California Duster and it works great ( like fine wine , it got better with age ) but was mostly interested in this smaller one for the interior . I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky ' to the touch for lack of a water word . Using a microfiber cloth did n't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop . Picked this up for $ 4.63 when I figured I did n't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested . After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones . That seemed to do the trick because I have n't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I 've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside . Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car . Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house . This included behind my tv and entertainment center , on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust . Worked like a charm , sucked it all up and did n't let go.So I 'd have to say this , just like it big brother , the Original , works like a charm . For anyone having other issues like red fibers all over the place , I 'd recommend following the steps I did listed above , it worked great for me and as of now I have a great little duster that I paid less then 5 bucks for . IMO , u ca n't beat it .	1
I had a cracked air intake hose that caused the `` check engine '' light to go on , but a couple days after I fixed it . I was n't sure if that was the reason , and if it was , I did n't want to take it to a dealer just to clear that code.This did the trick . Very easy to use , gave me the code so I could check what it was . Once I found out , I knew it was the cracked hose . Cleared the message using this unit , and it never came back . Had I taken it to a mechanic or dealer , they 'd probably have told me it was some other problem and I would n't have know if they were telling me the truth or not .	1
this scanner works just like they say you have everything you need to scan your auto . WORTH EVERY PENNY ! !	1
I purchased this Acton scanner 2 years ago when our older vehicle was repeatedly showing its MIL ( Malfunction Indicator Lamp ) . I was able to clear the code immediately . When the MIL illuminated again later , I was able to track down the problem ( O2 sensor heater trouble ) and correct it by reseating the connector . Later , I used the scanner to diagnose which cylinder was misfiring . By tapping on that cylinder 's fuel injector , I was able to correct the misfiring . Again , the Acton cleared the MIL display.My mechanic uses a more sophisticated ( and much more expensive ) OBD scanner in his day to day work , but for someone who does occasional maintenance on his own car , this tool is worth the $ 89 investment . If you paid more , you paid too much .	1
Actron seems to be a company that makeshigh quality diagnostic equipment . This autoscannertool is very affordable and excellent value formoney . Works very well and is pretty ruggedas I had hoped . The only problem is that fixingthe vehicle based on the diagnosed code isNOT always helpful , sorry . Repairing your car based on thesecodes requires a good understanding of auto repair.For example : code PM001 - Cylinder Misfire . What can a NOVICEdo with ALL that `` helpful '' information ( LOL ) . Relatively easy to use.I will give full marks for the quality of thephysical device otherwise .	1
I used to take my car to the mechanics and they would hook it up to their diagnostic machine . If they diagnosed my car and I did n't use their services , the fee was $ 50 . Otherwise , if I used their services it was a free diagnostic but I had to pay for the repair . Now I can self-diagnose my car and instantly know what is wrong with it before shopping around for the repair . I used the Actron CP9135 today when my air conditioner was not blowing at all . I had forgotten that I purchased this a month ago and I called my husband to ask him if I should take the car to our mechanic . He told me to go home and hook this up and see if it can tell me what is wrong with the air . After a dozen or so tries to get the air on , I went inside and got the Actron CP9135 and hooked it up . I then turned the car on and the air worked fine and no error codes were reported . I am not sure if this is true , but my husband said maybe it reset the cars computer ? Who knows , but it did save me a trip to the mechanic and it gives me peace of mind to know what is going on with the car . I am going to keep it in the glove compartment for future problems.Update Dec 20 , 2007 : My car was shuddering a bit at low speeds and stops . I immediately plugged this in and found out that my 6th cylinder spark plus was not firing . Took it to the mechanic and had my spark plugs replaced . Saved $ 109 off the dealers `` diagnosis fee '' !	1
Have you ever felt like your auto mechanic was `` Mr. Wizard '' ? All the way down to the bad attitude ? Only to find he has a doo-dad sitting somewhere out of eyesight that tells all , like a crystal ball ... Well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball . It might be able to predict the future and track flying monkeys but it can tell you very quickly why the `` Check Engine '' light has come on . Big or small you know what might be waiting for you when you go see Mr. Wizard . Sometimes you might even be able to track down the problem yourself and cut the cost to fix it.I would not go to Oz without mine !	1
This is cheap and it feels cheap , but it works and thats all that matters . I have one on the floor and two on the ceiling for months .	1
The price was right and it was delivered on time , however , it was not as durable as I imagined and was a little smaller than it looked to be in the picture . It was also a little flimsy when extended to it 's supposed maximum size . I would not buy it again as my vents are larger and this is just not adequate for the intended purpose . However , if the vents were not as wide , it would be acceptable .	1
I have two vents directly over my living room sofa and although I have lived with them blowing directly on me for a long time , a suggestion by a friend , had me search out diffusers . I am really glad that I did.The diffusers work great in re-directing the air flow off of me and either into the room or towards the windows . The magnets hold perfectly on my ceiling vents and the diffusers appear pretty sturdy . So far , nothing has fallen to `` crack me in the head . `` The diffusers are adjustable so that you can get them to fit even if you have a vent lever or screws that may get in the way , which I do.I am very pleased and would recommend this product in that it absolutely helps .	1
This air deflector was installed beneath our chest of drawers in the bedroom and is successful at getting the air stream into the main bedroom more quickly . The fact that it can be expanded to cover our 12 & # 34 ; wide vents is a plus .	1
This product did a great job of balancing the temperatures throughout my home by correcting the direction of the air flow . The magnets are super strong and the materials super clear .	1
The deflector does a good job navigating the air in the direction desired and the magnets reliably hold it in place on a vertical vent in a wall . I am happy with the product , happy enough to order another one !	1
I purchased this product for my parents to use on a ceiling vent . They were pleased with the product overall . It was sturdy , easy to install , and serves the purpose of the purchase . They said the magnet held on well also .	1
I put this over the ceiling vent in my bedroom and it does the job . The magnets seemed stronger than those on the one I put in my living room , purchased locally . My vents size required this deflector to be pulled out to it 's max length which put it right on the edge of not holding together but it does and it does the job . It has been up there for several day 's now and I expect no problems from it .	1
Five stars for price and for doing exactly what it is supposed to do . It also seems to be unbreakable in that it survived shipping . Amazon did n't pack the box very well ; I guess taking the manufacturer at its word and the claim that it is unbreakable . I purchased two of these , both of which came in boxes that were utterly smashed up by heavier items in the box . Both arrived unscathed anyway , although with one , the two halves had come apart . It slid back together easily , so no big deal.I am using these on standard HVAC registers in our new house . In two places we ended up needing to place furniture over top of a register . We wanted something to direct the airflow out from under the furniture instead of blowing air into the bottom of it . These do that well , and the magnets have held them in place . Just slide the sides apart to the width you need and set them down . Done . I would recommend them , and will buy more if we rearrange things and need to cover other registers .	1
I ordered two models of Deflecto vents and both are outstanding . Heavy duty plastic , large strong magnets on the side and they work perfectly . Would recommend to anyone , especially since these are impossible to find locally , just try asking for one in your local home depot/lowes , they 're never even heard of the product .	1
I bought my first air deflectors ( this same model ) 20 years ago from Lowe 's for my 4 '' x 10 '' floor registers . I 've stepped on them from time-to-time and have never broken them . However , I did break one recently when I moved my sofa - not the deflector itself but one of those little tabs that hold it together in the center , so I 'm back to buy another . I wasted a lot of money prior to purchasing these unbreakable ones with the other type that do n't flex and that break easily . The magnets are very strong , when I lift these up for cleaning , I pull the entire metal register out of the floor . The magnets are strong enough to hold tight on registers that have several coats of paint on them , too .	1
I 'm using this to secure the spare tire on my utility trailer . It has a nice thick cable and it 's not too long like a bicycle cable lock . Tubular locks are not my favorite , but overall this device seems like a pretty good deterrent for the casual thief . I did notice that the ring on one end of the cable was drilled out way off center . Maybe not the best quality control ? ( See it in the pic I posted . ) I 'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend it without hesitation .	1
The Wrangler spare is held on by three lug nuts , the other holes are covered from the inside by the mount so you ca n't get this cable thru any of them . The only way is to drill a hole thru one of the other two holes and thru the mount . This takes the simplicity out of using this cable lock , obviously . But if you 're willing to do this , it just takes a few extra minutes and then the lock works great on it . I 'll probably also add a locking lug nut to mine for added theft deterrence . A cable lock is n't foolproof but it gives you another level and at this price why not ?	1
I added this to my spare on my boat trailer . It was plenty long and built well . Not much else to say .	1
This works perfectly and sets my mind at ease with all the light fingered individuals out there ready to lift your battery , propane tank and whatever else they can get their hands on..	1
It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper . Easy to use and sturdy . Is not a eyesore , and seems well made , i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest , it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire , but when the thief see 's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel , it wo n't be so much a snatch and grab . Some piece of mind to myself . I run 31.10.50 x 15 & # 34 ; wheels ( over $ 350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $ 1750 ) , with a Smitybilt tire carrier , the 36 & # 34 ; cable was plenty long enough .	1
This is just what I was looking for , perfect size for the spare on my 90 4runner . Looped it through the spaces in the wheel and locked in the back . Nice for the added security .	1
This lock appears to be nearly identical to the old masterlock design . That one built up rust inside the lock mechanism , so this will probably do the same . It is a few mm 's shorter than the masterlock and barely clears my curt hitch holes , so you may want to try before you buy on this one .	1
this is a very nice stainless steel design . Mine was a bit longer than necessary so I put a few O-rings on the pin to keep it from rattling . The rubber cap covering the key hole could be a better design to fit more securely but I 'd buy it again .	1
Considering this is made in China , it is a quality product , too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number	1
So far I like this lock set up , I live in the Four Corners area of NM , I hope to not have the rusting problems some reviewers have had in the wet slushy climates .	1
man it 's hard to come up with a title for this . and it 's a mixed reviewIt works . It 's metal , strong , rust-resistance ( it 's not a grade of rust-proof stainless as there are already spots from road-salt ) , but given the narrow space where it fits , it 's difficult to get the locking end on and off . It 's hard to get a good grip on it , even with the knurling on the ends . But the ends ARE small enough so there 's no interference with other hardware . The hitch on my truck is just wide enough outside that there 's almost to end-play on the lock shaft which makes getting the end on even more difficult . Takes some getting used to . I do n't think there 's a better product out there though , which makes this worth the price .	1
We use this when we 'll be on the road ( more than 250 miles ) . We go to Maine every year from Florida and I do most of the driving at night when a cleaner windshield is nice to have . I mix it with distilled water and their 2 in 1 glass cleaner . While on the interstate I rarely need the windshield wipers if I clean the windshield well before heading out .	1
Although the treatment does a good job treating the windows , I have found that removal is not that easy . You have to work at removing the residual haze . I usually have to wait two days to remove the haze entirely .	1
Been using these since the 70s.They simply works . Read the instruction.But may require frequent application , depending on the weather and wipers usage.The coating does wear out with use and by the sun	1
I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist , when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use . When you apply before the cold weather , though , it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield , which is just great . I also like to use the product on the back window , which does n't have a wiper , because it keeps the window clearer . Follow the directions -- let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear . I 'm sure you 'll like it .	1
This is the original product . Really great stuff . Works so well ; when rain hits , you 'll be so happy you applied it . Rain just sheets off ; you do n't even need wipers on.This package includes a LOT of product . A huge improvement from the small , single-use packages they used to make ( or maybe they still do ) ; this is a much better value.The only downside to this product is the seal ; there 's a little spout on the bottle top that goes up and down ; you flip it up to dispense the product . It seems pretty flimsy , and does n't seem to seal very well when closed . I have a feeling some of it is going to evaporate out of the bottle , and at some point some will spill out if the bottle is ever turned on its side . Other than that , great product .	1
Before I applied this to the windshield of my car , I noticed that the wiper blades , although new , left some streaking on the glass , and it could be a bit of a challenge to see outside especially when it rains hard and the raindrops magnify the lights of cars or the streetlights . After application , the wiper blades no longer left streaks , it became much easier to clearly see outside and the water beaded and blew away . At times , it may look like there is no rain on the glass when driving through rain at night.It works so well that I purchased another bottle when my first one began to run out .	1
I ca n't say enough about the quality and benefit of rain-x for treatment on my windshields . my cars and bikes love it .	1
i used it on my windshield and bathroom shower door.it works for like a week . for the amount of time it took to apply and polish off , it should last longer.make sure to wear a filter when applying indoors . this stuff stinks .	1
This product takes time to put on right but it is worth the effort . When you are done you will not believe the results when you get into a rain storm . Your windshield glass is so slick that the heaviest rain just slides right off without using your wipers . Your visibility is improved dramatically and you can see what is going on around you.I use it often but especially when I am going on a long vacation drive . It improves your driving safety in inclement weather and helps to keep your family and you safer . I use it on the outside of all of my windows of my vehicles . It is good for rain , sleet and snow and even reduces the amount of bugs that will stick to your windows . The treatment lasts for about 3 months . It is only recommended for glass.The further you can see the better your response time to stop in case of an emergency . I strongly recommend this product as doing a great job !	1
This is my first purchase of rain-x . It seems to work pretty well . I do wish it lasted longer . A few weeks after application it seems to be wearing off unevenly . Also it was difficult to get a good buffing on the windshield after the first application . Once it rained the wipers seemed to even it out though .	1
great stuff to have when it starts to rain . Do n't need it too often in So Cal , but when it does rain , it helps a lot with visibility , especially if you have n't gotten around to buying new wiper blades during the rest of the year .	1
This was recommended to us as a way to ease keeping our windshield clean when pulling a trailer . However , on first use it did a lot more for us than expected . The first time it rained after I used RainX was on a cross-country trip last week , and amazingly it almost completely eliminated the need to use windshield wipes even during downpours . Water drops still land on the windshield , but immediately rolls off whenever the car is moving , leaving a very clear view through the windshield - much clearer than even with wipers on high . For those who have flown small planes , the effect is much the same , and why such planes do n't even have wipers . ( At air speeds , wind pushes raindrops off the windshield very nicely all by itself . ) The only time we needed to use the wipers in several days of rain and snow driving was when passing trucks , as those covered the windshield with clouds of tiny droplets that were hard to see through.A week later , I 'm noticing the windshield no longer clears itself at speeds under 40 MPH , so it may be due for another treatment , but still stays nicely clear at highway speeds , and is very easy to clear at lower speeds with a single pass of the wipers .	1
Fairly easy to apply and works really well . Have never used any other glass treatment to compare it againsts but this does the job .	1
Rain-X 800002243 Glass Treatment- 7 oz.It 's simple , this stuff works great when applied correctly , the rain will slide right off !	1
works great ... .you do not have to use your wipers as much ... water rolls right off	1
Product definitely works as described . Have used this in the past on all of my vehicles ( 3 over the last 16 years ) and it does a great job of clearing your windshield/windows of rain and misting.During light rains or when the roads are wet and mist is kicked up from the tires on the vehicle in front of you , this does a great job of keeping the beading moving up and off of the windows to the point that you do n't really even need your wipers . In moderate or heavy rains , it does a great job of keeping the water beaded up so vision is n't as reduced as it is on untreated windows.I docked one star though because i 've found ( thru multiple vehicles and uses ) that my wiper blades does n't seem to last as long after it has been applied . I 've also spoken with multiple friends who reported the same issue . I have n't used this in conjunction with the RainX wiper blades so maybe that is n't an issue if you use them , but it is def noticeable with other commons brands ... From the cheapest ones to the premium ones , it seems to affect the life of them all.That being said , i now only apply to the side windows , moonroof and mirrors of my vehicles . The beading the product causes helps keep the rain off which minimizes water spots as well . Another plus especially in the spring when pollen is rampant and not washed away with constant & # 34 ; April Showers & # 34 ; .	1
Rain-X makes terrible wipers , but you do n't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip : do n't put it on the side windows , unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open .	1
I never used this product , but have been told by many who have to try it and I wont be disappointed . I applied with a paper towel after each wash and I can say when it rains the water seems to fly off the windshield as if it were being pushed off with an air dryer . Each application seems to last very well for about 2-3 weeks or in between each wash . Try it and you wont be disappointed .	1
Master Lock 262 DAT Chrome Lug Nut Style Spare Tire Lock is a simple to use and reasonable sturdy product . Good value	1
More for slowing down an amateur thief . Lug nuts that require a special tool are more secure . Had to grind away a bit of the shell due to interference with the wheel casting shape .	1
I purchased this lock for the spare tire on my trailer . It seems like it could be broken without too much effort , but should help deter theft by being there .	1
Works like it was intended for .	1
Just installed the lock on my trailer nose mounted spare tire . After installing , it obviously works as described in the ad description . So far , I am satisfied with the item .	1
I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep . I just took one of the bolts out and put this in , I would thing if they really want it I 'm sure they can get it out , this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard . And for the price you can buy two..	1
This is smaller then I thought for a funnel , yet it is useful more then I thought it would be . Such as oil in the lawnmowers .	1
This is a small funnel , It will work for just abought any task.Small and easy to store in a zip lock bag to keep it clean .	1
This is absolutely one of the best four and a half bucks I have ever spent . I originally thought I would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen . She scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her . In addition , she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids . Amazingly , she was right on target . By holding the small end to my ear I could clearly hear her , the TV and the telephone . To my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified . I never would have believed it if I had not experienced this for myself . There are some frequencies which I have some difficulty in hearing now that I have `` matured '' . My wife 's voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when I want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate . For convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where I can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck . The uses for this item are nearly endless and I will order another one to serve the original purpoe for which I bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.This is truly a multi-purpose tool and at a bargain price .	1
Hard to complain , it 's a funnel , it 's a good length and width for awkwardly located fills . Has a guard on the top for spill prevention , feels sturdy and durable , and the price is more than fair . What 's not to like ?	1
I got this to change oil on my 2005 Honda Odyssey and it made the job of changing oil very easy . I was able to get nearly 4 1/2 quarts of oil in a couple of minutes with out any spill . It 's also multi purpose ! Very good value for the money paid .	1
This thing is smaller and skinnier than I thought , although it is very long . It is awkward for filling my car engine oil because its so long that the bottom of the funnel hits the valve heads before anything else , so its unstable to just sit in there . I have to hold it to support it with one hand while i fill the oil with the other.It does have some good uses though , as it is just the right size to fill my motorcycle transmission oil.All in all , the funnel is solid , no complaints on the product quality , but I think next time I will purchase in person so I can really gauge the size I need .	1
Ordered several funnels . One for my Auto trans oil . One for filling the Toyota van anti-freeze via the top hose . Faster than filling via the radiator cap . One for the shampoo consolidation in the house .	1
Works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower ! It even has a lip on the top so the oil wo n't go out of the funnel.The only problem with funnels is , you never know how full the chamber is , and always need to remove the funnel to look . Someone should invent a meter on the funnel , that helps in overflowing , and an end valve in case the chamber is full , to prevent it from overflowing.But until then , this funnel will do just fine !	1
It feels like it 's made of great quality stuff . It 's very sturdy and not flimsy like some other funnels out there . I recommended this funnel In conjunction with this item & # 34 ; RhinoGear 05068 3 piece Funnel Set & # 34 ; I use this to top off transmission fluid in vehicles . Comes in very handy ! ! !	1
A dollar ? I stole this . hehehee	1
While this is a simply plastic funnel , its uses are allot . My biggest use is with power equipment like my riding lawnmower ; the oil cap is near the bottom and a difficult place to fill . The funnel is perfect also for smaller engines like my Pressure Washer - etc . Hope this helps .	1
Perfect funnel to pour oil into your crankcase.. This funnel can be used for other purposes of course , .. but I bought it for pouring quart oil into my crankcase .	1
I love this funnel more than others that I have because it is the only one that stays in while I am pouring . The long spout keeps it in . I highly recommend it . I use one for automotive and my wife uses one for pouring in the homemade detergent into barrels .	1
I 'd previously purchased this w/o having an actual use for it . Turned out to be practically custom made for putting oil in my Subaru inverter/generator .	1
What 's to say ? It 's not very large . It works perfect in my 2003 Chevy truck to add a Fuel Additive into the fuel tank ! ! ! It should work for Power steering and transmission also , at least on Car/trucks that 's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad . The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it ! For under $ 5 , not a bad deal . Hang it up out of the way when done with it . It 's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube , so it has to be small enough , so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once ! ! ! It 's small and does n't hold all that much . For what it is , I like it .	1
This is a GREAT funnel for what it is desinged to do . ADD FUEL ADDITIVES to your gas tank . No drips or spills on the side of your car . ( LOOK at the picture ) For other applications , maybe a larger or different style funnel is better . Price SHIPPED TO YOUR DOOR tax free is VERY GOOD . ( $ 3.36 ) ( The list price $ 23.88 probably should be $ 3.88 ) : ) I like it and would buy it again .	1
Got this for oil changes on my Victory Vision . It works well but you do have to poor slow as to not overflow the funnel . It is a good length and offered an easy tool for use with my motorcycle .	1
Priced right and Just right for the longer reach needed for todays cars and trucks . Buy two or 3 they are so handy.Makes it easy to fill hard to reach items such as mowers UTV 'S etc .	1
I love this funnel , it has so many uses . For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease . I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again . Let 's see a hammer do either of those things . My hammer never stays put . You can reason with this funnel , it has an open mind so to speak . Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel .	1
In these cases , when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price . There are no frills here ... you pour things through this into other things ... end of story.If that 's what you 're trying to do , I highly recommend this one	1
I got sick of using my & # 34 ; Common & # 34 ; funnel for different uses , trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for Sea Foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than $ 1 . The size/length is perfect for gas-tank additives . I purchased 3 , I keep one in the garage to pour Sea Foam into my cara/motorcycle/snow-blower/lawnmower . And the other 2 I keep in whatever vehicle I 'm currently using , in my & # 34 ; just in case & # 34 ; pack.Great product .	1
great little funnel , long narrow output is good for transmission fluid or other stuff similar with a small opening not easy to get to .	1
This I use to replace the transmission fluid on my Lincoln Town car . The tube is quite narrow and way back at the firewall . The long skinny tip of this funnel reaches all the way back there and fits well , preventing a real mess . Ca n't beat the price either .	1
Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days . THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car . It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet . Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel . 1 ) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2 ) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling .	1
I am car-sitting a vehicle that mostly sits in my garage . I do n't drive it nearly enough to keep the battery charged . I am also convinced that Fords have a damn trickle as this car drains a battery faster than anything else I have seen [ maybe not as fast as a snooty BMW ] . I spent a hoop of time looking on line for a quality product . This one was well reviewed on many forums and after going to the factory web page I was convinced . Amazon had the BEST price period . I ordered four to start , one for Dad [ has a truck he rarely drives ] , one for car I `` baby-sit '' , one of wife 's Jeep it sometimes does not get driven for days which is only a concern during cold Illinois winters , and my truck which always is outside [ does not fit in garage ] and thought it would be a good idea on those super cold nights when I also plug in my battery blanket and oil heater.I installed two so far and it was very easy ! The unit is designed to be permanently mounted under the hood , it comes with a bracket and some screws . The first thing I did [ I know it voids any warranty ] is open it up and de-solder three wires from the short 12 '' cord and upgrade to a 14 gage 3 conductor cord of adequate single length . I routed and zip-tied it to blend in with all of the other factory wires and ran it to the front lower valance [ bumper ] where I fabricated a simple aluminum bracket with grommet pull-through opening and terminated at a plug . Now to use all I have to do is plug it in , no need to even open the hood . With it disconnected you can barely see the plug from behind the license plate . Total time about an hour and a half , if you are less particular I guess you could toss it in and be up and running in 10 minutes . So far very happy , I have taken some measurements of the capabilities and thay are as claimed . Almost forget , pics on amazon are not totally accurate , does not gome with a fuse holder for battery side . I added a 5A blade fuse with all weather holder to the positive side between unit and battery for peace of mind .	1
We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity , even when car is being driven . Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery . I have an external car battery charger ( old ) . It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight . Also it does not have any detection , so the battery can be continuously overcharged , which will eventually damage the battery ( as multiple battery experts tell me ) . Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews , I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies ( even with new battery ) . Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night , and unplug in the morning before the commute . No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days ! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car ... The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger , or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from .	1
Tested on a discharged battery and it charged it over night . Great for your boat/bike or anything that you need to charge over night for use the next day . If your looking for a charger that charges in 10 mins . this is not the one . Great product , and shipping . Thanks Amazon	1
This product works extremely well and is extremely reliable . Anyone complaining about the short cord did n't do their homework . The pictures clearly illustrate a short cord . A 12 foot cord would be ridiculous on a car mountable charger . I like to use those 9 inch lighted extension cords sold atwalmart and Amazon.com , These give you a lighted indication of power when plugged in . My charger is under hood mounted and has seen over 110 degreeswhile running highway speeds and charging in summer heat . Frankly I 'm amazed it still works 5 years later . I will buy another if it quits working .	1
Very useful charger . I mounted it in the engine bay near the battery and it works as intended.Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord . It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.I will be ordering a second for an other vehicle .	1
have this permanently hooked up to my car battery . when car sits long time , I just plug it in and works perfect . have 1 for each car , never fails .	1
Bought one for my car about four years ago . Still using it so got one for my riding mower . Mounted it on the mower so I just plug in , which is great in the cooler months . I 'm in south Louisiana and still have to mow in late November but infrequently , so this keeps it fully charged . I 've had the one o . The mower for a couple seasons now and it 's still ticking away .	1
Auto battery life can be significantly lengthened with the use of a trickle charger . Significantly . I put this one into my 4X4 to keep my Interstate battery at maximum readiness . This is a solid heavy duty device and is no toy . I mounted it securely under the hood next to the battery itself and have a heavy duty plug hanging down -- just behind the front bumper -- to connect up while out in the driveway . The lights/indicators on this model are very nice and it keeps my battery at full strength . If you have two vehicles ( or more ) and you do n't drive one of them that often -- definitely get one of these . You will never have another `` oh no '' moment -- when turning that key in the morning . Highly recommended .	1
They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use . With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer .	1
These fit perfectly and are easy to use and keep your connector clean and dry when not in use . Great buy .	1
Well they work ! Easy to put on . Might not fit some ends that are not rounded . ( to bulky to slide in )	1
If you want to get the most out of your towing lights harness or you truck harness you need these covers ... I will never again go without this product ... fit tight does n't fall off with road vibration ... Buy , Buy , Buy ...	1
These work perfectly on both ends of the connection for my motorhome and trailer . They protect the contacts very well . I highly recommend them .	1
Good way to cover those vulnerable connectors for my trailer . Works perfectly for the 4-pole connector and should keep problems away .	1
They keep the contacts clean and lubricated however they are both the same and not a matched pair for vehicle and trailer .	1
The 4Wire Flat Replacement Dust Covers help keep the ends clean from road dirt .	1
I do n't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver . There 's a little anodized flare , and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it 's stainless steel to boot ! Nice quality item .	1
This product , in my opinion , is well designed . The materials are top notch , and it is easy to access with the key for removal and installation.I ca n't imagine anyone taking the time to defeat this lock to steel my hitch ball . When the boat is attached and locked to the ball I can sleep better in a hotel room knowing the boat is secure.I 've notice a few times the rubber cover over the key slot has come off . I 'm not sure if I just did n't attach it well , if I bumped it , or if it came off by itself though . Even so I do n't think the rubber cover is a necessity .	1
Good news1 ) Fair price2 ) Fits Curt 2 '' trailer hitchBad News1 ) Key use a little tricky2 ) Plastic keyhole cap cover does n't feel real snugPractice locking/unlocking with the key about 20 times before you start using this so you establish some 'muscle memory ' on how to turn the key and remove the locking hardware - it 's not like your house key . Not sure how long before the plastic key hole rain/dirt/mud cover is going to stay attached .	1
I was looking for a receiver lock that was easy to use and give us the protection for our hitch . We typically dont unhook the hitch after arriving at the site and always worried that someday someone might remove it . Now we dont have to worry and my wife is much happier ! ! ! The rubber cover for the key area keeps dirt away from lock mechanism . Plus it is a Master Lock ... enough said .	1
This dogbone lock is very nice and well buildt . It is perfect for use on any car or truck if you are going to remove it after each use . But it is not for use on a motorhome reciver , were it is going to be left on for some time.The problem is ! The protective rubber cap that covers the key entry , fits loosely . The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot . Any little bump in the road , and off it comes ! Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism , the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch .	1
Works as advertised and the price is very good . A bit hard to lock and unlock but not enough to matter . Hopefully I 'll never find out how well it protects the hitch from theft !	1
It works and is much easier to lock/unlock with the key facing you than if it is pointed to the side .	1
I 'm a huge fan of Master products & this does not let me down . Very easy to use low profile lock to protect your trailer hitch attachments . I love the bright blue tip .	1
I recommend these to anyone who has bitched about drying their car.I used this product and was blown away buy how well it absorbed and better yet the wring out was so easy,3 folds and a twist and 90 % of the water was out ! I bought one of the Chemical Guys Waffle Micro fiber cloths and it was awesome , but when you go to wring it out the shear size ( 25 & # 34 ; x36 & # 34 ; ) made it very hard to get a good wring out.Their towel did almost 80 % of my car , 2 from those would be an alternative.I give this product A+ and it is worth every penny !	1
I love this product works just how I expected to work..Dries my car faster than just using towels . So far I think it will last a while , made from good quality materials	1
I know these have many many uses but I just use it to dry my car after a good wash. You will be surprised by how much water this thing will hold . You keep it damp in the tube for storage so it 's always ready to go when you need it . If it dries out just wet it again and it 's good to go . I wash this in the laundry and it cleans up nice , so easy to use and care for .	1
I was looking for a new chamois to replace the old worn out one I had . I ran across the Absorber , and the reviews wore great on this product . So , I decided to give it a try . I 'm SO glad I bought it ! ! It really is the best chamois/absorbent drying towel I 've ever seen ! ! After drying your car ( or whatever you are trying to dry off ) , just toss it in your washing machine . It comes out looking brand new again ! ! You really can go wrong -- -buy this product ! ! !	1
I find it a bit humorous that reviewers keep saying & # 34 ; it does n't absorb water & # 34 ; .. then they state later on that they have to ring all of the water out all of the time . Are they ringing out & # 34 ; air & # 34 ; ? Of course is absorbs the water . It is just not good at drying the car for the final wipe . I use a towel after using this . That 's worked well for many years . I tried a & # 34 ; waffle towel & # 34 ; and it was worse than the absorber . I tried a special auto towel , but that did not work as well either . I think that the absorber used with a towel is probably the best combo to use . I suppose you can turn on the leaf blower , but if you get any dirt in there you may do a number on your paint .	1
There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them . First , before using , soak in warm water , this makes it more absorbent . Second , keep it clean . The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint , this will introduce maring of your clear coat . I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry . When storing , get it as dry as possible . Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp .	1
I used one of these for the last 5 years and is the best I 've used to dry my cars . really is outstanding and the best for this task .	1
When reaching for a towel to dry that vehicle - grab an Absorber . It works as good as the real thing - at a fraction of the cost ! We have a piece of one of these in the kitchen ... priceless . Do n't waste your money on Sham-Wow or other junk..get a Absorber and be satisfied .	1
Do your research people , this thing is the best for drying your car . It helps so much when washing your own car . Do n't use rags that will drag dirt & hold onto rocks to scratch your paint . I ca n't go with out this thing and I truly stand by it.Highly recommendVery easy to use and saves you timeFast and easy shippingLove it	1
Just trust me here ; get this and the Meguiars drying towel and you 'll have your car completely dry and streak free in no time . This soaks up the bulk of the water and the other gets rid of all the mist . Great product that I 've been using for years !	1
This chamois works great . Very absorbent and holds a lot of water . Do not use anything else to wash your car .	1
Every time it rains , my glass patio table accumulates puddles of water . Before purchasing this , it would take several large towels to clean off and dry . Now , with this chamois , all I do is wipe the entire table one time , wring out the chamois , than wipe the table again . Within minutes , the table is not only clean , but dry . This is definitely worth the money .	1
This is an excellent chamois ! I have used many different kinds , in fact my last purchase from Amazon included this one as well as a fancy one with a waffle pattern design . Let 's just say that this outperformed that other one and I am confident in saying that this does just as good of a job as a leather one , without the process of breaking it in . This is a great deal for the price . Great for after washing your car or after a heavy rain .	1
The Absorber is made of polyvinyl alcohol which allows it to be super absorbent and reusable . It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen . The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had . After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90 % of the water gets removed . When the towel gets saturated , just wring it out and start drying again . It cuts car drying time at least in half , maybe more , plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois . If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car , it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get left behind . When you are done , just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time . This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills . I highly recommended it for those purposes . I am hesitant to recommend using it on your body since it sits in a moist , bacteria-friendly environment between uses - but as a car dryer it is terrific . I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review .	1
For those of you who are wondering `` do I have to keep the tube forever ? `` , the answer is `` no '' . I threw my tube away the first week I had it and three years later it still performs like a champ . The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed , but once you wet it again , it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.The other reviews are correct . This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces . Once saturated with water , it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up . After three years mine has held up very well , though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.This is the only drying chamois most people will ever need .	1
Not sure what all the 1 star reviewers are doing wrong as these dry my cars dry streak and spot free . You see some micro streaks when using this but they evaporate . Using the same two for over 15 years stored in their containers . No mold or anything ... best drying material I ever used and I tried them all .	1
I have several of this , I use them for all sorts of things . They last for many years , I use them on job sites to keep cool , just dip it in cold water and instant cooling.We also use them for keeping the dogs cool as if they were n't already cool looking.DO NOT BUY ANY IMITATION This is the best !	1
My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan -- both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she 's Made in Japan herself.We 're also familiar with this kind of product in Japan , where it 's called a `` gum towel . `` I bought two actually , one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles -- thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel . It 's certainly super absorbant , but does n't have the chamois quality I would need to , say , polish my bike frames . That is to say it 's more sticky than soft , more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing , this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it 's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it 's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too , from every knook and cranny , so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that ca n't go in the dryer . If you wash a sweater for example , it 's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry , as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac . It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I 've used several gum towels in Japan , mostly for swimming , and this is by far the thickest one I 've used -- therefore more absorbant . And at 27 '' x 17 '' it 's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE : I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Do n't expect to use this to polish or dust , as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV , and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like -- where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall , we 're thrilled with the quality , size , and how well this item works . Absolutely 5 stars .	1
I just finished using this for the first time today . Lately I 'd been using a flexible squeege to begin drying my car then follow up with a chamois.WHAT A DIFFERENCE ! ! Rarely does one come across an item that works exactly as advertized . This one does ! Now I use the chamois for the tires and wheels and the Absorber for the car . Unbelievable how much water that thing can suck up and hold ! Try it . You 'll love it .	1
I have used these for over 10 years as well as natural sheep skin chamois . This works very well . If you wring it out ( edges too ) it does n't streak , leave water behind , and works about as well as a natural chamois . It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container , ( nope do n't dry it ) . Then why use a natural chamois ? Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois . I 'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager . Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine . If you do n't want to dry , and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use , then get this . It works very well , plus I have never found anything synthetic , that works as well . ( Believe me I 've tried a lot different ones too . Haaa ) I do recommend it . Hope this helps someone .	1
This product is obviously manmade but is equal to or better than any 'natural ' chamois I ever had . It 's just marvelous .	1
I liked the absorber because it did not leave any streaks on my vehicle . The material was sturdy and not flimsy .	1
I have had one of these for years and loved it . My wife did n't know what it was so she thought it was old and garbage .	1
I love drying my Evo X with these . They get all the water off and leave to streaks . Its a must have when detailing your car	1
Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly , and you do n't wan na have to polish out all the water spots afterwords ( Black car ) . This thing absorbs so much water you wo n't believe it till you use it , and it just takes a beating and keeps on going . When I first used it I was afraid I was gon na rip it by twisting the water out too hard , nope , just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it , at least I 've found it to work better this way . When drying the car , lay the Absorber out flat ( unfold it across the surface ) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with . This works especially well on horizontal surfaces , but still good enough on the vertical ones as well . This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning , when it comes , do n't smell it . Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd ! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away . Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet ( Well to get it back in the tube , you must , because you ca n't roll it once it dry ) , but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short : Get it , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
I 've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so . The Absorber is PVA , so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry . Once you get used to it and how it works , it 's great . There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper , but believe me , this one is superior in thickness and quality . I bought a cheap , generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you 'd use a normal towel for . It wo n't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with , but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest . The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge , depending on how wet it is . It 's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat . When it gets too wet , you just wring it out . When it gets a little dirty , soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer ( just make sure you do n't put it in the dryer , it comes out of the washer slightly damp , just like it should be stored ) . Every few washes , I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new .	1
I was prepared to write a & # 34 ; sham-why & # 34 ; review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber , but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up ' and began working pretty well . It wrings out easily and leaves no lint , which is pretty rad , because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy .	1
I 've never used a synthetic chamois before , so I 'm not sure how well they are supposed to work . I washed my minivan the other day ; and I 'd say it took one swipe on a panel , squeeze dry , then a second swipe to completely dry the panel . The Absorber is a nice , large size . It dries my car better than old bath towels , and it left no water spots . I 'm very happy with its performance and would buy it again .	1
Pros : - works better than chamois in absorbing water.- does not produce streaks when drying cars - Spot free ! - I cut it to half and quarter sizes - makes it great for the kitchen tops , sink and bathroom- works great for kitchen spills- available almost everywhere- cheaper than chamoisCons : -You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard . ( Dip it on water and it is good to go again ) .-Storing it moist promotes growth of bacteria and micro-organism . Forget about using it on your body as a towel or drying your plates , pots and utensils .	1
Awesome . Just used this for the first time earlier today . I 've owned a natural chamois but have n't used it in years so I threw it away . This works great . Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it ( def another recommended product ) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces . Soaks the water up very well , rings out a lot of the water and stores & # 34 ; damp & # 34 ; which means little to not maintenance to maintain . Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was .	1
This thing will hold a lot of water . just be sure to keep it moist inside the original tube . I will buy more of these . Just need to watch the price and buy low .	1
I have a black car so i need to dry it to avoid spots . this works great . holds a lot of water and takes me few min to dry whole car .	1
I find it much easier to use this chamois over a towel while drying a car . The absorber works well with soaking up water then with a quick squeeze your back at drying . The chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your car like towels and old shirts . I also use a damp chamois to wipe down the interior dash and seats of my vehicle , which works very well . I would also recommend a soft water blade to use first after rinsing your vehicle to do the large areas and windows ... then go back over it with the chamois . It will cut your car drying time in half and work x2 as good . You are supposed to keep the chamois damp so when I am done I just put it back in the case and it will stay damp until my cars next wash . It is supposed to extend the life of the chamois .	1
This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming .	1
Keep all those sham wows . I have used Absorber Chamois for years , much better than natural ones or any other brands .	1
I purchased this cloth with the intent of drying my car after I have washed it . I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.Drying my car with `` The Absorber '' does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water . It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in . I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water . But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so . I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I 'm a happy camper . I would buy another one if I needed it : )	1
this has been a must have in the detailing word . This holds SO much water and comes with a nice container to stow it away . Quality and works excellent , does not scratch . NEVER use another brand !	1
I 'm using it on thy 38 ' 5th wheel and it 's working fantastic . Goes on very easy and comes off the same way . Buffs up to a bright shine that 's silky smooth to the touch . You ca n't go wrong with this product . I 'm buying another bottle right a way .	1
I bought this to try on my travel trailer with a gel coat finish . It worked very well , went on easy , wiped off clean , pleasant odor , removed stains and marks . I enjoyed using it compared to a lot of other products I have tried over the years . I have found that Meguiar products generally are quite good . Price is not great but reasonable - I was satisfied and will purchase this product again . Oh yeah , I should have mentioned that I applied by hand with terry cloth towel and removed with microfiber cloth .	1
After reading reviews and opinions on other waxes , I just stuck with what I ` ve used before and I ` m not disappointed at all . I did however apply this wax with a buffer . After cutting the hull with Flitz , I followed through with Flagship premium wax and this 15 year hull looks incredible !	1
Very good finish top cost or fiberglass RV & Marine products.Goes on easy comes off clean . I have used a light weight polisherWhen doing our camper.Last for months . Good product .	1
TYPICAL OF ALL OTHER MEGUIAR PRODUCTS ... ... GREAT ... ..REALLY PUTS A SHINE TO MY BOAT ... LOOKS LIKE NEW NOW ... EASY TO APPLY AND EASY TO BUFF ... .GOES A LONG WAY AS WELL ... ENOUGH TO DO MY 18 ' BOAT SEVERAL TIMES OVER ... .GOOD PROTECTION ...	1
I use this on my RV and it shines great ... With something that big , I also recommend a top quality random orbital , like Griots 10765LNGCRD	1
I bought these to use when parking our travel trailer and did not want to spend a fortune for something that does such a simple basic job . These do what they are supposed to do , appear to be solidly built and durable , and do not add a lot of weight while hauling them around . They also do n't take up much storage space .	1
We use these for our camper . They are light weight , easy to store , and worth the money . I feel that they are pretty durable and do n't anticipate them breaking .	1
I have been watching these for a while . Came in at Wally World , little over half price.I have used them for years but they DO have an Expiration Date on them ... Safety in case they dry out ! Excellent for Wheel Chocks in the Garage Too . It grips the concrete and Larger Tires very well . `` BatmanDSM ''	1
This is NOT the HEAVY DUTY wheel chock that Camco also sellsCamco 44492 RV Super Wheel ChockI bought this not paying very close attention to the details . It 's a nice wheel chock but I prefer to have a matching set of 4 .	1
match my existing wheel chocks . A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels , otherwise would be a 5-star .	1
These Camco RV Wheel Chocks are heavy grade injection molded plastic and work well to secure my 5'x10 ' enclosed trailer in place . These have ridges on the bottom and where it contacts the wheels , which adds extra gripping ability.We picked up four of these Wheel Chocks locally for a little bit less than offered on Amazon.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
They did what they are supposed to kept my trailer from rolling away i am going to the Lynx chocks due to upgrading to the Lynx levelers .	1
I have eight of these things now . They hold-up great , are dirt cheap and you ca n't lose them in the grass because of the bright yellow color . If you abuse them enough , they will show wear and tear , but that 's if you abuse them - you know , like driving over them instead of moving them : - (	1
These are the perfect size for the tires on an rv trailer - 15 & # 34 ; . I had some that were too large and did n't fit the curve of the tire so were n't very effective . These fit perfectly and hold extremely well . If you put a loop of rope through the hole , it makes it easier to remove them from under your tires .	1
Works very well for the cost , I would recommend an attached rope to allow for easier removal from the wheels .	1
Great ... ...	1
A good Made in USA chock . It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart , if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire . Do n't buy the one with a rope . It costs twice as much for the same one chock , NOT two.The heavy rubber Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W , Model # WC1467A at $ 8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete , but they are heavy to carry around . I use the Buyers ' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer 's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50 % more . The Buyers ones are nearly identical , are exactly the same size and weight . The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom .	1
I had bought a couple of these many years ago but recently bought a travel trailer so needed 4 more ( could only find one of my old ones ) . They are now dated for replacement . After buying these I found them at Walmart for $ 1.25 less per unit . The Walmart ones were dated a year later than the Amazon ones .	1
Wheel chocks are a must for every Rver . This is of particular importance if you use the tri-leveler or other similar device .	1
They do exactly what you want them to and show no signs of breaking after weekly moves and daily use for almost a year .	1
This is a well built wheel chock . It 's made out of thick plastic . I accidentally ran it over with my car . And it held up perfectly !	1
Bought 2 of these for my 27 foot Jayco Bunkhouse and they seem to work great . Very well made of durable hard plastic . Camper does not move 1 inch once I have them in place ... .Go ahead and buy a few ... Kurt	1
Need 2 for each side , works well for small pop up . Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope , same choke . These already have the hole for rope . Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two , they are exactly the same size .	1
Five stars because they are lightweight , inexpensive and have a hole for a rope ; tie two together , pull both at the same time . Ordered four for tandom axle trailer .	1
works well and holds fast and steady . I am really surprised by the light weight and sturdy construction . Will buy them again for the other things i have .	1
Just do n't plan to pull it out when the tires are resting against it - the grips really dig in and with 2 on the axle and a slight grade they work perfectly .	1
I bought 4 of these to change the rear shocks on my S2000 . They work as advertised .	1
It 's bigger and feels more secure then our older pair of wheel chocks.Holds our trailer in place with no issues . Not much else to say for such a simple product .	1
Works well , keeps the trailer from moving after disconnecting from the tow vehicle . These are light weight , compact , and easily stored in the basement compartment	1
Larger than I expected and solid feel like . The only cons is the curve is not snapped under wheel smoothly and there is a gap between curved surface and wheel line . So I do not know if it is really working or not because the function of chock is for the accidental circumstances the car slipped back , however , it is not usually happened when the car is put on the parking gear and hand brake is applied . So hard to say it 's good or working , unless the car is really accidentally slipped back and blocked by this wheel chock . Then you can finally see if the chock is good or not . But anyway , it worths that money .	1
I use these when parking my 30 Travel trailer . They are well made and strong . They have been used probably 80 to 100 times now and , while a bit dirty and scuffed from use , they are still in great shape . They work well in securing my trailer from movement when parked .	1
I bought a pair of these for my travel trailer . They fit fine and snug up nicely with the tire . While having a lanyard for them sounds tempting , I hate having extraneous parts on my chocks , so I like their simplicity .	1
I bought 2 of these , one to keep in my truck for road side emergencies and the other for automotive work use at home . The few times I have used them they work well , but just so you know they have a recommended expiration date on them . I think this is due to their intended use as a RV chock , where they would sit in the sun a lot and would degrade . But again they are cheap , and if the worries you , just buy a new one and toss out the suspect one !	1
I have a ~7000 GVWR travel trailer and bought two of these . One stops the wheels from rolling in one direction . That 's their job right ... and for less than the price of a pack of cigarettes , it 's just unbeatable . If you 've got to stop something , chock it .	1
About what you would expect , not super heavy duty but serve their purpose . i plan to pick up a few more to round out the set .	1
The price and appears to meet all our needs.Appears well made and we are happy with the sent product . Thank you .	1
These are well made , inexpensive , and work great . They are quality made in USA ! And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order .	1
This will be a useful item to have around . In the past I had to carry both an 1 7/8 and a 2 5/16 ball mount in the truck . Too much iron ! Now I just change out the ball and I 'm ready .	1
Very clever idea . Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch . Spinning ball hitches for different sizes wo n't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch . In order to tow my 2 different trailers I 'd need 2 drop hitches . Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect . They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing . Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store .	1
These things are super cool . Makes having 3 different hitches a time of your life you 'll look back at with shame .	1
If you need extra room for storing this , then is perfect for you ; ball sizes range from 1 7/8 to 2 1/2 '' and change very easily with little effort . This model requires a slight turn of the center pin to lock/unlock the ball for changing and you need to remember to re-lock it after attachment .	1
Admittedly I have not actually towed a trailer with this ... but it went together perfectly and I have no reason to think it will not perform just fine when I need it to . For a quality item with a well-known brand name attached , it 's an outstanding buy , and I 'm VERY pleased to have found it .	1
I have two of them now . The first one I bought about 7 years ago but it wast the tri-ball , so when I upgraded my trailer to the 2 11/16 I needed to buy a new ball ... . Or buy another one of these with the triple balls then I would have another shank to mount on another vehicle	1
Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado . The bar feels solid . The ratcheting system appears solid , is easy to operate , and operates smoothly . If I had to think of a weakness ... if I was the designer of this tool , I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar . When you hold it up to crank it tight , the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance . So petty , I know . I ca n't comment on how it stands up to weather , as my bed is covered . Really , I could n't ask for anything more , especially for the low price ! I may buy a second one . One high , one low . Highly recommend .	1
Nice cargo bar for the price . Easy to use and racheting works good . Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed !	1
Ok , I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in . I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed . When I went to place this cargo bar , I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep . I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out , then give it one or two more clicks . It did slip once while I was adjusting last click . After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using , but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place . After 200 miles of driving , bumpy roads , hills , ext ... . it is still in place and working . I must note that I have a bed rug , and topper . So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds . I would be on the fence to recommend this product . It will work , but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13 : OK been using for a while now , and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box . No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product . I would recommend this product , it does what it says , bounced to 4 star .	1
This is a must have for pickup truck owners . The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place . The ratchet part is very well made . You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving . Have had no problems at all ... ..	1
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab . I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler ( s ) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it ! Ok , he might have a few cuts while trying ! !	1
These are so wonderful to have in the car in the winter . After getting one of these in another color ( but the same brand ) , I decided to pick up a second blanket for my kids to use too while traveling . Here in Minnesota it gets extremely cold and everyone is always fighting over where to have the thermostat set at . By having some of these travel electric blankets in the car , everyone can keep as warm as they want to.This blanket works just as well as my other one and gets just as warm , just as fast . It works exactly like a household electric blanket does . I was so pleased with how well they worked that I bought some as gifts for people for Christmas this year . They were a BIG it and no one knew they even made such a thing . Finally with these we can all be as warm and toasty as we want to be !	1
Happy with it so far . Wife likes it . I keep one for a spare in the car in case of bad weather .	1
it works well , it 's well made , but make sure you realize it has a built in timer . If you camp in your van at night and have a spare battery that you use for things like this and expect you to keep you warm all night you 'll wake up an hour later freezing . There is another blanket out there that does n't have a timer for that purpose . But I keep this one in my boat for rides on chilly days when my mom gets cold . And here the timer is perfect so it does n't accidentally get left on .	1
takes a while to warm up , ok as the package says give it 10 minutes . warm after 2 minutes , nice after 6 , toasty after 15.papers say 4A / 48W , and it comes with a spare 7A fuse for the plug.price was decent , seems to work ok , plaid seems a bit faked but still attractive ; hope it will last for a while .	1
This travel blanket is awsome . My wife loves it . She does not have heated seates so this is the next best thing . Plugs into the 12 volt power supply	1
I love putting the top down in my convertible during the fall and even well into the winter . This blanket keeps my girlfriend nice and toasty while we enjoy the drive . The cord is long enough to reach the back seat from the front outlet and the blanket itself is big enough for two people .	1
Installed this air filter on my 2013 Silverado and immediately realized a gain of approx . 2 MPG . Took about 10 minutes to install .	1
Packaging was nice as always and shipment quick . Of course this was a drop in so it fit nice and snug for my 2004 Tahoe Z71 . Was giving the newly used Z a tuneup so I replaced the plugs , wires , cleaned MAF , TB , cleaned out the filter housing as it had grime inside of it , then just dropped this in . Z breathes better although I would really like to acquire a tube to replace the quiet factory one ! Anyways , I recommend the filter as it looks better than factory , and will be used and cleaned for MANY miles to come !	1
I have to admit that there is a small improvement in performance . The throttle response is better but not to the point to say that there is a increase in horse power . The truck seems to run a little better and I hope it 's just not the change in summer fuels . I was n't looking for fuel improvement . All I was looking for was better drivability and I think that 's what I got . I only have one concern and that is that it does n't affect the mass air flow sensor ( MAF ) because of the oil that is use on the filter could possibly damage it .	1
This filter combined with an Airaid MRT helped my 2004 Tahoe make a little more power and sound like it has a V8 under the hood ! The filter fit nicely and should provide plenty of filtration for this daily driver .	1
I 've read a couple reviews stating that the sizing could be wrong , so I was a little hesitant to order , but the return policy is simple so I did , very happy with my order . I can feel increased acceleration on highway speeds . I have a 2002 silverado 1500 8 cyl . rwd .	1
High quality filter , just like the numerous K & N ; filters I 've purchased over the years . Got it from the Amazon Warehouse deals and an awesome price too ( about the price of 2 of the cheapest paper filters you can buy ) . Fits perfectly in the stock airbox of my 02 Chevy Avalanche.Did I notice any fuel mileage or performance increases ? Of course not ... its a nearly 6000lb truck and this is just an air filter .	1
The initial cost of these is pretty steep but the long term savings , assuming you keep cars for a few years , is quickly recovered . It adds a throating sound to your vehicle while delivering much better airflow to the engine than standard throw away filters . The every 20,000 miles or so cleaning and re-oiling are very easy to do .	1
It is thinner than the stock air cleaner . I put this in at the same time as I added a Dynomax cat-back exhaust system . The truck can stay in 4 cylinder mode longer now , theoretically boosting my mileage a bit . Having used K & N replacement filters for years , this one did not disappoint .	1
This one filter has done the job in my 2001 Silverado for 13 years and 225,000 miles . I have never had the heads off , so I can not comment on the condition of the cylinder walls . Does not burn oil and still runs great . I have not cleaned it as often as I should have . Have only cleaned it 2 times . So counting it being clean when installed , it 's been without dirt 3 times in 225,000 miles . No evidence that any dirt ever got through it . Use the K & N cleaner and no other cleaners . Do not use hot water as it can shrink the cotton fibers making the filter look wavy . All of the dirt will wash out with ease . Let dry , I sit mine in front of a fan . Recoat with the K & N oil which is red so you can see that you have fully covered it . Put a thin coat of K & N grease on the neoprene seal and you are ready again . This filter maintains it low restriction to air flow , even when very dirty . I have these in all of my vehicles , not to save money , but because they stop dirt better and allow more air flow . Cars that sit outside sometimes attract mice that chew up the paper air filter and make a nest . Not possible with the oil soaked K & N .	1
W0W ... ..This filter fits exactly like the OEM filter But will allow much better air flow to my big V8 & save me sum $ $ $ $ $ @ the same time . I recommend this unit to anyone looking for added performance & mileage . A+ & # 34 ; Ca n't beat K/N & # 34 ;	1
For about the cost of 3 throw away filters , you get a lifetime filter that provides better air flow . I was due to replace my filter anyhow , spent a little extra an got this . It popped into my '07 Altima 3.5 without any tools . A perfect fit . There 's a decal to add to air intake box so that hopefully future service personnel ( Jiffy Lube and the like ) wo n't keep trying to change the filter for you .	1
I use it in every one of my cars ! Fits well and its washable/reuse for the life of the car .	1
I looked around for a better price but Amazon had the best number ! I have one in both cars and soon as I get time I will be building a K & N set-up for my other vehicle as there is not one made for it	1
My G coupe needed an intake air flow replacement pretty badly after I purchased it ( despite the fact I purchased it with only 37k miles ) and I already knew about the K & N ; air filters and I like how it 's a one-time purchase deal , no need to buy again when it 's filthy.bought the filter , slapped it on , and it has been working flawlessly for a little over 2 weeks now . I combined the K & N ; air filter with the popular Z-tube mainly because I was already going to be in there so I figured why not just add the Z-tube for a bit more efficiency . at this point , I have no complaints , I do feel a slight increase in power in 2nd and 3rd ( not a 100 % sure if it 's all from the air filter or with the Z-tube ) , and rev noise has stayed the same .	1
Bought for a 2001 Maxima and it was a perfect fit . I like to keep my air cleaner really clean and this should serve my purpose well ... I also bought the recharge kit which is also OEM K & N . Would recommend to anyone in the market for a K & N filter . : )	1
What is not to love about a cheap genuine K & N ; product ? It fit in my car with zero issues and its K & N ; so you know its quality.On a nice side note for the men out there , K & N ; includes a sticker to put on the air box that says the filter is a K & N ; product and does not need to be replaced . I only say this because my wife has had people who change her oil try to sell her a new one . This was a nice thing to see in the package . They even include a card to put in the glove box with a 1 800 number for a service station to call if they don & # 8217 ; t believe it ! I have always put a K & N ; air filter in my car and as long as they are around I always will . Plus Amazon had them for about 30-50 % than other places I looked.I have no issues !	1
the best air filter i 'll ever owned . it 's more power to the engine the stock air filter is just thick papersK & N ; air is way better . now my car can breath better ... .the best thing is it 's reusable ! ! can you used it over and overreally worth the money . enough said ! go and get this air filter .	1
at 30bux this is a steal ! any store sells this for 50 which is so high . K & N makes the best filters and for a drop in this works great . I modded my intake and used this drop in filter and noticed about 2-3 more mpg ( thats alot considering i used to get 11mpg on my truck , now i get anywhere from 12-15 no lie ! ) , also makes my engine a bit louder which is a plus i think .	1
I cant attest to any power gains but I do like K & N 's product line . I have a K & N filter in all of my vehicles .	1
Buy this right now . I had a performance K & N ; filter set-up on my Acura , but for some reason it never occurred to me to put a K & N ; filter on my commuter car . It popped up as a suggestion , and I purchased it immediately . Right away I noticed snappier acceleration . At the end of my 22 mile commute my mileage had already improved .5 mpg without resetting the computer . I am floored . I am fresh out of a dyno so I do n't know if my HP increased , but based on my other two observations , combined with this being a lifetime product , I am ecstatic about this filter.Now , a little story about replacing my old filter with the K & N . ; I thought I was just going to open the air box , yank out the old one , slap in the K & N ; , and then go about my day . WRONG . Big ol ' thumbs down for Nissan making routine task a big undertaking . If you have an Altima you had better get out your awesomeStanley 92-839 Black Chrome and Laser Etched Socket Set , 99-Piece . Use your short 10mm and remove the intake hose from where it attaches to the box . Then you can unclip the front clips , and the lid flips up . You can unclip the sensor , but I did not . Thank goodness I do not have to do that again for another 50,000 miles .	1
First , this filter will NOT give you huge horsepower gains , it might give you minimal MPG gains just by replacing the filter from a dirty , clogged one , but that will come with any filter . I bought this filter because it does save money , money you would be spending buying paper filters over and over again , with this and a 10-15 dollar service kit , this filter will last your vehicles lifetime . There is a trade off though , this filter does not screen out dirt as well as say a `` paper '' or foam type filter , that is why `` off roading '' voids the damage warranty . however i never off road , and for highway and street use , this filter is King in terms of economy and durability ( it is made of 4-5 layers of cotton encased with a aluminum wire mesh surrounded by hand poured urethane ) , they mean it when they say it will last a Million miles . This filter earns my recommendation .	1
I musta spent a gazillion dollars on nozzles from wally world , k-notsmart , etc . I just wish I had bought one of these in the first place ! I heard about it from a friend who owns several aircraft and he says it 's the best for use around aircraft . I figure if it 's good enough for his airplanes , it 's good enough for me ! Love it !	1
This nozzle is built like a tank and will last forever from the looks of it and from the 10 year old my neighbor has.I have the bad habit of sometimes leaving my hose water turned on so that I can have instant water at the nozzle . Not the brightest idea as your hose can burst or your nozzle can fail.A few months ago my neibhgor came by and told me that I had a leak . I looked around and sure enough , my old nozzle had failed . My neighbor mentioned , `` that there 's your problem neighbor - that crumby plastic nozzle you 're using . `` His has been going strong for 10 years . So I ordered this from Amazon rather than going through two warehouses stores hunting for it.I must say that I 'm very impressed.PROS- very solid construction , either aluminum or steel- padded with thick rubber- looks like fireman 's hose- smoothly fades from closed to soaker to rain to fan to jet with a simple twist- easy to work with wet handsCONS- noneNow I will tell you that the jet on this nozzle is one of the best I 've seen but I 'm not going to compare this to a pressure washer , I have one and nothing compares to a pressure washer , but the jet mode of this is pretty darn good.I recommend you get one and I also recommend you close your water at the faucet when not in use .	1
I really like these high-quality , `` fireman-type '' , and high-output nozzles . They are built VERY WELL and output a lot of water . If you do n't want high water output , then do n't get this nozzle , otherwise , I would highly recommend spending more money to get one of these rather than the cheaper nozzles . I think it 's worth it .	1
I have been using this for a while now , i like it , its a great nozzle , i can set it to whatever setting i want with ease . Does not leak while in use and it seems solid in my hands , i think this will last and ive dropped it a couple of times already . I think it works better with higher water pressure .	1
I 've been using these hose nozzles for years , you wo n't find a better nozzle anywhere . Do n't hesitate , buy a few you will love them .	1
Maybe they moved to China do n't know . Bought first one ten years ( ? ) ago . So much better than any other in my life that I sent another to my brother who says the same . China may or may not lower quality.Bought about three since the first one . They were copy cats , two I think from HD , junk , total junk . Felt like they were restricting the flow at any setting . Poor jet shape or any other compared to original . Remember I had the old one for comparison which defined `` perfect '' .After several throw aways bought another $ 20 one from Amazon . Think the metal part is aluminum in old and new if that matters . The most recent works just like the old one and on less pressure because the first hose bibb in front yard is ahead of the pressure valve all home have . Whoops , just noticed in the pic here at Amazon , front nozzle is stainless on both of mine but the colored body toward the rear looks like anodized aluminum on both of mine.So China or not I have old and new and they are equal in performance . Of the many things in life that never seem to be right this Bon-Aire Original Ultimate is settled . None have worked better for me and I look no more . Suddenly my wife springs to mind ... ... ... ... ... ..LOL ? ?	1
Every one of the hose nozzles I 've used has failed in a few years . Except this one . It 's the only one I 've left out back over the winter and has survived the freeze thaw and the snow . I 've left it through two winters of snow and ice attached to the hose and it still works great . Plus it functions so well . The worst thing I can say about it is it 's tricky to fit under some car wheel wells but that 's fine for having a functional nozzle that does what it is supposed to do year and year.EDIT : 10/16/13 and I have two of these nozzles and one still stays outside all winter and both still work perfectly .	1
so i used this to basically pressure wash my muddy ATV . it worked surprisingly well . nothing like a pressure washer but just turn on water and use this and i got 90 % of it off . i had hoped for a little more power on the high pressure setting but cant really expect much i guess.i dont know how often ill use it , maybe for playing with my son , but i like the & # 34 ; gentle soak & # 34 ; spray . its much wider and useful than just the hose without a nozzlei would say the best 2 features are 1. the ability to shut it off going either direction and 2. even if its not much more powerful than your typical nozzle there is no holding a handle , or holding your finger over the hose to get pressure . feels like it should last a long time	1
2 different hoses , totally different results . I typically use a light duty pocket hose to wash my car since it 's easier to tote around , but it does n't flow nearly enough pressure for this nozzle . I switched to my standard 3/4 '' rubber hose and it was night and day . This nozzle NEEDS a high-volume hose to function properly . Build quality is second to none , but I knocked it down a star because my other nozzles work just fine with my light duty hose .	1
All of my cheap dollar store garden hose nozzles gave up the ghost this summer . They leaked , sprayed from every angle except the desired one and one , just would n't shut off . Cheap Chinese-made Junk ! I read the reviews of the Bon-Aire Original Ultimate and it sounded like a take off on NYC 's Famous Original Ray 's Pizza . However , it was cheap enough so I took a chance . When it arrived , I immediately hooked it up and so far , it 's all you could want from a garden hose nozzle . You turn it on or off by turning left or right . The spray patterns go from gentle waterfall to direct stream and all stops in between . I ca n't tell how long it will last but it looks and feels well made so I give it 4 stars.It could have had 5 stars but , darn , it 's made in China . Fairly-priced Chinese-made not-junk ! The loss of a star is no reflection on China or the product ; just my disappointment that we do n't have a hose nozzle this good with a made in the USA sticker on it .	1
My brother purchased one of these at a trade show for almost double what it sells for here . After I saw it , I had to have one too . This thing is put together very well , with quality parts and good fit and finish . If you have the water pressure , using this will probably allow you to roll a small dog or cat down your driveway ( not that you should , but you 'd be able to ) ! Operation is smooth and it 's comfortable in the hand . Made in China .	1
This will be the 773rd review for this product , so I 'm guessing that this is not the first one you 've read . It 's safe to assume you already know enough about how it works . As such , I may not have a lot of information to add , except for the fact that I 've had this nozzle for at least five years . I 'm not sure exactly when I bought it , but it was definitely no later than 2009.I 've used it consistently over that time , for washing the car , hosing off the patio by the pool , washing the dog , cleaning the pool filter , etc etc . It 's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete , it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end , and years of abuse have n't affected it in the slightest . The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too , less messing with it when you 're done using it . I had intended to buy another one for the hose in the back of the house , but instead I 've just been switching this one back and forth as necessary.If you 're looking through these reviews because you 're interested in buying one ( why else would you be ? ) , get one . It 's worth the money .	1
This nozzle is exactly as describe in write ups . It has a variety of water patterns from full soaking to hard steady stream . You can expect water to come out of the hose a full throttle unless you reduce it manually . My first attempt to use it was with a small diameter hose and they are not the best to use for a nozzle that uses a standard hose . The small diameter would not permit pressure buildup inside the hose and therefore the exit of water was at a much smaller volume than a standard hose . No big thing . Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems . While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows . Next , I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder , fertilizer or detergent . It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer . Old happy gardener . When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic . Some , however , plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $ 25 for this nozzle . While it is not perfect , it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for . Also , I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off . In fact , it is doubtful that this nozzle will see vehicle washing again .	1
This hose nozzle lets out an amazing amount of water and looks like it could survive a nuclear blast . I 'm extremely impressed with the build quality and the functionality for washing dogs and my car.With my old nozzle , it would take a long time to wash the soap out of my dog 's hair . With this nozzle , the initial gush of water takes almost all of the soap away leaving them squeaky clean . Same goes for rinsing soap off of my car.It 's hard to imagine being excited about a hose nozzle but this thing is awesome .	1
This is a must have for those with excellent water pressure and volume and a good hose . I highly recommend this .	1
After reading many of the reviews here , my expectations were probably set too high . Many purchasers have made this thing sound like it sprinkles water from the fountain of youth at pressures to rival Old Faithful.It is well made and should last many years . Other than that , it sprays out water prett much like any other hose nozzle I have ever used . It is a quality product but I do not understand all the raves .	1
Solid piece of equipment , I do n't think I 'll ever buy the other `` garden '' variety hose head anymore ... .WOW I just wrote review on a hose head ! ! ! That saying something	1
I got this nozzle to try a different nozzle for different reasons . You can never have enough nozzles for hoses . It works well , puts out great pressure and you feel like something is getting cleaned instead of just soaked .	1
This is not a replacement for the amazing griots garage one , but its also a 5th of the price . Works well , takes abuse and seems built to last .	1
This is a very good nozzle . It allows a good amount of control of the water spray pattern , ranging from a wide fan delivering a low pressure water stream , through to a high pressure , narrow stream . Perfect for cleaning cars ( using a medium fan of water to get the car wet and to rinse off the soap , and a high pressure spray to remove road grime from the wheels and underside ) . It 's good for watering plants too , using the fan end of the selector range . If you get it just right you can actually get it to mist too.The only thing this nozzle is missing is a quick on/off mechanism . As it is , you turn it off by rotating the front to one end or the other . This is the same mechanism used to select the spray pattern . This is a design improvement over the original , which only had the off position at one end of the spray selection.The rubber coated aluminum design is very sturdy and will last for years ... the last one did . The only reason I had to replace the last one was my mistake ... I left it attached to the hose for a few years and either the hard water or electrolysis caused it to become permanently stuck to the brass end of the hose , and it got damaged when I tried to remove it . Lesson learned ... I remove it from the hose when it 's not in regular use .	1
This is a very durably built nozzle , with great thick rubber group and a spin that feels really smooth & solid . I can imagine this thing lasting for years . The only drawback I find is that for those who turn it on and off frequently , there is a decent amount of friction involved in turning all the way off to all the way on , so it 's not as quick to use as a trigger shot .	1
I have a 3/4 inch hose and I was always frustated that at the end of the hose , a nozzle or a quick connect would create lots of restriction . Well , with this baby , there is plenty of water coming out ! To make your life easier and perfect use it with a full flow Gilmour quick connect.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTMGTG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00	1
I have owned no less than 15 different nozzles over the years . One has been worse than the next . The ones you drop after you use which are made of plastic simply break . Then there are the ones with the several settings and trigger which constrict the flow so much that you would think it needed a dose of flomax ! I have used many types in between . This unit is simply the best . I never realized the pressure I had restricted by using the other ones . When I turned the spigot on all the way , I could get a good steady stream over 20 feet no problem at all . I drop it after use without worrying about cracking it .	1
I just started using it and ordered another one today . I am a garden person with many flowers all over the place . Nozzles are important to me . This one is by far the best I 've ever used . Reaches far and many patterns that I can choose . Nothing better .	1
By far this is the best hose nozzle . Look at the reviews . There 's a reason it 's rated so high . It 's very durable and easy to use . With so many spray settings , you do n't need anything else . It goes from a soft spray to a very powerful stream . I highly recommend this product .	1
The sky high ratings intrigued me , so when the Bon-Aire `` ultimate '' nozzle was available as a Lightning Deal , I bought one to see if it lived up to the hype.The product appears to be very well constructed , and is quite a bit larger and heavier , than your typical cheapo nozzle . You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front . Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range , as the flow pattern goes from off , to a gentle sprinkle , to wide spray , and then narrowing into a beam , and then off again . Because of the larger sized head , the `` ultimate '' nozzle has a larger area of coverage , and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow , producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers . When adjusted more to a spray , it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use . This is however , nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open , the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter , which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle . Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous , but you will be using more water , and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing . Unless your system has high volume , and good water pressure , you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built , and seems to work as advertised . Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish , rather than green , which looks cooler . Although it can deliver a higher volume of water , the assertion that it is the `` ultimate '' is perhaps an overstatement . It does a good job , but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns . The economy models typically do n't last very long , so if `` the ultimate '' proves to be durable , it might be worth the premium cost . It 's a bit heavy , and encourages using more water , so at this point I like it more than love it .	1
So easy to use and turn on and off . It dose not burn your hand like the others do when left out in the sun .	1
This thing is bulilt to last . I love this nozzle , it is very durable and works great . I did not have a leak for over a year now .	1
Used these for my Civic speakers and bundled with the bulk pack does wonders for dampening sound and keeping out road noise ! Great purchase !	1
Purchased for 2010 Challenger . Installed by HyTech Audio in Houston , Texas . No road noise heard only music . Picture perfect sound .	1
I used some of this on my headphones to help deaden the bass . It works very well , but then I found out there is cheaper stuff available . So I would shop around before getting this , but it does work very well .	1
HI , This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle 's car doors , rear panels , decks , etc . It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion , noise , etc ... . However , it should be noted that if you are over powering a speaker..distortion will occur and no padding can stop that.Dynamat has been around for ever and continues to provide a solution that eliminates rattle and vibration . Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product . Expect miracles and you will be disappointed .	1
Dynamat is great , it 's the original , you ca n't go wrong . I 'm strictly using for door panels on both vehicles as I upgrade their stereo systems completely . But I plan to put this on the floor of my truck as well , under the carpet .	1
I avoided dynamat for the longest time because it 's pricey for the coverage area . However after researching this , it 's not easy to find a comparable material . I covered the interior walls of my dryer ( I posted a photo above ) and it reduced the low rumbling noise considerably . Dynamat Xtreme is a butyl rubber compound covered by aluminum foil . The butyl is viscoelastic - it has just the right consistency between solid and liquid to provide maximum sound damping . The foil probably provides some level of fire resistance , since it is hard for a fire to develop without oxygen when it is sandwiched in between the metal layer . Cheap alternatives that some people use include the asphalt based rolls of roof sealer . However that stuff will smell bad when it heats up ( whereas butyl does n't have such odor ) and it does n't have an aluminum layer so it 's more dangerous if it were to catch fire , and asphalt can ooze into a liquid . The closest thing I have come across that resembles Dynamat Xtreme is Hard Cast Foil Grip 1402 , a specialty tape sold to contractors for HVAC duct sealing . This HVAC tape , a favorite of mine for all kind of sealing uses , is much thinner though . It 's also a butyl compound with a foil layer and is also very expensive . Overall I have n't found any hardware store generic material that is as good as Dynamat Xtreme for sound damping on large panels . The price here is pretty good - I called around to some local retailers and they wanted almost twice as much for this kit .	1
I used this on my Burgman 650 scooter putting in speakers - major difference.This stuff real makes the area around the speakers thick giving better depth of sound ... also takes out the rattles .	1
I had to use my wife 's 01 Honda Accord for a couple of days and I could hardly hear myself think from the road noise made by the tires on concrete . I searched around and found several products offering claims of noise reduction . I figured if this was good enough for the `` King of cool cars '' Chip Foose , then It would probably be good enough for me . I put it on the doors and the floor boards . It was fairly easy to do , get some of those nylon interior tools so you do n't scar up the interior panels . Man , was I ever a smart guy . My wife had never realized how loud it was in her car until I installed this . Now she is happy as ever driving her car . She said it made it feel like a new car . Happy wife - happy life . This stuff really does help a bunch ! And to think , I did this for me ... and reaped the benefits for doing it for her . Thanks to Chip and Amazon ( for having the best price and free shipping ) ! I would have given it a 6 out of 5 if I could .	1
I shopped around a lot and researched sound deadeners before i bought this . i was sure of 2 things , i wanted something made of butyl , and i wanted value . there is no way i would take my truck that ive put so much time and money in , and line it with roofing tar for sound deadening to save a few dollars . when i first started looking at these product i went to lowes and looked at the peel n seel stuff . wow , i cant believe people put that in their cars . the asphaly smell was horrible , and that was in the package at 70 degrees on the shelf . cant imagine at 100 degrees in summer . I wanted to go with another product that is like dynamat but its backordered for months . so i grabbed this to get started with . product is easy to work with . went on great and makes a nice difference . one of the few products that works as soon as u put it on and shud last forever . definatly pricey for what it is , but amazon had the best deal.The Tip : ive found an incredible sound deadener , i had a `` memory foam '' mattress topper laying around . after the dynamat , i backed it with the foam , double thick some places . now the hatch of my SUV is like a solid brick wall when u tap on it , and all the bass stays inside .	1
I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan , so I could hear my sony stereo more . I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors . I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers . I can hear them more and there 's less vibration on the doors . As far as road noise goes , it helped just a little . This product is n't made to reduce the road noise , just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road . The road noise level is still the same in my car .	1
This has a lot of uses beyond car applications . I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound . I used a sheet of it inside a computer case , to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on . You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback , and that 's the fact that once you stick it on something , you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess . It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover , and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind . So , choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down !	1
Wow , this stuff works well ! We have a wall air conditioner in our home . It is a quiet variety that we paid a good deal of money for , due to that claim . It still had a bad resonance of some vibrating metal on the machine.I applied this to all accessible ( front face ) surfaces , and only the spots where there was not a decal or other item present , probably less than 30 % of the total frontal surface ( keep in mind 50 % is the evaporator and blower vent ) , and the available space on the front cover . Wow , we can definitely hear a difference in the room it is installed in.This thing has a strong resonance , so we can still hear it in other spaces . I feel like it doesnt dampen all modes , but it certainly does enough for a noticeable difference in the space where we have the AC located .	1
This stuff works great and the price and shipping were all excellent . I ended up thinking one roll would work on a F250 front door , nope . It took nearly two rolls , so I had to order more , but that 's okay , I did .	1
This product is great , I only bought one of the sheets and all you have to do is fill the open holes in you trunk . I only covered the holes on the trunk and on the rear deck lid for the speakers . I didnt notice a big difference while driving till i looked at my rpm gauge and it was at 3500 ! ! ! ! i usually shift at 2300 rpm and it was soo quiet I did not realize the rpm 's i was running ! ! ! ! This product dampened my car from the sports exhaust sooooo much ! ! ! ! Great if you have a different exhaust system ! ! ! I am amazed on how much this product helps ! ! I am about to do my bottom of my trunk and my inside firewall and I know my car will almost sound electric from the interior ! ! ! GREAT PRODUCT ! ! !	1
Very good sound dampener it makes my trunk sounds very smooth and not rattly . I have my entire trunk lined with this stuff and all you can hear from the outside is true bass no rattling .	1
I bought about 10 boxs for my PT . The top of my PT would make a flutering sound when driving , not no more . Also road sounds dimed down some . When it rains , the top of my PT does n't sound like a tin can anymore ... .	1
Put this on the lid of my trunk and it decreased the rattling from my subs big time . I have a hyundai Elantra and the trunk lid is absolute garbage . The aluminum is extremely thin and flexes like crazy . This little bit of dynamat made the whole trunk sound much more solid and reduced the flexing . I highly recommend it.I also recommend getting the dynamat roller if you do n't have one .	1
I have had experience with dynamat in the past , but had never used it on my vehicles and was a little skeptical . My car has a factory sub and the rear deck rattled like crazy . After applying this to the underside the noise is gone .	1

I have used Dynamat to combat noise in automobiles , dishwashers and even under a stainless steel kitchen sink . The dishwasher and the sink were the most dramatic demonstrations of the value of this product . The dishwasher was on the noisy side , until I had to replace a small switch in the door . While I had it all apart , I decided to coat the inside of the door panel with Dynamat . Now the dishwasher makes a soft hum as it running . The sink was insulated , but it made that cheap rain on a metal roof sound when you turned on the water . It was difficult to have a conversation and do the dishes at the same time . Now it is dead quiet ! What a change ! I love this stuff . I know that I will be on the look out for more Dynamat applications in my life !	1
It 's no wonder Jay Leno and other serious car restorers use this stuff . It works ! Depending on the car you 're working on , disassembly could take some time , but it 's worth it . Getting the bulk pack is the way to go - much cheaper in the long run.I put this in an Escort ZX2 , and it made a huge difference . It was like my ears were stuffed up ( but they were n't ) . I did the hood , doors , floor , and trunk . Actually installing it is a breeze . Cut it with a utility knife , remove the backing , and put it down . Then just roll over it with a roller of some kind to make sure it grips.For tricky shapes , I used paper or cardboard templates . Even if you make a mistake cutting , it hardly matters . Cut it too big ? Just cut some more away . Cut it too small ? Just add some more.This is not a job to do when it is ten degrees outside . Wait till spring or summer when the Dynamat is easier to work with .	1
I do n't even know another sound deadner solution besides dynamat and theres proably a reason for that . I have been using this stuff on many car audio projects for years and its been great . Excellent from stopping trunk paneling from rattling down and solidifying speaker enclosures down to keeping wires bundled neatly and secure to the chassis . Always buy a bulk pack at least because the project always starts small like two speakers enclosures and next your doing the whole door outside panel and inside panel . Plus it never hurts to have extra .	1
I used this video to quiet a steel enclosure for a CNC mill . The product works perfectly . The amount I bought was overkill , but I saved on shipping and actual product price . My plan is to contact local stereo installers to see if they want to buy my surplus . If not , there are a myriad of items in my home that need some damping : ) Used a wallpaper seam roller which worked fine .	1
I 've used Dynamat for many years now . In my car I did n't manage to eliminate rattles from the trunk ( 2x jl audio 13w6 's ) , but greatly reduced them . It used to be embarrassing ( and sounded bad too ) driving with volume up and car rattling being the only audible thing . It 's better now because the rattling can only be heard by the trunk on the outside . I used it in the doors , floors , and trunk of my 04 ' elantra and it dramatically reduced road noise . It also made the stereo sound 10x better in my car . I also used it in the doors and trunk of an 01 Grand Prix , and also reduced road noise and improved stereo quality , but not as dramatically as my car since the grand prix comes with more sound deadening .	1
I have a 2008 , Ford F150 FX2 Sport , Supercab . I had never done anything with sound , to any vehicle I had ever owned , that was so extensive . I am so glad I did . I absolutely love this stuff and will probably put it in any vehicle I own , whether I do a sound system or not . It just quiets things down . It gets a bit sticky at times but comes right off your fingers . Be careful with small pieces that you want to throw away , they may end up back on the bottom of your foot . It took me a solid weekend to do the front to the back and doors . If you have the time , do it .	1
I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat . There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be , but I just do n't trust them as much . If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot . Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $ 20 worth of roofing tar into a $ 20,000+ vehicle . The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high , but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work . I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them . I have not purchased or used these product , but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them . I am not a car audio professional by any means . This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1 ) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective & # 34 ; legitimate & # 34 ; option.2 ) Sound Deadener Showdown - & # 34 ; CDL Tiles & # 34 ; + Mass Loaded Vinyl . SDS would be an interesting choice . If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff , but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3 ) Fatmat : Cheapest of all automotive dampeners , but one Google search of & # 34 ; fatmat smell & # 34 ; is all you need to know . Some say it smells awful and some do n't , but there is no chance I risk it . This stuff is super cheap , does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks . I would use home depot roofing material before this product . Move on.And to the & # 34 ; REAL & # 34 ; competitor.4 ) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam ( CCF ) - Although I decided on dynamat , based on reviews and forum comments , I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat , but I decided against it for a few reasons . Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme . For most , this isnt going to make a huge difference , but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound . I want an improved sound system , but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me . A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive , but a 36 sq . foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $ 204+ shipping . They do have some coupons occasionally , but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals . I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth . If you drive a big truck or SUV , want the absolute best sound and are n't as concerned with weight , I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme . I lined just about every surface , doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit . If you want to really go out and line an entire car , you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff . If you are doing the trunk and doors like me , you 'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door . I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors . You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors , but the door kit strips 12 & # 34 ; x 36 & # 34 ; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door . It would not be the end of the world to have extra , but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned . Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme . That may be true , but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk , I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners . I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down . it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you can not get the roller in , because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers . I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however , as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors ( and trunk I think ) as well as by itself in a few areas . I really hope this helps someone . If you have anything to say about my opinions , or would just like to comment on what I have done , please let me know .	1
I was originally going to get one of the small squares to go behind my newly installed speakers but after comparing the price per square foot , I decided to tackle a box of this stuff . A box let me cover four doors and my roof in my subaru wrx wagon.This car is my first non Mercedes in 15 years and although the subaru is still an econo box , this made the stereo sound way better , reduced road noise and give the car a more & # 34 ; luxury & # 34 ; feel . Well worth the price and effort to install .	1
there was so much product that I was able to dynomat all 4 doors and truck & I still have over half the dynomat left for other projects .	1
Installed in my IS 350 . Could have used another few square feet , but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet , spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation . Do n't forget the license plate and fuel door .	1
The rubber is soft so my vehicle doors are protected from hitting the concrete wall . I used doubled sided adhesive tape and it holds it nice and tight . Great product !	1
Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage , from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges . I need to buy another pack though , for the back doors protection too , as it is not long enough for both doors . We do n't need it for the back doors very often , but I think it will come in handy at times . Since we like this so much , we will be buying another .	1
After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port , I bought this . Works exactly like it should ... by being a barrier between my door and the wall . The thickness is perfect . It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs ... but very good nonetheless . Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note : The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured ( stucco ) wall .	1
I ordered two for my garage . They are the right thing I needed . The rubber is soft enough to hold it 's own shape , but wo n't damage the vehicle 's paint . I may punch a hole in the middle since it is already beginning to sag . And , it has the lovely & # 34 ; made in China & # 34 ; stench . The rubber smells strong , and is probably toxic , but it was only $ 8.No one lives forever.-Oingo Boingo	1
The door protector is the perfect size . thick enough to protect the door even if you open too hard . Other protectors are thinner . Easy to mount . You will need to provide your own screws .	1
Very happy with this purchase . It is SO much better than the yellow hard plastic one . The soft rubber protects the door edges much MUCH better .	1
What I really like about these is the locking bar . Most inexpensive stands do not have the add safety feature of a locking bar . These are quality items that make me feel very safe working under a car	1
These jack stands are awesome ... .very tall . My jeep has 4-5 inch of lift and is sitting on 35s . These stands have no problems holding it off the ground with lots of room to spare !	1
easy to use , very solid . the double locking is a great feature but is kind of over kill . Love it !	1
These jack stands seem to be well made and I like the feature with the safety pin . I bought these to use on an old corvette and they are more than what is required for that purpose . I would have no problem using these on our chevy suburban .	1
I bought a set of these thinking they were the same as my 6 ton jack stands . Luckily , my mistake made my life easier . I was always that anything less than a 6 ton jack is just too flimsy if you 're working on a truck or SUV . I turns out that these little guys are n't flimsy at all . And the added lock , while completely unnecessary , does provide a bit of extra reassurance when you 're under a vehicle . I would definitely buy again .	1
Can see the same welding issues as the other users , though I 'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load ( 2 tons ) the jack stands can hold . Sturdy jack stands , might be slightly high for some cars , depending on what you are trying to do ( being too high is n't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more ) .Overall , simple no frills car jack stands . Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked , as well as the regular locking handle .	1
Reviewer 's car : Hyundai Veloster TurboI did not have any problems with these jack stands . However , the lock is very easy to remove , so be aware of that . It did gave my car the support it needed , which these jack stands promised .	1
I use them and I like them ... though since they seem to be made from painted carbon steel do not let them stand in the garage floor over winter . They will most likely begin to rust . I sprayed a bit of rubberized undercoating on them to at least prevent rust for a while	1
I had two sets of jack stands but only 1 1/2 tin capacity and when I got my truck , I feel questionable getting under the truck . I know they share the weight but it only takes one to fail ... So I ordered two pair of these 3 ton stands . They were securely packed in the box with cover and cushion . I love the double locking safety . Very good construction and ready for use . I highly recommend this product .	1
I use these very often . Helps me feel a lot safer when under my truck . They adjust well enough to get under there without much jacking up and jacking down .	1
These jack stands do what they are supposed to do . My Disco 2 is about 5,000 lbs and they hold it just fine . My only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height . These jack stands are tall . I use them on the lowest setting on my Disco and I still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under . I will be lifting it soon though , so that will change , and hence the reason I got these . For a normal car though , these would probably not be my first choice.Also , if you are using them on asphalt , be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little . On concrete you would n't have this problem , but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through.Finally , be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use .	1
I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues . I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I 'm curious .	1
Heavy duty , no flaws . Easy to use . Make sure you bend in the tabs to prevent the insert from falling out later . These are great .	1
They are OK jack stands nothing special . The only problems are that the double locking stick thing sometimes is not aligned properly and does not go in correctly . Also the legs are not flat when they wrap which could result in them sinking into your driveway or garage but that is not a problem for me because I primarily use them for a go kart and ATV but I have heard that it is good to get the ones with the flat legs because of those problems .	1
The Honda dealer wanted over $ 1,000 to replace the back shocks on my S2000 . I bought these and a few tools totaling under a $ 100 and saved $ 500 by DIY . That makes these a winner.Mike	1
Bought these because I have a deep fear of a car falling on top of me while I 'm underneath . Although I still have a major fear of that , these things do help ease it quite a bit because of the thick and sturdy build quality and the bar thing that locks it in place . Very heavy duty stands .	1
Good stand for the price . They hold my offroad rig at full extension on the frame no problem , and the double locking feature gives me peace of mind , but still be sure to use other safeguards .	1
These are great for my Trailblazer , but huge for my daughter 's Camaro . So keep in mind , you may want to go with a smaller ton stand if you do n't have a truck or SUV	1
As for quality , sure it is n't top notch . But this thing is n't going to fall apart on you , these are tough and will hold . Scared for you life ? Than go to a shop . The welding is n't perfect , but you have to realize this is mass produced . The welds are n't going to separate . I would definitely suggest using these in pairs , as in do n't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle . For those with cars , do n't worry b/c cars weigh nothing . These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight . The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs . My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end , it will hold your average cars then too . If your doing small jobs , get these b/c theres no beating the price .	1
I bought two sets / 4 total . I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high . This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R & R ; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I do n't need 6t worth of lift , but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range . With these set for my range ( as stated above ) , they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I 've used in the past , but are comfortably in the middle . They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units , not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min . Lift Height ( in . ) 14 29/32Max . Lift Height ( in . ) 23 1/2	1
I wanted a stand with the double lock and this is it . Have been using it since purchase and have had no issues . Great value .	1
I wanted a higher rating for my garage jack stands since they will be holding the Beast up while I scurry about underneath . These fit the billl . The safety bar gives me a little extra confidence and the welds look OK to my untrained eye .	1
I would not hesitate to recommend these jack stands , as I have had very good results and they seem to be very well made . The double lock is an absolutely mandatory feature in my estimation . You should always use the jack stands with the double lock in place , as it adds additional security . I am pleased with the height of the stands as well , as it is possible to raise the vehicle up a considerable amount , making it easy to get in and work . I replaced the front suspension on my vehicle in an afternoon using these stands and they never wavered . I went out and replaced the rear shocks , springs , and fuel filter the next day . Once again , the stands were steady and solid while I pushed , shoved , wedged , etc . the rear springs into place.I am very pleased with these stands and definitely recommend them .	1
I 've been climbing around under cars since 1959 and these jack stands are sweet . One can drop a four wheel drive on these puppies and they 're not going flex . Or one can get their sports car up to a `` DECENT '' working height of a shade under twenty-four inches.It does n't matter if these have a capacity of six tons each or they 're six tons for two of them because they 're shipped and you 're going use them ... ... as a pair . Our full size F-250 , with tool boxes is 8,800 pounds so what do I care if they 're not six tons each ? They 're going be holding up a single corner or side of the vehicle at a time . In the meantime , the spec sheet packaged inside the box the jack stands are packed in , clearly spec these jacks at 6T `` each . `` If you need to be reassured , call the manufacture 's customer service line between 8-5 PST @ 1-888-448-6746 and let customer service tell you directly what the truth is regarding any of your questions.On our jack stand copy , I checked the delivered jack stand base welds and found all gusset welds and manufacturing quality control , to be good to excellent manufacturing/welding . I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be `` excellent . '' There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal ( a standout ) , cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.This is not a high end , tech grade , stainless steel , high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray 'd . This is a typical red and black jack stand one uses at home or a shop to support a car , pickup , flatbed or box truck for the purpose of safely making repairs under a jacked up vehicle . Used normally , with safety in mind during proper placement , there 's no reason to believe that if you use these jack stands , you wo n't be able to safely get under a vehicle , make your repairs and get on to the next item on your check list.Overall , I am very pleased with the pair of auto jacks we received and I feel comfortable recommending these beasts to all who find themselves to be mechanically inclined and in need of safely crawling around under their jacked up vehicle .	1
Torin T43002A 3 ton double locking jack stands . I know of other individuals that have use these and I decided that I needed them too	1
Why all the hype they have bad welds , they have this that or the other ... .. Sometimes you get a bad product . Does not mean that all the products are defective . I purchased a set this past week and they have 100 % perfect welds . The product is in perfect shape and comes complete with instructions . if you get a bad set , send them back . Amazon takes them back . I am a welder and a mechanic . Yes , I 've gotten bad products , but it does n't mean you berate the product to death . They have worked fine under a Kubota with a back hoe attached . They do the job that they are supposed to do . If you seem to think the product is defective send them back , get another set and rate what is used . I feel completely safe working under these and have !	1
I bought this to jack up my 4Runner . It is sturdy for 3 ton , but a little short for a SUV . So I have to be careful to be sure the chassis bar stay on the top of the jack stand when I lower the jack . Otherwise , it is very good .	1
I really like the double locking feature as a backup incase the release lever got kicked or something . These stands also have a pretty good lift range . The welds are n't the best like others have pointed out but that 's just what you 're going to get at this price point . I 'll probably reweld them at some point but for now they still far exceed my needs.I bought the 6 ton stands because while I 'm not certain they 're strong enough to support 6 tons ( 3 tons each of course ) they are definitely strong enough to support any normal vehicle . Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands . With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non-commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars.Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles .	1
The unique locking pin makes these worthwhile . However , when you read the instructions , it 's not clear how to bend the `` tab '' to hold the supports in the frame . Best way is to take a big screwdriver and bend them inward . Ca n't believe they do n't put that on the instructions , since it 's not intuitive .	1
It 's an oil filter . It has been on for a few weeks now and has n't come off , so I suppose it 's working . It 's hard for me to justify giving an oil filter a 5-star rating . What would the filter have to do to earn that ? The only thing I noticed is that this one appears to be *SLIGHTLY* shorter , in length , than the one originally on my bike . I ride a 2008 Victory Kingpin and this was about 1/4 inch shorter . Hopefully , that does n't mean that it is n't able to do the same amount of & # 34 ; work. & # 34 ; The rest of the fit was snug and seems to be just fine .	1
I bought this as a extra , so that when I change the oil I will have a new one . It look to be of great quality and I am sure it will work just fine .	1
Shoppe around a little for a motorcycle filter for my 2004 Kawasaki Mean Streak . I like Fram and have used their filters on other bikes without any problems . So I bought it . Will buy another when the time comes .	1
Fram 's a solid name in the motoring industry and at a price that 's still reasonable . Never had a filter fail in a car or bike . Buying the multi-pack for the bike was a great value since oil is changed more frequently with motorcycles .	1
My experience by no means is a proven scientific method of analysis , but the trend I have experienced with Fram filters has been one of reliability . I used Fram on everything from motorcycles , ATVs , cars and my 4x4 trucks . Not one has shown any indication of failure . My truck with over 300K miles is well within its compression window and does n't blow the least bit of smoke . My motorcycle has over 50K miles and it too does n't show any appreciable wear.Does that mean Fram is flawless ? Nothing is , but I changed 1000s of engine oil for myself and 100s of friends over 30yrs . I am presently using this 6017A series on a Polaris ATV which is exposed to extreme conditions in the Florida swamps with much success.Maybe Fram fails easier than others when you push the envelope with going long on an oil change interval . Since I change oil religiously , I may never know what the failure point of a Fram filter is , and I am certainly not interested in finding out the hard way.I trust Fram as good balance between quality , reliability and cost .	1
worked fine ... went on with no problems and I like the price much better than the cycle shop 's price ... next time for sure	1
It 's a Fram - a name I 've learned to trust over the years . My only gripe is that none of my cap filters fit on the end , even the small ones .	1
Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well , no issues . Would purchase again .	1
Bought this for use as a shot glass . Real men drink out of oil filters . Are you a man ? Then get this.Oh and if you need a oil fllter for your bike ? Just go into your cupboard and grab a shot glass . It 's a win win.I have so much chest hair .	1
How much can I say about an oil filter . Fits my bike and price was good . No complaints . Would buy again .	1
bestop has always been good quality merchandise.this product is no exception.very good quality fit and well constructed.make sure you know your tire size so you get the right fitment .	1
If you need a new tire cover and do n't care about having something printed on it give this a look . It just fit my 255-70 R15 tires on my Jeep and has held up for about 12 month since it was installed . The only this I have noticed about it is that it is very hard to keep it looking clean and black without dirt streaks in it .	1
I have a Wrangle-X but it 's got the Rubicon wheel package so the tires are 255/75-17 ( I do n't know what all the numbers mean so I just post them all ) . I bought the 2X size and it fits good , coming over the back side by about 2 '' , feeling snug and secure . I do n't really see the `` denim '' look but at least it does n't have the shiny look . Material feels durable , should last pretty good .	1
No issues , just as described , Used to cover spare tire on boat trailer . Good quality . Currently have owned for more than 6 months and looks like new .	1
No real complains about it . Fits and does it 's job . Even the wide one does n't completely go around my steering wheel . My wheel is n't huge either . So this was meant for a skinny steering wheel . But it feels good and was easy to install . One of the plastic strings broke . But I just wrapped it around the wheel , tied a knot in it , and continued to wrap it around the wrap . Not a big deal . Happens with this style of wrap often .	1
This worked great , easy to put on and feels good too.Hard to find also , and it shipped fast.I bought a used truck and previous owner wore a lot of rings and the steering wheel was beat up.Now it looks great.2008 Ford F-150 4X4 Truck	1
... fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect . Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight . The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little .	1
I 've used this type of steering wheel cover ever since I can remember ! It takes time putting it on but it 's worth it ! Always get the & # 34 ; wide & # 34 ; version because any other type does n't cover the grip enough .	1
I bought this to provide extra heat prevention/protection for my short ram intake heat shield . My brand intake is a Neuspeed on my 2012 MKVI Jetta 2.5L SEL.It is easy to shape/trace to the shape of the item being wrapped and easy to cut/place . So far , the heat wrap has lasted and I see no peeling , especially after having lasted through two heavy days of raining . I did a temp-check with remote thermostats and found an additional 67F difference with the heat shield being wrapped versus not . A definite difference and benefit from before -- after ! I will post a picture this evening to go along with my review .	1
This stuff sticks surprisingly well to the underside of my carbon fiber hood . It has been a month of hard weather and it still looks and holds perfectly .	1
i used it to insulate my headlight on my motorcycle ! ( i put in an hid light ) not the most flexible stuff but can be cut up and set nicely !	1
I used this to protect a couple of relays under the hood of my vehicle and it worked great and keep the relays cool .	1
Was looking for something like this for the underside of my box for my side x side , the exhaust gasket let go on both pipes an blew out the center of the sheet protecting the underside . saw this stuff on here and did some research on the web on their products . looks like this is what I needed and they been making this great shielding for a while . so if you need heat shielding of all sorts , this is the company to look up .	1
Originally , I purchased this for a vehicle engine air intake -- cooler air = more mpg/power . However , I found that it works well for high temperature halogen lighting fixtures . In the winter , CFL take too long warm up in a garage door opener . So , I employ 150 watt halogen lamps . Even with the translucent fixtures removed , the lamps still melt the dark plastic housing on the garage door opener . With this heat barrier covering all of the nearby surfaces , not only is the plastic housing protected but better light out is realized .	1
I installed a custom cone cold air intake . Used this to wrap around the piping to keep the heat out , my gas mileage went up only 1mpg but thats still something . Keeps the air cooler around the piping and can definitely feel a boost in acceleration . This keeps the heat out for sure .	1
it stays stuck , on fiberglass at least . easily cut to shape . seems to protect . i 'm using it on the bellypan of my motorcycle track fairing , which is fiberglass . i 'm told fiberglass wo n't bubble like stock type fairings will , so i may not have needed it . but i put it on just in case , and whether it 's because i did n't need it or the stuff is working , but my paint is n't bubbling . which is all i care about .	1
I 'm using this to protect the cutout of our new granite countertop from the heat generated by the cooktop . This material feels heavy and professional , so it looks like it will do the job nicely . The adhesive sticks fine so far .	1
Using this on some steel transmission lines that somewhat close to the exhaust . Trying to limit the heat transfer into the fluid . Will update with results .	1
Used this tape many times over the years and it does what they say.Recently installed a cat-back system on my Jeep and the pipe was pretty close to my shock.Wrapped some of this tape around the shock where it seems close to the exhaust and my shock oil should be alright .	1
For idiots that think you can wrap headers with this , your a fool . This a insulin . keeps heat away not keep it . put on anything to keep the heat away from wires , intake pipes etc . works great . keep your intake cool and your good to go !	1
The adhesion is good and the thermo tape does its job . It 's good for protecting wires in your engine compartment or other high temperature places .	1
Easy to mount and adjust . Since each one is made identical ( there is no right or left , you just mount the mirror differently ) , one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror ( drivers side in my case ) . That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror . Good sturdy mount and no vibration . Once adjusted they are easy on and off .	1
I bought a pair of these to use while pulling a 17 ' Bowrider type boat behind a 2007 Ford Ranger . With just the stock mirrors , any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me . With the mirrors , that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially : one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone . When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove , the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all . Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely . Also , the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them . Well , there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball ; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror . If I had somebody to move it for me , I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver 's seat . As it is , I had to get out , adjust the mirror , get back in , check the adjustment from the driver 's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right . I do n't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them . The image vibrates slightly but that does n't really matter in practice : I 'm just looking to see if anything is behind the boat . It will tell me that .	1
I highly recommend these mirrors . I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these . I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job . They vibrate a little but not excessive . The little bit of vibration I see does n't interfere with my view . I also do not extend them very far . The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate . Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it 's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil . Then do not over tighten these screws . They do n't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later . If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off , finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need . I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching . Also , when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar , grip the base ( the part with the internal threads ) with a vise-grip or something ( not too tight to crush it ) , then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom , and then screw the bolt into the base ( and through the aluminum slide bar ) nice and tight without letting the base turn . You 'll notice there are & # 34 ; teeth & # 34 ; on the bottom of the base . These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt . They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror . This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel . You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little . It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent . It 's not a big deal and you 'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors . It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside . Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely . Releasing the ratchet is another matter . It 's too tight to just push it down with your finger . To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle . Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab . I use my body leverage ( knees and back ) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab . You do n't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door . Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you 're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you 're adjusting the belt , place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far , if at all . And , yes , make sure there is n't any dirt behind the buckle or you 'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle . The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window . After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting ( scratching ) the window as you raise it . Once you 're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also . I 've taken these off and on several times now and we 've travelled with them and I 've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck , the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door . The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual . It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom . I do n't see this as a problem . The mirrors are not on there all the time and , even if they were , I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing . Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good , too . Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin . I 've tried to supplement here with my own experience .	1
These mirrors are the best that I have found for towing a travel trailer . They are easily installed and they do not vibrate at all . The field of view is goodsnd When not towing a trailer , they are easily removed for storage .	1
I loved these for my Honda Odyssey minivan . Easy to use and install . Very well built . I would easily recommend these !	1
They whistle while they work ! But only sometimes ( whistle that is ) . I only use them a couple times a year on an Expedition , economical .	1
As long as you take the time to make sure all adjustments are initially done correctly they are a breeze to install and take off . You must make sure that the feet are adjusted properly . I made marks on my factory mirrors so that I install them in the same spot every time . Once installed make sure the straps are as tight as you can get them . I have had little or no trouble with vibration . Anytime you hang something on a mirror that was n't intended to have something hanging there and then go down a not so smooth road you are going to get some vibration . I do n't care who makes it . This design was well thought out and works great on our 07 Jeep Wrangler . At speeds up to 75 mph I have very little movement to none . The only time I get any vibration or movement is at expansion joints or rough roads . To sum it all up I would make this purchase again and would recommend it to others who have the same type of factory mirrors as mine . I think that they would work for most applications as long as you take the time to adjust them properly .	1
these work great and are easy to put on and take off ; I had to modify the lower clip to conform to the mirror on a F-150 but it was easy and I recommend these mirrows to anyone who has a pair of pliers and a little do-it-yourself tallent for the F-150 2012 model	1
extremely versatile . the conical end pulls outward and functions as a ratchet , cranking the straps/clips taught . A few minutes of one-time configuration/setup is needed and future mount/removals are accomplished in seconds . The only reason i did n't give these a 5 star rating is the small foam discs tend to come off the mounting bases periodically ( they press against the outside of your existing mirror ) . Thoughtfully , the vendor includes extras . All in all , a very unique and functional product !	1
After arriving , it slipped onto our 2013 Highlander just fine , and tightened up and was able to be adjustable pretty well . Still I decided to & # 34 ; add & # 34 ; an additional strap that mounted to the two front feet to help hold it tighter at those points just for my own concerns about possible moving at higher speeds on the interstate . By adding the straps I did realize a more stable fit to the shape of our Highlander mirror . I talked to another camper who was using the same model and he did n't find any need or desire to modify his set whatsoever , and like them just fine .	1
Great replacement for a rearview mirror . Big for a large car perfect size . I dont know how night mode works or whatever but for sure its just a normal rearview mirrors	1
It is clear and the flip thing works fine . It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly . It does come with a mount for you to use , just no glue . But , as I said , it fit my old one with no problems at all .	1
Needed to replace a broken mirror . This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield . It has a lock-screw to hold it in place . If you need to replace the metal holder , it is included but no glue is supplied . Overall , it is a perfectly fine basic mirror .	1
Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck . I like this one . Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality .	1
product was just as described a prefect fit easy to install a lot cheaper than part stores would buy this prouct again	1
I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by . It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well .	1
Cheap , but huge ! Love it ! I will never have a vehicle without these again ! I highly recommend them . I 'm watching The Rock right now . I had to type 20 words .	1
These are great mirrors ! They do not seem much bigger than the round ones but they do give a better image . Be careful about placement though because they have a tilt to them unlike the round ones you will find at your local auto store .	1
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot . I had to order via Amazon since I could n't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size . These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well .	1
We have an SUV . I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors , there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them . This presents a problem when backing up as you can not see the curbs clearly . So this helps a lot . The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb . These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes , you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders . Great mirrors and to this day , they remain clear . I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan .	1
Thought I 'd find a use for this on both rear view mirrors , was mistaken . Still the convex surface allows for a really good viewing angle at a really cheap price so I have no complaints .	1
I used to have the round mirror . After getting a new SUV i decided to shop immediately on amazon for a new blind spot mirror and i found this.I decided to try this product based on user review and did the right thing . These mirrors are perfect for my Outlander 2011 side mirrors . I like the shape and very clear mirrors . Although i should have gotten the 3x3 but still this 2x2 works . Just make sure you purchase 2 . Since this is not sold in pair ... I had this mistake thinking it was sold in pair.. good think i got Amazon prime :	1
I use this mirror in the office to see if there is anyone coming to my desk . I sit with my back to the aisle and I was startled many times by people who 'd stand behind me and snoop on my computer activities.I attached this mirror to the upper left corner of my monitor using the douple sided tape that was pre-attached to the mirror 's back , and secured it additionally with a couple of Scotch tape strips . Now with my periferal vision I notice if there is a reflection change in the mirror , and I will be aware if anyone is approaching my desk .	1
I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides . This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view . You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference . Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20 % of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area . I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur . I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife . Also try on different spots of the existing mirror , before removing the adhesive covering , to determine the best location . If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade . Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking . Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror .	1
Cheap plastice mirrow for watching your blind spont . Better than the round type , this one wasnt all bad .	1
A little pricy for the spray but it does what it is supposed to do well and instead of throwing out filters you can reuse them a few times depending on the condition . I normally clean it two times than toss it out .	1
Like others have said here this aerosol bottle makes oiling your cotton/oil filters very easy . Controlling the amount and evenness of oil is very easy .	1
I 've been using K & N Filters in my cars since I was about 20 or so . It 's truly amazing the amount of particulate they catch , and this oil is a huge part of that process . I find it heaps easier to buy a can every now and then through amazon , instead of hunting it down at the local auto parts store , who may or may not have it , depending on any number of ridiculous things .	1
Works excellent ! Get the Aerosol over the liquid if you have the pod style filter or flat corrugated style for sure . It spays nice and even . I have used them both , the spray , and the liquid and the spray is the way to go for these . If you do have the older all foam style filters then get the liquid ( squirt/pour kit or bottle ) it will last you longer .	1
I highly recommend this product for when you want to re-oil your K & N or any brand of high perf air filter whether it be cone or panel . Not as much waste , easier to apply than the squirt bottle type .	1
fast shipping and a good price . I bought this and the cleaner separately instead of the combo kit because I think you get more for your money this way . Oil was easy to apply ( best used outside for aeration purposes ) . Never buy a air filter again .	1
Needed more oil for my filter and needed to get to 25 dollars for the free shipping so a win win for me	1
This is a good size to buy and is enough oil to service a filter several times . The K & N oil has red dye in it so you can see when you have achieved full coverage . Great filters that when maintained , one filter will last as long as the car will last . Catches dirt better than the paper filters . The K & N filter gave my truck a slight increase in acceleration . When I removed a new clean paper Fram filter and put the K & N in , I took it for a road test . On a dry asphalt road , straight line acceleration from a stop , my truck broke the tires loose every time . Put the Fram back in as a test and it was again not quite able to do it . Put the K & N back in and again it was able to break the tires loose every time . Never quite had enough power to do that before . Not a huge difference but a difference none the less . When you clean your K & N be sure NOT to use hot water while cleaning . Hot water can make the filter shrink in places , causing it to become uneven . After cleaning and recoating with the oil . Mine still looks just like a new one . I put the K & N in while the truck was almost brand new and now it has 234,000 miles on it in 13 years . Same air filter and the engine has never been apart . The engine absolutely has wear , but no smoke yet and still runs good .	1
I have two K & N air filters for each car , and truck I own . Put on a clean one . Wash the dirty one . Better gas mileage . no more to buy . SW	1
This oil is just right for the renewal of your filter and should be used instead of SAE 30 alone . It adheres better and as packaged is much easier to apply than sticking it and the filter in a bag and mushing it around . It also uses less oil and gives precise coverage . Oil your filter and get better air flow and better particle removal at the same time.You might be able to keep uncle Phil away from when you are grilling if you waft a little bit of it his way on approach , too , but maybe you should n't do that .	1
For around 20 dollars for 2 cans of KN air filter oil this will last for a long time since you only need to recharge the filters ever 30-50 thousand miles . Shipping and handling was quick and smooth and the products were in great condition .	1
I much prefer this version to the pump version . It 's nice and easy to just use the self propelled spray to re oil the filter . Nice that it 's bigger than the one that comes in the kit too .	1
I normally use the smaller recharge kit ( white bottle ) but since i ran out , I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match . I used it on a k & n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner , it did not completely remove the oil , so it is hard to say I 'm 100 % satisfied . I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter . Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be , but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it wo n't be for a while . Since i do n't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular ( non synthetic ) k & n filter cleaner , if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that . In this case the problem could be the filter , I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters . Time will tell	1
I started out with the `` kit '' ( cleaner & oil ) for my K & N . It just seems that the oil lasted longer than the cleaner , especially if your filters get really dirty and you have to clean a second time . The 32 oz . may cost as much as the kit , but it also has 4x the amount of cleaner in the spay bottle . The larger spray bottle has a larger dispersal sprayer than the one in the kit , so it takes less time to spray down your filter .	1
I 've used this product many times in the past but each time I did it was the small bottle included with the filter that I used . This stuff is exactly the same as the smaller bottle and therefore works the same , which is to say very well . You spray it on the filter , let it sit for 10 minutes or so and rinse with water . There are two benefits to the larger bottle . First is that it is more economical . I have four vehicles with cotton oiled air filters and this bottle should last a fairly long time . Also , it is much easier to spray into the filter than with the smaller bottle . I also feel because it is easier to spray and direct you will use a little less cleaner your filter which should make it an even better value yet .	1
I have a filter in my car and my wife 's car - this cleans them perfectly and is so much easier to spray than the bottle that came with the original cleaning kit .	1
This can be used to clean so many things . When I cleaned my air filter and then rinsed it , I now have a very clean spot on my front sidewalk . I 've used it with much success cleaning up old oil spills in the garage and cleaning window screens on the house . Highly recommended for the air filter cleaning but has many other uses as noted on the product label .	1
fast shipping and a good price . I bought the 32oz cleaner and the 12.25oz oil aerosol separately instead of the combo kit , better value that way , you get more for your money . Havnt used the oil yet im waiting for the filter to completely dry over night before I spray it with the oil . The cleaner worked GREAT just spray it on wait 10 min . and rinse with the hose , filter looks brand new . Il spay it with the oil tomorrow and Im good to go !	1
Does a great job cleaning grime that collects on KN filters for my truck and twin intakes on G37s . Less than 10 minutes of soaking and it removes the old oil and dirt . Rinse with water and blow dry with a hair dryer or even a leaf blower and your ready to reapply new oil that allows the flow through fabric to filter out fast flowing intake .	1
The bottle does not match the picture on Amazon ... FYI My bottle rec 'd was black ... .other than that , I was pretty pleased with the product , worked well cleaning my JWT pop charger filter . ***edit*** Amazon has since updated the picture .	1
This cleans all filth on dirty filters with ease . I need to look for a bigger bottle of this stuff	1
This 32 ounce is much cheaper in the long run than the kit with it 's little bottle of cleaner . Most people use more of the cleaner than the oil . One properly serviced K & N filter will last as long as the car will last . I have never had to replace a K & N filter . Just clean , air dry with a fan , recoat the filter fabric with the oil and a thin film of K & N grease on the seal . The oil has a red dye in it , so you will know when you have full coverage . The K & N filters catch dirt better than any of the paper filters .	1
All my cars have K & N air filter cleaning systems . I got two filters per car . I use one and clean the change out . Better gas mileage . SW	1
I feel like I could probably get away with dish soap and water but this is so cheap/long lasting that I do n't find it worth the risk/reward to find out .	1
Shipped in two days , great product , cleans and treats your K & N Air Filter . I use K & N filters on both my diesels and being able to clean and service them keeps my engines running great !	1
It 's what the company recommends and most people do n't want to experiment with other products to see IF they work or not and take a chance on ruining their expensive filter .	1
I used this on a car with 2 year old K & N ; filter . The car was n't driven much , but I thought I clean it anyway . It 's really easy . Spray on cleaner , wait 10 minutes , then spray with water . Dry , then spray on the red oil . Much easier using oil spray instead of the other type.My car has 2 K & N ; air filters , and I used 2/3 of both cleaners and oil spray . So I can use this kit for one more . However I was more than generous ( or spray-happy ) . I 'm sure I could 've easily use this kit on two filters twice ( 4 total ) , instead of 3 filters .	1
Been using K & N filters and this service kit for years . Best way to save money on air filters . Buy this as soon as you get your car and you will never need another filter again .	1
This is an K and N recharge kit with the Aerosol not the pour out style that works easier for the user . Great buy for less than what you would pay any where else for the same stuff . Well worth the price and shipping and receiving were simple and super fast . Thanks again Amazon .	1
Bottles were bigger than expected ( like pledge bottle size but a little fatter ) . The box was strong and in good shape . Products came on time ( surprised with UPS lol ) . Wally World wanted same price for smaller ones . I would buy again . What you see in picture is what you get ( aside from the K and N box ) .	1
Do not purchase other brand recharger kits . They are inferior oils used with them . This kit is by far better than any other recharger kits out there .	1
Does what it exactly is suppose to do . One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried , the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use . Would recommend	1
Washed the filter on a Friday evening and the filter was dry Saturday evening . Sprayed on the oil on Sunday afternoon . Very easy to do on a 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Diesel . My main concern with the dealer doing it was that they might not have let the filter dry completely before re-oiling it . How would I have ever known if it were done correctly ? They said it would take about an hour . I do n't know how the filter could have ever dried & # 34 ; naturally & # 34 ; as is required by K & N , in only one hour . I 'm glad I did it myself and I bet you will be too . This kit will probably last for at least three recharges .	1
Best I can tell it works . When I clean a filter it 's collected a lot of junk but the cleaning solution gets it good and clean .	1
well this stuff works . i had some gunk clogging up my fram airhog filter so i used this k & n stuff . had to let it sit for a good 10-15 minutes twice . now my FRAM filter is good as new . by the way , the fram air-hog is a washable filter .	1
My car and truck were both really running like crap ... figured it was time to wash and recharge the filter . I sprayed it with their , basically soapy water , and waited a while as the bugs and gravel dust was loosened , and then rinsed it in the sink until clear . I let it dry in the sun for a few hours while I found something else to do , then sprayed the oil as if I were spray painting something ... follow the instructions , do n't want too much oil , do n't want too little either . My Neon does n't care if I over oil it , but my truck has a mass airflow sensor , it does care ... it cares a lot ! Under-oiling it causes the fine mist of gravel dust through the filter , too much clogs it quickly and I guess that 's better than it going into the engine but the MAF Sensor gets coated with the oil and that will cause performance issues that the filter may have given you . It 's a fine balance !	1
This is my second one of these . I have been using K & N products on my cars for about 10 years and this kit cleans them well . I usually clean my filter every 25,000 miles or so . The kit lasts about 3 or 4 cleanings .	1
The kit cleans and treats the filter to keel it working as it should . Not much else to say about it .	1
The oil is what you really need . The cleaner is n't anything special , at least I ca n't tell any real difference from cleaners like Fantastic . But my air filter was n't too dirty .	1
This cleaner and oilier work great and restore the filter to like new condition just make sure you do n't use a lot of oil because it will cause problems with the MAF sensor or even foul spark plugs in extreme cases .	1
You need this to keep your K & N filters in top condition , hopefully it will also work for Fram AirHog filters , as the Fram cleaner kit is much harder to find !	1
OEM from K & N ... I have not used it yet but it is just the same as you can purchase anywhere else for the premium price . I am new to K & N air filters so I will provide additional feedback if I find it does not work as advertised later on ...	1
This product I 've used in the past with great results . Better mileage and cost savings .	1
This stuff has n't changed.The forumla and process has been around for ages , and works the same each time.My motorcyles air filter is very exposed due to the hypercharger , and it needed cleaned stat.Ordered this kit and washed , cleaned , oiled , and dried to perfection.Order yours today !	1
The power cleaner cleans well and sprays well , and the oil sprays nice and evenly . I just washed my filter in the sink ... probably should n't have , but I did .	1
If you have the rechargable air filter , this is a must to clean and re-oil the filter . IMHO you ca n't go wrong with K & N products .	1
Buy this if you have any K & N ; filters . The only thing you have to be careful is that you do n't spray TOO MUCH recharge fluid on the filter after you 've cleaned it.Apparently I put too much and it made my MAF sensor to malfunction causing a CEL and dangerous engine stalls on the highway . I had to replace my MAF sensor ( not cheap ! ) and went back to a plain paper filter for now until I learn to recharge the K & N ; with the correct amount of fluid .	1
For my ATV I purchased the K & N air filter . My old foam type needed to be replaced . After using the K & N filter ( which works better - both performance and cleaner ) I needed to wash and re oil the filter . Since it 's a K & N I wanted to use the K & N `` recharge kit '' which is designed for this filter . It was fast to clean and re oil unlike my foam type which took 2 days to dry out completely . I do live in the desert , but it only took about 3 hours to completely dry then I could re oil the K & N air filter . Note that if you do use the K & N air filters , be careful not to over oil them . I know some of my friends have had problems with the fuel injected systems that the mass air flow sensor fails if oil get on them . I do n't have this problem because my ATV 's engine is carbureted . I have carefully checked to make sure this air filter does keep the air clean , and found that it does . It 's easy to see when you need to clean them . Just look to see if the red oil is changing to brown . I clean mine every 2 trips which I put almost 50 miles per trip in the dirt ( which does get very dusty ) . Should you get a K & N Air Filter , buy this kit too .	1
This cleaner and oil works great . I recently purchased a motorcycle which already had a K & N ; filter in it , however it was extremely dirty from debris and soot . This stuff cleaned it to look like new and I 'm glad I only had to buy cleaner rather than a whole new filter.I put K & N ; filters on all of my vehicles , so this is a worthwhile purchase to be able to clean all of them without worries .	1
I like this product and would buy it again and again , very well made and saved me a lot of money .	1
Having K & N in all my cars , you got ta have it . It 's not used much , but I clean the filters every six months . Works well !	1
I purchased K & N filters for my cars and this cleaner cleans filter very well . Make sure you lay filter on top of paper towels to absorb excess oil . This will keep your MAF sensor from getting dirty with K & N Oil	1
This was 10 bucks cheaper at Amazon vs a local auto parts store . If you use it properly and service your air filter as you should , you will not go wrong with this product .	1
Kit comes with cleaning spray and recharger oil . Easy instructions . It just takes time and patience for the filter to dry after washing . You also need to plan ahead or drop a temporary air filter in your car in the time being when you are re-oiling your filter .	1
Personally I love the spray can vs other bottle . Have used this set for years and i love it.Sometimes i worry about it being too wet ..	1
Cleaned my filter out very easily.Can be a little messy but that 's the nature of the beast . Just plan to put some newspaper down or lean it against a fence after you spray it while its working . Brought back that new purple filter color fast.Must have for an K & N ; owner .	1
I have a K & N ; filter on my G35 's cold air intake as well as on my truck , and have always use this to clean and re-oil it.It really works well . The cleaning solution really breaks down the oil allowing it to be rinsed off fairly easily and t he aerosol can makes re-oiling a breeze.The only issue I have is I ALWAYS run out of cleaning solution before I run out of the air filter oil . Granted , this may be a good thing as it prevents you from finishing cleaning off your filter then realizing you have no oil to re-oil it , which would leave you in a tight spot if you need your car to work and you ca n't get more filter oil quickly.So , even though I complain about that , it 's really being picky .	1
It cleans all the K & N filter products nicely and restores them to a like new luster . Have yet to clean my 6 month old filter in my Civic Si , have used it regularly on the YZ250F	1
I used this on my wifes 06 corolla I also have K & N filters in our motorcycles and my truck . I 've used this product for years to clean all sorts of reusable filters from foam to fabric . Works great and I like that the cleaning solution is relatively un-offensive meaning that you can use it in the kitchen before rinsing the filter . Good stuff , ca n't go wrong with K & N products .	1
Use this product to recharge your K & N air filter . I do n't know of any other product I could use to recharge my filter .	1
handy little kit to keep the filters running good . simple directions and easy to clean . this is a must for anyone using these cold air filters	1
This is amazing stuff . This is great stuff . Pull the filter out of my 2013 Jeep and within min it was clean . Love it .	1
Some of the other reviewers here prefer the aerosol , but I think the squeeze bottle is just fine for re-oiling a cleaned filter . I do n't know what everyone is complaining about . This is something that 's good to do while you have some yardwork or some reason to be outside since the filter needs to sit for about 15-20 minutes during the cleaning/oiling process.In the long run , if you keep your car long enough , one K & N ; filter is cheaper than all of those disposables .	1
this is the cleaner and oil for kn , what more do you want ? finger will hurt after using the spray bottle , so pony up more for the regular hand sprayer or aerosol type or even put the cleaner in a hand sprayer yourself . Be innovative people..	1
This is a must for anyone who has a K & N filter . Use cleaner to clean out filter , dry and then oil and ready to go .	1
The kit makes cleaning the K & N filters so much easier and cuts through the grease and grime better then average soaps without leaving a residue behind .	1
Have used this before but was having a hard time finding it . Excellent product , the only thing you have to be careful about is not putting to much oil on after you clean it . You will have a mess every time you ride if you do . Expect a little spray going down the road but it stops soon .	1
in the end I 'll get the aerosol oil spray . with a large filter , it 's a pain to go lubing it rib by rib with this method . It 's efficient in not wasting oil , but still a pain . good product however.the oil in here was good enough for me to lube the K & N ; in my cherokee , z06 , and harley .	1
The K & N ; 99-5050 Filter Service Kit is all you need to keep your K & N ; patented High-Performance air filter clean and performing at maximum efficiency.I have used K & N ; Air Filters in my personal vehicles and also in my off-road competition vehicles for over 30 years -- with excellent results and superior performance in every instance , including better fuel mileage.The K & N ; Air Filters should be serviced at approximately 25,000 miles -- - they actually work just as well when they `` look dirty '' , and they must be REALLY NASTY before the efficiency drops off.Take your time with the `` Squeeze-Bottle '' kit , and do EXACTLY as instructed -- your reward will be a cleaner-running engine that delivers all the power and efficiency that was built into it ! ! K & N ; filters are proudly `` Made in the USA '' -- and known around the world as the finest filters that can be had at ANY price ! ! Amazon 's speedy delivery is the icing on the cake ! !	1
This Cleaner & Red Oil are needed for the K & N Filters . Works extremely well . The purchase will do two applications covering three years for me .	1
Amazon provides a hard to find cleaning kit for the K & N auto air filters . Directions that come with the kit are a helpful reminder . There is enough Cleaner solvent and Oil for more than one cleaning . so it is an effective way to have clean filter for better fuel mileage w/o having to go out and find an OEM replacement	1
this stuff cleaned my intake filter like a charm ! next time i will buy an aerosol version though as this one is kind of dirty to use : )	1
What can you say about an accessory to service a K & N air filter ? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter . I have only used it once before , but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now . Actually , if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit , please comment and let me know .	1
K & N ; Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze BottleI bought the squeeze bottle version of the kit because I had heard the aerosol spray was difficult to meter accurately . I 'm here to say that the squeeze bottle is n't a perfect solution either . I had to oil the Ducati Performance air filter for my 696 , which is just a basic cylindrical filter except the `` dirty '' air comes in from the inside out . A typical conical filter on a car has the dirt collecting on the outside . The airbox on the 696 is set up so the dirt comes from the inside of the filter . This made it extremely difficult to oil properly.On a car filter , oiling the pleats evenly takes a lot of time and excess oil still tends to seep out . It takes some practice , time , and patience - probably a second filter does n't hurt either.Overall : 4/5 stars , still difficult to oil the filter uniformly but easier to control versus the aerosol spray	1
I only wish that the oil was sold separately . I do n't like the cleaner soap provided . The K & N filter system is a great idea for saving money if you plan to keep a vehicle long term . I have never seen a performance improvement verses a & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; factory paper filter but this one is cleanable and if properly oiled will protect your engine the same as a paper one .	1
I got this kit never having used a lifetime air filter before and not sure what to think of it . Man , does it give you peace of mind to know you do n't have to find a new one every few months . Just pull it out , clean it , re-oil it and good to go .	1
I have K & N filters on all my cars and I needed this recharge kit to clean and keep my cars running smooth . This kit worked great and looking forward in keeping my air filters clean with this kit .	1
One of these kits will last you for your entire life . Anybody using K & N ; air filter MUST buy this as it 's the essential way to keep it lasting the life of your car . A+Cheers	1
This what you should do instead buying new filters . The cleaning steps are very easy and also when applying the oil on the filter	1
Works like it is supposed to . I do n't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil , as both work . The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle . I 've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat , which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is `` supposed '' to have , so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would . Good price on Amazon for the kit !	1
Does the job well . Comes with easy to understand instructions.Takes less than half an hour to do the job .	1
Used this before & it cleans good . You do n't need to over do it with the oil . Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying .	1
This kit made my 5-year-old K & N filter look like new . And it took only a few minutes with very little effort .	1
Use this for my K & N Air Filter for my Nissan Titan . Got a few more horse out because of the K & N . Oil filters good too .	1
Like I said in the title of this review what more can I say these product are far superior to anything else out there in the market as far as filters go they are number 1 in my book . The kit comes with enough product for at least 2 cleanings even if you have the large filter just use the product according to the instructions and you are good to go . Also let the filter dry COMPLETELY before putting the ol back on the filter .	1
Easy to hook up and nice and loud . I mount them on mobility power chairs and scooters since the original horns are not loud enough to hear from more then two feet away	1
I admittedly did n't see the sound byte of the horn until now , and if I had heard it earlier , I would have thought differently . I installed this to have a lower , and hopefully louder tone in my horn . The factory horn was lower though . I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now , so on an Isuzu Trooper , it is a little pathetic . I blame this on myself though , and I realize the product is good for its intended audience . Just do n't buy this if you havea truck ! The look of this horn , if you have it visible , is a plus , and the shipping and installation were a breeze .	1
If I wanted a SILVER colored horn like in the picture I supplied , I would have bought one of those . There are many of them for less than this.Fake ! I am obviously upset . ** UPDATE ** : So , it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this . I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store . It was black with the red stripe , and I bought it . Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand . So , I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item . I never thought to check that it was the right brand , though.I have updated my star rating to 4 . Ca n't find myself able to give it 5 .	1
Thought I have n't officially used it much , it 's still working . It 's consistent , responsive , and loud enough but I thought it would be louder ( 10 more decibels would have been 5 stars ) .	1
These lights are very bright and have a excellent warranty . They work great on the A post of jeep wranglers . They are very easy to install great directions and guides . These are very good off road light .	1
What 's to say..they are BRIGHT , and do n't take up a lot of space ... simple mounting , easy install , and they work when when I hit the switch ... Only think I do n't like is that the & # 34 ; KC & # 34 ; is in white ... ended up taking a palm sander to get rid of the white paint to give it a & # 34 ; blacked-out & # 34 ; look	1
the lights look good they were easy to install and work great . you can light up any area you see fit	1
Again , miles of wire , easy instructions , everything you need for an install . The SlimLites are great as they take up lees room . The tucked behind my grill !	1
These KC & # 8217 ; s light up dark & lonely places with brilliant , far reaching , white light even better than I had imagined they would . Install was easy on my & # 8217 ; 11 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets . The switch works great & adjustment of the beams was easy & positive with a 14mm wrench for the horizontal & a 13mm socket & extension for the vertical . Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light . Nice product !	1
Put these on my Jeep and they throw the light a great distance . The included wiring harness is great and makes install a breeze . The lens protectors are chunky and protect well without blocking light .	1
Looked at a lot of lights and settled on these . They perform great and ca n't beat the warranty . Only problem I have had are they are hard to get locked down once I have them aimed .	1
Snaps on easy , durable , has n't melted yet . It 's rated to withstand the 130 watt bulbs , so I doubt I 'll have any problems , and if so , 23 year warranty will cover it . They look nicer than bare lights , but do block and dim the lights somewhat so I 'll take them off when driving at night .	1
I have my daylighters mounted near the side pillars of my pickup and these guards clean up the look nicely . It also cuts down on the glare that shines onto the hood from my mounting location . I cant tell a huge difference on light output , so that is a plus . They lock on so secure that I have actually cut my hand on them trying to get them off . Wont lose them on the trail and its a nice deterrent to anyone looking to walk by and just pull it off to walk off with it .	1
I do n't think KC 's look right unless they have these ... .so pick them up ! Easy snap on part , and they look even better if you spray them all black .	1
I like them - YES the KC is bigger now than it was on older models of the guards IT IS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE and I LIKE IT.They provide some protection - not a lot but they do look good.I actually saw another set of these today on a Toyota FJ and thought how good they looked on the black lights they had . Then I saw a CJ with the old style ( there were aged ) the KC was smaller and the guards were holding up well after the years of use it was obvious they had .	1
The & # 34 ; KC HiLiTES 7210 Black ABS 6 & # 34 ; Stone Guard & # 34 ; fit as stated and they look good and I am thinking about buy ing another set of KC Light 's and the Covers as well . Delivery was fast and no damage to the product .	1
I bought these to keep from having to remove the ugly yellow smiley face ones before turning on my daylighters . They fit my 6 & # 34 ; daylighters perfectly and clip on solidly.All KC products are high quality , could not believe they give a 23 year warranty on their line of lights !	1
This is perfect for those times when you are not able to reach the small handle on your camper from the manufacturer or have someone that has a hard time using the stairs . It is really easy to install and even easier to use . A great product .	1
It is always nice when a product shows up and turns out to be better than you thought . This is higher quality than I expected for the price.Easy enough to install . Only issue for me is that the screws go all the way through the wall . Just barely mind you but never the less . They are in a spot where nobody will come in contact with the points and I will likely just take the screws out , put a washer in to act a spacer and then there will be no screw points sticking out .	1
Woo-hoo ! I love these things . I put two on my 2004 trailer , and am really glad I did ! Really makes coming down stairs a whole lot more secure . These are super simple to install , with just four screws total . And , they fold in either direction when towing , meaning that if you 've got an awning assembly near your door , you can fold these closed over the door ( s ) ! And , they make your rig look like a movie star trailer ( no fooling , someone said that to me ) !	1
Same handle and grip as the & # 34 ; older & # 34 ; unit on our 2003 Bigfoot truck camper , but the mounting base-plate has changed and would have required drilling new holes in the camper . Luckily , I was able to disassemble the new unit and utilize the old base-plate and the old bolts that hold the handle to the base-plate . The new unit utilizes a pin and friction washer to hold the handle to the base-plate . Had to destroy the friction washer to remove the pin and separate the new handle from the base unit . Then it was just a matter of attaching it to the old base-plate with the old hardware . The foam grip on the handle lasted for ten years on the old one , hopefully this one will last as long ! Did not give it a five star since they 've changed their base-plate mounting system from what they were using ten years ago .	1
Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job . I use the leather conditioner on the leather in my almost 4 year old car , as well as an old comfy leather arm chair . I put the product on the leather , wait a few minutes for it to get absorbed a bit , and then use a micro fiber towel to clean off . The Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job in cleaning and softening the leather.The price on the conditioner in the last twelve month ranged from $ 11.24 to $ 7.99 , so the price as I write this review is very good . Note on price research : I found a very helpful tool that shows me the history of Amazon prices , you can find it by searching from Amazon price history and pick the one with the camel in the name . I find it very helpful.A quick note on the spray vs cream packaging . In the past I have used leather conditioning creams , so I bought the spray to compare how it would work . I have to say that overall I like the conditioning cream better because I have more control over where the product is applied . This especially the case when I work inside of the home on my leather chair . When I get to the edges I have to be careful not to over spray .	1
I have just bought this product after using some of the cheaper ( $ 6 ) leather conditioners for a while . This one certainly seems to be the best at rejuvenating leather . You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it , which you do n't notice with other conditioners , and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry , cracked creases . I have just got a `` new '' used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they do n't go the same way . I have to admit I 've neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup 's tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places . They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution . This is a pretty harsh technique , but effective , apart from in the deepest creases . It did seem to take the shine off the leather , which was a worry . Using the Lexol conditioner , letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth , the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple . It will never return to its `` new '' state , but it should last a few more years with regular applications ( not sure but maybe every 3-4 months ? ) . It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing , but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen ( not a false shine ) appears.On my minivan , the leather came up like it was just new . It smells good too ! I bought this product at my local Advance Auto ( sorry Amazon ! ) and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $ 3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather , not just put a protectant shine on the surface . I 'm always sceptical about product claims ( since they usually exaggerate performance ) , but this one seems to be the real deal.Try it.UPDATE ( Dec 3 2009 ) : The stiff leather has certainly become more supple after applying this product - it works really well !	1
Auto detail shops use this product that says a lot . Also I used it on my leather couch and it looks like new . I had some very badly dried areas and it took care of them . Make sure you use the cleaner first especially on older items . On new things it probably is n't necessary but if you have it use it anyway . Use clean cotton cloths and follow the directions .	1
Its a great leather conditioner , I use it all the time i highly recommend this product . I am pleased with the ongoing results on my leather car seats . Unfortunately i did not use this from amazon , because of the poor packaging , it leaked all over the place .	1
I used this after the Lexol cleaner , and it did a terrific job on our seats . It was easy to apply , and when buffed out , the material looked great .	1
I have been using this product for several years on my leather products and highly recommend it . I have an 2004 Chevy PU with 1/4 million miles and the leather seats are still in great shape , most pickup I see with leather have holes worn through from lack of care . I use it on my cars and leather furniture as well with the Lexol cleaner to preserver the life of the leather .	1
I bought this with the leather cleaner . I found it to be very good , but you have to wait for it to dry , which takes about a day . It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought . I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run , but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in . So in the long run , this is a great option .	1
Decades ago during high school and surfing , custom sandles were the thing . Bought a nice pair and shoe maker recommended Lexol . Fifty years ? Ok those sandles are gone but ... ..Used it ever since on shoes , chairs , jackets , and any other leather . Inherited a two hundred year old leather book . Lexol ! Amazing difference.Motorcycle friend had old ( 10 yr ) favorite leather jacket , think he said $ 600 , looked poor . Couple doses of Lexol and once again re-incarnation proven true . He was happy.Oh yes , do n't forget your wallet . My Dooney is ten years old and looking better than me.Wonder if it works on `` live '' leather ? Addendum : For years I did not use cleaner then I tried some and now appreciate it 's benefits . My car seats definitely need Lexol Cleaner , orange bottle , first . They are darker from rubbed on grime over months of body pressure.Cleaning brightens colors AND ADDS MOISTURE . By cleaning first you remove old oils mixed with dirt when that is removed the conditioner penetrates deeper and faster . Cleaner does not work like normal soap or deterent it cleans and restores and primes leather for conditioner . Just give it a try.Its a hassle and extra work but the result is obviously better . It might even be possible to use cleaner without conditoner the cleaner moisturizes too but conditioner seams to seal the surface after it dries unlike the cleaner . You will be surprised how much dirt is on the cloth after cleaning . I change cloths positions to use new clean areas as dirt is removed . A little cleaner goes a long ways , Chairs can get quite dirty from body oils I guess .	1
This stuff is a very good conditioner for your boots and other leather products . It was recommended to me by the local shoe repair guy . I 'm very happy with it . I would definitely buy it again . It does seem to last for a while .	1
Updated January 20 , 2013I use this product on my Flexsteel leather couch , a high-quality couch . It 's a super long couch because it is actually two loveseats assembled together . Each loveseat has an arm , one left and the other right . Putting them together makes it one giant piece . It 's a lot of leather and that 's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected . It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application , but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time . You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable . The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine actually . Ultimately , this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer . In the meantime , it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it . If you have an expensive piece , most likely there wo n't be instructions for this . That 's because the manufacturer does n't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use . The retail representatives that I questioned did n't know anything about treating leather.Lexol works just fine on an expensive leather couch as my experience continues to show . This large container goes far . I would not waste money on small highly-branded boutique products when in my experience this product has worked perfectly on very good leather .	1
Friend of mine who works with leather every single day told me a few options of products in order to care my car leather seats , I pic this brand of the options he gave me .. and so far I 'm well pleased .	1
The leather sofa , love seat , chair and ottoman were faded and looking rough . One bottle of Lexol restored them to new condition . I cleaned some worn and stained areas with a good saddle soap with a day to dry . Then in one day I was able to go over the furniture with one coat . Use a dish sponge with the blue scrubber top . Use the sponge part , not the scrubber . The scrubber worked well with saddle soap to clean.Let dry for a day . Repeat . Expect the leather to darken . The white stains are curing salts that have worked their way out of the leather . They melt with the Lexol and return into the leather.The result is a buttery soft leather that looks great .	1
I applied this based on other users responses . It seemed to soften the leather . I will see how it goes with continued usage	1
The Lexol Leather conditioner contains special oils that rejuvenates and softens leather surfaces . It is easy to use and the instructions on the bottle provide the optimal application method . I have a leather wrapped steering wheel that has grown stiff due to its exposure to dry summer heat over the years . I had been using Black Magic 's Leather Conditioner/Cleaner combo and some other OTC products without much success . The Lexol pH cleaner worked well to clean the leather , and the conditioner was just amazing . It turned the leather almost brand new and all of the creases were soft again . I recommend using a terry cloth or cotton cloth to apply it onto surfaces . The Lexol conditioner is an amber liquid that is only slightly more viscous than water and has a unique smell.Pros : Very easy to use , and works as advertised . It should be the only leather conditioner you use - the over the counter stuff does n't work.Cons : Hard to find and expensive , but Amazon carries them at a low price.Overall : If you own any leather accessories or cars with interior leathers , Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditions are must-buy items .	1
My seats are ten years old so I cleaned the and applied this product and it soaks into the leather but does not leave a film .	1
LEXOL IS THE BEST CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET YOU CAN BUY AND AMAZON HAS IT AT THE BEST PRICE , ITS THE BEST CONDITIONER YOU CAN BUY TO KEEP YOUR LEATHER SEATS FROM CRACKING AND LOOKING GREAT IN THE WINTER AND SUMMER MONTHS , AND ALSO WITH THE HEATED SEATS KEEP IT SOFT , SO IT DONT CRACK AND KEEP YOU FROM BUYING NEW SEATS ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHICH GETS WORN MOST TIMES.ALL THE BEST FOR 2013 AMAZON.COM	1
If you have leather seats in your car , this is the stuff you want to use on them . It gives them a silky smooth feel and a nice luster . Easy to apply too . No overwhelming odor like some leather products either . To me it makes my seats smell the way they did when they were new , so I guess the best description would be & # 34 ; new car smell & # 34 ; . As far as using it on any other leather items , I 'm sure it would work great , but you 'd have to take into account the car smell . Not sure you 'd want your leather coat smelling like a car . : ) My only negative quibble is the size of the bottle . It 's huge . It will last for years . It would be nice if they offered it in a smaller size . ( They might have one , but I could n't find it . )	1
Yes . It smells kinda funny . Yeah , if you leave it sitting long enough , you 'll have these fatty looking clumps in the liquid . No , they do n't disappear after shaking . And still , after all those years , that bottle of Lexol conditioner still worked great on my MDX 's leather . Between the Lexol cleaner and this conditioner , the 10 year old car 's leather already looked newer . It ca n't save the glazing the driver 's seat acquired from use , but all the other seats did manage to look like that brand new leather look ; slightly matte , firm , but supple.For the price , I think Lexol conditioner 's great . Leatherique 's conditioner is quite a bit more expensive .	1
I 'm a car freak but not a professional car freak . Maybe one day ... Anyways ... The professional car freaks recommend Lexol . I have been using it for years on my BMW M5 , Honda S2000 , Porsche Boxster S , etc . The seats are still in amazing condition - the M5 is a 2000 model so it 's 12+ years old now and the seats look pristine . And I only use this once a year . If you used it more frequently , results would probably be even better .	1
I mainly got this product for my leather jacket that I haven & # 8217 ; t used in a few years and looked faded and felt stiff . It was so stiff it started to warp and bend that I got worried it would stay that way or get ruined.When applying I used a terry sponge bonnet and as I applied the conditioner to the black jacket inside lining ( testing ) it first came on really wet . I got a little worried but let it sit for two minutes and eventually the leather absorbed it . Before I had applied the conditioner my jacket had a faded almost ashy black and after applying the product it brought out a nice deep rich color and think it looks better than when I first bought it . Plan on using this product on all my leather items .	1
This has to be one of the best leather care products out there . I have used it on my leather coat , car seats and shoes . Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather . Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest , where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time . Would recommend to anyone .	1
Love this product and I love the price . I do n't know how they have such a great product at this price but they do and I love it ! Will buy much more .	1
So far the product is doing what was advertised . I like the conditioning feel I am getting from the leather after application . I will be using this a lot more .	1
As with all lexol products ... excellant quality and serves my needs extremely well . This is by far the best leather conditioner ( for the money ) I have had the pleasure of using ... .I highly recommend all of lexol products .	1
I use this on my leather seats after cleaning them with the Lexol pH leather cleaner . This is a great compliment to the cleaner and finished the perfect leather care in my car . Could n't be happier with it ! Cheers	1
The people who installed the leather on my truck recommended Lexol to clean and condition it . This renews the leather without giving that glossy look you see on some leather . Works very well IMHO .	1
Works well w/o darkening leather . Product suggestes using another cleaner first , this cleans and conditions . I have used on car interior and recliner w/ good results .	1
I have owned an auto detail business for 9 years and this is my go to product for leather protection . It gives nice protection and dries fast . Ca n't go wrong with Lexol products .	1
This and the Lexol Leather cleaner are the best solutions I 've used for my car . However , I 've only tried Lexol and Blue Magic . Blue Magic left the leather feeling a bit dry . However this Lexol gives the leather a good slick feel.The instructions state to apply then let sit for 15 minutes or so then `` wiping off excess '' as necessary . Granted , upon application it feels sticky and a little greasy , and 15 minutes of sitting does n't resolve this so you can wipe down lightly with a dry cloth if you think it will help . However , I found for best results , apply the conditioner then let it sit on the leather for about a day ( two if you can help it ) and do n't wipe down . I know this does n't sound practical for most people but I do think it gives the best results for good feel and well conditioned leather.Use this after cleaning with Lexol leather cleaner or just on it 's own if you think your leather is clean enough . I 've also used this for leather shoes and it gives it a nice shine .	1
I have been useing this product for over 30 years on all my leather products and it is the best product on the market ! ! Amazon has the best price over all . You cant go wrong with Lexol and Amazon ! ! !	1
A liter of this stuff will last you a long time if you do n't have many cars with leather seats . I just bought this for my lambskin leather jacket and my leather gloves . It seems to really soften up the leather . I think my jacket was really & # 34 ; dry & # 34 ; and it felt considerably heavier afterwards . The leather feels much more durable . My gloves are also much more water repellant and do n't absorb water quite so quickly . I have no way of knowing if this is the best product on the market , but nonetheless it 's pretty darned good !	1
The leather conditioner is great , but the price is a bit high for the amount in the bottle I think .	1
I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results . It does need to be applied every few months , but I 've used it on a variety of leather surfaces ( worn leather sofa , dining room chairs with leather padding , office chair ) with excellent results . As long as you do n't apply it too thick , it wo n't leave an oily residue , and it blends into the leather very nicely . I 've gone through the original bottle and a refill , and am about to order another refill.For application , the Lexol sponges work great . They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time .	1
I read with interest many of the other reviews . It seems everyone but myself has heard of this brand . I have been using car leather conditioner bought at the parts store on my truck seats , a couch , and two recliners.The car conditioner worked ok but was expensive and harder to apply.This just floats on with a small cloth ... ... ... I put in on rather heavy since my leather had not been treated for over 6 months.The difference was amazing . My leather returned to it 's new look and after a week I see no evidence of the smooth leather glow going away .	1
Well ... typical of buying things on the internet , it was n't as large as it looks , but it 's still larger than what I 've bought in the past for less money ... so ... .I 'm not griping . I have a great friend in the uphostery business and he swears by it , so I use it .	1
After being in the auto detailing business for awhile and trying a lot of different leather conditioners I can say that this is the best conditioner that I have used . Really softens the leather and gets the leather back to a natural `` off of the factory '' look .	1
I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture . Makes the leather very soft and pliable .	1
I have used this stuff ever since it came out . It 's not messy and does n't stick . Great on Auto upholstery , ( no suede ) . SW	1
This was a good cleaner for Leather . It was so good my daughter borrowed it for her car and I have yet to get it back !	1
I have to say it worked really well . I 'll have to get more when I run out.Pricy , but then again , I would hate to buy something and it does not work.5 Stars	1
This stuff works great ! You should use a little brush and lather it up then wipe it off . Really cleans up the leather !	1
I bought this and the conditioner and I found them to work well . They definitely spruced up my nice older Stressless leather chairs .	1
This is an excellent product that leaves the leather clean and ready to be conditioned . Easy to apply and remove . I was very satisfied with the results .	1
The Lexol pH cleaner worked extremely well to clean automotive leather upholstery and surfaces . Just follow the instructions on the bottle and it does a fantastic job . Always use the pH cleaner before you apply the Lexol conditioner since you do n't want to apply new oils over existing dirt . The pH cleaner comes out as a clear liquid that is more viscous than water . I recommend using a terry cloth sponge to create more lather than just using a cotton cloth or terry cloth . I have tried several over the counter leather cleaner/conditioners and Lexol beats them all.Pros : Cleans leather without drying it . Very easy to use.Cons : The product is a bit expensive and hard to find compared to the over-the-counter products , but it should be the only product to buy and Amazon carries it ! Overall : If you own any leather accessories or cars with leather interiors , Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditioner should be on your list .	1
LEXOL IS THE BEST SRAY FOR CLEANING LEATHER SEATS IN YOU AUTOMOBILE AND KEEPING THEM FROM CRACKING IN THE SUMMER AND WINTER MONTHS , WHILE KEEPINGB THEM MOIST AND PLIABLE AND SOFT , SO I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT LEXOL , TO KEEP THEIR VEHICLE CLEAN.THANKS AGAIN AMAZON.COM.ALL THE BEST FOR 2013	1
A relatively thick , viscous liquid that cleans leather like crazy . You only need just a bit on a wet rag , then it 's off to the races cleaning your leather . I use this on a leather couch , auto upholstery , shoes , boots and a leather jacket.It only cleans , but it does that well . For protection you 'll need something like Lexol Leather Conditioner ( furniture , auto , jacket ) or Nikwax ( shoes and boots ) .A little goes a LONG way , does n't take much to get the cleaning done . One bottle has lasted me several years .	1
I have only used this to clean the leather seats in my car and for that it works perfectly ! This is the best I 've ever used . Most importantly it 's pH balanced so it will not damage your leather like some other onces will . I was turned onto this by some Porsche owners who swear by it and I completely understand why . Non greasy , just great stuff ! Cheers	1
There are so numerous spray leather cleaner and conditioner out there and I was curious to see how different they are.Here are my findings:1 . All 5 spray leather cleaner and conditioner are priced between $ 7-9 for a 16 FL ounce bottle . This one is actually 16.9 FL OZ and cheaper than some of the other brands , so a good value.2 . This one has no particular scent , which I prefer.3 . The bottle holds nicely in the hands , it 's very ergonomically designed.4 . The spray nozzle is the nicest and best ( big , sturdy , fine mist ) of all the spray bottles I have tried.5 . Since this is a cleaner only , you should follow with a leather conditioner ( also stated on the back of the bottle ) , which I find a bit of a hassle . I 'm a busy working mom and prefer to use a leather cleaner and conditioner in ONE , such as as the WhooHoo-CleanLeather Conditioner and Cleaner in One . Luxurious Leather Lotion for Your Designer and Fine Leather Goods . Protect Your Leather Investment . 15 FL OZ . Made in USA ! .6 . Because it 's in a spray format , it 's good for large leather items such as a sofa , which I used it for . For smaller and more expensive leather goods , I prefer to use the WhooHoo-Clean leather care . If I pay several hundred or thousands of dollars for a leather item , I want to keep it new looking for a long time ! In my opinion , any real leather can and will benefit from a good leather care product ( with high customer reviews ! ) . Think about it , leather is like skin , it will get dry with time and particularly usage . Just pick one that fits your budget and use it regularly !	1
This company was recommended by the people who installed the leather seats in my truck . It seems to clean the leather pretty well without being too sticky or messy .	1
I use this product on the car 's leather seats . The seats are a tan color and really show dirt and stains . This product cleans them up nice .	1
In the past I 've ruined leather because I was not aware that household cleaners or even other cleaners that are supposedly for leather do not have the proper pH to care for leather . They end up damaging the leather and/or soaking into the pores of the leather and clogging them , making the leather tacky and shortening the life of it.This is not the case with this Lexol cleaner . It is the correct pH so will not harm leather . Further , it seems to help feed and treat the leather as it gently cleans.I have noticed a difference ! The leather seems healthier after using this product for sure . Unless I hear about something better in the future , I will swear by this stuff for all of my leather furniture and car upholstery.Note , on the bottle it states - `` Not intended for stain removal . '' So , please do n't expect this product to remove stains . It 's more of a general routine leather cleaner . It does clean , because when using a white cloth , I notice some dirt on the cloth while using this.Also , a tip from a leather pro I know-wait 30 minutes after using this before applying a conditioner . This will allow the leather to fully dry .	1
I had a set of these before but only the two ton . Needed another pair and these match up perfectly with dimensions for my 2-tons .	1
These stands will work well for most situations . The only problem I ran into was that they were n't high enough for my application ( which I should have known when buying ) . The bigger stands that have a bigger capacity have more height . These stands are good quality and do the job well .	1
These jacks are well constructed and easy to use . Similar to most auto parts store brands . Paint is thick and well coated , welds are superior , operation is smooth .	1
Great little jack stands - look and seem to be made as well as my Kobalt ones from Lowes , but cost half as much . With free shipping on this , you really ca n't go wrong . These are rather heavy , and I trust them to hold their rated load . Get 'em !	1
As described , metal and design is great ! Very sturdy and for my 2006 ZX3 it holds up very well . I recommend this product .	1
Nice stands at a nice price . I use these during the winter when I store my sports cars ; and in the Summer when I have occasion to work on them .	1
Did some caliper work and these kept the car up even on a small grade with no issues at all .	1
Like others it needs more notches as it is about an inch in between and when rolling truck onto a life you have to squeeze them in , Still all in all for the price it is a good buy	1
I got these and they do a great job , I just purchased them a week ago , no problems yet , they hold up my 2010 toyota corolla when changing my oil . I was looking for a good price and good review Jack stands , and I found them to be cheaper on amazon then going to my retail store .	1
A must have for the home mechanic . Wish I had bought these years ago . Solid construction , a steal for 20bucks	1
If you are underneath your car doing some work , or just doing some routine maintenance , you need a solid pair of stands and a good jack to safely lift your car . I can not believe how many people I have seen working on their car with a scissor jack that came as part of their vehicle maintenance pack . If you value your life , you want to get yourself a nice sturdy pair of stands like these . It takes no more than a minute to successfully jack up your car , align these jackstands up , and then lower the car back down onto them . They are built VERY nicely and the capacity is more than enough for standard vehicles ( I use them on my RX8 ) . The only thing I wish that it had was some sort of safety on the release . Granted that when the weight of the car is on the stands it is near impossible to release the height , it would still be a nice bit of insurance .	1
Used this for my 325Ci and I didnt once hesitate being under the car . They are made just as good as the best brands .	1
I have used these on several vehicles lately , do n't let the appearance of being light fool you , they held up a full sized Dodge van recently for two days while I changed a transmission without an issue whatsoever , and the price was great ! Highly recommend	1
My father has used Torin jacks for years , and I continued to keep it going . Ultra sturdy and solid , they can definitely take a beating and have held up my numerous cars . If I ever need to replace , whether by replacement ( doubt it ) or upgrading to a lift ( I wish ) , I will be going with Torin again .	1
Old one was weathered and nasty looking . This one took it 's place and looks great . It was about six inches longer then the old one .	1
Not much to say . It fit and worked as it is designed to - was just a much better price on Amazon !	1
I bought this one as a spare just in case I break the new one . sucks when you break the strap in mid stream	1
Cheap and quick fix for those of you with aging pullstraps . Ours were literally falling apart . Sliding out the old and in with the new took seconds .	1
We were in need of replacement awning pull strap and figured this would be a good brand.No problems with the length or the strap , the t slider piece however could be a little stifferand thicker to give a solid feel . As it it does work fine I just worry that the strap willpull out of the awning slot .	1
bought this to use with a signal generator , and works great . does just what I need . will buy another if needed .	1
I have used a LOT of this type of equipment over the past 30+ years and this is one of the best for the price deals I have found . I sure wish they were tad bit longer , but what can one expect ? They have a good strong cast wire and plug assembly ( as pictured ) and they used a very good quality wire of what looks to be at least an 18 ga wire , with good flexibility . The alligator clips use a high quality end and should give a good long service life if not abused . With a 3 foot lead length I assume they are designed mostly for use as a bench test lead set , but these will service any use where a 3 foot length will do the job . Buy with confidence ... . so far , I have never had a bad experience with anything from Elenco ! Not to mention that Amazon 's policies will cover you if you are not satisfied ... .. highly likely you will NOT be disappointed . Enjoy !	1
These are pretty nice test leads . Banana on one side and small alligator clip on the other . The wire is of decent quality as well as the alligator clips . The teeth of the alligator clips mesh nicely and the insulating boots cover the clips well . Overall a great buy .	1
For the past year , I have been using these with my Mastech power supply . While I have mixed feelings about my Mastech power supply , the leads are fine . The cables are flexible enough and the clips feel reasonably precise .	1
They work and they were at a good price , so there is not much else to say . I bought these to replace a set that I 've had for years and they were just plain worn-out . So far these appear to be a good replacement for my old set .	1
These are fairly solid lead cables . The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair , where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead , each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common , the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part , i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard , these are solid . Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable , i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine . contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine , teeth all line up fine . the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close . clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall : Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables , and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below **	1
These are not your cheap run of the mill clips . They are very thick and durable ; solder joints on clips are good too . This product is definitely well made .	1
OK	1
So often we are disappointed with the quality of what we receive , even when we paid a premium price for what we bought . This time I was pleasantly surprised to get better than I had come to expect . I received better than I had paid for in these test leads.Do enjoy !	1
Good clips nice wires . Not the greatest but do the job . Ours are used mostly with automotive repair & mowers .	1
What can one say , test leads they work and they are priced right one recommendation is to sell a kit with an assortment of ends .	1
We use this an another set of test leads to insure our products meet QA standards before shipping them out to customers . They work great , are durable and just the right length .	1
these are pretty handy when troubleshooting , can free up a hand so you do n't have to hold both leads to what ever you are checking .	1
Great price , they work as advertised !	1
It was quick getting here , but I already painted the item and have not used it to see if it works well .	1
When used as directed ! ! . This is a GLAZING putty not to be confused with something to fill dents with . This product should be limited to filling paint scratches/chips up to 6-8 mils . Anything deeper may not produce the desired result.A few observations ; 1 ) Fresh product coming right out of the tube has the consistency of ketchup , and spreads just as easily-fight the tendency to & # 34 ; grow & # 34 ; the repair area with extra filler . 2 ) Apply with a flexible plastic spatula to get the thinest coat possible . 3 ) work quickly as it dries FAST . 4 ) Thicker areas of the application dry last-make sure it is totally dry before you sand . 4 ) you really need to sand with a flexible sanding block , or you will dig out the repair with uneven sanding pressure . 5 ) wet sand with the LIGHTEST of touch , as the product tends to ball up when wet when friction is applied to it.Other than that , a much better way to fill paint chips than a blob of touch up paint .	1
Dries fast and sands easily . No problem filling cracks in bondo or any other surface . Adheres well to most surfaces . i use a lot of it for small repairs .	1
this is another requirement or should i say step to doing the job right , this glaze was exactly what i needed for my repair work , and will purchase this product again , love it .	1
I repaired damaged exterior redwood house siding with Bondo in many places where bushes and trees had rubbed against the siding for decades , leaving deep , sweeping surface mars , some over 2 ' long and 1/2 & # 34 ; deep . Worked perfectly . Also great for patching holes in anything ( yes , that includes cars ) . One car guy I know took 300 lbs of lead out of an older car repair and replaced the lead with Bondo saving that 300 lbs , the weight of two people ( or one beer-gut from Wisconsin ) ! An instant gas mileage improvement.Bondo is nearly a wonder material if used correctly , and that is to use as little filler as possible . In metal , bring the repair surface as close as possible to original , then use Bondo to smooth . Use like putty in small wood and soft material repairs , but for larger and deeper repairs , drill small 1/4 & # 34 ; deep anchor holes at differing angles in the bottom/sides of the hole for the Bondo to & # 34 ; grab & # 34 ; onto . It will then never come loose or fall out . All craft work is deserving of our best efforts . Give it the respect it deserves by doing your best , and by using the best tools and materials .	1
If you need to fill in light scratches or pinholes in filler then this will work great . Dries quickly ( if not too thick ) and sands easily once dry . If you try to sand it before it is dry , it is going to clog up your sandpaper but once dry it sands well . Easy to use and minimal shrinkage .	1
Bondo in a tube is exactly what you would expect . It 's Bondo in a tube . My experience in the past is that it 's a one time use product . If you sit it on the shelf after opening it and using it most likely by the time you need it again it 'll be hard . I only needed for a couple spots on the car , one where a tree length fell on it , and this product is perfect . Goes on easily , dries hard and is easy to sand . Saves you money from having to buy a large tub.Highly recommended .	1
it did the work , nothing special is just bondo , but it gets the job done , i used to cover to samll holes in the trunk of my accord , since i removed the H emblem sign .	1
got this to flush the brake fluid from my cbr and rebel and has worked great . it was just the right amount for 2 bikes so overall a great purchase . so far have n't noticed any brake loss with the new fluid so i expect it to hold well over time .	1
What you will be getting is Castrol DOT 4 Synthetic oil which you can get at the local auto parts store for half this price.Castrol GT LMA is the old name of the same product . When I called auto part stores for Castrol GT LMA they did not have it because it 's the old name they are not familiar with .	1
Great stopping power ! My brakes feel softer and spongier , but the stopping power much higher than before . It 's so great that moderate pressure made the wheels skid while stopping and getting off the highway . Castrol is a trusted brand . It is a product you can confide in . By the way it is Made in Germany ! It has to be well made or the Germans would not bother .	1
This is great stuff ! I used this to do a flush on my Lexus GS400 and it works great.Pros : Better braking performanceMixes with DOT3 and DOT4Castrol Brand so you know its good.Cons : NoneBuy with confidence and enjoy !	1
After installing a set of new brake lines , I flushed and bled my lines using this Castrol fluid . I had a track day coming up , so I wanted to make sure that my brakes were as free of air and had fresh fluid as possible . This fluid works great ! Through repeated track runs with heavy braking , I saw very little fade in the pedal , and no loss of fluid or air in the lines . It is a bit less expensive than some of the other brands that are geared towards track use , which is fine for those of us who are constantly bleeding their lines before each race . The only `` problem '' is that flushing lines is a bit difficult as this fluid is a similar color to the OEM fluid . As others have mentioned , I did do some more research and realized I promoted a poor practice of adding a few drops of water based dye to the fluid to differentiate between old and new fluid.edit : Removed line `` One remedy to this is to put a few drops of food coloring in the container and mix it up a bit so that the new fluid gets a bit darker . '' ... dont do this !	1
I use only 100 % synthetic fluids for my 1990 Toyota Camry which I keep in mint condition since the day I bought it new in 1990 . Mobil 1 Extended Performance motor oil . Royal Purple Max ATF Synthetic automatic transmission fluid , Royal Purple fully synthetic Power Steering fluid and Toyota 50/50 Anti-Freeze coolant.I wo n't give a lesson on why synthetic fluids are far superior to conventional fluids . I 've had that argument WAY before auto manufacturers started REQUIRING synthetic fluids right from the factory . They are far superior.In the case of this brake fluid . I 've compared all the spec . sheets on all the major brake fluids , and this one meets the highest standards . I just keep is simple with fluids and follow two rules . Change EVERY fluid on your vehicle yearly ( more often n the case of the motor oil depending how much you drive ) and use the BEST fluids available . THIS is the best brake fluid available .	1
Yea its good wax for the money and gives your car the protection your car needs . Reason why I say that is , I go by how it beads up when it rain . NOW having said that I waxed my car 1 month ago , I will see how long the shine and the beading lasts . If not just move on and try a different product .	1
I torture-tested this product on a big black Lincoln Town Car Signature L that emerged from the winter with the old wax stripped off by time , weather and automatic car washes . This is a car I detail by hand during the warmer seasons , so I decided to try Liquid Glass when it came time to revitalize the finish.The most appealing characteristics of Liquid Glass are ease of use , lack of residue , durability , and its ability to repel water and road dirt . This is possibly the easiest product to remove that I have ever used . You can apply it to the entire car in just about any conditions and buff it off very easily , although you may have some white powder floating around if you apply it too heavily . It does n't stain plastic or rubber parts , so you do n't have to worry much about where you apply it . Liquid Glass repels water so well that I can just about dry the car completely with the exhaust from my shop vacuum , with just a little help from a microfiber cloth . Its water-repelling properties make it useful to apply to all the glass on the car as well as the painted parts.Starting with essentially bare paint , I did n't find that a single coat of Liquid Glass was enough to produce the results I wanted , but two applications did the trick . I also tried a third coat to see what would happen , but additional benefits were n't apparent . ( Each coat was applied on a different day to allow the product time to cure . ) Liquid Glass produced a good shine , but the results did n't surpass what I 've achieved with other quality products . Since I did n't have time to do any polishing , I wondered whether Liquid Glass would have some cosmetic effect of filling in swirl marks , but it did n't seem to do as much as some other products in this respect . There also was n't an exceptional depth to the shine it produced on a black car . My impression is that the Liquid Glass finish is hard and durable , but on the thin side . It does , however , produce a slick finish that repels water and road dirt very well , so that sometimes I only need to rinse the car with water and blow it dry instead of washing it.Liquid Glass is a good product in many respects , and I intend to get my money 's worth from the can I bought . The jury is still out as to whether I 'll buy more or try something else.UPDATE : The product I ultimately decided to stick with is Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Polish . It 's a synthetic polish with all the benefits of Liquid Glass that I described above . However , it 's even easier to use than Liquid Glass , more economical , and produces a better-looking result . Unlike Liquid Glass , Turtle Wax Ice actually has some ability to mask swirl marks , and it produces a deeper shine .	1
This is the BEST stuff to use to polish your vehicle . It does not leave a waxy mess when trying to wipe it away after dried.There 's really not much else to say . I will never use anything else for my vehicles . For a true showroom shine , get you some Liquid Glass .	1
i am using this in 40-50 degree weather so I think it 's too cold to use this product so i only gave it a 4/5 . i am assuming once it gets warm i will have a better experience .	1
I 've waited a couple of months after using LG just to get a feel for its long term coverage . I 'm pleased to say it 's holding up well and I 'm glad I purchased it . Be sure to read and follow tiny print instructions when applying it . I put 2 coats on verticle panels and 3 on the horizontal ones . Still beads like newly applied .	1
If you want the very best well this is the one.This is a first step you apply every week for one month and nothing else . Wait ... The second month you apply some 3 hours after applying this product the Mothers Gold Carnanuba wax.You 'll be amazed and very happy.After the above , apply this product every 6 months to a year.It 's a basic	1
Preliminaries : New 2008 full size extended cab truck . Black paint . Just so you know this paint is in excellent condition before I did anything.I started withEagle One 2084018 NanoWax Sprayand decided that I needed to use something more substantial to keep the finish looking like new . So I moved on to a two step - one layer ofMeguiar 's A-1214 Car Cleaner/Paste Wax . 14 oz.and a follow on layer ofMeguiar 's G12711 NXT Tech Wax - Paste.It looked good and I was proud of the way it turned out ( all done by hand ) .Then I got theLiquid Glass LG200 Pre Cleaner 8 oz.andLiquid Glass LG100 Polish 16 oz.. WOW ! Goes on very easy and was a breeze to take off even after sitting for up to half an hour.The truck looks just amazing ! Truly a mirror finish ! As I read up on detailing my vehicle I got sort of hooked on getting a deep and wet look . Meguiar 's really was good but after all the reviews here I had to give this stuff a try.Get it and you wo n't be disappointed either.Darin	1
Read the reviews and had to try for myself on my new car . Works GREAT ! Easy on , Easy off . Great protection , water just beads off . Can apply in hot sun , easy buff off to hi-quality shine . So easy , you do n't mind applying again later for added protection ( 2nd coat ) . When dirty , rinse car with waterhose ( if water does n't bead up , time to apply Liquid Glass again , usually last more than 2months ) and dry off with microfiber clothes .	1
This wax goes on and off very easily and leaves a truly classic look . It is not a `` wet '' look or the `` I 've covered my car in Saran wrap '' look . It literally looks like you 've coated your car with a sheet of glass . On the black car it is very lustrous and on the white one not so much but it still looks very good . After 4 months both cars are still beading like I just waxed them . I will be using this product from now on .	1
Man O Man this is just the best stuff ! The slickest stuff around and is my only wax I use for all my cars and Im picky ! Goes on easy !	1
Liquid Glass is a terrific polish that goes on easily , protects for months and actually creates a deeper shine with additional coats . I do n't know if I believe the hype that many coats of Liquid Glass create a scratch resistant shell on your paint , but as a meticulous car nut , I can say that Liquid Glass is the best polish I have ever come across . This polish goes on easily with a microfiber cloth and comes off very easily with another microfiber cloth . It is not a wax but rather a clear acrylic coating . I highly recommend it.PROS : Long lastingDeep , superior shineEasy to apply / buff offCan be used in sunCONS : Can not be used over existing coats of wax/polish ( unless you use LG pre-cleaner ) Fairly expensiveTough to remove cured polish once appliedI posted a picture of my Liquid Glassed blue Shelby above . Good luck .	1
I used this product on my 2004 mini with 130K on it , i was ompressed with how easy this was to use , i was able to apply by hand in less then 15 minutes to the entire car , i let it sit till it hazed up and then wiped it off , a very impressive shine with very little effort	1
Goes on easily , comes off easily and leaves a great wet shine to my black car . If you want the best , you will have to pay for it .	1
I bought this polish for long time . when open the bottle it comes a blue creamy liquid , it show as its description how the shinny it was and easy to clean up . I compare to Mother 's product , it looks with similar result but much less in price . Anyhow , it works as it is .	1
I clay barred , lightly cleaned surface with Liquid Glass Pre-Cleaner found here , Finished up with this product and my 2012 is cleaner than new . I kid you not . Follow these steps and admire you work .	1
Over the years I have tried just about every car wax available , at every price point . Not that long ago I threw out the mostly unused bottles of just about everything else and stocked up on a few more cans of liquid glass . Every now and then I will test out the latest and greatest but I keep coming back.In terms of shine , durability and protection , I simply have found nothing better . A few years ago I noticed a friend 's car had a wet paint shine to it and that is when I discovered this product . I have since achieved the same results on all of my own vehicles of varying age and color . It is a shine and slickness that people ask about.Recently , the good workers of PennDot were directing traffic over a recently painted yellow line . Later I discovered lots of dreaded yellow speckles all over the lower quarter . Thanks to a couple coats of liquid glass protecting my paint , I was able to easily remove what could have been a disaster.Sure , some of the pure caranuba waxes are nice , so long as you hardly ever take your garage queen further than the enclosed trailer . What is nice about Liquid glass is that you do not need to reapply it every month to keep a great shine.Finally , I find that this is a very easy product to apply . Follow the instructions and use the pre-cleaner the very first time you use this product and you will be good to go for a long time . On certain colors ( i.e . red ) I sometimes get a bit of streaking . Again just follow the instructions and you will find that a quick spray of water while buffing easily fixes that issue.I have no afiliation with Liquid Glass other than being an extremely satisfied customer .	1
I bought this after reading all the reviews on amazon about it all i can say is they are right a very easy to use product that gives a great Finnish especially when you use it for a while gets better every time you use it	1
Easy to apply , gives a beautiful mirror finish- and I really appreciate how this polish leaves my black SUV looking almost new . It makes removing those dang dried up bugs so much easier . In the Arizona sun any vehicle 's paint needs ALL the protection it can get- and Liquid Glass does the job . I will repurchase this item .	1
Easy to put on , easy to remove , nice shiny glass look . Car lovers will appreciate the reward of their effort ... even if it is fairly easy to do . notihing better than a clean shiny car . I do recommend it..	1
goes on very easy and small can has alot in it . price average for the amount you get . when you wash at car wash make sure to forego the wax options , makes hard for wax to stick properly . instuctions are clear but small print . enjoy !	1
This is the best polish available . It goes on smooth and cleans up easy . I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs auto polish . The shipping was extremely fast .	1
This is the easiest wax I have ever used . It makes for a brilliant shine . When you wash your car all the bugs just rinse off . It gives great protection to the paint . But it 's the ease that makes this my fav .	1
Update on November 1st,2012 : I am on my third bottle of Liquid Glass LG-100 & there is no going back to anything else for me at this point . I even use this stuff on my windshield , it last longer than Rain-X while providing much better gliding action , rain just glide over the windshield . It 's a nice feeling not having to use wipers.It 's hard to write another review for an outstanding product with numerous positive feedbacks under its belt . But unlike most people I used Liquid Glass with a different approach . I used my Liquid Glass in conjunction with Blue Magic 's TR3 which in my opinion is slightly more abrasive , which makes it a better scratch remover & a better glazing compound than the Liquid Glass which is a better paint sealer and/or protector.My entire detail process took 2 days . Day 1 was washing & claying followed by a thorough polishing job with Blue Magic 's TR3 . After the required 2 hrs cure for the TR3 , Liquid Glass is applied with an orbital buffer that has Mequiar 's W8006 polishing pad attached to it.Follow instructions & let the Liquid Glass `` bake '' in the sun with ambient temp above 70 degrees for a minimum 4 hrs . I applied a second coat on Day 2 once the ambient reaches above 70 , again let it bake for 4 hrs before applying 3rd coat.The end result is complete paint restoration that looks like no other wax job unlike anything I have ever seen . My 97 Chevy Dually now looks like a new truck with a brand new layer of clear coat paint over its once dull , faded paint.For as long as you are willing to invest the time by applying multiple coats & baking it for 4 hrs in between , you will never look back at `` any '' wax , paint sealer or polish etc out there . This is indeed the best there is , my search is over .	1
I have detailed cars for a luxury car dealerships and have used many different car waxes in my lifetime . This is the best paint protection I have used . It removes off trim easily and also is easy to apply . I have done three coats on my 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid so far and it looks great . This product is a Buy in my opinion . Better then the dealership 's 700 dollar application of Xylon on my wife 's ' 2014 Honda Odyssey . Make sure you clean your vehicle with the pre cleaner and do a hand check to feel for & # 34 ; bumps & # 34 ; of dirt or other road grim before application . This is easy to wipe off as well , so it is quicker then hand waxing for me .	1
This product is nothing short of AMAZING ! ! ! ! ! I 've been a hard-core Maguire 's Wax/Polish man for years , and detail cars often . Over the years I 've used Mother 's , Maguire 's , and a few others , and hands down , NOTHING compares to Liquid Glass ... it just blows everything else away ! It 's easy to apply and remove and the crystal clear mirror finish it leaves is second to none !	1
I 've tried just about every sealant ( with the exception of NuFinish ) to protect my cars finish . This is the easiest to apply and remove . I put 5 coats on my 2001 Jeep that 's parked in the sun day after day , 5 coats on my new car that 's protected in the garage . The old Jeeps look like a late model SUV now thanks to Liquid Gold and new headlights . Wax in the Southern sunshine has very low lasting power , so after I wash my cars , I just follow up with Macguires Quick Detail Spray . I 'm sorry that I wasted my money on all the other & # 34 ; sealants & # 34 ; that were near backbreaking to remove , never lasted half as long , and never provided the new car shine . It 's been around awhile , but it 's performed better than any of the & # 34 ; professional & # 34 ; , highly rated products I 've tried . The price may seem a bit high , but there 's a lot of car coverage in one can .	1
I am not a detailing professional but I do like keeping my cars looking new . I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products . I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners , wax , tire shine etc . If you need advice on recommended tire shine , cleaners , car wash , write a comment . I have heard about liquid glass before but I was n't convinced that it was as good as people say it is . I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it did n't last long . I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week . I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years . I decided not to buy it because I do n't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time . So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again . This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time . The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It 's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent . Since my car was new , I did n't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint . I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish . You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free . If you have rock chips , I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later . I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth . Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine . After doing the entire car , let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake . After my second coat , my car looked better than new and I am not kidding . It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it . I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car . It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint . I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows . It 's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains . It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to . Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat ; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats . The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets . I have read in many places that after about 20 coats , the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection . The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips . Obviously you ca n't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast . I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats . I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $ 60 . You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat .	1
I was frankly stunned bu how well this stuff works . I put it in my 2006 Dodge Caravan and within a mile the shudder was gone .	1
Noticed a big change after putting into the tranny . not the cheapest but who wants to break down on the road	1
Got this for a co worker and his car had a delay from first to second even after a trans flush , after this and some Lube Gaurd WOW ! It feels like riding in a new car ! ! !	1
It ca n't be magic to fix the problem right the way . It takes a little bit of mileage before it can solve out the problem . I treat it as a piece of tylenol . Its OK .	1
I bought this for my 97 f150 and was very surprised at the cheap price for a quality price . very impressed !	1
This is the stock fuel filter for many Ford vehicles , including my Explorer . Located along the driver side frame rail , just under the driver 's seat and behind the tire . You will need one of these:5/16 In Fuel Line / Filter Disconnect Tool - Ford , KD Tools 3321 Ford Fuel Line Quick Disconnect , orOEM 25043 Fuel Line Disconnect Tool.Jack up the vehicle and secure it with jack stands . Open the fuel fill cap , remove the fuel pump fuse ( if applicable ) , and disconnect the negative battery terminal . Have a drain pan handy to catch fuel that will run out of the lines . Remove the line from the gas tank to the filter first . Then remove the other end which leads to the engine . If you have never changed the fuel filter , with age & corrosion , this may be harder to do than you think . Some have reported that the quick disconnect fittings were stuck on and that they had to cut the fuel lines . But with regular service , your future fuel filter changes will take only minutes.Safety equipment is optional . If you do n't care about gasoline getting on your skin , and in your eyes , ears , nose , and mouth , then do n't wear any safety equipment . If you have a water heater , or any other source of open flame with a pilot light , then you may want to check with your homeowners insurance before you blow the garage up . IF you smoke ... ..well , enjoy your last cigarette . Or it might actually end up being your very last cigarette .	1
Sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door . ( 2005 Ford F150 ) ... If you have the proper filter wrench it 's a very fast job .	1
Right part number and looks good . Clean package box although the tube ends did not have the caps like Fram , but will take Motorcraft any day .	1
When it comes to a fuel filter , this is the best . Only filter that fits perfectly . Makes the job very easy . If your not sure , try another brand . It will work , but the secondary clips wo n't fit . It will be ok , but not 100 % perfect . Just get the right one , the Motorcraft . I am a certified Ford mechanic in Michigan and did hundreds of these . Do n't fret over an extra couple dollars . This is the only fuel filter that goes on easy , and is the best for your Ford vechicle . Like i say , try another brand and see for yourself . Bye !	1
I try to use only Motorcraft parts on my Crown Victoria so I went ahead and ordered this from Amazon as no local stores carry motorcraft . It did not come with new clips which you will probably break removing the old filter so keep that in mind .	1
It fit my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71.Do this , it actually helped my car run smoother . You should have seen the jet black junk that came out of the `` in '' end of the filter when I dumped it out ! How the filter was working , I do n't know ! I heard these filters are supposed to come with new hose clips , but neither of mine did on two separate orders.If you have n't done this before it can get messy with a pressurized fuel system ( taking the gas cap off did little to relieve the pressure ) . Get a pan , rags , fire extinguisher , eye protection , and a hose to wash yourself off ! It seems like the gas squirts out all over , and it does , but if you 're quick enough , and wrap the hose in rags , you will have half a chance . NO OPEN FLAMES , SPARKS , HOT MUFFLERS , ETCETERA ! DANGER ! ! ! GAS , EXPLOSION , DEATH ! There are clips on either end of the filter that LOOK like they come off , however , you can buy a little plastic set of `` clip release '' tools ( Lisle 39400 Angled Disconnect Tool Set ) that fit all of the clips on the car . You slide them into the hose and it spreads the clips for easy removal , and I reused mine again .	1
My Lincoln used to start well , run rough for a few seconds , and kill . After the second or third try , it would run perfectly . It turned out to be a fuel delivery problem . The problem was a dirty or partially plugged fuel filter that restricted fuel to the injectors until the fuel pump had run for a few seconds . On most Fords that use this filter , the big Crown Vics , the Mercury whatever , and the Lincoln Town Car , the fuel filter is located under the car on the passenger side in a special bracket attached to the frame of the car . It is up on the inside of the frame ahead of the right rear wheel . As far as I know , Ford uses two types of & # 34 ; quick connectors & # 34 ; to attach the fuel lines to the filter . Either type is simple . You can find a & # 34 ; how to install & # 34 ; video on You Tube . This maintenance part is probably the first place to look if you suspect a fuel delivery problem . This part is genuine Motorcraft , it came promptly at a good price , installed and fit perfectly , and resolved the starting problems on my Lincoln .	1
Top Motorcraft Product at half the normal price . What is n't there to love ? With dirty fuel causing so many issues with new fuel injected cars I consider it cheap insurance to replace these at half the recommended interval .	1
A good , OEM replacement fuel filter for many Ford vehicles . Often overlooked as routine maintenance , fuel filters can ( without warning ) become clogged and , in turn , lead to vehicle reliability issues . This is especially true up norh , where seasonal mixes of gasoline affect the fuel system differently . Additionally , if you utilize E-85 ethanol in your vehicle , than you should be replacing these things more frequently than you may be used to . A final thought to extend the life of your new Motorcraft fuel filter ... do n't pump gas at station that is currently being re-fueled by a fuel tanker , as deposited fuel tank sediment can be stirred up in the process .	1
I use this in my 2005 Lincoln Town Car Signature Limited.Always use Motorcraft in a Ford/Lincoln/Mercury vehicle.This will last a long time , but you do n't necessarily need toreplace it every year . Fuel filters are best replaced after a certainmileage , not necessarily time . If it 's a few years old , replace itanyway . But if not that old , replace after 30,000 miles sincelast replaced . If neurotic about replacement or do n't knowdate of last replacement , replace right away or after somelesser interval like 20,000 miles . But if you believe thefilter might be in serious need , do replace it at once.This is a sturdy , solid unit but does not include a clip ; canbuy that separately or your installer can locate it without a lotof fuss .	1
I have a 1999 Mercedes-Benz C230 that had ~144,000 miles on it . The idle was very rough and noisy , and the engine was n't as smooth as it should have been in general , especially at lower engine speeds . The problem was so bad that the engine would almost stall at idle after first being started.I tried Lucas `` Upper Cyclinder Lubricant and Injector Cleaner '' , and it did n't seem to help at all . Then I put a full 20-oz bottle of Chevron Techron through the fuel tank , and it also seemed to do nothing . In each case , the product was used as directed , and the car was driven until the fuel level was very low . That is , I did n't refill the fuel tank and dilute the product in either case . In the past , I 've also used other brands of fuel system and fuel injector cleaners , including Gumout and STP . None of these products seemed to have the slightest effect.Finally , and extremely skeptical , I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment . I put a full 16-oz bottle in the fuel tank after filling up . The improvement was dramatic and immediate . The engine ran much more smoothly and quietly than before . The engine no longer idled like a diesel farm tractor . I was extremely surprised , but still skeptical , because I was n't sure if it had actually cleaned anything , or if it was simply helping because it was being burned with the fuel . So , I withheld judgment until the fuel tank had been driven to near-empty and refilled , meaning that the amount of Sea Foam left in the fuel would be negligible.This was no placebo effect . Even after refueling , the car ran much better than it did before . It now idles more nicely than my Hyundai , which still seems bizarre to me . I am extremely pleased , which does n't happen often , trust me . I 'll be putting a can of Sea Foam Motor Treatment through my fuel tanks before every oil change from now on.My other car , a Hyundai Sonata , had an annoying ticking sound when it would idle , especially when cold . I would have described the sound as a `` lifter tick '' , but I 'm not sure what it was -- a sticking valve ? I do n't know ; I 'm no mechanic . I added the recommended amount of Sea Foam to the crankcase , and the sound went away immediately , or nearly so . I 've since changed the oil in that car , and the sound has not returned.Some people criticize Sea Foam based on its age . I find these criticisms ridiculous -- as if `` older '' equates with `` worse '' . Do these people ever address the actual chemistry of the product , or provide actual reasons for their disapproval ? No , they just complain about how long it 's been around.Sea Foam made me a believer . Very highly recommended !	1
Below is the formula:1/3 : to the manifold ( using brake booster ) 1/3 : to the fuel tank1/3 : to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner . Remember : do it at night , otherwise , you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke .	1
I READ ALL THE POS FEEDBACK ON THIS PRODUCT AND HAD TO TRY SOME..THIS STUFF DOES WORK WELL..I HAVE A 1996 FORD RANGER WITH A ROUGH IDLE..POURED SOME IN THE TANK..WITHIN A DAY OR 2..THE IDLE SMOOTHENED OUT..GOT TO USE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KEEP THEM INJECTORS CLEAN..BETTER THAN ANY FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER I EVER USED..IT WORKS GUYS	1
I read all the reviews how using this product ... on the actual bottle you will find the instructions ... I used 1 Oz per gallon of fresh gas . I did n't have any white smoke from my bike ... I still need to run the motorcycle more often and see if clean property the dust of my carburetor .	1
I have a 2006 Toyota Matrix that would always seem like it was struggling to start . It was almost like it had a weak battery , but it tested fine . At idle the car would also vibrate just enough to rattle loose objects in the car . I used two cans in a 1 gal to 1 oz ratio and everything cleared right up ! Just FYI a lot of brick and motor stores carry this product cheaper .	1
This product will clean out an engine that has minor problems . It wont rebuild a carb for you , but should eventually dissolve some shellac build-up if used regularly .	1
I like it as It is not much more then their flagship product stabil and can clean deposits and remove moisture from ones fuel system . Moisture should not be much of a problem anymore though because ethanol mixes with water . The bad news though is gas with ethanol does pickup water where in the old days it sat on the bottom of the tank with other contaminents . It is the contaminents that circulate in tanks nowadays this helps rid your fuel system of . If nothing else it makes me feel better to use it . I put it in all gasoline for all equipment and vehicles in my household especially that which is seasonal .Update April 30 , 2013 . I swear my truck is running much better . Almost like brand new after dumping 32 ozs in the 32 gallon tank and running it through . Now I am putting in one can . My friend tried star brite star tron gasoline additive and swears by it . That is a little cheaper and you use 1/3 per gallon . I may try it but I can honestly say I am very pleased with this 70 year old additive that has consistently cleaned fuel systems , preserved gasoline and kept gas from separating from ethanol that picks up water . I am not one to spend money on frivolous items that do not produce . Sadly I do not drive enough miles to do a fair millage test but I would be interested if anyone has had a improvement . My friend on the star brite claims it adds about 1 to 2 mpg . I wonder if seafoam has any similar benefits ? In todays world that difference defers the cost a considerable amount . It will be hard to even try something else I have been so pleased with the Seafoam however .	1
I loved the process of seafoaming my car and plus you can definitely feel the difference in throttle response it does not last for long though as the quality of petrol in my country is really bad !	1
i use this cleaner on my 04 wrx , i run it through the intake , the gas and the oil , as far as running it through the oil you should only do it right before an oil change as seafoam isnt a lubricant , if you put it in your oil do it before an oil change run your car for about 40 miles then change the oil and you will be goodrunning through your gas is self explanatory just dump it in : ) for running through the intake i find the easiest way is to put in through the brake booster , when you do poor it in slowly otherwise your car will die , the engine may stumble while pouring it in but that 's fine , after you 've done that shut the car off for about 10 minutes , after that start your car up and go for a drive and enjoy the smoke show , your car will run ten times better afterwords and it will idle smoother as well great product !	1
I use it all the time . I use it to basically flood my engine via the intake/vacuum line . I let it suck up about 2/3 of the bottle slowly without it killing the engine and then last 1/3rd I just push the vacuum line completely in the bottle and let the engine die essentially . Then I let it sit anywhere from 30mins to overnight . Next time you start the car , it will be smoking white smoke ( as it burns off all the carbon build up that it helped dissolve ) for maybe 5-10mins . I do this about ever 6mo or so .	1
I bought this under the guidance of my Smog Technician to clear up a high NOx rating for 15mph.I have a 1998 Honda Civic EX VTEC , 5 speed . The past 15 years , the car has always passed smog with flying colors ( usually , all the numbers are 0 or close to it ) . This year , the car passed everything fine with the same record , except NOx at 15 mph . Reading online said that this is the place to fail if your car is going to fail . Prior years , the number was 50 , with a max limit of 480 or so . This year , it went up to 780.So , I bought seafoam and , unlike a lot of other people , my car hardly smoked at all . I baby my car usually ( short shift , cruise at 60-65 , easy on the gas and brake and clutch ) all in the name of gas mileage . With only an intake , exhaust , and headers , I average into the mid 40 's for gas mileage average , when the EPA for the car is 25/33.I 'm not sure if this is something to do with my car getting old and the Catylitic converter is getting bad , but after Seafoam , the car registered a barely pass of 460 out of 480 max.For those of you who wonder , I added the seafoam through the brake booster vacuum line . This , from what I have been told , is good for a quick fix and to pass smog . I later dumped the rest of the can ( 2/3 left ) into the gas tank . Its hard to notice , but I believe the car idles a bit easier ( no gushing kind of noises ) . Could be cleaning the injectors.Whatever the case , I passed smog and plan on using this the next time I go in for a smog 2 years from now.I read a lot of forums online and there is great debate over seafoam . It took me a while to buy it , but it worked . 5 Stars ! Worst that happens is you put it into a car that is held together by carbon deposits and your car leaks . If you car leaks oil already , or you believe it has the possibility to with engine cleaning , do n't buy this . But if you have high NOx or other figures , this is is a good buy to pass smog . Heck , once you pass smog , it does n't matter anymore for 2 years . Cheap investment/safety net for your car .	1
Sea Foam is the best , My truck has 146,000 miles and was running rough . I used two bottles in two fill up in a row . Seems to have helped a lot , truck runs smoother gas mileage is better by 2+ mpg . you can find it a wal-mart for about 9.00 bottle . It worked for me !	1
This stuff is promoted as very good for the gasoline , oil , and carb cleaning.I do n't know if it worked , but I put a whole bottle in my car , and aside from probably and hopefully cleaning the carb , did not really notice anything out of the ordinary.I recommend pouring this in your car at least once every 2 years , once a year when you have a modern engine .	1
did only as a gas additive , seemed to actually produce some results . engine seemed much smoother and the results lasted a good while after the additive . no change to mpg that was noticeable	1
A great product . When I used it didn ` t know what to really expect because of some mixed reviews but I noticed a change inmediatly the engine made less noise and had a bit more power . Even my girlfriend felt the car running better ( without knowing that I had done anything to the car ) . I would recommend to any body who feels there car isn ` t as peppy as before its really worth trying , just use as recommended . Even do I only used it via brake booster and gas tank didn ` t use it in the crankcase . Still great ! ! !	1
All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest . This is O2 friendly so it wo n't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any . I plan on buying another can next oil change .	1
I have previously used in : 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle , 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel , and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle .	1
Not sure what this stuff is or why it works , but it does . I had a 1986 Honda Shadow that had a hard time starting up , and it would randomly choke out and die sometimes . Mechanic said I might need a carb job ( super expensive , you have to dismantle the bike ) . I threw in some Seafoam ( full can into an empty tank , just before refueling ) . Bike ran like new . HOW ? Lots of other people have given dozens of incredible uses for Seafoam too , so I 'm sure it will serve many other purposes as well .	1
I Always use this product . This stuff is great ! When I bought my motorcycle , it was running a little rough & stalled at stop lights ... .but no more . Will not fill up without a little of this in the tank !	1
My Jeep has almost 138,000 miles on it and I used this product for the 1st time about a month ago . The product really worked well . My jeep idles a lot smoother and overall just feels different . I also poured some in the gas tank and it must have really cleaned any gunk out of there because I drive my jeep the same route every month and this last time I averaged almost 20mpg , which is a lot better than the 17 I used to average . I would suggest using at night though , because your neighbors may call the cops thinking there is a fire with the amount of smoke that comes out the exhaust . I would also suggest looking up videos online on youtube and typing in seafoam jeep . That 's what I did , and it proved very instructional .	1
I ran a bottle through my boat engine . The engine did n't burst into flames , but it also did n't get 30 extra horsepower . I think I need a & # 34 ; NOS & # 34 ; sticker for that.But really - it 's kind of hard to tell if the product works or not . You have to go on faith , and I have faith that Sea Foam delivers a high-quality product .	1
I use this in my RV to both preserve the gas ( from degradation with age ) and to & # 34 ; treat & # 34 ; the engine and generator .	1
This great product keeps all of my gas powered vehicles and equipment running great . I absolutely love it ! Thank you !	1
I bought my can of Seafoam locally , on the advice of those on the Yahama Vino 125 owner 's group . The engine on my Vino 125 scooter had been hard starting , and running rough- signs of a gummed up fuel system . I was hoping I could clean it out without having to disassemble everything to get at the carb , a major pain on the Vino . I added 2 ounces of Motor Tune to a full tank , and let the scooter run for an hour . And surprise , the engine smoothed out . No more coughing and sputtering . Started a lot easier after it cooled down , too . I added the rest of the can of Motor Tune to the tank of my 2003 Honda Element , which , my mechanic tells me , could use a fuel injector cleaning . Might just save me a hundred bucks here.So what 's in it ? The MSDS ( manufacturer 's safety data sheet ) says it 's 40-60 % `` pale oil , '' 25-35 % Naptha , and 10-20 % IPA . Naptha is a light hydrocarbon fraction , lighter than gasoline . Lighter fluid and Coleman Fuel are naptha . Pale oil is a very light , heavily refined , pale yellow oil- several sources tell me that kerosene is pale oil . And IPA is just isopropyl alcohol . Amazingly simple- you could make up your own mix , which I might just do next time . ( One experimenter who did a lot of testing suggests four parts diesel fuel , 2 parts naphtha , and 1 part `` HEET '' brand IPA . ) The IPA binds to any water in the tank or fuel line , I suspect the naptha dissolves varnish deposits , and the oil is a carrier , according to a mechanical engineer I spoke with.Incidentally , I found my can on sale at the local O'Reilly 's for $ 4.99 for 16 ounces . If you shop around locally you may find a similar deal .	1
This stuff is awesome . I put my first bottle ( about half of it ) in my ATV which was running a little rough . Threw some in the fuel tank and then sprayed some ( with a spray bottle ) directly into the carb while running . Let it sit for 5 minutes and repeated . It instantly ran smoother and had better throttle response . I thought okay , not bad for a quick & # 34 ; miracle in a bottle & # 34 ; . So i went over to my weed wacker which would run like crap at anything over half throttle . I figured if this stuff could fix my weed wacker than it has my approval . I added a little to the fuel and repeated the same process ( spraying in the carb and letting it sit twice ) . It smoked a ton but ran like it was straight out of the box new . SOLD ! I love this stuff.Long story short I bought three more bottles and put it in both of my vehicles , my snowblower , generator , leaf blower , lawn mower , outboard mower , and anything else with an engine . Everything runs like it is brand new . Forget bringing your stuff to get fixed by a mechanic . For cheap money up front you can do a little preventative maintenance and stabilize , clean the gunk out of your machines , and keep them running smoothly.When I put it in my vehicles , I threw a third of the bottle in the fuel tank , SLOOOOWLY ( READ SLOWLY ) dripped a third of the bottle in my vacuum line , and may toss the last third in the oil right before my next oil change . If you throw it in the oil you need to change the oil and filter within 100 miles or it will be bad for the engine . Do n't put it in the vacuum line quickly or you will hydrolock your motor and destroy your engine . You will be fine as long as you slowly drip it . DO NOT & # 34 ; slurp it & # 34 ; by sticking the vacuum line in the bottle . People do this all over youtube and it 's the wrong way to do it . That is a recipe for disaster . Just buy it and you will love it .	1
My last car was pushing 165,000 miles and going very , very strong . I mean , I floored it all the time and was never merciful with that engine . Not only did I take good care of it , constantly clean it , and always use premium fuel , but I would use Sea Foam from time to time . A lot of engine cleaners are similar , but Sea Foam has been around for a long time and seems to be one the strongest and most reliable brands . And at around 8-12 dollars a can ( depending on where you buy from ) , its totally worth it for me to use every now and then.Also , do n't just pour it into the fuel and oil tanks . Thats great for regular maintenance every 1k miles or so , but either find out , have a friend , or figure out ( youtube ) where the brake booster vacuum line is that runs to your engine . Running Sea Foam through that is what its known for and will reeeallllllly clean out your engine .	1
I had to buy this from NAPA shops in past times and pay the full retail cost.Amazon now is offering this at a very competitive price and even has free shipping.That free shipping just involves getting enough items to get over the minimum limit which is really easy.So now I can get a product at a great price that I know works for me and get it delivered to my house for free.What more do you need ? Thanks Amazon for offering this item .	1
A few years ago I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling , and our mechanic found no problems ... he basically just told us that Ethanol sucks ... to be more exact , ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down . This can lead to all sort of bad things including rough idle , corrosion , reduced power and a failure to easily start.He recommended a couple product -- SeaFoam and BG44K -- which quickly took care of the problem by helping remove the water and cleaning the valves and fuel injectors too . I buy BG44K when found at a good price , and SeaFoam when I ca n't ; put a can into the Mustang 's tank every three or four months , and drop one into my wife 's SUV at least once per year.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue , give this stuff a try . Recommended based on our experience with it .	1
I would not have believed it if I did n't try it for myself . The Onan generator on my toy hauler would not start and I tried new gas , but the lights would blink that the generator needed service and would not stay running . I poured a little more than the recommended dose in the tank and kept starting the generator . After I felt I got some of the fuel into the generator carb I left it overnight . When I came out the next morning and started it the generator fired up , blew out some white smoke and ran like a champ . I let it run for an hour under full load of the A/C . The generator fires up every time now and runs great .	1
right after I put it in my car . Later my mechanic decided it is the old water pump which broke and hit the piston valves ? ? ? Not this Sea Form . But still my mind is not clear . Why minutes after my car was gone ? Very very expensive experience . Sea Form is safe ? I have no proof it is bad so I give 4 stars . Why one star minus ? Expensive ...	1
My 1998 Mitsubishi Montero Sport has reached 100K miles and I needed to spoil her by buying some kind of engine treatment . My mechanic recommend this product and I 'll tell you that the engine runs a lot smoother.Also , when I apply gas I can feel the engine `` struggle '' less than before ... it almost feels like a new engine . I placed the treatment in the oil crankcase and in the gas tank as well . An added feature is that it comes with a spill free spout but I still recommend a long funnel.Cons : a bit pricey when compared to it 's competitors but we 're only talking a few dollars .	1
I got tired of all the issues the ~10 % ethanol garbage gas has caused , so I went with the recommendations I 've read here and on various car sites , and have been using Sea Foam ever since . I regularly put it in the tanks of my 3 cars , use it in my motorcycle , in my snow-blower and lawn-mower . I saw the biggest difference in the snow-blower . After only 1 season , it would n't start because the carb was gunked up . And yes , I was using Sta-Bil in the tank on the off season . But I never ran my seasonal stuff till the tank/carb was empty , I just put in some Sta-Bil and left it for ~6 months . Now I put a couple ounces of Sea Foam in every time I fill the tank and it not only starts easier , but it starts every time . I also noticed a difference after loading up my 12 year odl motorcycle with some Sea Foam and a clean tank of gas . The idle was smoother and it revs smoother also . I could go on , but I 'll just say that I 'm a believer , and have a case of this stuff in my basement .	1
This is like medicine for anything that runs on gas or diesel . I have n't tried it yet , but maybe I will rub some on my sore elbow one day ! LOL	1
It Worked for Grandpa back in the day & Works just as good for me Today ! I used Sea Foam to clean a number of Carburetors that had been gummed up by ethanol in today 's gasoline.Worked awesome on both 2 and 4 stroke carbs !	1
Ok this stuff is down right AWESOME ! ! ! ! I added this wonder stuff to an old tired motor that was going to be pulled and rebuilt . Never pulled that motor out . Cleaned the carbon right out . Smokes like crazy while its doing its job and a few minutes later smokes gone and smooth running clean engine is what your left with . Works so well that a un named car repair shop uses it instead of doing the overhaul you paid for . Date line aired that	1
I ordered this before I was aware of Pri-G . I understand Sea Foam is much better than Sta-bil but not as good as Pri-G. Pri-g is MUCH more concentrated and therefore represents a better value . It is what I will be ordering in the future .	1
I have used this on my car , motorcycle , and even a scooter . This works well as part of a maintenance schedule .	1
I think of lot of guys use this for the smoke show it produces out the tail pipe.Pay no attention to most of the Youtube videos you see about this product : almost all of those people are using it wrong.WRONG WAY : start car , pour seafoam into fuel , oil and PCV valve or carburetor ( or similarentry point to the cylinders ) and then stamp on the gas hard until it looks likesomeone detonated a hydrogen bomb in your neighborhood.RIGHT ( and more mature & informed ) WAY : start car , let it warm , pour in Seafoam tofuel , oil and cylinders . Once all used , TURN OFF CAR . Let sit for at least 5 minutes ( preferably 15 ) and then turn the car back on and DRIVE IT somewhere , aggressivelybut not irresponsibly . Do so for 20 minutes or so or at least until the smoke dissipates.Most cars do n't need this treatment but I can see it on an older car or a vehicle that'sbeen abused and requires a full tune-up.Be ever mindful that the deposits you liberate from the engine may , in fact , be all thatholds the motor together . Oil might not lubricate as well ( or at all ) if the clearances betweenbearings are so wide ( without the deposits in place ) that it ca n't reach them . Take care whenusing this product , and do so responsibly.Better idea : run 20 % Marvel Mystery oil in your crankcase ( use 1 of each 5 quarts as MMO ) , add 4 or 5ounces of it ( per 10 gallons ) to the fuel , and pour some down the carburetor ( or into PCV valve or acarefully-selected vacuum line ) ) once the car is started . Do n't go crazy with the amount you pour intothe engine directly . Run it in a new oil change : use cheap ( but new ) oil . Use a cheap ( but decent ) oilfilter like a Fram ExtraGuard [ the Orange Can ] . Run for 2-4 weeks . Change oil again with a good filter ( Motorcraft are my favorites but Purolator and Mobil 1 are great as well ) and decent oil ( preferably synthetic ) and watch the crap drain out with the oil/Marvel Mystery Oil combo . Continue to run good oils and filtersfrom then on , and perhaps repeat this procedure every few years or as you believe it necessary.Seafoam is a far more aggressive crankcase cleaner ( flush ) solution which fewer cars are inbad enough condition to require . But for those that are , it works well . Just use correctly andresponsibly . And beware that it may clean out exactly what was holding the motor together all thoseyears . Still , few vehicles will have that problem .	1
Worked great on my BMW 's leatherette . I have been told that soap and water works well for cleaning vinyl , but when i tried it out , i was left with mineral/water marks on my interior . Not only did the Vinylex take off the marks left from the last cleaning , but it left my leatherette looking new . It has a nice matte finish too , and its so cheap ! Worked well on dirt too .	1
Most of the sprays I have used in the past leave a sticky film on the dash , which ends up collecting more dust and dirt that has to be cleaned off . No such problem when using Vinylex . Easy to apply and performs outstandingly well ! ! !	1
I have used this for over one year now . It 's way better than Armor All , which is what I grew up with.Leaves no residue and looks clean . It does seem to leave a crusty appearance after a long summer on dark charcoal color . Then again , it might not have been it that did that .	1
I use this product to mist onto my black spray in bed liner to give it a shine and prevent UV fading . So far it has worked great for this purpose .	1
I highly recommend this , even though it does not have the most pleasant smell . This protects trim from UV damage while keeping a nice classy shine .	1
I 've never used this product until recently , although I 've become aware that it is preferred by many due to its non-silicone based formula.There 's no way I 'm able to comment on the long term protective qualities of this protectant - although eventually this review may get updated.I was deep cleaning the neglected interior of an older mid sized sedan . I started cleaning the dash and the rest of the vinyl interior by using a very damp - not soaking wet , hot , and somewhat weak mild soap solution.After I removed all of the dirt and grime and the vinyl was dry , I applied the Vinylex . The vinyl interior soaked up the protectant , and I found myself with half a bottle left over after doing 1 car - but again the interior had been neglected and had n't been detailed in a while.The spray nozzle did n't spray evenly , and after taking it apart to try to understand why , I just conceded it to be a defect . Not the end of the world - and it did function somewhat but for over ten bucks I should n't have to deal w/ these types of petty issues . So I simply swapped sprayheads w/ one of my own.A light , quick buffing of the vinyl thereafter applying provided the ideal amount of sheen I was hoping for . ( not greasy )	1
I have been using Vinylex for cleaning my vehicle 's interior and exterior for several years now . I prefer to other products rubber/vinyl/plastic protectants as it does n't leave much of a sheen once it dries ( as compared to something like Armor All ) . It also reportedly protects against sun damage and while I do n't have enough experience to confirm this is does keep things looking like new for a couple of months after an application .	1
I 've been using this product for years , and it 's the best out there . It is low gloss , and a little goes a LONG way . I use this on more than just my car . Basically anything made of plastic that I need to condition and protect , I apply this product to . In my opinion , the other major competitor that `` armors everything '' does n't live up to the hype , and in fact can in some cases cause you more headaches than save you . Plus , it 's gone up in price quite a bit . Pay a little more and buy a better product . The Lexol leather conditioner is also an excellent product , made by the same company . I will add that I prefer the spray bottles to the wipes for both .	1
Lexol Vinylex Protectant SprayLexol makes a variety of quality car care products , and Vinylex is no different . I 've used their leather cleaner , leather protectant , and 2-in-1 leather protectant with great success , so I had high expectations for the Vinylex.The best way to describe Vinylex is that it is almost like 303 Aerospace Protectant , which I have used for over 12 years with good success . Vinylex is a white milky liquid that is applied to plastic and rubber to protect it from UV radiation and degradation . It 's not supposed to contain silicone which can dry out dash board materials.I 've used the Vinylex on polycarbonate , plastic car trim , dashboards , steering wheels , center consoles , and the plastic body panels on my Ducati Monster 696 . It dries cleanly leaving no greasy residue or smell . There are no streaks either . However , I do n't recommend using it directly on the grip area of a steering wheel or any other surface where friction is required for safety purposes . It does get somewhat slippery even when dry.The directions indicate to shake well , so there 's probably some ingredients that settle . However , I recommend covering the nozzle with a cloth when you shake it because some product does come out . I just use old ( but clean ) cotton socks for applying the Vinylex . The best part about Vinylex is that there seems to be no off-gassing after applying it on the dashboard . When I tried Armor All products and even 303 , it tended to leave a filmy residue on the inside of the windshield as it dried out . The 303 also had an odd smell , whereas Vinylex is almost totally odor-free . I also used Vinylex on the EPDM rubber door seals on my cars.Overall : 5/5 stars , highly recommended . I feel Vinylex is better than 303 Aerospace Protectant , but only time will tell after I observe the actual UV protection capabilities .	1
For years I hoarded the remaining ounce of Vinylex left in my garage until I found it on Amazon . Vinylex is the best cleaner/protectant you can get for vinyl , rubber and plastic . It is UV resistant and will prevent the sun from fading the aforementioned items ' color . I discovered Vinylex over twenty years ago for use on the vinyl seats of the '65 Mustang I had then ; it really worked great to clean and protect . Since then , I have discovered other uses for Vinylex including the cleaning/protecting of vinyl siding and on vehicle tires , dashboards and interior/exterior plastic trim . The results are clean and classy looking without being over-the-top glossy . I even went and bought the 1 gallon refill container , too .	1
I 'd consider myself a novice in the personal car care crowd . When I was ready to sell my 13 year old Honda CRV and I poured through amazon and other website for the best stuff to detail my car , to get the best resale price , and I came across this product . I took the online advice of others and I ca n't say I 'm more pleased . Using this product on my honda made it look only a few years old and brought the plastic and vinyl pieces back to life . On the interior , the dash was super slick but no oily . I even used it on the exterior of the car . The black plastic bumpers had faded to a light gray , but when I applied the vinylex , they went back to black . Anyways , I did get top dollar for my honda using vinylex and other car car products . I hope this review can help others .	1
As with all lexol products ... excellant quality and works extremely well for general interior ( namely dash ) protection . Serves my needs extremely well . I highly recommend all of lexol products .	1
Used on Jeep , interior and exterior , great results . I use on the bumper , fenders , hard-top cover , and the vinyl spare-tire cover . It 's an '09 Wrangler so all those pieces are faded looking after washing , not to the point that it 's really noticeable until you spray the Vinylex on to see how much better it could look . Also use it on all plastic and vinyl inside with good results . It 's not a super-shiny look on the exterior , just dark and clean , basically new looking . It 's not a greasy feeling like some other products I 've used either , which I like . I 've gone an easy 3-4 weeks with it still looking really good . By that time I usually have taken the Jeep out in the dirt/mud and have to wash again anyway and it 's always necessary to re-apply after washing . I also use this on our quads for a nice , new looking appearance . Very easy to spray on and wipe off . On a more porous surface like the Jeep bumper I need to spray on a bit more for good coverage .	1
I was turned onto this by some Porsche owners and gave it a try . I use it on the soft top on my Boxster S and it makes the top look GREAT ! Gives it a nice black and also is protecting at the same time . I highly recommend this to any soft top owner out there.Cheers	1
I decided to give this stuff a try after watching a video featuring a professional detailer . He suggested to use this stuff and to NEVER use anything by Armor All because the greasy film produces a greenhouse effect , trapping all the rays the sun puts out and basically cooks the plastic , causing premature aging , cracking , etc.. I foolishly started using Armor All about 3 years ago because it made the plastic in my car look really nice and had a deep , rich black color it was starting to lack . But then I gave Vinylex a try and once I removed the Armor All that was previously applied , I noticed that my circular air vents actually turned a little white . I can only assume the AA caused that . So I stripped all my interior plastic of the AA and used Vinylex and , depending on how much you apply , leaves a really nice matte finish with a slight bit of sheen , but with no glare in the windshield . The AA wipes I used , even if I wrung them out , still left a highly reflective shine on the dash.The best way I found to apply Vinylex is to take a good quality microfiber towel , fold it and then spray about 3 good squirts , rub it in and that should cover a whole door panel with ease . Then switch to a clean side of that microfiber and kinda wipe off or buff some of the wetness you may get on the plastic . Also use it on interior weather stripping where the doors shut -- mine were looking spotty with water and almost chalky , simply because I never bothered to clean them . The Vinylex made them look dark black and brand new . I have access to this stuff because the Toyota dealer I work at sells it and a lot of it . I 've honestly never seen it anywhere else . My first impression of Vinylex was , `` Eh , it 's a cheap product , I can guarantee it '' , simply because of it 's outward appearance . Trust me , it 's good stuff.A co-worker of mine also uses the Lexol leather cleaner and conditioner for his leather couches .	1
Ive tried multiple products over the years and this is my favorite for plastic & vinyl interiors . It cleans and protects very well while leaving no excessively glossy finish like most other products , which is caused by the silicone content that sits on the surface and does not penetrate . This should be your preferred interior protectant if you really care about proper maintenance and not useless gloss .	1
I 've been using this stuff for YEARS . It works great , it prevents the & # 34 ; fogging & # 34 ; on windshields , and it lasts a good long time . And since it 's not silicone based , it 's not one of those cheap products that just shines up the surfaces , and dries them out so they crack . Over years of applications in several cars an in the house , I 've never had cracking issues.It will never provide a super shiny surface like the cheaper competitors , but that 's not what it 's for . It 's for cleaning AND protecting the surfaces .	1
I 've tried a lot of different products for interior detailing.This is the best.One tip is to use it sparingly . A little goes a long way.It leaves all vinyl and plastic looking great , without that artificial gloss and streaky mess like some other products.It also lasts a very long time , I only have to detail the interior a couple of times a year .	1
cleaner seems to work pretty well , and the fabric guard repels water for quite some time . Light rain showers are easily repelled . Bird droppings were easily removed from the top as well , i have a feeling the guard made it easier.BEWARE OF OVER SPRAY . I recommend you cover all surrounding areas before applying this stuff . Its a pain , but its necessary . This stuff sticks to what it hits . I applied it to my top months ago and it still repels water .	1
I had close to a dozen pine tree sap spots all over my tonneau cover from being up in Northern Michigan from week vacation back in May . Normal car washing did n't do a thing to remove them . So I decided I 'd try 303 and followed the instructions to the letter , sprayed on the Cleaner let soak , scrubbed a little , did a second application and sap spots softened and wiped right off . Impressed ? Wait there 's more ... I then applied the Protectant , applied two coats and looks great , not ultra glossy , but semi-gloss and I like that very much , after only having on one day and while parked in my driveway for an hour while I took a quick ride on my Harley came home to find birds had decided what a nice thing to poop on ! Here 's the even more impressive part , I broke out the Cleaner a few shoot on the & # 34 ; effected & # 34 ; area and wiped right off , did n't even have to re-apply the Protectant . I 'd by this again , No question !	1
The 303 Products 30520 Convertible Fabric Top Cleaning and Care Kit is great for cleaning canvas tops . I reccomend taping off anything you dont want overspray on with the protectant as that stuff is hard to get get off after it dries	1
I used this on the front carpet in the car.The stuff works.. It removed & # 34 ; ALL & # 34 ; whatlooked like permanent stains with 2 applicationsone on top of the other .	1
Dissolves dirt instantly , like magic ! , Has taken most of the stubborn stains others have not been able to . Price high , but worth it !	1
I used this products on numerous stains on my carpet . I followed the directions on the can and it removed all the old and new stains on my carpet . I will buy again !	1
I had some old stains on my car 's carpeting . Do n't know what they were from but scrubbing with soap & water did n't budge them . I even had the car detailed a few times and the spots remained.Sprayed this stuff on and they vanished before my eyes . Now the old stained spots I sprayed look cleaner than the rest of it !	1
This is great stuff to use on small screws and adjustments to make sure they stay put . Easy to remove when needed .	1
I used it on a small machine screw for my turn signal switch . Holds great ! I do n't have to worry about snapping the screw when i remove it again . Could not find it in any stores . Went to amazon and found it Thanks !	1
I use this on auto repairs to ensure a locked bolt . it only takes a drop . Loctite has the track record of providing a quality thread locking solution so I will continue to use it . Enjoy !	1
If it moves and it should n't , Loctite . I like to use this for small items that I will need to take apart in the future , but I do not want to have loosen up during use . Like tiny screws in a gun or something else small and hard to replace .	1
I was simply delighted to FIND purple locktite . I needed the right product for set screws on rifle scopes . Purpose locktite is not to be had in local stores . Go for blue and you commit your set screws . I needed something that I could use with a small screw and remove if I needed to without stripping anything or resorting to heat guns . This is PERFECT .	1
When your trying to keep small screws from backing out , this is the one.The & # 34 ; Blue & # 34 ; type is still way to strong for small screws , and it will be very difficult to remove them.The & # 34 ; Purple & # 34 ; works great , holds the small screws securely , and allows them to be removed without destroying or bunging them up .	1
This made my brake flush just as easy as an oil change . Fill it up , tighten everything up ( really tight , more on that later ) pressurize and open caliper bleed nipples one by one.Couple nit-picks:1 : Tough to tell when you are running out of fluid in the resivoir . The pressure bottle is a thick plastic that 's barely translucent . Nearly pumped air through the entire brake system at the end because I could n't tell the pressurizer was dry of fresh fluid.2 : They really need to ship with a roll of teflon plumbers tape . The connection between the hose and the adapter leaked for me , and I had it tight as could be.Overall a must have for DIY brake jobs . Couple things hold it back from being a 5-star product .	1
Used this to backfill our aircraft 's hydraulic system . It worked flawlessly and we avoided having to bleed the system of air bubbles because there were none . This saved a lot of time and labor . Fantastic product !	1
came on time excellent quality works well with the multi meter i would recommend this product to any one who asks about them	1
I purchased 2 packs and I 'm quite happy with these . I did n't measure the wire size but they are larger and heaver than a set I bought several years ago from another site.The clips are attracted to a magnet so I know they are not Aluminium and could probably be souldered if I wanted to ( that 's good ) . I checked them with a Ohm meter and the connections were all good . The boot is soft and flexible . Well worth the price for those of us that are DIY 's .	1
These are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use . There are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you can not hold the leads . These are fine for that .	1
These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires .	1
I was sort expecting some rather poorly made and low quality clips , I was sure wrong . These are really well made for the price and I am sure that you will NOT be disappointed . Enjoy .	1
The perfect size for my projects and well built . The price is 1/3rd what I 've seen at other stores and with Amazon Prime I 've been stocking up on everything : )	1
Look everybody 's looking for a good lead , look no more you found it . If looking for a lead on a good job sorry it will not work for that .	1
Nothing spectacular . They work , they are as advertised , and they are a good value . The cables have a strange `` feel '' to them that will leave a residue on your hands .	1
ca n't have too many of these guys , a must if you do any electronics work , tinkering . seem to be of good quality and hold on well .	1
These are nice short leads with alligator clips on each end . They seem to be sized perfectly for electronics use . But what if you wanted them for something more.. well.. personal ? You see my point ? You can probably see it better if you 're younger and more active in.. well.. the pursuit of happy happy happy . In that case just lengthen them and stop complaining . Some people , ..	1
Great product . Fast shipping	1
Easy application , Easy buff , doesnt dry too fast like some others ive used and I have had the privilege of using this wax for over 10 years .	1
Easy on , easy off . Make sure you use lot of clean microfibert rags . My show is so shiny is practically glows in the dark from this carnuba wax .	1
This wax , used in conjunction with some type of pre-wax cleanser , in this case P21S Paintwork cleanser , this wax provides amazing finish shine and protection . I keep my car garaged so I ca n't say as much as I 'd like on durability , but on a garaged car that I was once a week ( with only soft water ) this stuff has lasted me MONTHS . My car continues to look like I just waxed it after I wash it . I highly recommend this wax .	1
I put this product on after applying a paint sealant and if gives the car a very nice gloss . It is super easy to apply and remove . What I really like about it is that it does not show fingerprints at all . on my Porsche 911 it would always show fingerprints in the area of the door where we push to close the doors or trunk area , after applying the P21S it no longer shows fingerprints . Generally speaking the carnauba waxes do n't last very long but that is not an issue for me since my car is pretty small and doing a full wax does n't take me very long at all so I can apply a wax like this once a month since it is so easy to put on and remove . This is my first experience with carnauba wax and certainly wo n't be my last . Yes it is a bit more expensive but this container will last a very long time	1
This wax is great - no white junk on the black trim , easily applied and buffed . I love the shine ... wish it would last a little longer . However , it does add 'pop ' ! ! !	1
Very nice , I am hopeful it holds up over the winter . It is very easy to put on and buff , smells nice . I used the wax after using a clay bar on my paint and the results were very good . I believe it is best to do as much prep as possible before you wax to get the best results . This is a very good product .	1
This applies so easily and comes off even easier . Usually it takes me 30 minutes to wax the car but this has dropped the waxing time to less than 15 minutes . Super easy to apply and comes off in just one wipe . It really helps to bead the water . I think it lasts for a few months . This stuff rocks !	1
I have used many , many paste waxes over the years as I am a detailing fanatic . This is by far the easiest wax to apply , and remove with excellent results . All you car freaks out there need to try this product !	1
This is a very good quality wax , for the price , you get easy application , and easy buff , it gives a great shine , doesn & # 8217 ; t last long though , especially if the vehicle is exposed to the sun regularly	1
My son bought this after reading about it in a car magazine . He absolutely loves it , and would n't trade it for anything else . This definitely does the job , and seems to be much easier to get on and off the car , compared to some other vehicle waxes . It shines much better and lasts longer than several others he has tried . I would definitely recommend this .	1
Based on some forum posts , I originally bought this product to use soley on wheels to reduce brake dust build-up . Although it was okay for these purposes , I thought I would try it on the whole car . I was not disappointed- easy to apply and good durability .	1
Love this ! Does what everyone says . Puts a polish and shine that lasts 3-6 months . Makes new cars staybright and old oxidized cars 'almost ' look new . What 's great is just rub on and buff off in 15 min. , and you use only a capful per 3 sq/ft . Water beads up and rolls off , or gets blown off while driving ( water flies off the windshield ) . Between waxing , add a capful to bucket of clean water and wash your car . MUST dry car immediately with microfiber cloths so no spots will form . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! Great shipping by AMAZON and VENDOR .	1
What can I say that has not already Been said . I love this product and will use it till it is gone then buy some more .	1
this stuff is liquid gold . do n't mind spending a couple hours detailing ? this 'll make your panels shine like mirrors ... it 's all i 'll use . now just need to get rid of the older , inferior product i bought ... .	1
I gave this 4 stars because it is a great , gentle , all in one protectant . It performs as promised . Would not hesitate to get it . One thing for sure ... .. If you want a 5 STAR product , get the KLASSE Sealant/Protectant in the Silver jug . It is fantastic , and if I was only going to get ONE KLASSE product , it would be the Sealant just mentioned . The silver bottle ! Red bottle comes in at one step behind . But both are good .	1
Having used other Klasse products , I recently bought this for my daily driver . The instructions caution you to use the product sparingly- too much and it 's difficult to remove . Just wipe the excess with a damp cloth . Despite this challenge , it left a nice durable shine .	1
Im writing this review because I read the negatives that some peoole have with this product . U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls . No liquid , in any way , will ever put swirls in a car . The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product . Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second , and the one people have the most difficulty with , is how hard it is to wipe this off . This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car . The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water , put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator . Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off . The longer you wait , the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does . Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off . This is a sealant , it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years , applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick . After a rainfall , the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof , as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove , simply apply more and rub off .	1
Read a few of the reviews and checked out some of the detailer forum and decided to give KGS a try . I know that is product has been around for many years and I kick my self for not trying it sooner . This stuff is just great . I read on how difficult it is to work with and I must say I found it to be a piece of cake.It was easy to apply and wipe off ( I did it by hand ) . It took me about 90 minutes to do the All in One and the Sealant ( mostly because you have to wait 30 minutes for the sealant to fully dry ) . However , make sure you use very little . Be sure have plenty of light ( not sun light ) when applying . I only applied one coat of the AIO and one coat of the KGS . I want to see how long it last before I need to reapply to see its longevity .	1
I was a touch skeptical . But I can afford to throw it out if I do n't like it . Well I can say , I will NOT be throwing this out ! I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self . Why did n't I buy this sooner . And it is true . A little goes a long way .	1
This product over-delivers . Clean your car very well . Wash it . Use a clay bar on it . When you are ready for it to shine , get this product out.Get yourself a velcro & # 34 ; pad holder & # 34 ; that fits in your palm . Attached a round 4 & # 34 ; pad to the velcro holder . Apply just 1-3 drops from the jug on the pad . That is all . Then do about a 2 ' x 2 ' section . Put it on very lightly . Oh ... DO IT IN THE SHADE ! ! This product dries as hard as a rock . If you put it on heavy , you may get frustrated . But there is no need.Do one fender at a time . Put on very lightly . Wipe off before going to next fender/door whatever . Just 3 drops will do a whole door . This product goes a long way . You have a tendency to put it on heavy to start because you want to & # 34 ; see a haze & # 34 ; to wipe off . You do n't need a heavy haze . Just a light one . Then BUFF with a soft double folded cloth . If you put it on LIGHTLY , it will only take light buffing . If you mistakenly put it on heavy , you may have a tendency to RUB IT HARDER -- - BUT THAT CAUSES SWIRL MARKS from even a soft towel thread . So If you put it on heavy , let it dry . Then overspray with a little Quick Detailer spray ( any brand you prefer ) and then wipe . The heavy haze comes off . You can also spray the Quick Detailer on a rag first and then wipe off the haze . That little bit of moisture prevents you from & # 34 ; muscling & # 34 ; out the haze.RESULTS : Amazing GLASS LIKE seal over your car like you have never seen ! And , it almost appears as if you had it sprayed with a gloss clear coat . And , it is a HARD finish . GLOSSY . And , it has lasted through 3 months of car washes and dusty roads . Even a dirty car shines through the dirt with this product . There may be other products that shine as good , but why shop when this one does it ? I have gone over the Clear Sealant with a Carnuba wax , but it really does n't feel any smoother . Just had to try it . Now I do n't need the Carnuba . I did buy the & # 34 ; ALL IN ONE & # 34 ; Klasse to try . Seems to be ONE step less than this .	1
Installed these on my 2002 Jeep TJ and really love them . Huge improvement over the stock lights . So good that I spent quite a bit of time adjusting them down to avoid blinding on coming traffic . Well worth the money .	1
Wranglers are not known for great headlights , these will fix this . Takes about ten minutes to replace the stock units . These have a great beam pattern and allow you to ditch the sealed beam lights .	1
Outstanding lights , I installed these on an MG TD , they fit just fine and night driving is safer . I used Dorman 84790 sockets and I wired the ground to chassis rather than to the bucket . Could n't be happier with the result , great lights .	1
My rare 1970 Chevy is about to get upgraded headlights . Have not installed them yet so I ca n't say I love them yet . From what I 've seen , these DOT approved , glass lens , metal bodied units , with heavy dust covers , will not be noticeable to a novice eye . Look at the photos on the desription page , there were no surprises for me . `` Cool Nova . `` HELLA 002395301 Vision Plus 165mm High/Low Beam 12V Halogen Conversion Headlamp ( HB2 ) x 2 .	1
If you are looking to upgrade from sealed beam headlights to replaceable bulb halogen types , this is the way to go . Far more light is transferred to the road and ahead than before and with the same wattage bulbs .	1
I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ Rubicon and this is perfect for converting the regular headlights/bulbs to aftermarket HID bulbs . The fit is perfect and , with the HID bulbs , it 's extremely bright . In fact , it 's so bright I am concerned I might get stopped by the cops ( tip : stay with 35W HID bulbs and do n't get the 55W HID bulbs ) .Highly recommend .	1
What a terrific and not very expensive upgrade to my MX5 headlights . Much improved light output over sealed beam . I have not tried the Euro version which purportedly gives even more light output ; but these are for me a very satisfactory upgrade . Notable improvement .	1
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler . They fit perfect and work exactly as you 'd expect they should . I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous .	1
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla , Matrix , Prius , Yaris , ect.. These horns are very load to say the least . The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn . It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase ( this is why I gave it a 4 star ) . I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link , and the included relay and a relay socket . The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR : [ ... ] Make sure you use the included relay in your install . I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire ( not using relay ) , but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw ! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns . Do it the right way , and follow the instructions ! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns ! They will get your attention , I can promise you that . I do recommend these horns !	1
I was expecting better tone that does not mean it do not do the job .. it does and does it pretty good but I used to have set of those black hella horns and I like that tone more than this one .. maybe it 's just matter of appreciation .. BTW others are half price of this ones ..	1
Installted this horn kit on my wife 's truck after my son installed small car horn in it ( beep beep ) . Now her truck sounds like a truck should and is plenty loud . I wish the low frequency horn had a lower frequency , but it is acceptable .	1
they work - and increase the volume of blast from my bike - but be prepared to sort out the wiring on your own ...	1
I bought these long ago , but just got to installing them.They are noticeably louder than stock . It feels like the metal on my 1994 Nissan D21 Hardbody vibrates just a bit when the horn honks now , too.As a note : It turns out I did not need to use the relays and other parts . The existing wiring provides adequate power to rock these dudes .	1
The relay setup is a breeze , if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times , rather than just when the car is on . You CAN NOT take the bolt off on the back , dont try to , the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel . Also , we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through . Excellent product	1
Yes these horns , and any other Hella Supertone horns you find `` new '' will be made in China . I was slightly worried when I first ordered because I did my research and knew this was the case . I ordered anyways because of the lack of reviews on other types of horns out there . I put these on the front of my Hyundai Elantra and completely removed the stock horn.Keep in mind that the only thing that comes in the box is a pair of horns ( high tone and low tone ) and a relay . USE THE RELAY . You might think that the power going to the stock horn is sufficient but run a volt meter to it , when the horn is pressed , and chances are you are getting less than 12V . Just as you would think the extra power just creates a louder horn.I got all of my supplies from Home Depot . A 36x1 '' bar of steel and 2 nuts and bolts . I cut this down and drilled two holes to mount my horns to because I did n't have room in the stock location . I also got a spool of red wire and a spool of black wire 14 gauge ( a little oversized , you 'd be fine with 16 or 18 ) , some heat shrink , and connectors to plug into the horn , relay , and attach to the battery and grounding points . I took my time and made sure that all of my connections were crimped , soldered , and shrinked very well . I found a location by the battery for the relay and hooked everything up.These horns sound great . With the dual tones alone more people will notice these but they are probably 50 % louder than my stock horn . The quality looks fantastic . I would certainly order another set . Install took me ~2 hours including run time to home depot and I was taking my time.Just Google search for the wiring diagram and ideas of how to mount them. [ ... ]	1
It just makes sense.They 're loud enough . They 're red . They 're Hella so they 're German or something . Why would n't you want them	1
The reviewers here who say to remove the black lens covering are not increasing their ability to see better , only increasing the glare to other drivers . They are also breaking the seal and allowing water intrusion to do so , for no benefit.The light pattern of these is not ideal but for the price is fine . Mount them properly , aim them properly , and use them in conditions that warrant their use and only then , and they are an effective product.But too many use automotive lighting incorrectly , thinking that a huge blast of light is allowing them to see better , when in all actuality all it is doing is constricting their pupil sizes , and vision , and blinding oncoming traffic.I hope cops start ticketing these fools who are using auxiliary lighting improperly , or retrofitting HID bulbs into halogen housings .	1
I bought these to mount on my tractors snowblower to help with visibility when it is dark out . The tractors lights are okay but do n't put out a lot of light . These light up my driveway great when I have to snowblow in the dark . Pretty good for the price .	1
I 'm using these as DRL , and they are perfect for that use . Very good quality , great installation gear , and they look nice . I am going to replace the bulbs with LEDs to cut down on current draw .	1
ITS THE BEST LIGHT I ORDERED FOR MY SILHOUETTE BECAUSE A PEBBLE BROKE MY LAMP , AND IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL , THANK YOU AMAZON , COM	1
I was looking to buy some good fog-lights for my car , I did a lot of research , I was going to go for the Hella FF50 , but I did n't want to spend a lot of money , so the second option was the Optilux 1450 , like everyone said these are some pretty good quality fog lamps , they feel sturdy , however I agree with Tito 's review , do n't remove the black shields , as without them the lamps get very hot and you do n't want to blind oncoming traffic , I tried a comparison side by side , one lamp with shield and the other one without it , I could n't see a mayor difference . The cables are good , the only complaint that I have is the plastic switch , it feels a little cheap , but I 'm hopping it will hold up .	1
I had Hella Optilux 1002 fog light 2 years ago , that was n't bright enough even i put the 35w HID in there , this time I 'm going to use non-projector light for the fog light and use 50W HID in it ! , this light come with the everything you need , durable cable , reply , switch , etc . for this price and its quality , i would say i found a good one , although the HID is bit hot especially I 'm using the 50W , the chrome on Hella Optilux 1002 fog light stripped a bit on it because the hotness of HID . with the 50W HID 3000K on it , i can even use it as the driving light ! ! ! sweet ! with HID in there i needed to modify the hole in the back for the HID bulb to be fit , and use silicone to seal , that only need a small file and small silicone cost me only about $ 6.after a year of use this light with 50W HID in it . I like to use it a lot even in good weather , the light brights up the road ... . but just recently one of the the lens broken but still works and the hosing still in good shape . I do n't know what broke my len but I will leave it that way for a while !	1
This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs . they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights .	1
Right bulb to replace the original that lasted almost 4 years . Kind of a pain to replace with the lights mounted but it can be done .	1
Use this for my kc offroad lights on a mule utv . Replaced one bad bulb that would come on/off . Worked as expected . Nice and bright .	1
What canI say these are bright and cuts through thr dark .	1
The brightest bulbs you could find for your KC hilites ! I love these . They light up the night and make the drive safe . Ensure you dont keep them on while driving - way too bright and dangerous .	1
This steering wheel cover is exactly what I was looking for . Soft leather , and is very durable , and the stitching is very high quality . I love the way this makes my interior look and the feeling is great .	1
This cover is a little bulky on the steering wheel . Fits nice and works great but I would have chosen a thinner cover if I knew . Other than that , I am happy with this cover .	1
I bought this to replace a replacement cover . The old replacement cover was old , ripped and still smelled like the strong vinyl scent . This one is very nice . It is nice and smooth and feels good in your hands . It takes some muscle to install but once it is one there it looks good . It could be a tad cheaper but it looks well made . The stitching is solid and does n't seem like it will come apart . It does n't move at all once you place it on your steering wheel so you do n't have to worry about that .	1
Great cover ! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little , and it is not moving ; low 80 's outside today but likely over 110F in the car . I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off . It is smooth leather and is dyed black , much like belts and shoes , which can rub off on contact ( belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing ) . For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips ( stinky ) or vinyl ( slippery ) but neither are very durable in hot cars ; you wo n't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather . Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery , but it will not bleed color . If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber . This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve ) non-smelly ) that prevents the cover from moving . I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on . I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel ( there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock ) , carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly ( the first 3/4 's is easy ) , use patience and care , then roll the edge into position . If it is off-center it can not be slid sideways . Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly ; a little here , a little there . Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming ; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15 '' 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel ( do measure your wheel diameter before ordering ) . The only con to these types of covers is they can not wrap the inside , so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover ; in this case it is smooth , rolled , and well stitched and I have gotten used to it . It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality . I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend . I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this , much like one would use on leather car interiors . It is smooth leather , not suade or roughened.In 'the old days ' I bought wrapped 'stinky ' vinyl , and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension ( still available ) and it filled the inner part of the wheel . It was difficult and time-consuming , and , the vinyl strings eventually breaks . I recommend this 'new and improved ' version . Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV . Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell ' is highly carcinogenic , expecially when hot , and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric , also . This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars . FYI .	1
This is a nice steering wheel cover . I 'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice . I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather . I 'm going to say this . If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely is n't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $ 20 for a product . For that price you get what you get , regardless of what the manufacturer may claim . Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant . A nice cover it is . Top grain leather it is not , at least not for $ 20 . Want top quality ? Spend multiples of the cost of this product ! ! ! ! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap .	1
Simple , quick review.Real , thick , stiff leather.Heat it up some to make install easier.Good color ! Feels great , works well !	1
I 've had a lot of imitation leatherish wheel covers that a ) smell and b ) do n't last very long . I ca n't swear that this is real leather or not , but it does n't stink like others that I 've had , and so far , in about the 4 months I 've had it , it 's holding up well . So far so good .	1
The item was just as discribed . Genuine Leather , it does fit sung . My wheel is a PT Crusier GT . It is leather , but it 's starting to show wear . So I bought this to try ? It was a bit hard to put on . So I laid it in the Sun for awhile . It went on . But do n't add anything to help it along . You do n't want it to slip . My Steering Wheel is 15 '' , but it fits like it was made for it ! My secret for keeping them looking HOT , is KIWI Black shoe polish , hand rubbed . SW	1
I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred . These covers fit well . They do n't slide and they are made of real leather . You can smell the leather scent . One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather , they do make the driving experience slightly different . They do make the steering wheel thicker . No regrets , the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition . The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels .	1
20 minutes in the dryer on low softened it up for easier stretching over the wheel on our 2002 Chevy Tahoe . Smells like new leather seats which I like but some do not . Nice soft feel . Quality piece . Seller was fast and efficient as well ...	1
I used this sand paper to wet sand a set of headlights and it worked amazingly . Unlike cheaper sand paper this one did n't shred apart so I recommend you buy the good stuff . In my experience 3m makes some awesome products and shopping on amazon will save you a few dollars also .	1
Great for working with metals and woods if you want a real fine and smooth finish . So get some and get sanding .	1
I use the & # 34 ; scary sharp & # 34 ; method of sharpening knives , plane irons , and chisels . That involves wetting a sheet of abrasive , laying it on a flat surface , like a thick sheet of glass ( I use a surface plate ) and sharpening tools on that . For the occasional woodworker it 's inexpensive and very effective , and a lot less messy than waterstones.Reshaping damaged edges , I start with something like 325 grit wet-or-dry . For normal honing I start with 3M 's 800 grit sheet and finish with this . It provides a mirror finish and a single sheet lasts through many sharpening cycles . I 'll probably eventually invest in a set of good waterstones ( $ 150-200 ) but for now this is a good substitute .	1
3M knows how to make sandpaper . When you get to 2000 grit you 're really polishing . I use this prior to polishing something .	1
Very workable wet sanding paper . Never gave me any trouble during the life of the pack . Will buy again . Expensive , but like all other 3M products . The stuff just works .	1
If you 're one of those folk who likes to keep your car looking clean and shiny whatever the weather , and no matter how old your car ( or you ) might be , this is stuff you want to have on hand . It is gentle , effective and provides the best shine possible , whether your car is nearly new or has 100,000 miles on it.My daily driver is an original owner , 18 year old , bright red M3 , and it still turns heads because it still looks great - thanks in part to regular use of 3M hand glaze . Here 's what you do - wash your car well , using one of the better car wash solutions like Meguiar 's hi-tech wash or P21S car shampoo . Dry . Then use Griot 's Garage ( or similar ) paint cleaning clay to remove surface contaminants and start to work on the swirls and other imperfections in your paint . ( You can skip this step , but I 've recently discovered this cleaning clay and it really does wonders , especially on cars that spend a lot of time in the woods where birds , bugs and tree sap are unavoidable ) .Now - get out the 3M Imperial hand glaze . This stuff is very finely abrasive and supremely gentle on your paint - clear coat or not . Use a terry or foam applicator pad to rub the glaze into the paint and rub out fine swirls and scratches . Work on a small section of the car at a time -- perhaps a square foot or so of surface . Always buff the glaze off , before it dries , with a best quality cotton or microfiber polishing cloth.When you 're done with the 3M hand glazing process , your paint will be at its best - silky smooth and contaminant free . It will shine as best as it knows how - but you 're not finished . This is a polish , not a protectant wax . So now 's the time to protect the paint with a high quality wax - I recommend P21S carnauba or one of the Zymol paste waxes.Follow this regimen , do it two or three times a year and keep your car washed in between . If you care about how your car looks , then year after year , you will be glad you did .	1
Got the shine back on my 13 year-old original paint . Easy to use and a little goes a long way . Works better if you have orbital buffer . I used a electric screw driver and even made my headlights sparkle !	1
You have to try this stuff . I 've been using it for years on my dark cars and it really leaves one of the best squeaky clean feeling deep shines you will find . It seems to make the swirl marks and small scratches just disappear . I cover with a good synthetic wax . Great product , easy to use . One bottle goes a long way - I use 1/4 or less on a large full size car . I was so glad to find it on Amazon .	1
The very best wax for black you can find . Hard to remoe by hand buffing alone . The key if to get most of it off with a good cloth and then hit it with the 3M detailer spray . Mirror goodness and that deep penetrating wet shine . Love it !	1
This is a great product ! It brought back the original look and actually a nice satin-gloss look to my tires.I agree with other reviews , do n't care for the Ultra Glossy finish some tire dressing produce and this is a restorer ... it helps the rubber . Just be aware that this is a strong and some what dangerous product , they warn that this can cause cancer , and as a survivor of Melanoma from last year , I take this cautions seriously ! Just follow the directions , be safe , and enjoy the look this produces !	1
Goes on easy , just spray and wipe . Looks like the war wash tire detail.I 'm happy with it . Supposed to block both types of the sun 's UV rays which I guess implies reduced tire aging ?	1
This product was designed to make tires look new again without using the usual silicone based ( make-um-shine ) stuff which actually dries out your rubber trim . Though this product does contain some silicone it does not have as much as the stuff that it resembles . If you like your tires to look wet and shiny this product is not for you . If you want your tires to last longer and look new even when they no longer are , 3M Tire Dressing does just that .	1
This tire restorer is the best one I 've ever used . I tried most brands and this one is by far the best . If you want your tires to look like new , just spray some and wipe with a cloth . If you want some crazy shine , spray and leave it like that . Be aware that , just like many other tire dressers , it can and will stain the pavement/driveway .	1
If you want to restore the new tire look , this is the stuff . Easy to use . If you have curb scrapes just stiff brush the tire with car soap and water , dry tire and apply . This does not give you that glaring shine nor is it formulated to . The tires look as new when done . Great product .	1
I 'm always hesitant to use tire-shine for personal reasons . They always wear-off and sometimes they are just too shiny.This spray really does the job . Its non-greasy and shiny . It makes tires to look BLACK ( the fluid is white/cloudy ) and as i was applying it to the tires , i could see a difference . It rained right after i left the carwash and after driving in the rain for 15mins the shine/cleanliness was still there . So over all i 'm super happy with this .	1
I like this 3M Tire Restorer because it goes on easily and covers well . It leaves the tire looking great and not real shiny but like new . I do n't like the really shiny tire products because it looks peculiar to see a tire that way . I prefer the matte finish where the tire looks like new and clean . I have tried lots of tire products and use this one consistently on my new truck and looks great . Also seems to last awhile . I also like the way it comes out of the spray bottle as it is a nice fan spray that covers a good area . Worth trying if you like to keep your vehicle looking like new .	1
I was at our Good-Guys car show ( with my show car ) a few years ago and a ( NAPA ) dealer had this product for sale . They said try it and if you do n't like it bring it right back and I 'll give your money back . Well ... I did n't and I have continued to use this for years since . This stuff is great and like others have stated really brings the new tire look without being too shiny . I used it on all the plastic and rubber parts to bring new life look back and also the colored plastic panels can bring the color back . None of it is permanent and tires need to be re done every other wash or so . I use the 'Eagle One Tire Swipe ' applicator to apply the product or wipe it around for an even appearance . I have even used it sparingly on my Azek deck and keeps it looking sharp ( but if too much can get slippery ) . Great product .	1
I 've been struggling for years with my lever action grease gun as you really do need a third hand to use it . I finally got fed up enough and did some research on-line and noticed the LINCOLN model had the best ratings . I love the way it locks onto a fitting and does n't leak all round the sides of the fitting instead of going into the fitting as my old gun did ... . ( made a mess and wasted grease ) The Lincoln forces all the grease into the fitting easily ... once you snap onto the fitting you only need ONE hand to operate ! This is a quality piece of equipment and worth every penny especially with the best price and free shipping from Amazon . Now I wont get aggravated and talk myself out of greasing the cars and lawn tractor as I should be ... ..THANK YOU LINCOLN INDUSTRIAL 1134 ... ..	1
Delivered in timely manner and packaged properly . Easy to use , easy to load as well . I have been using it a while now and it is holding up . Great transaction .	1
My preference was to purchase a grease gun made in the USA . Nowhere could I find one so I was resigned to buy one which I was sure would be made in China . To my surprise the gun was made in India and is a high quality item . The hose was made in Germany which was another surprise . I needed to lubricate the spindles on my mower so I obtained a grease cartridge and tried to load it into the gun by following the manual provided by Lincoln . I appreciate the fact that Lincoln furnished a manual but I would have been pleased if it had been written clearly enough to be understood . I simply could not load the cartridge using the Lincoln manual and decided to look for other instructions . Luckily I found a YouTube clip titled Lincoln Grease Gun Tutorial which solved my loading problem and offered other helpful hints . All went well after viewing that clip.This is a fine grease gun and works as expected . Other than a confusing user guide I have no complaints .	1
Best grease gun I have owned , and I have gone through a few of them so far . This will be the last one I buy . The quality is top notch . Very smooth operating handle .	1
I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem . I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does . It was also a heavy duty , industrial gun like this Lincoln . I like heavy duty , but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting . Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel . Dremel makes a small , cone-shaped , red-stone bit . It 's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long . I do n't know the item number . It is tiny . Under a magnified florescent work lamp , I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped , spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting , careful to maintain the original contour . This took about two minutes . I 'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection . I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear . This grease gun is top quality . After a two-minute modification , it is now a customized tool . Guys like to customized cars , motorcycles and guns , why not their tools ? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun . This works for me . Good luck .	1
The grease tube was easy to install . First time user and it was easy to use . Great price for the grease gun compared to buying it from auto shops .	1
This is one good grease gun . Yeah , it 's easily twice to three times what you 'd spend in a big box store for a grease gun but it 's solid and heavy-weight . It probably weighs twice the weight of the gun it replaces . It 's got an air pressure release valve to purge any trapped air . The rubber hose is longer than most and that helps getting in those hard-to-reach places . The tip snaps securely on the zerk fitting and the hose end fitting is adjustable to get a secure connection on the zerk valve . And the one-handed operation of the squeeze handle is a delight to use . I just finished using it to grease the spindles and wheels of my riding mower and it worked great.This has got to be the last grease gun you 'll ever buy . You 'll thank yourself every time you use it .	1
After a couple of cheap grease guns , I opted for this better one . It 's definitely heavy duty , worth a few extra bucks , quality throughout . Comes with everything I need . This is the one I pick up every time I need a grease gun .	1
The quality of this tool is very good and it has n't fallen apart or given me any issues yet.If it does I will update my review accordingly.My only regret is that it 's not made in the USA .	1
For the pump : -Solid construction.-No problem loading the grease tube.-Gives out good pressure for injection of grease.For the coupling : -Had a real hard time pulling the coupling away from the zerg fitting.-I would replace the coupling .	1
This thing seems extremely well made , even if it is n't made in the USA . I had a cheap gun before this and blew the seals on the second use . This pumped grease into some well rusted fittings with ease.My only complaint is the hose fitting that attaches to the zerks . Yes , it is a 2 piece design as many have mentioned which is both good and bad . If you have easily accessible zerks that need a lot of pressure , you can screw this on and use both hands to pump . However , large u-joints can be a huge pain as I ca n't get anything in to tighten the fitting . I found I had to keep making adjustments then sticking it in the joint until I found the perfect setting where it fit on the zerk but did n't lose grease . However , there were a few joints where I was unable to find this balance and could n't get them to take grease . I will have to buy a different hose to get them all .	1
I received from Amazon and put it right to work . I installed a Lithium Cartridge from the top , screwed on the whip hose , primed it , and went to work . I found it locked on the the grease fitting well and pulled off the fitting with a firm tug . It did not lock on like another reviewer found . So far so good . I have owned other Lincoln models and have not had any trouble with them .	1
I 'm a shadetree mechanic , so figuring out how to load this thing was an adventure . The instructions are ok , but as I have ZERO experience in using/loading one , it was quite the mess - not the fault of the product , it 's all me . Once I got it all loaded up , it worked flawlessly . Great pressures delivered into the driveshaft zerks for my '98 Land Rover , and required little to no pressure on the handle to deliver it .	1
This is a high quality grease gun and FAR better than all of the less expensive ones I have purchased at auto stores and Wal-Mart . I threw away my other grease guns after trying this one .	1
Ca n't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime . However , I see what people are talking about with the instructions . They 're not really instructions . No parts labeled , nothing but a drawing of the unit itself , and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked . Other than that , the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head . So just do n't even read it , just throw it in the trash unless you want to laugh .	1
I 've used this buffing pads for about 5 years now in my car wash and I have to say they work great and leave your car looking like new very shinny and leaves no swirls .	1
These are fantastic . It will leave swirls on dark colors , so use a foam one if the paint is decent . On old badly worn finishes- use this first , then do it again with a foam one . It 'll come up amazingly well .	1
A friend had recommended this wool cutting pad for de-oxidizing and restoring the shine of a 15 year old boat ! The results are amazing ! I ` ve even ordered more to keep on hand for other wax products !	1
I received this buffing pad in good time and well packaged ... I 've used it once and found it to be satisfactory ... nice and thick ... easy to clean ... adheres and works well with my buffer ... .also found the price to be very competitive ... .SATISFIED	1
Made well ! Has a centering hole , for fast changing . Read my reviews for the best disk to use with it . SW	1
Per recommendation , it use it to do the cutting stage of car polishing using Porter Cable 7424XP . It does its job well . My only complaint is that that small wool threads will be shredded and fell off . You need to clean up the garage after you are done polishing cars . I guess it is nature of wool . I use it for heavy duty job such as cars that do not get waxing/polishing for a long time like mine . After that I switching to foams .	1
CLEANS DIRT IN PAINT VERY WELL AND BEST OF ALL , IT SO EASY TO POLISH OFF..TAKES NO MUSCLE AT ALL..LEAVES A SHINE I CANT GET WITH OTHER WAXES	1
I have been using this product for years . It 's a liquid cream stays emulsified and spreads very easy . After it dries to a haze it wipes off even easier . As a cleaner wax it 's fantastic . Removes everything that has accumulated on your paint and leaves it shiny , sealed and smooth . I use it on our Murano , F150 and camper trailer . I 'll never use anything else .	1
It is a good quality wax , but do n't expect super shiny glossy finish from this wax . Basically it is just a cleaner wax and not anything exotic .	1
on the advice of miles ( you know who he is ! ) use this to maintain the grille and surfaces of our kerosene heater . initial and seasonal . seems to do the trick.also there 's a kinda nice coconut smell .	1
This liquid wax really brings out the shine and is very easy to apply and wipe off . I use it on my chrome wheels and it makes them look brand new .	1
This is a great one step wax when you do n't feel like spending hours on cleaning , polishing , then sealing your car 's finish . It does have a bit of abrasiveness to it , so I would n't recommend using it on newer finishes . It works ideally on older , imperfect finishes.I have a 12 year old car which I used to be very avid about keeping cleaned , vacuumed , and waxed . Over the years I have gotten more lax about keeping the car up , even though it still looks decent . Being outside all the time has slowly worn away the clear coat on the car , so the finish oxidizes fairly easily now . The proper way to handle this would be a multi-stage polishing , followed by a good wax or sealant . Done correctly this takes hours and is quite tedious - even with an orbital polisher . With this product you effectively reduce those 2-3 steps down to one . It does an admirable job of reducing watermarks , stains , and oxidation while leaving a nice shine and protective wax coating.It can be applied easily by hand , though you 'll get the maximum cleaning and polishing effect from using an orbital buffer . It dries quickly and wipes off easily by hand . Overall a very friendly and effective formula .	1
I 've used Meguire 's cleaner wax for over two decades . The protection and finish are great . What I really like about this wax is that it does not create a build up , as using other waxes like carnuba can do over time.Reading some of the other reviews is frightening ! Please do n't mistake the work `` cleaner '' to mean a substitute for actually washing your car ! ! The cleaner function removes previous wax and oxidants ... but you need to carefully WASH your car before applying this , or any other polish or wax .	1
Great product . It works and is easy to apply and take off . Great shine ! The price can not be beat .	1
Wax went on well and came off pretty good also . do n't get to far ahead of yourself before removing the wax or it take much more elbow grease .	1
This wax leaves a nice shine . Compared to the Meguiars Nxt . Gen Tech wax 2.0 , they are identical as I have both.This leaves a white residue when dried so you can tell when it 's ready to buff off .	1
Meguires has done it again . This product is completely awesome . It 's very easy to apply and remove and it adds an incredibly deep tone and luster to the vehicle 's finish . You wo n't be disappointed in the results .	1
Its good stuff but if you look around you can find clay for cheaper ! ! I will shop elsewhere from now on for clay ! !	1
There are many types of clay out there but this works great on a newer vehicle or one that only needs to be dressed up a bit . Easy to work with and requires little effort . I use a spray lube and have found Mequiars Final Inspection does the job.Make sure the surface is washed before starting.Unless you drop some or have other issues , one bar will be enough for most vehicles . I 've been able to do 3 small cars with one of these bars.You could shop all over and play hit or miss for a couple bucks or just do it right the first time .	1
I try to keep my cars in good shape , and part of my routine is regular use of a detailing clay . A light hand and a good detailing spray ( I use Meguiar 's ) make a huge difference compared to just washing and waxing ... it seems to bring the finish to life in a way that few other things do.As others here point out , detailing an entire vehicle with clay is a lot of work . Even my small cars can take me 4 hours if I do the job in one shot , so I usually do it in stages . My routine is to do one or two sections every time I wash the vehicle . One week I 'll do the top , hood or rear , then the next time it 'll be fenders or doors . Every so often , I 'll do the whole vehicle , but my staged approach lets me get the benefits without spending all day on the task.Compared to other clay products I 've used , Meguiar 's seems less `` aggressive '' while still giving my car that smooth as glass finish . It also does n't leave any sort of residue , and seems to glide on and off with nothing but a hyper-smooth finish left behind.Definitely recommended , and Amazon 's price ca n't be beat .	1
Wish it were cheaper , but I wo n't use a product that might damage the paint on my classic - so I pay the price . Only reason for not giving it another star is how much it costs . Using a stretched out 2x3 inch piece of clay along with the Meguiar 's Detailing Spray for lubrication makes pretty easy work for a step that I 'm not that fond of doing . I 'm always shocked at how much garbage the clay picks up from what looked like a clean paint surface . The smoothness after going over the paint shows that this stuff is working great . Cleaning the car with soap and water is the first step , and using the clay is definitely the necessary second step before moving on to polishing and waxing .	1
Until I went through a detailing class I had never used automobile detailing clay . Once you have used it , you can never go back . Not long ago I detailed a new red Audi A5 that sat on the dealer 's lot for about 6 months . The amount of embedded dirt was amazing .	1
this clay works well with the spary detailer it get the dirty out of the paint for a smooth as glass feel a little work but worth it in the end	1
Wow this stuff really works when used correctly ! I used the Meguire 's Final Inspection spray as a lubricant ( mandatory ) and cleaned off 5 years or road grime from the lower third of my SUV in no time at all . It was heavy and thick and not the paint is smooth as glass . Get a few containers of the clay for a SUV or large car because it does get dirty and you will drop a piece or two during the cleaning process . Meguire 's has some very good How-To video 's demonstrating the proper way to use this product .	1
This is the key to a beautiful , mirror finish on a car - both new and old . I have introduced this to many of my friends who never heard of such a product . Buy lots of it .	1
I used this product with Meguiar 's Quik Detailer spray and I was amazed at the amount of embedded dirt , tree sap and grime the clay removed from the surface of my car 's paint . I used the clay in a small area at a time , about 2 ' X 2 ' until the whole car was done and , my goodness , the surface was so smooth . I then used Meguiar 's Mirror Glaze polish to smooth out some very minute scratches on the clear coat until it was spotless under a light . I finished up with Collinite Marque d'Elegance carnuba wax and the shine is blinding if the car is in the sun . I get so many compliments on my car now . It 's 4 years old and I swear it looks better than the day I bought it . Also , this clay worked really well on cleaning the windshield . After cleaning brake dust from my wheels , I used the clay and the wheels look like they just came off the assembly line . I am very pleased . I am obsessed with keeping my auto detailed because it has been so rewarding to me to have a shiny car .	1
Meguiars is my brand of coice , theres PLENTY of clay in here and it isnt very aggresive at all , just enough to get the job done without marring the paint , and quite malleable	1
This product will do what is says it will do . That being said , it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations . It does not appear very rugged . Nice that it comes with the mount , but again the mount is very thin and light and probably wo n't last very long . Also , the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes . White is ground on the item , while in most cases in the US , black is the ground wire . Where was this thing made ? Again , it is a good price , and a useful product , but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable . Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly .	1
perfect for my camper hook up . It was fairly easy to install and not only has the circular connector , but has the 4 pinconnector also	1
7 Prong connector is the best for use in any towing situation even if you only need a flat 4 lead connection . This unit is well used on rigs where you may run into many towed vehicle applications that do not match the 7 pole set up . 4 pole is at the ready if you need it .	1
Great little kit that you can get everywhere but , it 's Amazon pricing ( even less than WallyWorld ) This comes with a mounting bracket , do n't buy on with it . The unit is easy to install and is of sufficient quality that I expect it will last a few good years . Plastic sprung closure of the round , rubber pop cap for the 5er.. I like this on my Tahoe and wiring was just a google away .	1
First of all , THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET ! For the first time ever , I did n't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as `` frequently purchased together '' . On the flip side though , I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy . The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion should n't be an issue . Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well . The wires are heavy ( enough ) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus , though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it . Everything needed to mount it is included but it 's very soft steel and strips with little effort . Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle .	1
Easy to install , setup , wire up and use . Its nice to have one connection point and be able to plug pin what ever kind of trailer you might want to tow . It works great with my camper , snow mobile trailer , ATV trailer and my old beater gravel , dirt and construction material trailer.Installation : If you have a 4 wire harness already installed ( like I did ) you can just plug into that for all the lights , blinkers and brake lights , then simply add a break controller for trailer breaking and connect to the wiring on the multi tow adapter . It also has pass through power connections for your attached trailer- which is great for charging your camper batteries while driving down the road . We used this feature all summer while dry camping ( camping with out plug in power ) all over the midwest United States .	1
The Multi-Tow Adapter is needed to supply multiple trailer use .	1
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels . can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely	1
I use these inline on Aux Lighting , they work perfectly . Rather than having to cut wires , I can simply unplug these and dismount the light . Save so much time and they are weather resistant . I use some Diode Grease to protect the internals from moisture and have had no issues at all .	1
Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room . I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it . Do n't have to crawl under to hook it up .	1
I cut this extention in half and either solder and use shrink tube or use but connectors with shrink tube and have used it on my bikes or vehicles ove the years as add on accessory disconnects . I use the red as positive and the white as negative and the exposed white connetor with the covered red connector to connect to the battery to protect the wire from shorting out .	1
what I needed was rewireable or pigtail 2-pin connectors but those do n't seem easy to find . maybe if there was an RV store near me , but ... but honestly finding this was even better . and the price is unbelievable . ( what I really needed these for , is to cut in half and reverse the polarity . yeah , I know , danger will robinson . but it turns out that chaining up certain other connectors on my solar system results in wrong polarity in the first place , so to fix that ... yeah , it scares me too . )	1
Pretty basic design executed well . Good and tight fit with a quality feeling rubber shielding the metal . The wire seems pretty thick . I have n't spliced it so i 'm not sure if its a copper or aluminum wire . I guess they could have made it of poorer quality and it would still work but for this one they decided to take an extra step and should last a long time without issues .	1
Fast service , great pricing and to top it off I liked this so well I will be back and will recommend to others . I have no reservation about this product or seller .	1
I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night . I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights . They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground .	1
I needed to extend the length of the reach of the charge controller in my solar panel system setting , and after checking the prices of the extensions for sale , I decided to make my own.I bought these to cut in half and use at the end of the wires . These work so good that soon I 'll be ordering more , because I 'm planning to build a battery bank , and using these will lower the cost for sure.Also , they are easy and secure to disconnect and reconnect to the different component within the solar panel system setting .	1
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two . I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China & # 8230 ; with free shipping & # 8230 ; and they are working fine . These aren & # 8217 ; t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors . You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender . The description states a length of 12-inches & # 8230 ; but it & # 8217 ; s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors . Nice item for the price and it & # 8217 ; s made in Mexico .	1
Easy to install . I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on . I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket .	1
If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is , always non-functional . this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly .	1
This works fantastic at keeping your Hopkins brand trailer wiring harness secure and looking good . With some minor modification I used this in conjunction with a Curt 58001 Easy Mount Electrical Bracket for 2 & # 34 ; Receiver Tube and am extremely pleased .	1
This item was purchased because my landscape trailer was constantly pulling my harnesses apart , they would drag the street all the time . This is a simple bracket you install on your hitch or bumper that keeps the light harness stationary . I will never again go without this bracket . matter of fact I plan to order a few more so I have them when I upgrade or buy more trucks for my company . I highly recommend this product if you pull any kind of trailer .	1
My tow bar had the bracket welded on it , so it was easy to install . Really looks great , no more loose wires .	1
The picture is slightly misleading . This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring . But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable . The bracket is flat on one side , and curved on the other . The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . The connector on the end of my T connector fits well , and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . It sure beets having the connector flopping around !	1
Along with the light plug I bought , the two in combination worked great . Easy mounting and complete with screws . Made the project easy to do . A very short process and I had lights to my trailer .	1
The bracket was great , but as it turned out it was not needed because the multi-tow adapter came with one . Amazon credited me and said do n't bother sending back . Very pleased with amazon .	1
I used it as a doubler to get better support with the Hopkins 47185 Multi-Tow Adapter kit . It makes the plug much more rigid when plugging in and unplugging my camper connection .	1
This is a well worth the money adapter for automotive uses . If you need an adapter and do n't want to pay double at the store order here and get great shipping and receiving of the product . Works great with all my vehicles and trailers . Thank you again Amazon for the selling another good product cheaper ...	1
Bought this for my 2012 Tahoe , works really good , makes good contact and no issues so far . Real good purchase .	1
I like these allot they do a great job . Screwed up and lost one so I replaced it . I love the test lights on this one and they have a 7 5 4 that is very convenient . I prefer to wire evey truck and car with the 7 blades and go from there with adapters . As long as your vehicle was wired right to USA uniform standards you will be pleased . They are a little bulky but work very well .	1
i like how short this terminal connector is , much shorter then other 7-way plugs i have seen . the light are great to verify that you are getting power through the plug .	1
I sometimes pull a car trailer and this adapter works fine . I have not had any trouble with it making connections .	1
it helps you address wiring issues as soon as yopu pl ; ug in without running around the trailer for a light check .	1
Works well as a way to adapt our car 's 7 blade trailer hookup to also work on our 4 wire bicycle trailer . The LEDs are particularly appreciated , as a way of ensuring proper functioning of trailer lighting to at least that point . The rubber cover for the 4 contacts is also much appreciated.Our lawn mower once ran over this , damaging it enough that we bought another , though the original does still work - despite no longer being quite all there.My only other suggetion is that it 's not always obvious in the dark which side goes up , though it does eventually only fit one way.Recommended !	1
Love this thing - the LED 's are a simple verification and the device seems to fit snug and secure in the socket	1
Seems well made and works as it should . Like the fact it has the LED 's which is a quick and easy way to see if your vehicles wiring is working as it should and can point you in the right direction if you may be having an issue with your trailers lights	1
The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out , and so does this Adapter . But I really would n't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well , with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector , aligning all the pins correctly . It 's a tight fit so that it wo n't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I do n't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested . Frankly , I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway , with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works . I presume the LEDs will tell me if there 's an issue some day .	1
I like it , it is inexpensive , do a good job , and check your connections on the same time . Great item .	1
I hand to do some rewriting due to an accident and this adapter helped me . The diagnostic lights were very useful to troubleshoot the connections . The only complaint is that in my vehicle , a 2009 Ram , this adapter was big enough to block the other connector in my hitch .	1
Not only is this a good adapter to plug your trailer wiring into , but the lighting really helps in diagnosing problems . It told me the side of the wiring the problem lied in , and was able to pinpoint . Sweet !	1
Does what it says , seems to be good quality . I wish the wires were wrapped though . I ended up wrapping the wires with black electrical tape for a cleaner look and additional wire protection .	1
I recently rewired my boat trailer and found out I was a bit short when connecting to my pickup truck . The extra length was just right to connect to my truck .	1
If you need to extend your wiring for sharp turns this is both an easy and geat value way to do so .	1
Nothing special - just a well built 12 & # 34 ; flat-wire extension . Because I have my flat connector mounted to my hitch , I sometimes run into trailer wiring that is just a bit short . This solves that problem . And it does not take up much space in my tool box .	1
These were a very hight quality product and I received them very quickly , thank you Amazon . I ordered three to use for a disconnect system on my scooter , they worked great . I cut them in half and connected them into my lighting system so I could remove the seat frame and the trunk easily .	1
I got these to use with Lexol 1115 Leather Cleaner Spray . Worked great.Using this helped out cleaning my wives ' leather underwear.Now if you had read that , I really used it for my Ford F150 seat , very light tanthat shows dirt like crazy .	1
I bought these to use with the Lexol Leather Cleaner , Conditioner , and Vinylex products . Does what it is intened for and they 're washable for reuse .	1
I love these things . They could be cheaper but are still reasonable and they seem better constructed than other brands I 've purchased . Excellent option for an applicator sponge .	1
They are nothing fancy , some basic terry cloth sponges.I used them to apply waxes and leather care products.I own many fine leather items . When I need to clean them to remove grime and stains , then I prefer to use a terry cloth sponge , rather than a microfiber cloth . When I condition the leather , then I use the microfiber cloth which is much softer.I did n't have much problem with the lint issue , maybe Lexol improved these pads ... . ? I washed them and they held up fine.But I do have to say , I prefer the Viking cotton terry sponge applicators better as those ones have a denser foam and are softer to the touch . In addition , I think the price for these Lexol pads are not such a good value , considering that one pad cost about $ 2.10 . The Viking ones are much better value ... .	1
Nothing special here . Just a firm pad wrapped in cotton to apply cleaner/conditioner . It washes easily and applies well .	1
I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car . The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use . They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning .	1
I try to avoid doing rear brake jobs with drums as best a possible ... .LOLSo to that end , i have only used this tool a few times.It 's effectiveness really depends on the design of the brake job you 're doing . But it 's been really good so far for me.Doing rear brakes is like going to battle . Every fight is going to be different so you have to find the right & # 34 ; Weapon & # 34 ; to do battle with . Not Like doing caliper brakes . What do you use ? ? ? Sockets and wrenches and DONE ! ! ! ! With rear brakes it feels like you will use anything you can find that will help you win the battle . LOL ! ! ! ! you just have to becareful not to bend the springs when using this tool cause it can happen really easily.It 's very handy to have in your arsenal of tools .	1
I bought this product to get at stubborn brake springs . It works very well as long as you use it correctly . The one I received is not the black one in the picture . The one that I got is a red handle , but they both do the same job.I recommend this tool !	1
So I had the misfortune of having to replace my brakes recently . I purchased one of these brakes spring tools and I am glad I did . You will see that the end piece of this tool , which has a one inch adjuster , the black piece . Slip the grooved area onto the straight part of the spring and turn the handle to tighten ; it sure does make it a lot easier to stretch a new spring . I have tried to remove the springs with a vise grip and pliers but the brake spring tool is so much easier and Best $ 5 I have spent on a long time !	1
works great , high quality , very sturdy even with the toughest of springs , great price , a must have tool for some vehicles in the shop . saved me more then once !	1
this pad spreader worked on my silverado 3500 just as it was suppose to , and never got in a bind on time	1
This made retracing the brake piston a breeze . Made changing my brakes much easier . I highly recommend this product for brake jobs .	1
Once in a while you will come across one of these inexpensive items that performs a very specific function , and it looks like a gimmick that is too good to be true . That is not the case with this brake pad spreader . It works perfectly for the job it was designed for . You could probably do something similar with a c-clamp and a small piece of plywood , but I would spend the money on this again instead of fumbling with that kind of setup .	1
total time saver . Never leave home without it sorta deal . Once you have one , you 'll wonder how you did without .	1
used this for the first time last week to push the calipers back when i changed brake pads . simple and easy to use without any tools . made quick work of a brake change .	1
Sure you can use a C clamp or a adjustable wrench but this is n't very expensive and looks to be of reasonable construction . My only issue is I have everything to install brakes but I 've been waiting for almost 3 weeks for a floor jack to ship and I 'll be damned if I 'm breaking out the jack out of my trunk when quality floor jack is on order . Ok finally used this tool and all I can say is Perfect ! Works just as it should , I tightened in small slow increments and let the piston settle all the way back . Made adding the pads a dream , now if there was a way to keep the freak'n pads in place till you slide the caliper back in place ! lol	1
I used this to change my front brakes recently . I had never used a tool like this before . I 've always just used a C-Clamp on the caliper . This tool was very simple to use . You just put an old brake pad on the caliper piston , stick the tool in the caliper , and turn the knob . The tool feels sturdy enough to last through many brake jobs . It is easy to use . It was a little more difficult for my car because it has 2 piston front brake calipers , so I had to go back and forth in the caliper to make sure that both pistons got compressed . It still was not hard to use , it just took a few minutes longer.I am very pleased . I would buy this again , but based on how this felt when using it , I do n't think I will have to .	1
Great tool for the price i keep one in my box at work and it holds up to everyday use . very sturdy does n't feel cheap like other competitors and a lot easier then using big pliers or c clamps . there are better and faster caliper piston compressors out there but are more expensive and for the price you cant beat this one for home or professional use lisle makes a great product .	1
It woked really well when I changed the pads on my BMW . Safer than using c-clamps .	1
This is such a useful tool when doing brake jobs . Simply place the tabs in between the pads and twist to push the pistons back . There is no need for positioning a C clamp or using vice grips and an extra set of hand to squeeze the pistons back .	1
This product is simple to use on single or dual piston calipers . Just put the brake pads in and screw them out . I now do not have to use bulky spreaders anymore . If it ever breaks good luck , otc is not stamped anywhere on it though .	1
good strong spreader , gets really small to fit between pads . perfect for when you are just refinishing rotors and leaving pads in place .	1
I purchased this spreader for my shop and have not regretted it . We use it on any 4 or 6 piston caliper . Simply pull the caliper off the vehicle with the pads still installed in the caliper , place the tool between the pads and spread them open . Every tool box should have one of these .	1
I use as this a lubricant when claying a car . Have tried many things including soapy water but , this stuff makes the job so easy it 's almost effortless.Works great for touch up work too .	1
Ive used just about every spray detailer out there and this has a noticeably better shine and durability then anything Ive ever used .	1
I have used this products for years for quick touch ups in between washes . It is great for removing bird droppings or other unfortunate spots between washes .	1
This works on par with mothers showtime spray lubricant and as final once over the car so it 's perfect . Good for using as a pad lubricant when cutting , polishing , and waxing .	1
I own my own detailing business and use this product exclusively for three purposes . 1 . As a clay lubricant for paint contamination removal and 2 . Putting the finishing touch on vehicles that are freshly painted and/or have had recent body work . I love the fact that it 's body shop safe , and 3 . Prepping my polishing pads . Otherwise , for anything else I use Meguiars synthetic spray detailer that wipes off even easier and has the added benefit of putting a protective `` film '' over the vehicle . Another great product by Meguiars .	1
This is excellent quick cleaner of compound , polish and light dust . Also excellent for use with a clay bar ! Highly recommended ! Also removes finger prints exceptionally well and fast .	1
This gallon is more than enough product to maintain a waxed car after wash , always bring a spray bottle full with you & microfiber to dry & buff after a touchless wash , or hand was if you are n't waxing that day . Deep gloss & no streaks !	1
Had my 13 yr old car painted and the body shop said no waxing for 90 days to let the paint out gas . I live in FL with bug season and water spots from washing and general dirt abound . Called Meguries and this stuff is body shop safe . Which means it will let the new paint out gas . I have been using it with excellent results between washes . Once the 90- days are up I will use a permeate wax.For really tough bug stains I use DP Detailers road kill bug remover and then the final inspection to bring the shine back . On very light bug splats the Final inspection works fine .	1
I use this item . I use alot of Meguiar 's products for my detailing . You do n't need alot to make it happen , SW	1
Works great ! I did a wash , clay , and wax last week , and this was my final step.. .. looked GREAT !	1
I saw this product recommended on another forum . Having used Meguiars products over the years I figured I would give this one a shot . It works well in between full polish / waxings or cleaning up the paint with a clay bar . Recommend .	1
I have a very unique finish on the tins of one of my bikes ; it 's a triple plate gold with a clear coat finish and for six months I could n't wax it , polish it or generally touch it . Even now I have to be very careful with the products that I use on it , but I 've never had a problem with Meguiar 's final inspection . In fact even when I was n't allowed to wax the finish , I still could use FI 34 to remove dust from the bike . When I do n't have time to wash , polish and detail the bike a quick squirt of this ingenious product and a wipe down with a MF cloth and I 'm on my way . Bike looks new ! It lasts and lasts too - although that could because I 'm using it on a bike ! Ultimately , always have a bottle of this in your garage regardless of your vehicle type .	1
This is an excellent product , and it does exactly what it says it does . It gently buffs out those irritating swirls that somehow develop over time in the finish of every car . I use a Porter Cable 7424XP buffer , and it makes for a great combination . I 've recently started using more and more Meguiar 's products , and I have n't been disappointed .	1
It 's intended for easy cutting the paint . A nice thing Meguiar 's been doig is having the scale shown on the label . This is one of the lowest indexes available for paint cutting.For the amount it comes ( 16oz ) it should last for about years to come using on a single car.I 'll try it with my PorterCable to figure out if it was a good purchase and this will be updated . If the case , I 'll buy from other brands like Wolfgang or Black Diamond ( better rated but 2x the price ) . Anyways , wait for the update .	1
Since my car is only 2 years old , I chose this Meguiar 's # 9 Swirl remover as I did n't want to have anything too aggressive . The paint was not in too bad a shape as I always used the 2 bucket hand wash method . Just light swirling on my grabber blue paint . To prepare the surface I washed the car then used Meguiar 's clay bar to remove any embedded matter in the paint . Surprising what is in there after only 2 years even though the paint looked clean to the naked eye . After the claying I got out the Porter Cable polisher . Since this is an orbital polisher it is good for anyone who is new to using a power tool on your paint . This was my first time . It was quite simple actually . I mentally divided the hood into 5 section and did one at a time putting an X pattern on the Meguiar 's polishing pad with the # 9 Swirl remover . I did 4 section passes on each area and then used a microfiber towel to take off the excess polish . I could immediately see that the pad I used ( Meguiar 's 6.5-Inch Soft Buff Foam Polishing Pad ) was just enough to do an excellent job . You see , since the paint was only 2 years old I did n't need a too aggressive polish , or a pad that cut too much . So if your car is in similar condition this may be a good combination for you . This I guess is why you do a test are first and not the whole car . After I was satisfied that this was the right combination , I moved on and finished the car . If it did not do the trick , I could use more pressure , a more aggressive pad , ramp up the speed on the polisher ( I used setting 5 for this ) or maybe bought a more aggressive polish . I really liked this stuff . Quite easy to do and I was n't afraid that the polish would burn through my clear coat . I finished it up with Meguiar 's liquid Ultimate Wax . The car looked when I waxed it the first time . I might try topping it off with some carnauba wax , but its not really needed .	1
This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover . While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint . If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar 's Ultimate Wax . ( paste or liquid )	1
This stuff works pretty well at removing light swirls and scratches . They take seconds to get in your clearcoat and hours to remove if done properly.There were some deep defects that were diminished but I didnt want to burn through the clear as I have not done paint repair before . This is the Pro version of Swirlx and I tried them side by side and this works better than Swirlx . Maybe its the placebo effect but most of the swirls are gone without any damage to the paint using a cheap Harbor freight DA polisher and their orange compounding pad . I did follow this up with Ultimate polish then Mirror glaze for a really good black finish .	1
I 've used the Meguiar 's professional line for years and couple them with the Meguiars pads used on a Porter Cable 7424 random orbital polished . Results are outstanding . This time , I had to rescue the finish from an incompetent transport company that wiped down the car dry trying to be & # 34 ; helpful & # 34 ; leaving it a mass of swirl marks . Even this was n't abrasive enough to remove them , had to go the low cut cleaner first then this polish and all is right with the world . Two potential problems with this product - if you use an orbital polisher that is n't random , you 'll likely burn through your paint if you are not a pro . Second , DO NOT let the product dry before wiping off and when wiping off , a very damp cloth helps a lot . Change the cloth ( micro fiber preferred ) frequently ( I use about a dozen to do a small Mazda Miata as they will load up quickly ) . Use the product sparingly - a little does a lot .	1
Product works great ! Ca n't speak much for durability , but it seems like the hard ( but pliable ) plastic tube would be easy to pinch . The end piece has good length , good to reach in hard to reach spots to hear what is going on .	1
The Stethoscope is very sensitive and works great for pin pointing out problems in a engine that you need isolate.The ear grommets are rubber witch makes it more comfortable to use .	1
If you do a lot of work with bearings or bearing assemblies , this can be a useful tool . You simply hold the end of the probe against the housing or stationary bearing race , and listen . A grinding or crunching sound means the bearing is rough/dry . Used properly , it can save a lot of diagnostic time . Quality seems to be good .	1
This is a great product at a great price . I used it to listen to the cam banks on my BMW to isolate which the noise is coming from and what the root cause might be . It 's the first time I have used a device like this but it 's amazing how effective a simple , old school device like this is . Considering how much vehicles cost , mechanics charge per hour , parts cost , etc. , this tool is indispensible .	1
I was first introduced to a mechanics stethoscope quite a few years ago when I used to use a regular physicians stethoscope I had picked up somewhere when needed for car repairs . I located a mechanics model in a catalog and ordered it there . I found it to be far more versatile with its long stem conductor instead of the flat plastic head on a physicians model , as well as much easier to use by design . About a year ago my old stethoscope got run over during one of my more intense repairs , and I have since picked up this very same Lisle model from a local parts store . The price here on Amazon for this 52500 model is cheaper than what I paid , and at the time of this writing ships free when bundled . Although there are more expensive models available on Amazon , I can not imagine anyone needing anything more than what this one offers . Its solid , durable , and very comfortable to wear.I should point out that a mechanics stethoscope is one of the most versatile tools you can own . Even if you never do any work on cars . You would not believe the number of uses one finds for this instrument when you have one around . Ever have one of those annoying squeaks or rattles inside your car , or some other place that you ca n't exactly pin down no matter how close you seem to get to it ? With this baby you will find ground zero on the squeak in a couple of minutes . In addition to cars , you can easily locate squeaks or noises in any kind of machinery , or in your homes floor and walls . I even used mine to locate an irritating squeak on a neighbors sewing machine . It is very easy to use , and even a lot of fun at times.As for this model versus a higher priced one , unless you 're a highly paid specialist of some kind that prefers the very best , I would pass up the more expensive scopes available here or anywhere else and buy this one . It is all the scope most of us should ever need , and one of the most handy and versatile tools to have in your home or garage ... .. Recommended .	1
Just got mine scope today . Tried it and noticed how sensitive it was . I can hear my own heartbeat with it . Hell I can even hear my own vein/artery pulse ( very low ) with it . The overall build quality is flimsy ( bad ) , so that was a bit disappointing . The long probe tip shown in the picture is very fragile ( easy to bend ) , so be careful . While I can not compare it with any other , I can say it should come in handy in the future , just keep it in a padded sturdy case of some sort , and you may have to disassemble it prior to storing it , since it is fairly long - about 16 '' with the least bend radius allowable . The ear buds are a bit tight , it hurts my ears to use it after a short while . Again , it is extremely sensitive to sounds , even touching any part of it produces a lot of sounds , so keep that in mind when you use it . Some sounds will be `` distracting '' , and the user may have a hard time discerning the real cause of the noise ( on a car ) from you touching/bumping/moving the probe around the car.For the price , its worth it , free shipping and all .	1
Even without a lot of mechanic knowledge or doing much mechanic work , this item is worth the price . Stick here or there and hear what you ca n't otherwise . It is great for the person shopping for a used car and you will know when you hear something that is n't right.As for the home mechanic , it is invaluable in pinpointing where things are wrong . Fuel injectors , pistons , valves , anything that moves.And for the computer tech , I have also found this device is great for finding soon to be faulty harddrives . You can hear everything that is going on without disconnecting anything . Long before real problems come up , this thing can find them.As for quality , it really is just a plastic tube with the correct diaphragm at the end to convert the metal pole vibrations to audible noise . Its is FAR better than naked ears , but there are many products out there that are better than this . As valuable as it has been , I would have paid for a better quality version if I were to buy one again .	1
Solid construction . Great price . Comfortable and easy to use . It 's quite sensitive . I did n't want to use my medical stethoscope to isolate engine sounds . The long probe on this is designed specifically for that purpose and works well .	1
Find out which pulley is whining . Comes with a nice extender for those hard to reach areas , very clear ! I would recommend to anyone .	1
Something as simple as a stethoscope can be the catalyst towards a successful repair or failure . Comes in handy for noises that you ca n't find with just a flashlight .	1
I usually have to wait for someone to be around to help whenever I perform a brake job on one of my kids cars . But this little tool works like a charm and makes my life a bit easier . Well worth the money spent . Seems very well made . I take very good care of my tools , so this will last many , many years with no trouble or problems .	1
After having several other brands die after one or two uses , it 's nice to finally have a tool that works every time .	1
Well , to start , the only thing that I will complain about is the reservoir jar.It 's not well made ( may leak air ) , and does n't hold that much liquid.I ended up building my own with a mason jar and two nozzles from a local hardware store.Other than the jar , I 'm very happy with the kit , especially the the pump.The pump is well made , solid construction with all metal . The gauge is movable.It has two settings , pump or suction.I used the kit on the following projects the past year:1.. Oil change on mower.Experience : Worked great.2.. Oil Change on Generator.Experience : Worked great.3.. Brake fluid change.Experience : not so great . No fault to the pump or the kit setup.When using suction with brake fluid change , the fluid does n't come out in a nice uniform motion where I can examine the bubbles , for example . The fluid comes out in the tube with a roller coaster fashion ( ca n't see anything . ) I think next time I 'll go back to the 2-man setup.If anyone has a recommendation on this please let me know.Overall , a great kit ( great pump ) , and would recommend to others .	1
this is a high quality vacuum/pressure pump , with a nice assortment of lines and connectors . it 's great for testing vacuum operated devices in automotive , like purge solenoids and egr valve , but not that great as a one man brake bleeder . yes , it will get some fluid flowing out a bleed port , but not with enough volume to be able to determine if you have removed all the air . tried it on a few different vehicles but ended up resorting to the old 2 man method on each and good thing , as there was still air left on each . still , a very useful tool .	1
Great kit , high quality .	1
I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic . I have not used the pump on the truck , yet , but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions : vacuum and pressure , which are selected with a knob on the side . The pressure release valve has a large handle , but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure . The gauge swivels , so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring . It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure , nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $ 72.00 , Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump ( single function and came with broken pressure release valve ) handily.Even though it will be extra expense , I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid . I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container .	1
Used this to diagnose my EVAP system in my 03 grand cherokee . Had a few cracked hoses and a faulty leak detection pump . This allowed me to rule out the duty cycle purge valve ( ~ $ 100 ) , the vent valve ( ~ $ 15 ) , the vapor canister ( ~ $ 100 ) , and also helped me diagnose the leak detection pump failing . It has already paid for itself .	1
Has some cleaning power to it , but nothing like an all purpose cleaner . Leaves a semi glossy appearance behind . Not too glossy but not matte . It 's been about a month and it 's still on my dash .	1
I have been addicted to Final Inspection for years and would never have a vehicle without it in my trunk . This is equally as nice for the interior vinyl and rubber weatherstripping and hoses under the hood . It 's non greasy and takes no time to apply .	1
This product really works great for any type of rubber/vinyl/plastic . However , this item was purchased for a specific purpose , when you detail a car no matter how good you are you will get some wax splatter in places that you never intended , ie rubber weatherstripping , this stuff will take dried wax splatter off perfectly . Highly recommend this product and highly recommend this item for any detailers bag.Advice use this product ASAP on dried wax , do not let the wax become sun baked ! Also perhaps you 'll have better luck than I , but I have yet to have one of these bottle arrive intact from Amazon , bottles are usually leaking contents upon arrival .	1
This worked great to make my vinyl look good inside . Not good like shiny-glistening , but good like Rich and Full . I have a little red rocket ( WRX ) and it looks so NICE now !	1
Great all around product with strong uv protection especially important here in Florida . Used another product that really screwed up my dash board . This fixed it right up and does not leave a shinny surface that is going to reflect in your windshield . I would describe the finish it leaves as satin . I would suggest spraying it on a cloth when doing your dash board so as not to get it on the inside of the windshield . If you just want to use one product for all your rubber and vinyl this is it .	1
I 've used this product for at least 2 decades . You wo n't find this at you local stores . I used to buy it at the car shows . Now I can get it here . Thank you Amazon.com.It 's quite simply the best rubber cleaner/conditioner on the market . I use it on all my door seals every month .	1
I LOVE YOU - I LOVE YOU - I LOVE YOUThis is my favorite wax.Put down some # 21 first and cover it up with # 26a few months and Sha Bam , bitches get in ! ( Just do n't get dirt on my mats )	1
this is an excellent final coat wax for your car . In my case I use the Meguiar 's NXT polish , wait several hours to let it cure , then apply this wax . I use it on my car that has color ( my other car is white ) . Be aware , it is harder to buff this . I maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time I used it . ( I washed , clayed , hand compounded , then did 2 coats of wax ) . The next car I did I paced myself and washed/ compounded one day . Then the next day I polished and waxed the car .	1
My car is looking Tits baby ! ! Use this for some deep shine in the sun ! ! I love all Meguiars products !	1
First off , do n't get turned off by the name , Yellow is the color of the stuff , it wo n't turn your paint yellow ! It does look great on yellow paint though , also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black . For lighter colors you are better off going with something else , Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros : -DRIPPY wet looks . You 'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint , its that wet ! -Decent durability , approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons : -Stains trim ( rubber , black plastic ) -Needs to be applied very thin , otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall , this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great . its a total steal at the price .	1
Great product , leaves cars feeling smoother than a babies bottom ! ! Also gives paint a great depth and sparkle , would recommend this to anyone !	1
I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty . Gives a nice shine and reflection .	1
Meguiar 's has a reputation of making excellent car care products and this one is no exception . It goes on and comes off easy . I applied their sealer on my new Caddy and then followed it with this wax . ( All by hand . ) It looks amazing . The shine is so bright it almost hurts . It really pulled out the color of the paint . It gave a depth that I did n't see when it came from the dealer . It looks like a candy apple red after the Meguiar 's treatment . It looks so good I 'm almost afraid to drive it . : ) This is supposed to be long lasting wax , so my plan is to only wax once a year . I 'll provide an update if there are any changes .	1
This is a great wax . I live in Chicago so weather can be kind of crazy . This wax lasts about 3 washes for me until I need to reapply more .	1
I have used meguiars car products for years . This wax goes on easy and comes off very easily . I polish and wax car twice a year and it still has that new car look . I always polish it FIRST , with meguiars mirror glaze car polish , then wax with high tech just twice a year and cars always look new .	1
I 'm not saying it 's a bad thing or whatsoever , if you have n't tried this then you will love it . Will give you the deep glossy look similar from the gold class or maybe slightly better . it comes easy on and easy off . Did my entire car in less then 30mins with the DA machine . longevity , well as what you expected from a carnauba wax . good for around 4-6weeks .	1
I have a 2007 RAV 4 V6 and change my own oil . This tool fits the cannister perfectly and makes installing a new filter cartridge and `` O '' rings a snap . You just need a common 3/8 '' rachet driver to fit the hole . Worth every penny for this well made , accurate , quality product . If you have one of the 65 mm canister type filter housings , and change your own oil , you ca n't do better than this . Highly recommended .	1
Great quality , heavy duty with secure center . Should never bend or have the center piece come separate from the body . Fits perfectly on my Honda oil filters . Much better than the standard ones in auto parts stores . Would definitely buy again .	1
Works well on our Lexus ES350 , and a good affordable aternative to OEM . What I do n't like is the nut is spot-welded with six tiny welds to the wrench part . It 's holding up but I would rather see a continuos bead weld where the two parts meet .	1
There are many pros to the K-D End Cap Oil Filter Wrench : It is bright , like polished stainless steel . That makes it easy to see , especially if dropped into a dark place . Try looking for a black wrench that has fallen into a dark engine well . It cleans up nicely . All of the oil and grit is easy to see . The K-D is only 5/8ths of an inch deep . Why is this good ? That 's all the grip that is needed . I bought a whole set of oil cap wrenches in a pretty red case from Sears trying to save a few bucks . The wells were over 1 inch deep . On many of today 's new motors , there is not enough room to get a deep-well wrench on the filter . For example , I bought two brands of oil cap wrenches trying to find one that would fit a 29-HP Kawasaki engine on a Scag Turf Tiger . They both failed . One would n't even go onto the oil filter . The one that would go on would not come off after loosening one turn . So , refusing to give up , I tried the K-D . It fit perfectly . As far as I 'm concerned , the rest of my oil cap wrenches are garbage . I 'll buy only K-D - `` Made in the USA '' - from Amazon.Com . You get what you pay for .	1
I have had this cap wrench for 20 years , I first bought it for my 1993 Tercel . It worked on the metal canister oil filters of the Tercel and it also works on my 2012 Camry 4 cyl as well . I can not understand the large number of reviews stating that this wrench broke - how tight are the oil filters they are removing ? ? ? I can not imagine this one breaking if the oil filter is installed properly . The only complaint I have is it sticks to the filter housing ( both the metal filter of the 1993 Tercel and plastic housing on the 2012 Camry ) so you have to rock it back and forth with your ratchet to get it off .	1
I needed a decent filter wrench for my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel . The filter is up beside the engine and is best reached from below . This wrench grips the round Amsoil Filter , Which is not wrench friendly with it 's smooth surface . It holds the filter securely while I turn it with my 3/8 & # 34 ; ratchet using a nine & # 34 ; extension . Make sure you get the right size range for your filter size .	1
This works on everything ! ! ! But its awesome ! ! haha i personally do alot of oil changes for the family and alot of my friends have borrowed and used this too , and we love it ! Some oil filters are a bit small for this wrench , but it works really well on medium sized oil filters . Before the ownership of this oil filter wrench , i had so many cases where the oil filter literally just melted shut onto the thread . When i was young , i knew no better , so i would take a screw driver and stab it through one side then to the other and use the screwdriver for increase of torque ! hahaha It was tough ... a bit funny , and really really messy . but now i never have to deal with that again . Until this breaks of course . So far so good though ! ! ! Great buy ! ! !	1
Use the tool everyday , I think I loan it out too much lol . Great tool to have for a beginning GS	1
Given as a gift to my son in law and one for myself , this wrench does a great job of getting the filter off with ease.I would recommend it to every one that needs a good filter wrench .	1
These are great , everyone should have them in the toolbox . I lost my old strap oil filter wrench and these are great for the replacement . Get one or two , you 'll be happy you did .	1
If you need to change the filter on a 1984 Isuzu engine WITH THE SUPER FAT FILTER and do not have this tool and somebody else installed the filter with more than per instructed hand tight you are without this tool in a world of hurt.Granted this too is hard to manipulate and the spring falls off but it is cheap and it will work YOU NEED IT NUFF SAID .	1
I had one of there before and it got lost so I got a new one here . This is a great way to remove oil filters in places where there is only access from the bottom of the filter like newer Subaru cars . Dependable quality and reasonably priced .	1
For years I used a band type filter removal tool . With the new vehicles going to smaller ( thinner ) filters , the band was n't cutting it . My search for a better filter removal tool brought me here.I like to tighten my oil filters as tight as I can by hand , so I always use a removal tool to loosen it . This tool has never failed to easily loosen the oil filter in all our vehicles.The pros : + Low cost , which includes free shipping.+ This tool fits 2-1/2 '' to 3-1/8 '' filters.The cons : - None that I can think of . : )	1
So far I have used this on my lawnmower filter ( John Deere D110 ) and Acura Integra . Its awesome because it GRIPS ! No slippage on the filter , no falling off , ad no need for multiple oil filter sockets . This is a must have item if you change oil yourself .	1
I got this for my waverunner oil filter . I was unable to remove the filter with any other wrench and this one really grips the small filter .	1
Great tool to have for stubborn filters . Great starting tool for a new General Service Tech . Really good for Subaru 's	1
If you 've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru , you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way . With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8 & # 34 ; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day . I 'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit . Well worth the cash if you ask me .	1
work great for my John Deere X500	1
I have needed this tool for years.The old style metal tape filter wrench never did do the job right.Now I have a very dependable tool that will remove the filter quickly.I highly recommend getting one of these for your tool box .	1
Very high quality oil filter wrench and it 's made in USA ! Needs 3/8 '' wrench and gives good leverage to get the oil filter out . Got this after I struggled with oil filter plier bought from a local B & M store . Hoping to use this for a long time !	1
Lisle , great products an I love the quality of them and have had them for many years ! You get what you pay for	1
I bought this wrench to remove the oil filters on my arctic cat quads . I can never get them off and have resorted to punching holes in them with a screwdriver and then turning the screwdriver to remove the filter . This wrench worked like a charm and I no longer have to tear up the oil filter to remove it .	1
This tool surprised me . It is made extremely well , I ca n't over-state this . This will fit 99.9 % of all oil filters , and there is no struggling with other types of tools/wrenches . It has a spring mechanism where you simply put a ratchet on this and it self fits to any size filter.. and you twist . Great grip , .. best wrench I 've ever used and being universal mean you never need to swap out for another for any other vehicles/tractors , etc . This replaces a dozen other tools .	1
i have all the others and they do n't come close , makes the job fast and reliable . though one time it started crushing the filter I was worried once it crushes there 's no way to use this tool . I found it was on the edge of the filter moved it up more and it came right off.wish I had this decades ago	1
The oil filter on my Kubota tractor was cranked on tight by the dealership , and no oil filter wrench seemed to be able to get it off.This one did , and I was able to change my own oil.This filter also fits other sizes , too , so I can use it on my other vehicles .	1
This is the one to buy ! Pros : - Cheap- Just the right size to remove the blue oil filter on my 2011 Subaru WRX . Attaches to a standard 3/4 '' ratchet . Has n't seen a filter on my car that it could n't remove.- If you 're not sure about your filter size , it comes with a template on the back so you can measure up your car 's filter against it to see if it works for you before you open it . I like that it has a good range of filters it can accommodate.Cons : - For filters that have been overtightened ( i.e . at the dealership ) , it permanently dents the filter , but who cares ? It does n't dent the filters I installed to the proper tightening specification.- Packaging is kind of weaksauce , but I could care less.- It 's not very pretty , and the spring and mechanism are all exposed , but again , this tool is about functionality and you only use it once every couple months .	1
Bought this after I could not remove a tight filter from my 2008 Camry with a cap-type remover . This slips on the filter easily in confined spaces and grips the can well , thanks to the two spring-retained semicircles on this tool . Looks like this is very well made and should outlast me . Well worth the price to end the frustration of a frozen filter !	1
This is the best solution I 've used for an all-in-one oil filter wrench ( although you actually need 2 to cover the majority of sizes ) . It works only to loosen , not to tighten - and of course you 'd never want to tighten an oil filter with a tool anyway . Very nice.Note that this is listed on Amazon at least twice , and one is priced almost three times as much as the other .	1
No oil filter within its size that this tool can not open . Buy it once and no need to buy anything again .	1
This item is primarily used for REMOVAL , not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand . The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn . The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer . Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes . I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle . I probably wo n't have to use it ever again . In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars , I 've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount .	1
Great , versatile oil filter . I have a Passat and couldnt find a wrench to fit it easily . Bought this and it works great .	1
For the longest time I 've avoided changing the oil on my wife 's Camry myself simply because it 's so cramped under the car and I could hardly even get my hand in to reach the oil filter , let alone get a traditional filter wrench up there . Well , I finally got sick of paying $ 85 for Jiffy Lube to change the oil and decided to give this tool a try . Worked like a charm . I popped my 3/8 '' drive socket extension onto the back , slide it over the filter , tightened down , and it popped right off without crushing . Could n't have been any easier . This time around I replaced the filter with a K & N ; filter that has the 1-inch nut on top since that 's what I 'd already bought , but I may start using this tool and traditional K & N ; filters in the future just because it was so easy and it 'd save me about $ 3 a filter.If you 've never spent more than 5 seconds trying to loosen an oil filter , do yourself a favor and get this . It 'll literally be that quick .	1
This seems like a well-made tool . Good design , quality materials , solid construction . Had a tough time removing my factory-installed filter , but this tool made the job a snap . And a good price , too . Highly recommended .	1
I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since : Accord , Civic , Integra , GTI , 240SX , 200SX , Maxima , Sentra and I could go on ... You name it and it works . If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches , it may not be ideal . In my opinion , it 's worked on 95 % of the vehicles I 've owned and this tool is awesome !	1
If you are going to have oil change at home than you must have this good US made oil filter tool .	1
I bought this unit for hard to reach grease fittings . So far I have used it to gease u joints . Works decent .	1
I have a zerk fitting that is in a difficult spot . Be sides that the standard coupler would n't fit , I could n't hit the zerk fitting head on either . I have to go in at a slight angle , which made this job a real challenge.I bought two other types of adapters from local auto parts stores without any success.One was the rubber tip , and the other was 4 '' needle adapter . Both failed . Rubber tip could n't hold the pressure , leak grease around the rubber edge . The 4 '' needle adapter was too long and the tip angle was too wide.Bought Lincoln needle nozzle next and it was perfect for this . The tip was narrow , sharper angle , and the right length . It fits on my grease pump without any problems . I was really happy that I got the ball joint greased up . I would buy this again .	1
I needed this for the newer style u-joint grease fittings ( not zerks ) . There is no other efficient way to grease these new fittings without this injector . The picture does n't show it , but the tip has a coating on it almost like bed lining to seal against the ball seat . I have n't tried it on conventional zerk fittings , but I do n't see why it would n't work , especially on hard to reach/limited access fittings . I 'm going to buy another one as backup since I ca n't find one locally .	1
Works very well , just remove your zirk fitting on your gun and have at it.Gets into those tight places , tie rod ends ball joints , etc .	1
Will work great for what I bought it for.Have n't used it yet and will post if it turns out to be a pos .	1
I 've done 3 oil changes on my BMW 330xi with this vacuum , and its still going strong . It removes oil quickly and without mess.I 've been cleaning mine out with gasoline after i use it . Im not sure if this will make the vac last longer , but im hoping so . Definitely worth $ 80 .	1
I bought this back in march 2009 , and have had nothing but flawless oil changes with it.In that time I have performed two lawn mower oil changes , and five car oil changes with this device . ( Yes . I put a lot of miles on my car . ) On the VW I use a fumoto valve instead of a traditional drain plug . My Oil filter housing is also designed with a nipple allowing oil extraction . This combination allows me to draw oil out of the car quickly and easily with a vacuum device such as this . The Mityvac draws 5w40 and 0w40 out of the car in roughly seven minutes.Many would consider that slow . However I do n't have to spend time torquing a drain bolt down , jacking up the car , or sloshing an oil container around . Oil changes are easily half the time they used to be , and far cleaner.For oil disposal I simply reverse the flow on the Mityvac and put the oil in a multi gallon vessel.Before I bought this device I was worried about implosion : I prefer to change oil when it is warm or nearly operating temperature hot . So far I have had no problems .	1
Bought it for oil extraction from a Mercedes and a SeaDoo . Works great . Also works for draining diffs , transfer cases , or transmissions before removing pans etc . It can be kind of annoying to clean out but beats dealing with drain pans in hard to reach areas . As the instructions say do n't over pump . 10 pumps or so and just let it do it 's thing . The last thing you would want is for the reservoir to collapse in on you .	1
I was apprehensive because of the reviews with people saying theirs only worked once.. But I get the feeling that they did n't understand how the thing works . You can easily damage the components by using it wrong . You pump the thing 3-4 times per quart , but you do n't want to sit and pump while you 're removing the fluids , that is n't how it works . Pump it a 3-4 times and wait for it to get done , then do it again . It goes pretty fast ! I did my brakes , trany , oil , power steering , transfer case , and differential before pulling the plug to get the rest and not make a mess and radiator fluid on a couple different vehicles.. went smoothly . I recommend buying a half inch hose clamp for the rubber reducer .	1
After reading all the various reviews on this , I knew I was taking a risk on the purchase but decided to roll the dice to see if it was my lucky day.First of all , I did not purchase this through anyone currently listed as a seller on Amazon , but the source is a very popular tool supplier that is listed for many other tools on amazon . The priced was only about $ 4.00 more than the best listed.The mityvac arrived inside a sturdy shipping box that originated from Mityvac . Inside this box , the 7201 was nested inside its own box with a protective card board sleeve over the top of the handle . It arrived undamaged.Per the supplied instructions , I checked the screws in the upper lid to ensure they were tight ( they were ) . I 'm not sure if it came with a gasket under the lid that so many had stated was missing on some units . It worked , so why bother with taking the lid off.I tested the evaucation action by drawing a gallon of antifreeze inside the 7201 . It did this quickly with only a few pumps of the handle . So far so good.Next , I tested the refilling capability by returning the antifreeze back into the one gallon container . It did this quickly and very throughly leaving only about 1 oz in the botton of the reservoir . Very very good.The supplied tubing is very rigid and I plan to replace it with some flexible hose from a local hardware store.I give this a 5 star rating . Sturdy and well made .	1
This thing is well worth it overall . It 's not going to work for every vehicle , however . My Corolla and my Yukon are both apparently not compatible with the down-the-tube method of oil removal . For my Crown Vic , and my pre-80 's cars , it 's simply outstanding.It pulls an amazing amount of oil from the pan , just have to fish around a little with the hose after you get most of the oil out , in order to find any small pockets of oil remaining . After about 3-4 minutes of suction , I removed the drain plug and checked . I only got a tablespoon or so of drip , which is pretty good , overall . Transmission oil is just as easy , but I think you 'd be better off slightly elevating the front/rear/side in order to force fluid toward the dipstick because the pans are usually flatter/shallower.Quick , easy , and you can just pump it right back into the empty oil container . You 're still going to get some on you ... Finally , my one complaint , there is no way to securely fasten the hose and adapter fittings to the pump when it 's not in use . Minor , but irritating , since the little friction clip is pretty much useless if you bump the hose out . The fittings disappeared into the garage somewhere , since I set them aside while I pumped out the oil . Would be much better to have a little plastic compartment on the side/base of the pump to drop those into . Had to adapt a fuel line to use as an adapter.Would definitely buy again , and recommend to friends . Love it .	1
I have been using oil extractors for a few years now , namely the Pela 6000 marine pump . Although I am well experienced with cars , I currently have my oilpan drain plug replaced with a temperature sensor , so I prefer not to remove that and risk damaging , plus , I hate having to get under the car and pray not to spill oil everywhere.The Pela pump was great , the big issue was that there was no easy way to drain the container and if you were n't careful , while draining you would tip too far and cause an air bubble which made oil dump out with some force and splash everywhere ( think of turning a 2liter bottle upside down ) . Unfortunately I had to toss out the pump because it was starting to leak some oil out of the handle.I read some great things on automotive forums about the Mityvac , and was ecstatic to find this particular model that can not only pump , but easily evacuate fluid as well . This comes in real handy when dealing with fluids such as brake fluid and transmission fluid . On top of that , it provided me a VERY easy way to extract oil from the pump back into the bottles ; ) .The pump worked like a charm , and did exactly what it is intended to do . This is great for my car because although the car holds about 5 quarts of oil , conventional draining from the pan only drains out about 4 quarts as oil is still left in the oil coolers . Because of the vacuum that this produces inside of the oil sump , I manage to evacuate almost every drop of oil from the system.One note is that you MUST tighten the screws holding on the top cover . They are a tad loose when you get the pump , but can easily be tightened and you do not have to worry about the leaking that others have experienced .	1
Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great . Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube .	1
This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used . It includes everything you need and works pretty well , although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow , so be patient . I use it for oil changes so I do n't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer ( do n't forget to replace the filter too ! ) . I 've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there . That 's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in . Warm up the engine a little , turn everything off , slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil . Change the filer and refill the oil and you 're done . For me that means I do n't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I do n't have to put the car up on stands . Those both take a lot of time , so this evacuator is a great time saver . The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car 's engine and when the tank is full , the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too , so you do n't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter & # 34 ; straws & # 34 ; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes ( like on a differential ) . Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm . However , do n't get the fluids hot and do n't run the motor with the straw inserted ! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them , causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out ! ! About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I 'd also like to drain the radiators using this but do n't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil is n't wanted in the radiator . Otherwise this is a great tool to have available . Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for sucking up the oil , so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick , you may not be able to use this . Check on forums for you car if you 're unsure .	1
After I got my CV from the auction , I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it . They did NOT come with aiming instructions , which seems silly , if you ask me ( but , who asked me , right ! ) .If you 've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions , good luck ! No two are alike ! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs , and even they had vague instructions . This is the best explanation I found : [ ... ] Step one ... put some gas in the tank . The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank ( yes , I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height . ) , and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface , you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams . This varies from bulb to bulb , and can range from a well defined rectangle , to a somewhat defined `` top , '' and a vague `` bottom . '' Some bulbs have a kind of a `` z '' that you align where is zigs and zags.Now , back your vehicle up 25 ' . This is an `` industry rule of thumb , '' not a mystery , as some manufacturers may have you believe . My lights were shining on the ground at this point , waaaay off ! On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads . The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down , the lower ones , towards the inside of the car , are for left and right . I tried pliers ... no good , I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good , I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $ 20 ( what was I thinking ) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench , back and forth , back and forth , dropping it into the frame ... ( you know what I 'm talkin ' 'bout ! ) ... I did discover ( if you 're short of cash and have a little wrench already ) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight , that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars , I decided to look for a `` real '' adjustment tool and found this Lisle product . WOW ! Now , I can do BOTH headlights , up and down , AND , right and left , in the time it took me to do one screw before ! This thing fits perfectly , it ratchets smoothly , and you can pop it on and off easily ! It 's like a miracle tool ! NOTE TO SELF ! ! ! DO `` NOT '' BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW ! THE TOOL WO N'T COME OFF AND YOU CA N'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND ! And , no , I did n't actually do this , but I came darn close ! K , I digress , sorry about that ! Now , you have your car backed up 25 ' from the wall , hood open , radiator access panel removed ( there 's a little thumb screw you turn if you 're lucky ) . Lights on `` low beam , '' then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something , and it will be easier to see the light you 're working on.Vertical adjustment ( up and down ) ... At this point there are several variations of `` the rule . '' I have found on my car that aligning the `` top '' on the headlight pattern at , or just below , the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good . This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment ( side to side ) ... This varies a lot ! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the `` driver 's side '' of the beam rectangles ( this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations , and various other recommendations ) , just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall . IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans , this might work . On one car , the beams are defined , on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall , so I had to `` play it by ear '' and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out , erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines . Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder , passenger side of the road , the lane you are traveling in , and , I believe , to illuminate somewhat , the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense , and a test drive will tell you if you have it right . If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road , you 're aimed too high ! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim . You do NOT adjust high beams , they are supposed to be `` self-aiming '' when the low beams are aimed , however , they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then , when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already , and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver 's side ( middle ) of the road , I just pulled off the road , opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw , easily flipped it a few turns ( you will know which way after you adjust it a few times ) and it came out perfect ! Please verify all information , this can be dangerous for everyone if it 's not done correctly . Safe driving !	1
I could n't get to the lower adjusting screw with a ratchet , too thick and not long enough . This thing has a long handle on it and the ratcheting head is fairly thin . I was able to adjust my driver 's headlight out of oncoming traffic 's eye .	1
Got new headlights and this tool works like a charm . Its goon take a while to get your headlights just right . But its easy to do while driving around . Just pull over pop hood and adjust . Super easy .	1
If you are adjusting headlights on a Ford with 4mm adjusting screws this tool is a must . The review that states that the screw moves out enough to keep you from removing the tool from the end of the screw is questionable however . On all the headlights I have seen , the adjustment on the light moves in and out and the screw dose not , so If you can get the tool on , you will always be able to get it off . Tool is well made and the infinite ratchet is handy . Should last a lifetime even though the vehicle will not . All mechanics I know have one and Amazon is the cheapest . I ordered one that said it was used , in good condition , for ten bucks . When it arrived , it was on the original blister pack , unopened . This is not always the case , but this time , it was . If you are thinking of buying one of these tools , do it .	1
This tool fits easily behind the headlight area in my 1996 Ranger pickup . The long handle makes it simple and quick to make adjustments . I saw in other reviews that the space in other Ford vehicles is tight , but there 's plenty of room in the Ranger.It 's not obvious which way to turn the screws for up/down or left/right , so you have to experiment . You just flip the wrench around to turn the other way . Unlike regular `` clicking '' ratchet wrenches , the fine-ratchet capability on this tool makes it easy to do micro-adjusting , and it also makes sure that you can turn the headlight screw even if you have only a short swing on the ratchet handle . ( FYI : for the Ranger , the bottom screw is vertical , top screw is horizontal . ) A great tool , makes an otherwise crummy job simple .	1
This thing is a life saver for adjusting those accursed 90 's ford vehicle headlights . This makes it pretty easy . I 'm glad I own this thing for use on my 94 mustang GT .	1
I needed to aim my headlights correctly after buying aftermarket housings.Did some research and found this tool , it works very well for my 01 Ford Taurus .	1
For my Crown Vic , this was the only way to get to the adjustment screws and be able to turn them . Not much else to say , it 's the right tool for a specific job .	1
... and perfectly-suited for the intended purpose . That 's all I can - or need to - say about it . Case closed .	1
I needed it , so I had to buy it I elt it could had been cheaper but it got the job done .	1
Ordered this tool to align new headlamps I installed in my ranger . If you 're looking at this review right now , you probably already know how difficult it is to access the headlamp adjusters . Thats where this little bundle of joy comes in , making it nearly effortless to align ford headlight assemblies . When you 're not able ( or willing ) to use a small ratchet and metric socket to adjust the headlamps , than this is the tool for the job . And as always , Lisle makes an awesome product ( which mostly tend to be made in the USA ) . Overall , great buy .	1
These are easy to use and comes with many sizes . Take your time and the fuel line will disconnect just fine .	1
Solid connectors . You wo n't have any problems disconnecting that AC line . Some other plastic tools are flimsy and give too much when put to use . These are solid and get the job done .	1
than the first set I had purchased long long ago , , maybe they were not lisle , but this compnay has been around a long time , better than my harbor freight scissor kind	1
It works but like others said , theres nothing easy about getting the old one off . Takes some patience and upper body strength to get it going . Found a similar set locally for a couple bucks less . Quick shipping .	1
Title says it all . This puller works well for what is is designed to do ... pull seals . Good tool to have for your shop .	1
Pops out seals easily . Long handle to give lots of leverage . Lisle tools are good quality mechanics tools that should last .	1
Works as will as other seal pullers I 've used.When using a seal puller for my 16 & # 34 ; FV wheels I 've found that I need to use the assistance of a 5 lbs hammer to pull the seal.Of cource replace the seal with a new one . This is a common practice of RV repair shops .	1
An incredibly easy to use seal puller that is Made In The USA . Excellent quality and built to last for many years of normal use .	1
I did the left side first ... took a bit of pecking around . The trans case is aluminum , so was wary of prying around with a screwdriver or some other McGiver tool . Right side seal came out with one swing . It works and is nicely constructed .	1
I used these to replace to CV boot clamps on a 2006 VW Jetta , and they crimped the clamp up perfectly . I could have tried with general pincer pliers , but these are the right tool for the job , and by doing the job myself the tool has more than paid for itself already .	1
It appears to be well made . I needed it to secure a band on cvc boot & # 8230 ; works great . The tool for the job ! !	1
This tool is a must have for Oetiker clamps . This tool works perfectly ! Once you determine the correct size Oetiker clamp with your hose and barb configuration , all ` s it takes is one simple squeeze and your done ! perfect ! I recommend this tool !	1
Good heavy well made tool that will last a life time , or when they decide to change a clamp design witch ever comes first . But it is one of those must have tools to do the job rite and make it easier .	1
And you 're probably wondering what happened to the first one ... very simple -- someone & # 34 ; acquired it & # 34 ; one fateful day . With that I was in need of getting another pair and after looking at the designs that are out there , I went with the same one that I had . What is nice is that it has a flat that when you crimp down on the ears it helps flatten it out so it is not a big bump . This definitely helps in preventing the clamp from coming apart or becoming misaligned too much while you are squeezing it . There is not much to say except that this one is exactly like my last one and I like the way it works .	1
Just what I was hoping for . Clamped the boots on my B7 Audi S4 with no trouble at all . Glad I have this in my toolbox now . Ca n't believe it took me so long to get it .	1
If you work on cars and front ends , you 'll eventually need a tool like this for your CV boots . Not all CV boots require this , but this particular one allows for torque wrenches or breakers bars to & # 34 ; pinch & # 34 ; the CV boot clamp for proper installation of your boot when applicable .	1
I wish the tool was about an inch longer . For a 1995 VW Jetta , with the tie rod inserted , I ca n't clip the wrench part in place because the tool is about a quarter inch too short . It 's still usable but the wrench part wo n't clip in place so there 's a lot more fumbling around .	1
this product worked perfectly and made short work of removing and installing both inner tie rod ends on my 96 camry , easy to use , although it said not to use a impact gun with tool to remove tie rod end , i had limited space to turn the ratchet , so i used the impact gun . no damage to tool , highly recommend this product .	1
I needed to replace the inner tie rod on my 97 Corolla . I have a fairly well equiped shop but needed this specialty tool to do the job.This tool allowed me to remove the inner tie rod lock nut with ease . It has several difference sizes of fittings that allow it to be used on other vehicles.This tool paid for itself by me doing the job . It is well made and worth the price .	1
This made the removal of my inner tie rods very easy . I have had issues in the past and wish I had this tool . I will use it only few times in my life but it was worth it .	1
Worked perfectly as advertisied , a real time saver , great product , good pricing.Would highly recommend , for a mechanic or weekend mechanics . Will save you lots of bucks !	1
I had never heard of OTC and was hesitant on buying this but due to other reviews bit the bullet . OTC is very well built , I have bent similar products bought at auto parts stores but the OTC stuff gets the job done .	1
At less than $ 100 , it 's not much more than twice the price of one puller . I had a stuck ball joint and got this and the ball joint puller was too small but one of the pitman arm pullers was just right . So it lets you separate a lot of things in different situations without spending a lot of money.Everything is organized well in a sturdy plastic case . Unlike some cases , this one is big enough that you do n't have to turn the screws all the way in to fit the tools in the case.Very impressed at the price and selection . It 's not something I 'll use every day but it 's something that is nice to have when it 's needed . Besides , if I ever get a new car , I could probably sell this for at least what I paid for it .	1
You ca n't beat these tools in ease of replacing tie rod ends . I have n't tried the pitman arm puller or the ball joint tool yet , but if they 're anything like the tie rod tools , they 'll make your life way easier . Do n't mess around with those pickle stabbers , get a real set of tools and make your life easier . They 're beefy enough to work on everything the & # 34 ; home mechanic & # 34 ; can throw at them , and it 's really refreshing when you can take a tie rod end off with barely a twist of a wrench . They come in a nice case too !	1
OTC makes good strong tools . This front service kit has worked like a charm for every front end suspension job I have done . Its a must have kit to do front end service . Works for many makes and models . The case is durable and keeps everything organized . & # 34 ; BUY IT & # 34 ; it pays for its self , as soon as you use it one time .	1
I didnt need all the pieces but this kit had what i needed . I may use the other pieces at a later time , so this kit for the price was a great investment . Very hight quality .	1
I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel . The kit was perfect and the tools were decent . My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made . Global economy or whatever , when I 'm looking for quality tools , I 'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices . Sure , these are better than Harbor Freight , but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day , and I can point you towards a better kit for now . So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA .	1
I was originally just interested in one of the larger pullers for my suspension rebuild but decided it would be more cost effective in the long run getting this complete kit . Very happy I did because its proven to be quite versatile . The smaller puller works great at removing stubborn windshield wipers ! All the pieces are very well made and should last for years of use ...	1
I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles . I could n't use the venerable pickle fork , so I had to breakdown and buy a front end set . This kit paid for itself in this one job alone . The dealer wanted over $ 700 for this job ; It cost me $ 200 for parts and $ 94 for this kit . I used the longest puller for my job and it easily popped off the ball joint with just a couple of cranks with a normal length 1/2 drive breaker bar . The puller did n't even flinch . No warps or bends in the claws.I suspect this kit will serve me for life since I wo n't be abusing it with a commercial rate of use . I do work on cars more than the average backyard mechanic and I am confident you do n't need to drop $ 400 more on a commercial grade name brand set .	1
This is another great OTC product ! I purchased this kit to disassemble front end components without the use of a big hammer ... lol ... The tools worked great for their intended purpose . Well made and easy to use . Another great addition to my tool cabinet !	1
I rarely have a very high opinion of tools made in China but I have to admit that the quality of this set is really nice.I have n't broken anything yet but if I do I will update this review.For the price it 's really nice .	1
These tools paid for them selves with the first use . Good quality but stick to cars and small trucks or you might have problems . Wish I had them when I rebuilt the front end of my Chevy S-10 . I will never touch a pickel fork again !	1
Just as describes and my husband loved it . He was able to get the job done in no time thanks to this product !	1
Did n't realize I already had the puller I needed , but it 's a good kit to take apart a front end with little or no damage of the seals on the TRE'sGood kit to have ... ...	1
OTC is reliable , and this is also reliable . The parts are durable and machined well . If you wok on front ends , you need this kit . The case is also durable .	1
I want to buy another . Not cheap and flimsy like some of the other blowers I have had . Quality throughout !	1
This is a quality made in the USA product . I needed a blo-gun for various things . I wanted something to blow clean my tools in the garage . The rubber tip is great to protect items you do n't want scratched . The gun has a bit of weight and it feels good in your hands . You can tell you are holding a quality item and it will last a long time .	1
Spend a few dollars more and get the quality part that dealerships use on their own cars . High quality , works great ... .	1
I like the style of the gun , it is well designed and u can get into places with it that some others ca n't	1
I had a cheap blow gun in the garage that split when I tightened the fitting too much . This blow gun is very well made and should last a lifetime .	1
Very sturdy and well built feels like it last a very long time , worth every penny . For the price you definitely get your money 's worth .	1
This is a simple , effective , and tough design that 's been around for years . The valve came properly greased/lubricated , so I know there was no chance of it pitting or rusting as the unit sat on the shelf waiting to be purchase . A little dab of additional lubricant every now and then to make sure the valve remains lubed will likely ensure solid operation for years to come .	1
But i was very impressed when I opened it and felt how sold and heavy it felt . Definitely seems much better than prior ones I have had that are likely out of China .	1
Have not used it yet but the feel and quality in your hand speaks for itself , quality product MADE IN THE USA makes me proud there is still some of this out there in this great country . Have had Milton air products before and they are the BEST of the BEST and worth the difference you may have to pay , in the long haul the difference in price is really cheaper , they are pretty well built to last most of our life times . *BUY USA FOLKS*	1
It is apparently well made . Works as you would expect . Mine reads between 1 and 2lbs higher than the pressure compared with my racing gauge in the 29lb - 44lb range . It is marked in 2lb increments but seems to bounce around a bit . would n't count on getting closer than within 2 of your desired pressure with this unit . It is good for filling past your point , knowing you are there , then use a more accurate gauge and let air down to the exact pressure you seek . For lots of uses it will be fine just to go with this tool and accept the +/- 2 lbs or so of error .	1
This is perhaps one of the best air chucks you can buy . True , it is n't cheap and you get what you pay for.Unfortunately though , it does not work 100 % on the dualies on my motorhome , which is why I bought it . Turns out , I need the chuck version that has a straight inner tire chuck and angled outer tire chuck . This item has both angled inner and outer chucks.But I can buy a replacement chuck ( which Amazon does not sell ) , or a combination chuck with 12 & # 34 ; hose ( which Amazon does sell ) , so I can retrofit the chuck for my type dualie setup.I am giving it 5 stars because I simply ordered the wrong item , so I am not going to gig the product because of that . Amazon though could describe the products a bit better rather than making me go to the vendor 's website and looking up the product number to see which one is what I need .	1
As others have written , the Milton S506 gauge is the top-of-the-line tire gauge and well worth the few extra bucks . You wo n't regret buying this one .	1
I have seen this type of dual check tire inflator with gauge at many service stations . No more airing up then change to a gauge to read the pressure . Gets tiring if you are checking all the tires on an RV . With the build in gauge you get the reading constantly as you put air in the tires . This is going to be my main tool for the RV .	1
This air gauge is dead on accurate , it seals completely , allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars , trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems . I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors , fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle . You know what I mean . This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem . I love it .	1
I believe if your looking for something to make airing anything up these are & # 34 ; The cats rear end. & # 34 ; If you are some guy who want to complain that it 's off .25698 of a pound or 1.94236 of a pound spend the 8000 dollars for the top of the line air gauge . If you want to air something up and recheck it with you .50 air gauge or your 30.00 Snap-on air gauge that was certified and find the numbers are off then do n't buy this . If you like me , average Joe , that uses it to check tire pressure , air kids basketballs , and around the house airing jobs , I have had 2 in my life this is the 2nd in 40 years and they both work perfect for these needs and have never failed . Great shipping and thanks again Amazon for offering at cheaper price .	1
I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose , so I returned it and got this . A number of people say the gauge on this is too small . I do n't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue , but the Milton 's gauge does feel harder to read . I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light does n't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB 's gauge , and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB 's gauge . Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it 's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see . I think whoever designed this gauge `` back in the day '' decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge . The ARB does n't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire , but that is n't true . The gauge goes to zero while you fill , just like every other tire filler I 've ever used , and only measures when you 're not filling . The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I 've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a `` dual chuck '' which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection . But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical . I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect ( ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in . Red Coupler and Plug Kit ) .The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you 're inflating but the Milton has no such feature . I do n't think it 's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that 's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway . Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you 've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings , the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose does n't leak .	1
The Milton S506 product was great , was just what I was looking for . I would recommend this to any one !	1
I purchased this inflator instead of purchasing a 0-100 psi gauge . Combined with a 2 ' flexzilla whip hose , it is exactly what I needed on my 10 gallon air tank .	1
Still the best tire inflator on the market . Very accurate and easy to use . those stick pressure gauges never seem to work well for me	1
Do n't waste your time buying all those cheap China knock-offs . This tire inflator is built solid and does the job .	1
I have a 5th wheel and I check the tire pressure frequently . When inflating , it gets to be a chore to air up , remove the chuck and check the pressure . A constant guessing game : too much , not enough ... you can never tell . With this gauge , it get it where I want it first try every try.Nice quality piece of equipment . Buy one !	1
Used a quick connect to use with my existing Husky compressor . Very easy to use and easy to ready . It 's very sturdy , and I have no concerns about it falling and taking a little abuse over the next few years .	1
I never thought a tire inflator would make me think thoughts like incredible , beautiful , precision etc . etc. , but this is no regular tire inflator . Besides the fact it is all those things it is also accurate and well built . You may spend a little more on this but it is money well spent , it feels like it will last a lifetime . This thing should literally be in an automotive museum .	1
This unit eliminates the need for a gauge and makes the job quicker . More than accurate for me . Fair price .	1
My family runs a small business that has been around almost 200 years . If my ancestors purchased one of these , my guess is it would still be working . The solid aluminum body looks great , does n't leak and feels good in the hand . There is a reason gas stations use these ! I like the fact that the unit can easily be taken apart and serviced/rebuilt . Love made in the U.S.A ! The gauge reads accurate and is simple to use .	1
Great product . Solid and well built . I like the fact that you can service it if needed . I would recommend this if you want a solid inflator gauge .	1
This is a great quality - made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature , the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out .	1
This is the old stand-by and works very well - you can always turn so you can see the dial . It does n't always sit well on the stems for some reason , but using this with an air compressor is so much faster than a small 12-volt compressor and hand gauge .	1
Man I love amazon I never have to stand in a lne at a store ever again ( : and prices are as good or better and the Prime membershiop is the best money you could spend I think.. This air head is the best I 've used had a diferent one that would bend the dang schrader valve 1 out of 5 times But that was a totaly different item and dealIn all the hundreds of tansactions I 've done with amazon just one was a problem that the seller will not honor their warranty on a a auto radiator	1
The only flaw that kept me from leaving a 5-star rating is the `` inaccurate '' gauge.. Everything else works great & the inflator unit itself is built with quality material designed to withstand heavy use.After having read other 's review here , I caliberated this Milton S-506 gauge against a high end digital gauge that I use on my passenger vehicles & the reading from this gauge is consistantly 4 psi lower.I bought this gauge for my Chevy DuraMax Dually , so I simply inflate the tires up to 64 psi in order to achieve 60 psi pressure on all the tires.So word to the wise , caliberate it against a better , more precise gauge first before you put it to use , this way you 'll know how much to `` offset '' before you rely on it completely.Overall , it is an excellent value .	1
I bought this gage , because it 's easy to use . Wife friendly , and it 's sealed . No dirt will get into the gage . You can nail your presure real easy . Thats why I bought one for myself . SW	1
I bought this to go with my Porter-cable 150psi , 6 Gal . compressor . Although the compressor comes with a tire inflation device , I like this one for the built-in gauge , the extension hose and the quality construction .	1
Sometime hard to see dial wish it was maybe more magified or even the even numbers on the guage in red might help but I do like it , checked it with a guarge and appears to be pretty accurate too ! A dial guage seems to be easier for me to read , I would grade this from a B- to an A even because it is well made .	1
Excellent quality . American made . Top notch all the way around . Built to last .	1
this item is worth the money when your are trying to set gap on spark plugs . very easy to use	1
If your working with spark plugs you need this . As standard as they come and guaranteed to work . Helped me gap my plugs with no problems . If you do n't know how to use , just youtube it .	1
I bought this in conjunction with spark plugs and anti seize and it worked great to dial in the plugs .	1
I bought this to gap some plugs that I was installing in my car and it works like a gapper should . Just a solid piece of metal that gradually gets bigger as you move along it . Easy to read and use . Would recommend .	1
I gapped my 8 new plugs in under ten minutes , solid quality and a necessary addition to the toolbox . It does n't put pressure on the electrode when you 're prying the gap wider , which makes it a very good design . This is my third one like it ( I always seem to lose them ) Just a note : if you 've never used this style before , make sure you 're using the hole to pry the gap open , resting it on the inner lip .	1
i used the one from craftsman an it doesnt work as well as this one . i recommend this to everyone	1
This is a nice , sturdy guage to check spark plug gap . However , it has only an inch scale , with no metric equivalent on the reverse side . So if you plan on gapping your plug to a metric value , forget this guage . Even so , it felt good to use and not at all flimsy . It 's smoothly finished and the marking are clear and legible , making it easy to read . Well worth what I paid for it.PS . Another reviewer said the one he received had the metric markings on the back side . I found no such markings on mine -- perhaps the one I received was defective . In any event , that does n't alter my rating . I still like it .	1
This works exactly as you expect . If your gap is too small , you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap , and the gap will extend some ... that is , measure , push to extend , re-measure , and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap . This is where I think the tool could improve . The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller . Once , I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge , and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all , though , this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag .	1
had these before , it 's a great little tool that 's been around for a long time , trouble is that I or others have a habit of loosing them so here I go again . guess you can never have to many . still made in USA .	1
It 's simple and effective . You easily get an accurate rating on your spark plug gap , and you can use the hole to pry the electrode open if need be . Very convenient tool to have if you 're a Do-It-Yourselfer .	1
Works great , no issues	1
I have been working on my classic car for years , this product , at it 's great price and quality is a great way to test for spark at your cars spark plug , and you can do it by yourself . One of the best tools I have in my toolbox .	1
This makes it very easy to find the problem . Plus no more holding onto the plug tip to see if you get shocked !	1
this is a very helpful tool that comes in handy when you think a spark plug has failed and isnt fireing and with this tool you wont have to wounder if the plug is bad or not and is worth buying and i recomend this tool to all do it yourselfers and mechanic shops as well thank you	1
great little gadget ! No getting zapped anymore checking for spark or have the spark plug fall off the engine every time to pull the cord to check for spark !	1
Needed a good tester for ignition systems on most cars and trucks now days . nothing worse than having a cheap tester and not knowing whether the tester is good or not . Plus the old put a sparkplug on the wire and try grounding it with the high voltage is not fun any more . worth the money for a quick use tester .	1
Needed to check a sea doo . Bright enough to see in normal light and confirm spark .	1
Does what its supose to and does it accurate ... Well made and marked ... Numbers print a lil small , I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel ... Giddy-Up .	1
Got tired of using a ruler or a penny to check tires . This is very accurate and repeatable and allows me to monitor tire wear . so simple and so easy and reasonably priced to me . Nice if you are buying a used car to check the tire wear for remaining life as well as uneven wear across tire or side to side which can help id other problems .	1
This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge , and nothing you do n't . Here 's how you use it : You press the & # 34 ; probe & # 34 ; down into the tread gap to measure the depth . You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line . The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder , making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another . Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch .	1
This did the trick for me , needed to be able to measure tread depth and it does work , its a little confusing to begin with , but once you use it , its easy to use and very handy as well .	1
Another eason to shop on Amazon - availability . My local auto store was out of these . I got this one at a very good price , and it works fine and is easy to read . I rotate my tires on a regular basis and keep track of tread depth . Having a few gauges like this around makes it quick and easy to do . There are digital tread depth gauges that light up , but this is all you really need - no batteries .	1
Measured my front and rear tires . Front 6/32 , rear 8/32 . Time to rotate.Accuracy is cleaverly done by putting the numbers around the barrel so accuracy is increased because numbers are spread apart . Mechanically simple and small to fit in glove commpartment.Ca n't imagine any advantage to paying more for such a simple tool when this one works so well . Quality is medium but more than sufficient for this purpose . Only a few measurements needed for tires . This tools is the one to buy .	1
It works well , I wanted to just keep track of how my tire wear was . My only concern was that it is not really calibrated to be right on the money , but if you keep this in mind , it is just an offset .	1
Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire . Some states require you have this for state inspection .	1
It does exactly what it 's supposed to do . No problems whatsoever .	1
Got this to try to extend the life on my motorcycle tires by adjusting the air to keep the tread depth similar on the middle of the tire and on the sides . It appears I was running too much air and the middle tread was wearing faster than the sides . The gauge is simple and straight forward , however , the scale goes around the cylinder that goes in and out , so if you measure tread depth at one point on the tire , you have to turn the gauge around to read tread depth at another point on the tire if it is more , or less , than the first reading . Also , while you can & # 34 ; guestimate & # 34 ; the depth ( good enough for personal use ) by reading the lines on the gauge , I would just go for one of the digital depth gauges if I had to buy one again .	1
I manage a tire shop and I use a tread depth gauge all day long , the cheap plastic ones were always breaking , so this all metal one will last a whole lot longer ...	1
No more using the penny or quarter to measure the tire tread . No more second guessing . With this gauge , you can see the actual measurement at an affordable cost . The only drawback I noticed , like some reviewers say , is it leaks oil .	1
I just want to say thank you to milton for making a METAL tread depth gauge . I hate those little plastic ones . The best part about it is the numbers on the gauge are recessed , stamped , into the metal . So even if the black ink were to come off ( hasnt come off ater a few years ) you can still read the numbers . A little bit of lubrication with some silicone or rust penetrant helps keep it sliding smooth , and if you dont , it rusts up and makes it really rough and may even give some strange tread depth readings . The pintle is quite strong ( used it as a screwdriver on a desperate situation once ) and the ink is long lasting .	1
So your dad taught you to use a nickel and Lincoln 's head to tell when it 's time for new tires . However these days , tread patterns and tire materials are a lot different . It 's handy to have tool specifically designed for the task . The Milton is a pocket clip sized gauge that in increments of 1/64 '' tells you how your tread is wearing . No more crawling under the wheel well to see Lincoln ... Just insert it over a tread groove and push down . Where ever it rests it will stay . Pull it out ( get out your glasses ) and read it . That easy . It 's nice for non-gear heads and people who are n't as limber as they used to be alike.Stopping is the most important mechanical feature of your vehicle . Tires obviously play a huge role in this , particularly when road conditions are wet and slippery . So checking your tread and planning for the next big expense of replacing them is important . Be sure to also check your tire pressure often as this plays a large role in tire wear and driving safety .	1
I have been using tape measures and the like for my car tires , but I did n't want to take a risk with my motorcycle tires.This tools is very simple to use . Like others have mentioned , the grease can come off on your hands but that 's ok.1/32 increments.I like that the gauge is a little wider so I can make sure it 's level .	1
Perfect . Simple and perfect . Not oily , like others have been saying . It 's just great . Add it to your arsenal of automotive tools today !	1
What can ya say -- it very inexpensive , yet it WORKS ! ! ! ! ! I spent like $ 17 on a digital Fowler tread gauge only for it to tell me my tires had 23/32 tread left ? ? How is that possible , when new it is only 13/32 ? ? If that were the case , I 'm sure Yokohama woul dbe hunting me down to steal those tires , lolThis Milton tread gauge is very basic and it works ! ! No batteries to worry about . It does feel a tad greasy when you touch it . I just keep it in a ziploc bag in my trucks cub hole ! ! Too easy ! ! Do n't let the low price fool you , it works ! !	1
I rated this product 5 stars for quality and ease of use . The scale is easy to read and moves easily and stays where it needs to be after reading the depth .	1
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use . You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth . Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires . If the front tires are worn more than the rear , its time to rotate the front tires to the rear .	1
This is a great tread-depth gauge . It seems accurate and does what it is meant to do . It 's built from metal , not plastic so it feels like it 's a good quality tool .	1
Bought this to replace an older model that apparently grew a set of legs and walked out of the old tool box . Anyway its a handy little gauge and seems to be built just as well as my original one . Much better and more accurate than using coins ...	1
I purchased this gauge on Amazon for $ 5.99 with FREE Super Saver ShippingIt is a handy tool and quite useful ; the only drawbackfor me is that it only measures in imperial measurements.Metric measurements are always more precise .	1
I bought this to watch my tire wear during the track season . In all honesty I 've only used it once but it works .	1
I had never bothered to measure tread depths until I bought a travel trailer and realized you can wear the tread right off if you have the wrong electric brake controller installed . I bought one of these depth gauges so I can periodically measure the tread depth to be sure my brakes are working right . It does the job and is easy to use .	1
This product is pretty simple . Interior tube slides up and down , no spring return.Looks durable enough to take the abuse of being thrown around.Optional , removable pen-style clip is included .	1
received two days ago , opened up the package , no grease or oil as reported by other users , works as it should be , handy little gadget , no more guesswork with the coins , let coins do their monetary duty . All thumbs up on this purchase .	1
I truly do n't know why I waited so long to get one of these . Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection . Ca n't go wrong with this one .	1
Simple device , works fine , not hard to read . Nice to have this gauge to check tires from time to time and be able to verify what the tire guys are telling you .	1
Unit is 100 % metal - definitely a plus . Seems quite durable and actually has some weight to it , not like a cheap plastic tool . I had no issue with oil - maybe they 've changed their manufacturing process since other reviews were written.Does exactly as described and gives you a number to use so you can track the wear over time - Lincoln 's head does n't do that.Excellent price , would buy again if I lost the current one .	1
No more using a penny to make sure my tires are safe . This little gauge does the trick . Highly recommended .	1
its a solid piece that 's easy to read , very handy to monitor tread wear I would definitely buy it again	1
it 's a depth gauge . not much to it- it does the job so you can better measure how much tire tread you have left . handy when you 're looking to replace a tire and debating on whether or not you need to replace two tire , or have the new one shaved down . a handy little tool .	1
I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side .	1
This gauge is great for the average person . I 've used mine for years . I also have a digital gauge which I like a lot better but I paid a lot more money for it . This does everything a digital gauge does except it 's a little harder to read . The increments are lost a lot larger . Working on my race car I prefer the digital gauge from Central Tools . It all depends on how much you want to spend . Both do the same thing .	1
TIRE TREAD DEPTH GAUGE , IT WORKS , I NOW KNOW I WILL NEED TIRES A LITTLE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT , A GOOD BUY IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN PEACE OF MIND = )	1
Old time tech , old time price , as good as new tech ... It measures the depth fo tread.. so why all the digital infrared laser type depth gauge devices ? Do they think people are that stupid ? they must . These are great and will last a lifetime . If you can read a ruler and you understand tread depth varies at different points on the tire.. you 're way ahead of anyway with a Buck Rogers laser dazer..	1
Simple and cheap . It works and appears to be accurate . Why use a penny when you can pay substantially more for this ? : )	1
You may have a tire pressure gauge , but this tool allows you to measure accurately when your tires need replacing . It is durable and precise in its ability to measure the depth of your tire treads .	1
There 's really nothing to this gauge . Very simple and it works.If it was shorter would 've been even better , but it 's okay for $ 5.Not greasy/oily on mine as others have reported .	1
A nice item to keep in your tool box . Keeps the guess work out , when checking your vehicle tires for wear .	1
Works just fine and useful for making sure that you are road legal and safe . easy to use and store .	1
IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS JUST AS SHOWN IN THE AD . THE PRICE WAS GOOD . EVERYTHING WAS FIN AND.iT WAS EASILY READABLE ! !	1
This is a great product for the money . Worked as described and built very well . Highly recommend this to anyone that works on their own cars .	1
Waited too long to get this ... after breaking connectors and fingernails it was time ... Good tool and a fair price - MADE IN USA ! !	1
A must have tool to work on any car , if your check or fixing electrical problems , it makes the connecting and disconnecting that much easier , and you do n't have to break anything with this tool ! !	1
The tool is a quality item that is well constructed and looks like it will last a lifetime . I have absolutely no complaint with the quality or construction but did note that the tool I received did not match the picture that should not be allowed for online sellers . My handle was grey in color instead of the advertised red . This does not detract from the tool 's performance but I do find it unusual that Lilse would choose a dull color such as grey instead of a bright color that stands out . The grey acts as a camouflage if you drop it or set it down in your engine compartment making it hard to see and fish out from behind your firewall especially in poor lighting . The tool was a lot bigger than what I was expecting but that was actually something I liked . This tool will not help with all electrical connectors on every make and model due to the many different designs but is a welcome addition to my tool chest . Would definitely buy again if needed but would select the easier to see red handled version if I had the choice .	1
This tool was just what I needed for a difficult to access connector . Lots of under hood connectors get very brittle and fragile with age but this worked great in my application and I was able to lift the retaining snap just enough to remove it without breakage . Will it work every time ... probably not but it always helps to have the right tool for the job to minimize frustration . The tool I received had a grey handle not red like the picture . Not a big deal for me but thought it was worth mentioning for people who care about that ...	1
great heavy duty bag I have in my trunk . so many different spots to put your emergency items . and for the price you wont find anything better .	1
I considered all types of bags , plastic boxes and even Tupperware . But this Highland Organizer is super and fits in the left cornerof my trunk . At first glance , it appears flimsy but once it is opened and filled , it is quite substantial and hold a tremendousamount of stuff . I would consider a second one !	1
Have Used Mothers protectant for years and love it . Does a great job and I like the smell . Have had numerous people make comments how our 2011 CRV looks and smells brand new still ! !	1
This product is excellent . If you are the type who pays attention to detail , especially cleaning your dash , you will not be dissapointed . For best results , follow the directions EXACTLY ( this goes for all Mother 's brand products ) . I 've noticed that using Mother 's two step model : ( 1 ) evenly apply the product over the surface , wait , then ( 2 ) buff the surface to ensure an even application . Using this product like one would for armor all will not give you the intended results . Additionally , even a left-leaning Liberal ( I am not either ) would love this product as the ingredients are ph balanced .	1
I use this stuff all over my jeep all plastic parts even under hood . shines and protect for a long time mothers is the best	1
I used to be able to find Turtle Wax UV protector , which was a no-gloss protectant , I liked for plastic headlamp and taillamp covers . However , it 's been out-of-production for a while.This stuff , though , is perfect . No running , no greasy residue , no excessive wiping required .	1
I used this product on my 2014 Genesis Coupe and it is decent . It kind of leaves a semi glossy surface . Nothing that will blind you like some armorall products haha .	1
Rather than buying the individual spray bottles it is easier to buy the refill in addition to one spray bottle . Mothers makes the best products hands down .	1
ALWAYS ALWAYS A GREAT PRODUCT FROM MOTHERS . They have such a quality line of car car products . You can always find anything your looking for ... ~ ! !	1
I had always used a different brand for all my interior car detailing . I was out of product and came across this . After reading some of the reviews I thought I would give it a try . Was I ever happy I did . This is the best detailing product for all interior car surfaces that I have ever used . My car is 12 years old and I have always kept it clean and looking good . After using Mother 's Protectant on the dash and interior surfaces everything looked new again ! Even the faux wood trim . I then applied the product to every seal around the window and doors , they then looked deep black and new . In spots that were to small to get into I used an old toothbrush . I have now made Mother 's Protectant my go to interior detailing product as well as the product I use on all weather stripping and rubber seals .	1
Easy to apply . Long lasting protectant	1
This is by far the best protectant . All the other ones i have tried always leaves my dash board too shinny or too dull . This has the perfect amount of shine and it lasts for a long time .	1
AMAZING AWESOME WAX ... .~ ! !	1
I have been using the detailer as well as the liquid wax and I did not know what I had been missing . This paste wax last far longer than the liquid stuff . It is easy to apply and just as easy to polish . I love the product and it is priced very reasonably.This can will last me through many wax jobs .	1
I am a detaling nut and this wax over a top quality polish makes the car look loved !	1
I have been using this cleaner/wax for about 20 years . I have tried many others , but I keep coming back to this over and over again . And it smells good too ! !	1
Before this , I was using a spray wax . This takes a bit longer unless you have a power ball but it does a better job . Excellent , like all of the Mothers products I have tried so far	1
This pure carnuba wax goes on easy and wipes off easy and sure makes a car look brand new , of coarse I have a pretty good pint jod on my chrysler 300-C and that helps for the nice look .	1
You know the difference when you have this on your car and the rain pours . The water does n't stick . Nice slick surface .	1
Mothers 05500 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Paste - 12 ozI HAVE A LOT OF BOTTLES AND CANS OF WAX AROUND THE GARAGE . After using this last weekend on my 69 I am tossing out all the other stuff and sticking to this product . My truck looks so sweet and silky smooth I am sold . ***DOES NOT COME WITH APPLICATOR PAD***Buy with confidence.RagenRat	1
Have tried many different waxes on both modern and classic cars , both the old school rub-all-day types and the new-school spaceage polymers ... but I keep on coming back to Mothers Carnauba.Thoroughly clean each of our cars about once per month , and then they get a good detailed waxing at least once each year . I will wash them with a good car wash , use a clay bar to remove oxidation and then rebuild the deep shine with this wax.Mothers Carnauba really is easy to apply and a little goes a long way . I wax sections of about three square feet at one time , rubbing in a good layer , giving it a little time to bond , then hand buffing the residual off . The results looks great , but if I have a few extra minutes I 'll usually run an electric buffer ( have a nice one from Craftsman ) over the entire car to give it that totally gleaming car show style finish.One can of Mother Carnauba does go a long way , which makes it a really good product for the price . If looking for a good wax , this one is highly recommended .	1
I bought this to compare to my favorite one . I ca n't see any differance ? So give it a try . Costs a little less too . SW	1
I have been using Mother 's California Gold Carnauba Wax for over 20 years . It 's easy to apply , and tends to spread out nicely , so when it dries there usually is n't a thick layer with a lot of clumps , that needs to be removed . Dried wax buildup happens in some areas , but it is n't as big of an issue as with some other brands.A can of wax usually lasts a really long time . Of course buffing is the part that involves the most work , and while it still takes a little effort , it 's not that huge of a chore with this product . Very little dust is generated , and you get a nice shine that holds up reasonably well even under high UV exposure.Perhaps there is slightly less in the can now , or maybe the formula changed , but a can cost about $ 10 way back then , and it 's still about the same price now . Although I mostly prefer to use liquid or spray on type wax products , there are still times when I want to use paste wax , and this is the stuff I go with . It does the job , does n't require that much muscle , and also has a really nice smell . Try it , you 'll like it .	1
I 've been purchasing fancy waxes and polishes . They all look good just after being applied , but I noticed that they do n't seem to last . I thought I 'd go back to the basics and just try good old carnauba wax.I am not disappointed and will stick with carnauba wax from now on . It keeps on beading water way past the time that the others starting sheeting .	1
I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing . I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it . I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car . I do n't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps . Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs , stuck on dirt , and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System . I do n't clay every inch of the entire car . I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps . When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint , I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer , then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified . Normally , you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes . Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat . Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay , and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car . I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax . It easy to work with . I put it on a small section ( each side of the car is done in 4 sections , for example ) , by the time I am done spreading it , it is ready to be wiped off , you do n't have to wait . I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax , using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces . This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface . Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic , that 's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine . It is easy and pleasant to work with . I highly recommend it .	1
Looks great . Goes on easy and comes off easy.Only downside is it will last about a month or so depending on washing and weather .	1
If you want a product that has been around for yrs and yrs then buy this . It will work good and cost less than others .	1
Has n't changed my life , but it gives a nice polish . Goes on and off easily . Not a huge bottle , will order a couple next time .	1
I detailed two of my cars this week and used a paste wax on the Corvette while going through the identical process on my Jeep except using this liquid wax as the last step . The wax was very easy to put on and easy to use . In-fact I think it was easier to use than the paste wax . However , when I put both vehicles side by side the shines look identical . I think that is a plus for the liquid wax as it is easier to put on and remove than the paste waxes . I have never gotten a bad Mother 's product . This is highly recommended . It may cost a fraction more than some of the store brands however it is worth it .	1
I began with Step 1 Polish , and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze , and finished up with the Step 3 Wax , using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint . The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly , and after doing Step 1 and Step 2 , my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball . The car looks a brilliant white now . With all the work preparing the finish , I put 3 coats of wax on it . The car is a full-size , and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car , and despite the 3 coats of wax , there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs . Very pleased with the 3 Step process , and the Powerball .	1
The shine is pretty good and it still shined after 3 consecutive rain days . A little lasts a long way so use thin multiple coats instead of one thick coat . I had a little difficulty buffing off the haze at first ( cos I let it dry too long ) but i applied a few drops of water on the cloth and the haze came off pretty easily .	1
I got these for my brand new car since you do not really need to polish a new car . They work great . They pure Carnauba with no garbage added so you can rub them on any surface of your car and they do not leave a white film on , which is a huge bonus . They do give a nice shine and you really feel the protection they provide . I strongly recommend this WAX .	1
This was great . After using Mother 's Clay Bar System , I applied this wax and it was as smooth as a baby 's butt . Some other waxes that I have tried were much more difficult to apply and buff off .	1
this product is as good as the turtle platinun , carnauba Meguiars . and the prices are similar as well as the quality of the three brands , the brightness of the car depends on the quality of the painting and not the wax . for this reason the high prices of other products can not be justified , after several years of experience in this field I recommend fulfill any of the three , I recommend waxing every month depending on weather and if the car is exposed or not the sun ..	1
As the french say : cream de la cream.Does n't get any better.First you polish your car and after a few hours you apply this product . You apply this product every week for 3 months and your car comes alive , like smiling at you.I finished restoring a 35 yrs old BMW classic and this is the last stage.One has to be careful since other drivers keep looking at your car and may crash .	1
Since this product is designed to be used as a 3-Step system , along with the cleaner and carnuba wax , this review was also posted under the Step 1 and Step 2 products to help anyone who may miss one of the products ... I have a 1970 American Motors AMX with the bittersweet orange color which I bought new and drove until 1983 . Since then , the car has set under the carport , uncovered , collecting dirt and grime . Its only use has been to serve as our cats `` perch '' . You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked . Truthfully , I was skeptical ... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try . So based on that recommendation , I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally . I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing . After rinsing the car off ( it does n't run yet , so I just sponged it off ) to get the worst of the grime off , then set to work with the cleaner . I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done : and the results were nothing short of amazing ; However , some haze was still visible . So I applied a second coat of cleaner . That one went on much easier , and following the final hand rub , the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product , preceded by the step 1 cleaner , and step 2 sealer has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years , and exposed to wind , temperature extremes , and blowing rain and snow , there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint . They still remain ( after all , it 's an old car with completely original paint ) . But that 's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition . I ran short and had to buy a second bottle . In my mind , that 's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System . You can save a few bucks on shipping to buy it that way.Happy Waxin ' ... & lt ; > & lt ;	1
Item arrived when promised , and was well packaged . I like the way this wax goes on , and it does leave a beautiful brilliant shine on my car . It does require a little extra effort to get that sweet look .	1
Great wax ! Hazed over in about a minute and came off really easily . Non-oily and gives a great shine . It did n't stain any trim pieces either . Plus it smells great like all the other Mothers polishes/waxes/detail sprays .	1
After the rain I 'd usually have dirt on the sides and on the back . After doing all 3 steps and going through a day of rain , those pesky black rain drops were n't on the back or splash marks on the side . the dirt did n't stick .	1
Works well . I have been using Mothers for 6 years to wax my Honda Ridgeline truck and Audi A4 Cabriolet . I do the 3 step process a couple times a year and then just reply Carnauba wax as needed . This gives my car & truck a great finish and the paint still looks brand new on both !	1
I reviewed the other Mother 's products and like I said before you cant beat this price . I bought steps 1-3 and the claybar . Once my products run out I will buy this again .	1
Ease of application and removal leaving a beautiful , durable shine . I have detailed high end cars for years and this is a great product for the price . Mother 's is a name to trust when you want excellent product quality . They over achieve .	1
Mothers car wax and polish are the best car care products i have used . If you care about your cars paint i recommend buying 3 Mothers Ultra Soft Microfiber Quick Detail Towels , MOTHERS California Gold Car Wash and doing the three step polish and wax twice a year .	1
I WAX THE CAR/MOTORCYCLES ALL THE TIME AND I RATE THIS LIQUID WAX HIGHER THAN MEGUIAR 'S THAT I HAVE USED FOR YEARS . YOU WILL LIKE HOW IT GOES ON AND BUFFS/SHINES UP SO EASILY . GREAT FRAGRANCE TOO .	1
I used the Mother 's 3 step process on my C6 Corvette . Easy to apply and wipe away . Each step has a different purpose and I noticed a nice clean deep shine by the time I finished step 3 . I was a bit skeptical and had tried different carnauba waxes in the past . But this 3 step process has given my car the best shine to date . I 'm a believer !	1
This product works and smells amazing , however only use this product if the paint is entirely clean , if not use Mothers Cleaner Wax instead as it cleans and protects in one step .	1
this is a really good wax . it gives a deep gloss and shine . It goes on easy and comes off easy without flaking.very good value .	1
This product shines like no other ! Goes on easy , comes off easy . I 've used every wax out there this one is by far the best . I use it on my new MazdaSpeed3 . It keeps my car looking amazing . Water beeds for more than 3 months and I cover my car daily and wash it ever week . Good job mothers ! Oh , by the way I use the three step system . This one works the best .	1
Very good product , goes on easy and more important comes off the same way . Easy to use by good old elbow grease if not using a DA machine . Do not hesitate to purchase . IMO , much better than that product that starts with M and beads water nicely . I am already on my second bottle and here at the big A I do n't have to go to circus town ( WM ) in my car .	1
I 've used many other 'over the counter ' brands from Meguiar 's NXT , GoldGlass to Eagle1 Nanowax and none of those products comes close to Mothers Pure Carnuba Wax when it comes to deep , reflective shine and ease of use . Period.I started using this product and noticed the difference right away . Seriously , this is the most underrated wax on the market . Anyone with a black car should give this wax a shot and I will make a bet that you too will see the difference . Even my coworkers saw the difference right away . Just by switching to this wax . They commented that it was `` brighter and really glossy '' .This wax does provide a very nice , reflective shine . Very easy to apply and wipe off . You wo n't be disappointed with this wax . Other waxes ( especially those synthetic polymers wax ) Such as NXT requires that you wait at least 20 minutes for the wax to dry before you buff it out . Even then , they still show signs of `` smears or streaks or oily residue '' on dark colored cars . This carnuba wax dries in no time . By the time you apply the last coat , you can start buffing out the first panel you apply the wax on.The shine is just simply amazing . The smell however is not.This is one of the most underrated waxes out there . Do yourself and your car a favor and get this wax . ( See comments for pics ! )	1
Great stuff . I use Mothers ultimate wax system and it brings back very aged paint . I would recommend this product .	1
I used this as step 3 of the 3 step process which has as step 1 the Gold Pure Product and the Micro-Polishing Glaze as step 2 . This step is the hardest of the 3 and takes the same amount of time to do as steps 1 and 2 combined . You could probably just use this on your clear coat finished vehicle and get excellent results . The wax is pretty thick and it takes some effort to apply and some sustained effort to remove . When you are finished you will have a smooth , shiny , mirror-like finish which is gorgeous . Be prepared to dedicate an entire afternoon to do all 3 steps . On my Mercedes SLK roadster it took 2 hours and I am very happy with the results .	1
I have a dark colored car , so I purchased one of those `` black '' tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim . Wrong . I also use a regular ( not black ) liquid spray polish detailer . It 's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper . But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did . Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid ( not black ) . So my product applicator ( an old sock ) and my wiping cloth ( an old t-shirt , both from my husband ) are n't stained . I 'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone .	1
This stuff works fantastic . I have a lot of black bumpers on my car , and after applying this the car really looks like new . It makes a bigger difference than I expected . You do need to reapply it every few months or so to keep the effect going .	1
I drive an older SUV that has a lot of plastic on the outside . The plastic trim had lost it 's color and looked sun damaged and pretty terrible . At first , `` back to black '' did n't sound like what I needed , since the plastic I needed to treat was grey , not black . But , I read about this stuff on another website , and it can be used for all sorts of plastics/vinyls etc. , not just black color . Anyway , this stuff really works . My car is looking much better now . I did the first coat and it is looking very good . I 'll follow up with another coat soon , and hopefully it will look even better !	1
Bought product to try on mirrors and bumpers and mud flaps a friend said ot is amazing stuff we will see	1
The Jeep Wrangler ( 1999 model ) has wide plastic type fenders over each wheel well . These black plastic fenders , at least on my vehicle , turned and discolored over the years . I tried numerous products and while many would restore the black , the color would eventually fade and I would be right back to where I started . I ordered this Mother 's product and applied that to my fenders . I was very surprised at the amount of color restoration I got from applying two or three coats . The black did return and my fenders looked great . I have now been driving the vehicle about three months and I still have nice looking fenders . I also used the polish on my black running boards and the end caps on both the front and rear bumpers . All received the polish well and color looks good . It is easy to apply and then wife . Do n't leave the polish on too long after drying as it will be more difficult to polish .	1
This product is PERFECT for keeping the plastic fenders and bumpers on my Wrangler JK . I am kind of a freak about keeping my 'baby ' looking new and this does the trick . I 've even had a fellow Jeep owner stop me in the parking lot of REI and ask me how I kept my bumpers and fenders looking so black . Definitely does the trick ... although a bottle does n't go very far for me .	1
Great for all those black trims on the car.Not a permanent fix , but should be good for a few months , depending on how faded your black parts are .	1
I use this on a variety of parts on my car . I use it on the B pillars , the black side mirror mounts , areas of trim around the door jams , trunk sealants , etc.I wash these parts with whatever method is necessary , make sure the parts are completely dry , apply the Back-to-Black and let it dwell for 10-15 minutes . Then wipe of the excess and reapply ( with MF cloth or applicator ) . I let dwell again for ~10 minutes and wipe down excess with clean MF towel . I use the cheaper towels for these areas as there is no use in using premium MF towels for this type of project.The areas have a nice semi-gloss shine and last and last for at least a month or longer . I 've never gone past one month without treating these same areas again so maybe they 'd last even longer , but , I just prefer to keep my car looking reasonably clean.It 's cheap enough and a little goes a loooong way . No need to over-apply . Use sparingly as using a 2nd application is recommended and worthwhile .	1
If you are restoring a 35 years old BMW classic you need only the best and this ( as all Mothers products I have used so far- and they are many ) is among if not the best.Several applications ( every week ) during the first 3 months have restored all rubber to its new like condition and this brings not only a better look but also brings back the purpose of seals all over the car . From noise reduction to air tightness to better working AC and well , many other advantages.Believe me , I do n't own the company !	1
Under suggestion of the owner of a local autopart store , I tried this on my 2006 Mustang convertible top , which is black and made of vinyl . The results have been amazing . I was previously using Ragg Topp , but I find this way better in how easy it is to spread it . It is also far cheaper .	1
I thought that the product would be thicker but it goes on smooth and last for a long time just rember to buff it out with a clean cloth or when it rain it will streek .	1
Mothers products way back when they for motorcycle tanks and fenders were the shizzle . Lets just say if its mothers the price is a bit more but so is the quality .	1
I 've tried every blackening product out there , Black-Magic , Armor All , Meguiar 's , and even my own concoction and none work as well as this . Not only that , it lasts about 3-4 weeks outside in the weather , which I find amazing.Also it seems like the more you use it , the better it looks and the longer it stays black . Plus it has a pleasant smell , which is always nice.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit runny , which can make applying it a bit hard , but it 's still worth every cent.A must have for anyone with black trim/molding !	1
I use this stuff to keep fenders black on my jeep tj . then I retouch every time I wash my jeep	1
I 've heard of various tips and tricks to bring your black plastic exterior parts back to life - from using a heat gun , to , well , & # 34 ; Back to Black & # 34 ; . This lasts longer , and does n't require a heatgun treatment which may harm other parts . I think it looks brilliant - and so far has not 'crazed ' any surface I 've used it on . I can safely recommend this for a 'make it look newer ' project .	1
Applied with a sponge wax applicator and follow up with a microfiber wipe down , this product leaves a & # 34 ; like new & # 34 ; luster to the black plastic trim surfaces of your car . Easy to apply , the results have that just like new appearance that you look for . Great under the hood too where other products leave a greasy too wet look , this is my go to product for a classic , understated appearance .	1
this product works great ..I applied one coat and you could see the difference . I applied 2nd coat and my plastic trim looked brand new ..its been 3 wks and still looks great ... .the only down side is that it will stay oily or tacky until it dries..i will buy this product again ... .	1
My car does not have a lot of black plastic trim . It 's a Cadillac CTS , and the only black areas are around the front and rear fascia , and the door pillars . But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years . The car is even garage kept most of the time . Many of the black trim restoring products on Amazon have a wide range of reviews ; from 1 to 5 stars for most if not every similar product . I chose Mothers because I use many of their other products , typically with good results . Back to Black did not disappoint . I applied it to the plastic trim around the fascia using `` 12pcs Waxing Polish Wax Foam Sponge Applicator Pads Fit for Clean Car Vehicle Auto Glass High_quality Yellow Useful NEW '' ( from Amazon ) which are ideal for this task . Mothers instructions state that the area should be buffed after application . I found buffing unnecessary on the trim around the fascia . I did try buffing at first , but these areas are somewhat rough-textured and seemed to absorb the liquid fairly quickly . Buffing did not change the appearance.However , on the door pillars , the texture is smooth and buffing did make a appreciable difference there . Buffing with a soft towel helped to more evenly distribute the Back to Black , eliminating some minor streaking resulting from application . Buffing also improved the gloss of the black color , which would have been more like flat black prior to buffing . So whether to buff or not depends on the type of material where the product is being applied . Back to Black is also very good at removing any excess wax that gets on the fascia trim areas.Most of the negative reviews of this and similar black detailing products are because they need periodic reapplication . I found this to be true also of Back to Black . But no black detailer is going to be a miracle product and last forever . Mothers lasts for 2 or 3 months depending on the weather and how frequently the car is washed . This seems perfectly reasonable to me .	1
I 'm on my 3rd bottle of this stuff . It does the job for me . There might be a better product out there but every time I run out of Black-to-Black I just buy another bottle . It works so why should I try anything else ? Ok , that 's a bad attitude . When I use up all the product in this bottle I 'll try something different . Maybe .	1
Used on a second hand tonneau cover , restored the black back to new looking . It took a couple of applications , but worked well . Also effective on other trim items , not necessarily only black . It works like a clear polish that leaves no white residue .	1
I used this in place of Armorall wipes one day to discover it did a better job and lasted way longer . This will turn anything that you have black ( black plastic , rubber , leather , etc ) that it is safe to use on , back to the original color . The only down side that I have noticed is that it will come off when wet . Otherwise , it looks great and does n't seem to be affected by the sun , at least , not that I can tell .	1
This product restored my black trim on my bumper , fender and side door panels ! The only draw back is the bottle is small and if you have a large truck you may want to invest in another bottle .	1
Bought Meguires and Mothers brands . The Mothers brand is a lot better . It gets the plastic trim back to black , and it stays that way alot longer than the Mequires brand	1
It 's been three years since I last applied this to my '08 Avalanche , and my black trim was burned up , faded with a white film and looked really shabby . After washing and drying , and applying Mother 's back to black I am thoroughly satisfied . Mothers did a great job restoring my trim back to black.My trim was very dry and It absorbed so much product that I used the whole bottle and did n't get to the mud flaps and the running boards ( which were not as bad as the trim around the bed and cab of the truck ) . A couple of things impressed me , it really evened out the blemishes and brought all the trim to a consistent black color . This was extremely evident around the bed of the truck where part of flat areas are expose and some flats areas are protected by deck lids ( on the various compartments ) , which when opened revealed a sharp line between the two areas . After applying back to black you could not tell the difference , the trim was even in color and shine . It looked brand new ... Impressive , indeed.But just to say out loud , it 's important to work back to black into the sun baked dry parts . if it is really dry , like mine was , you may have to hit it several times . That 's the key , get the rag saturated with the product and keep working it in until the trim can not absorb any more . Once you 've reached that point , go back with a clean dry towel and wipe off the excess and buff it so that the shine is in the trim and not from the excess product on the trim . Do n't go by sight , feel the trim with your hand until there is no excess product on it ... keep drying and buffing until the trim shines on its own . If you do n't , you 'll get streaking . If you do , you wo n't regret it .	1
I began with Step 1 Polish , and continued with the Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze , using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint . The Powerball saved my hands , and this Micro-Polish and Glaze made the white surface of my car reflect like a mirror . You ca n't see the micro scratches easily on a white car , but you could see how smooth the surface was , and you could feel it . I followed up with 3 coats of the Step 3 wax , and the car looks showroom new . There is enough left in the bottle , after doing my full-size car , for at least another full-size car . Good value !	1
This product is very good but not great . It 's their consumer grade polishing glaze and their professional line is really great ! A good product at a very reasonable price .	1
When I hit the three-quarters post I 'm ready for Mother 's glaze to slide to the finish line.If you do it right the paint looks like glass . However , if you have a lousy paint job do n't waste your money.This product is for people who can afford the best finishes and want to sit around and get classy-eyed and polish their cars trying to impress someone . No machines . You need a microfiber towel and keep flipping it over to get a really nice glare.I do n't care what is in the stuff . It shows a noticeable difference . I care more about what beer I 'll drink doing the job .	1
Since this product is designed to be used as a 3-Step system , along with the cleaner and carnuba wax , this review was also posted under the Step 1 and Step 3 products to help anyone who may miss one of the products ... I have a 1970 American Motors AMX with the bittersweet orange color which I bought new and drove until 1983 . Since then , the car has set under the carport , uncovered , collecting dirt and grime . Its only use has been to serve as our cats `` perch '' . You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked . Truthfully , I was skeptical ... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try . So based on that recommendation , I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally . I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing . After rinsing the car off ( it does n't run yet , so I just sponged it off ) to get the worst of the grime off , then set to work with the cleaner . I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done : and the results were nothing short of amazing ; However , some haze was still visible . So I applied a second coat of cleaner . That one went on much easier , and following the final hand rub , the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product , followed by the step 2 sealer , and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years , and exposed to wind , temperature extremes , and blowing rain and snow , there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint . They still remain ( after all , it 's an old car with completely original paint ) . But that 's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition . I ran short and had to buy a second bottle . In my mind , that 's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System . You can save a few bucks on shipping to buy it that way.Happy Waxin ' ... & lt ; > & lt ;	1
The Micro-Polish used with the regular Mother 's polish really intensifies the shine . Plus it does a great job at filling in any larger scratches .	1
After using Step 1 - Pure Polish ( really a pre-wax cleaner ) , I went on to this Glaze/Sealer . And boy does it make my car look REAL good ! Although this polish wo n't cut harsh enough to remove swirl marks and scratches , it seems to `` hide '' swirl marks and make them less visible ( possibly by smoothing out the microscopic edges ? ) . Add to the fact that it doubles as a glaze/sealer , and it fills up the swirl marks and scratches . Scratches are still visible , but the edges are smoothed out and less visible from farther away . Swirl marks are still visible , but only up close and takes a tiny bit more focusing to see them . So , it does n't cure scratches or swirl marks very well , but what does it do best ? Enhance the color ! This glaze makes the paint `` pop '' and adds even MORE depth , revealing long lost shades in some paint colors ( in my case , Mazda 's Galaxy Grey Mica ) . It brings out the color of the paint and makes you appreciate your car even more ! I feel like this glaze will be effective even on lighter colored cars ( maybe not white ... ) since it seems that darker colors seem to get all the love when it comes to detailing . ; ) Believe me , after you do this step , you 'll be looking at your car from different angles trying to figure out how many different colors & shades you can find and how `` deep '' the paint looks.Well worth it .	1
This is part of the 3 step process . It brings the show room floor shine back to an aging vehicle . You see the difference with each step .	1
I bought steps 1-3 and you cant beat the price . This product is easy to use and it also smells great .	1
When it comes to car care mothers is the best . I did the three steps of the polish and wax products and it cleaned the jet black paint on my car very good .	1
I purchase this product and applied it . I skipped Step 1 since im applying it to a bnew car . After applying this product i can immediately notice the effect . It 's very shiny and Glossy . Now for my Step 3 i did not use Mother 's Carnauba but i used Mother 's FX Synwax and what a combination . I 'm really glad i tried this combination . It works with my car . I hope it last long..	1
I use it to wax my cars . It works great and smells good . The price is reasonable compared to other products . I use Porter Cable 7424XP and Meguiars 6 & # 34 ; foam pads .	1
Reason I bought this : I have been cleaning , claying , then waxing for awhile now . I own an 06 scion TC and pampered it with the steps above . but then tragedy ... minor scuffs from the kids getting out of the back seat . Careless people brushing their groceries/backpacks/fat butts against my freaggin car ! after all the scuffs and scratches washing was the only real priority now , years later I look at my once gorgeous car and think to myself it still looks ... okay . then i miss that feeling of satisfaction of that wet/glossy look . I tried waxing which made the car shiny but the scars still remained , it only covered the lightest of scratches at most.Review : Then by looking up any new clay bar kits i happened to see amazon recommend a 3 step from mothers car care products . I didnt know about sealants , and after reading it i bought the whole kit and was surprised . step one cleaned well enough , but step 2 made those pesky scratches less noticeable , only I would see them since I know where they are . the deeper ones are still their but the glaze makes it so shiny its hard to focus on the scratches , which are usually the focus of a car . This is probably the best visual result from the 1-3 process.Tips and processClaying has to be key for it to work , so I think I like my 5 step process better . 1 wash/day 2. clay 3. mothers step 1 pre wax cleaner 4. mothers step 2 sealer glaze and last 5 . Mothers step 3 California gold wax ( if you arent a mothers fan for wax you can use any you like ontop of the glaze ) Personally i like mothers wax , its shines well and easy to apply . I will wait to review the wax because I want to see its durability and water beading properties . I like it better than turtle wax paste , which i used years ago .	1
I suppose you could use this without first using the Gold Pure Polish and you will get a reasonably shining car . However , if you want to do the job right , start with the Gold Pure Polish to get the pollution and other crime removed from your finish and the proceed with this glaze . The glaze is not very thick so be careful squirting it out of the bottle . This product goes on easily and comes off easily . Afterwards your vehicle will be shiny , however to go all the way you need to finish the job with the Gold Carnauba Wax . You need to commit to an entire afternoon to do all three steps .	1
I have been using this for years , and it is hands down the best quick detailer on the market . Products like Meguiars Ultimate Detailer are more of a spray wax type product rather than a detailer , as they withstand car washes . However , those products can not be used on fresh paint , and they are a bit harder to apply/remove than the Mothers Showtime ( which is safe for fresh paint - confirmed with Mothers ) . Not to mention it has a great smell , provides a deep shine , and fills in light swirl marks . The 24oz version from Amazon is a great deal , and if you try it , you wo n't be disappointed . The same goes for any Mothers product , actually .	1
I have used about every car detailer on the market for my Corvette as it goes to several shows a year . The Mothers brand caught my eye and even though it cost a little more than some of the other brands it is an excellent product . Easy to apply and wipes off with a nice shine . When I arrive at the show site , I take out my spray bottle of Mother'sCalifornia Gold and touch up any places needed so I have a great presentation for viewers.I have never had a poor product from Mothers.This is an update -- I was out of this product and stopped at the car parts store and they were out of stock so I purchased a substitute which did an excellent job however I paid almost 80 % more for the substitute product and the Mother 's Detailer was equal to the higher priced product . I still think this is the best buy for detailer on the market .	1
I have been using `` instant detailers '' for over a decade , mostly the Meguiar 's product in the purple spray bottle . It did a good job , smelled nice , and left the car clean . But as I am always looking for a better shine , I decided to give the Mother 's Instant Detailer a try , and I 'm glad I did . Indeed , until I decided to try the Mother 's product , I assumed that all `` instant detailers '' were pretty much alike . Not so ! In my experience , the Mother 's product not only cleans the car but it also produces greater shine , depth and gloss . It also seems to brighten the finish as well . My take : it 's a superior product.Mother 's Instant Detailer is very mild , it smells great , and makes a noticeable difference in a car 's appearance . I no longer use the other brand.Since discovering Mother 's Instant Detailer I have tried a number of other Mother 's wax products , and found them to be at least a notch or two above the current offerings of the major retail store competitors . Of course , car detailing goals and results can be very subjective ; nonetheless , for the discriminating car enthusiast who wants their car to look its best , do yourself a favor and give this product a try -- I think you 'll like it .	1
I love this stuff ! I ca n't keep my car in a garage , so I use a car cover almost every day of the year . I hate going through the day long meticulous labor of washing , clay baring , and waxing my car more than a couple times a year , so I use this stuff . After washing and clay baring my car , I use the Mother 's wax and throw the cover on . Each week I dust the car , and depending on the need I use this spray detailer weekly or bi-weekly . I do n't know exactly what 's in it , but I assume it 's some sort of liquid wax . It really helps to preserve the original wax job and helps it last for months . It also cleans bird droppings , grime , and general filth gently and easily . Using it could n't be easier . Just spray on , wipe with a microfiber cloth , and dry with another microfiber cloth . One bottle will last me two to three uses on the entire car , depending on how heavy I am with the application . An excellent product all around !	1
I bought this because a friend told me about it and he was right because the shine is beautiful and it brings out the luster in the paint . Spray it on wipe it off wait and wipe off the hue and the car looks beautiful . If you go to car shows or want your ride to look like show room then buy this stuff , you can even spray it on the glass this stuff is great .	1
The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off . The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area . The spray wipes off easily . The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it . Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up . It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth . It 's good stuff but does n't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job .	1
This product comes with Mothers clay bar kit and I 've never used it by itself , but while clay barring my car . It 's a nice product .	1
This is great for when the car is essentially clean but needs a little buffing up ! My car is always garaged and gets dusty even though it is in an enclosed environment . SO this is good stuff for when I do n't need to actually wash the car .	1
I like them both , as both are the top end in auto cleaning products . I have a 12 year old Acura and it looks like new as I use this product after washes every 2 weeks . I wax twice a year ( April and Oct ober ) and touch up after every wash with this detailer . That is all it takes to keep a car looking like new as long as you own it . Takes no more than 15 minutes for the whole car .	1
I use this for small areas of the auto that gets water spots or dirty . Excellent for dusting as well , avoids dry dusting that may leave swirls .	1
I love this stuff . I do n't want to wash my car every 4 days but it gets dusty and birds use my car for target practice while I 'm at work . Just spray my car down and wipe , takes less than 5 minutes and my car looks great . Perfect item to use between washes . And I love the smell ! I 'll be buying this stuff by the gallons !	1
Love this stuff , makes your cars shine . Recommended for all who want a nice and easy shine . Very low price for this product .	1
I 've used Mothers product for a long time and have never bee dissatisfied , and this detailing mist is perfect . Although probably not recommended I 've used this on a slightly dirty , dirty not dusty , car and it had done a fantastic job . I just have plenty of micro fiber towels and keep changing the surface , finishing off with a dry buff . Our car looks great .	1
As its name , the instant detailer does it job quickly . I give it 4 stars since it does its job . However , I rather spend money to something else . For car outside , you should use the right product to make the waxing/polishing job last long . For car inside , you use plastic/vinyl protection on your leather/vinyl/plastic and fabric cleaning with good smell to do the job . The product has OK smell but not that great .	1
I used this with the Mothers Powerball 4Paint and it went on easily , and I could spend the time on every surface giving the polishing I wanted , without wearing out my hands . I have a white car , so the effect was not as visible as it would be on a darker car , but the smooth feel of the surface afterwards told me it did a great job . I also used the Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze , and Step 3 wax , and the car looks showroom new . There is enough left in the bottle , after doing my full-size car , for at least another full-size car . Good value !	1

Hazes in about 30 seconds and comes off relatively easy . It also gives a mirror like finish . Plus it does a good job of removing hairline scratches and swirl marks .	1
I recently got the whole Ultimate Wax System and decided to give it a shot.This polish IS A PRE-WAX CLEANER . It is very mild and will take off old wax and oxidation , but it will NOT remove most swirl marks and scratches . ( Consider something else if you 're looking to cure these pre-wax ! ) . This polish would be more beneficial on cars with old wax and/or oxidation . On newer vehicles , although this is not necessary unless you want to remove any previous wax you might have done , it 's still worth using just for a peace of mind kind of thing . It 'll help revitalize the color on oxidized paint and it 'll enhance the depth and color of non-oxidized paint.On my car , a Mazda3 in Galaxy Grey Mica , there was no oxidized paint , but after using this polish , it brings out the color a little bit more via the clear coat . It adds a little more depth and shine , making for a nice pre-wax prep.Worth giving it a shot , whether your car is oxidized or not !	1
Mothers polish bought back the depth in my shine . Used all 3 steps to make my car look new again	1
I had bought other mothers products from amazon and you cant beat the price . Step 3 really shines your car like a boss .	1
I like Mother 's products . They are affordable , and work well when used correctly . The thing about mothers is it is not the best on the market , but as for price , availability , and ease of use any novice to car detailing can make a car look stunning.personal processI wash my car and used a clay bar to before using this product . The clay will remove heavy contaminants and prep the surface to be smooth . It so happens I use the mothers california gold clay bar kit which IMO is the best for the price . The detailer is just ok , the clay is great and so is the premium microfiber towel . The reason why I mentioned all of this is that you need to prep your car before starting to use the 1-2-3 system.So on to the actual review , the step one part they call a pre wax cleaner . If I 'm not mistaken it is either a very mild type of car polish and may contain abrasives . Basically it will smooth out your cars surface , and make it shiny from the clear coat surface . I think it did a fair job making it shine and removing surface residue from the clay and detailer . It did an okay job so far with very light swirlmarks . since I am unfamiliar with other polishing compounds that I have been hearing about I will give this product of 3.5 rounded to 4 stars . just because I like it enough for the ease of use/money/amount and ending result . I may change the rating if I like other products I try in the future . but for this price and the amount they give ( 16oz ) this will last me awhile because its 1-2 times a year use . now thats bang for the buck . On my Tc i estimate about 2oz was used for the entire car .	1
This is step 1 of a 3 step process to get your vehicle as close to show condition as possible . It is easy to apply and easy to wipe off . It removes a lot of pollution and other things which dull your finish so you probably will want to launder or even throw away the microfiber towels used to apply and remove this . After you are done the finish is rather dull so only use this product if you are committed to at least going on to step 2 , Polishing Glaze .	1
AWESOME PRODUCTS ... ..~ ! ! ! !	1
I really love the quality and scent of this cleaner .	1
This is one of the necessary evils to keep my vehicles looking good . It is not a lot of fun but it gets all the contaminats off your vehicle so you can polish . Comes with everything you need . Just spray the lubricant on the vehicle and on the clay itself and start rubbing . It is amazing how much comes off even after it has been washed . I normally do a 2 ft x 2 ft section and refold the clay after each section is done to get a clean side . When it becomes pretty bad I use it to clean off my wheels . I 've tried both Meguiars and Mothers and I like Mothers a little better .	1
I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum , where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago . Since then I clay my car twice a year , in the spring and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing . I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it . I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip . This keeps it pliable and clean . It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package . If clay dries out it will stop working . And it is sticky , so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car . Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish , so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly ( i.e . with plenty of lubrication ) .The clay material ( which feels like play-doh ) makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish . Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication , which Showtime Instant Detailer , included in this package , provides.I start by washing my car . I do n't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps . Then I clay the car . I do n't clay every inch of the entire car . I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps . When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint , I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer , then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified . Normally , you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes . Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat . Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay , and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car . This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs . Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome . It does a great job as well . After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces . This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface . Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic , that 's why I do back-to-black as the last step .	1
I used Mothers California Gold Clay Bar to clean my car 's paint before using DA polisher . I washed my car two times and then used Mother 's clay bar . Even after two washes , when I ran my hand on the paint to feel the surface before and after claying I could feel the difference . After claying the paint was appreciably smoother.The application was very easy - just spray the included solution and slide the bar on the paint , knead the clay when it smudges appear . The box warns that if the bar is dropped it has to be discarded , so I was mindful of not dropping it and I did not . It was quite easy to hold and use.The only thing I did not like about this product is that the solution smelled like cinnamon . I am not a fan of cinnamon and that smell is unpleasant to me.Overall , this is a great product .	1
This is the first time using a clay bar , very simple.Follow the instructions or look at the many videos on line.Quick and very easy to use and took less than 20 minutes	1
Very nice kit and amazon has the best price on this ( beats walmart by a few dollars ) . The clay is a little tough to knead but it works nicely on paint and leaves it very smooth . You will probably use most of the showtime detailer so just be ready for that . The towel is nice as well , just some lint here and there . The whole process is time consuming , but it makes waxing your car easier and the shine will last a lot longer .	1
This is one product that in my opinion is well worth the money . I just finished the hood on my car and the result is great . You can feel the grit and grime on the surface and once you apply this product the surface is as smooth a it can be not to mention how shiney it was . I then applied Mother 's wax and now have a surfce better looking that the day the vehicle left the dealership .	1
I used this on a 1994 Caddy and a 1991 Honda Goldwing and its amazing how slick it gets the surfaces.Of course after I clay barred them I always applied a good polish . Great kit .	1
I used this on my girlfriends 12 year old Solara , and it really did the job . Her car was very rough to the touch , and after using this clay bar , it made it much smoother ( almost like it had been waxed ) . Make sure after using this clay bar to wax your car after . The car now looks 100x better than it did before .	1
I enjoyed using this product on my vehicle . Looks and feels much smoother.I spent some time working on the entire car . It took a lot longer than the 30-45 minutes people have been posting.The `` Mothers Clay Bar System '' did remove most of the debris off of the surface , but it did leave behind dots of tree sap , and some tar that kicked up on the side of my car . ( I did work on it extensively attempting to remove everything . ) The system worked well for me , just not up to the hype I had read about.I noticed a big difference in drying off my car now . Before a microfiber towel would stick , now it glides ! If you want to spend sometime with your car I would recommend it . Do n't expect miracles.Hope this reviews helps ! Thanks for reading it ! : )	1
I would definitely recommend this to anybody who is looking for a clean finish . It is definitely worth the price and hard work .	1
Our Jaguar had specs on the entire back end and these clay slabs got them cleaned off . PERFECT ! ! ! ! !	1
It 's a good kit for beginners because it has everything you need to get started . I used this on my six month old Honda . Since it 's still new , there was n't oxidation or anything like that . Just normal industrial fallout that left a non-smooth feel when stroking the surface with the back of your hand . Well , after claying the surface it 's like someone finally gave the surface a real bath - baby smooth now . I also used this on the glass and same effect .	1
Love all Mothers car care products . Use the clay after wash to remove any deposits in the paint , then 3M glaze to bring out the shine , followed by Mothers California Gold wax to protect and seal . Two to three times a year is all you need .	1
The clay bar works just fine , this is the first time i try clay bars , but it does work ; i dont really like the detailer that much , ive tried turtle wax ice , and the platinum series and those are much better detailers . with that aside i dont mean to say that this detailer spray wont work , it does , but ive tried better ones like the ones i mentioned above	1
I could n't believe my eyes that all the gunk that was stuck to my car disappeared ! The Clay Bar System really helped restore my car paint like new . It was shiney and smooth~ I was scared to use this product , but my car really needed it . I 'm really happy with the results and I plan to purchase more in the near future .	1
I 've owned a black car for 25 years and keeping it clean and keeping swirls out for the paint is tough . So I bought another black car but this time I searched you tube for car care and found things about & # 34 ; claying & # 34 ; your car . I thought & # 34 ; no way & # 34 ; I 'm going to rub a bar of clay on my black car , that would just scratch it to death . Well I was wrong , even after a good cleaning there is still dirt particles in the paint , just do the plastic bag test and you will see . I used the clay bar as instructed and it deep cleaned the surface and in turn I could seal the paint after the claying job . It does an amazing job on cleaning your paint . I have used it to remove scuff marks , bird doo , bugs , about anything that is on your paint .	1
I 've been using this product for years and will state for the record that it really does work . It will not bring back a badly oxidized , neglected paint job . It does n't work miracles like that , but it really does work if you use on a car that has n't been allowed to rot or been forgotten . This product works best when used after a thorough wash . Some people use it while washing , but I feel this can have a negative effect as it may help to embed dirt and contaminants instead of allowing the suds to lift and carry them away . Plenty of the included spray detailer must be used or else the clay will stick to the car . I personally do n't rub too aggressively , and I do n't believe that is necessary . After the clay the residue is wiped away with a microfiber cloth . While you can leave the car as is , it is a really good idea to put on a coat of wax immediately after claying the car . You will be amazed at how smooth and slick the car 's paint will be after just claying , and with the wax it 'll feel like you greased the surface . The results can be incredible if you are patient and follow the directions . The only thing to remember is that if the clay bar ever falls on the ground it must be thrown away . Trying to use it after that would be akin to taking a sanding block to the car . You ca n't go wrong with Mother 's products .	1
I love this product and it works great ; however , my only problem is that the detail spray is barely enough for a mid-sized sedan . That being said , It works great ! I would have given 5 stars if there was twice as much detail spray .	1
Started detailing autos for local used car lot . Thought I would try this product for first time . The results turned out great . Product was easy to use . The auto dealer called to let me know it was the best detail he had ever seen . I am sold on Mother products and this one especially .	1
Used on my son 's 2006 Scion XA . Needed BAD ! Did the job as expected ! His car looks new ! Thanks for the product !	1
I just bought my first car at the age of 42 . I once had a car assigned to me for two years , but other than that I 've only had single day rentals . So of course , in the honeymoon stage with my 2007 Honda Element , I wanted to make it look as beautiful as possible before showing it off to my family at Thanksgiving.So I went to a local pro detailer . To hand wash and vacuum out the car it would be $ 25 ; to clay bar the car and do the wash it 's $ 75 ; full detailing cost $ 150 . That 's pretty decent , and I would n't mind paying to have the pro do the job , but for $ 18 I wanted to try clay barring it myself.The instructions could n't be simpler , though I would add that you should at least rinse off the car and let it air dry for a few minutes before starting to clay bar . You do n't have to be particularly gentle or slow about it , and do n't worry about getting the chamois dirty -- you can wash it or just get another one for cheap.Just spray , rub , wipe it down with the cloth , and move on to the next spot until you 've done the whole car . Do n't worry about getting into ever single little nook and cranny . I imagine even the pros do n't bother with that unless they 're literally working on a showpiece.Trust me , you could n't fail to be happy with the results , and for $ 18 why not try.When you 're finished clay barring the car , take it to a car wash for a nice wash and wax ( or do that yourself as well ) and see the gorgeous results . The car will look as new as it possibly could.Lastly , I want to dispell a myth about clay barring . I heard -- from a pro amongst others -- that what clay barring does is reverse the oxydization of the paint which makes the finish dull , amongst other wierd science theories . That 's rediculous ; car wax does that . All clay barring does is pick up tiny bits of stuff -- airborn metal specks , asphalt dust , microscopic bits of rock , space debris -- which have become embedded in the paint . That 's it . It 's basically just removing the millions of tiny little splinters of stuff that have lodged themselves into the paint since it was new or the last time it was clay barred .	1
I use this on My New 2013 KIA RIO and it pulls the Dirt off the Car after I thoroughly wash it . An Amazing product , works like a charm . The spray has a Cinnamon smell to it , its not bad but For people who do n't like Cinnamon I feel sorry for you , k But I would use this None the Less.It pulls the contaminates off the car and yes you can hear it , it does help remove tar , bugs can be stubborn but do come off . Make sure you use plenty of spray and do n't push hard , you need to glide across the paint .	1
If you have never used a clay bar on your car , this is going to blow your mind . It is very easy to use , and only takes a few minutes - but yields the most amazing results . The clay bar pulls the dirt ( after a regular wash ) from the paint and leaves a totally smooth mirror-like finish . I 've been using the Mother 's version for a few years and each clay bar can last a dozen or so uses before it needs to be replaced - unless you drop it on the ground . The spray is essentially very light soap water , but it provides all the lube you need . I usually add this into the three step process after washing and polishing , but before waxing.You will simply not belive the before and after difference you will feel when running your fingers across the paint.Also works great on glass .	1
My wife parked under a tree that left tiny sap particles all over the car ( a 2011 VW Sportwagen ) . I 've tried using mineral spirits which did nothing so I tried this . While it did n't make the car perfect , it made a very noticeable improvement . Had I not dropped one of the bars on the ground and immediately discarded it , I think I could have made an even better improvement . I was careful not to press too hard , but I did use some pressure . As others noted , this did cause some very faints scratches which were easily removed with wax .	1
Have not used it yet , but wish it did not come with the clay bars ... they just look like more work will be required .	1
This clay pack worked great on my car . I only used half a bar on my car . It took the gunk off the paint . I polished it after .	1
A friend of mine who drives a beautiful Porsche first told me about this product . We were standing in my driveway looking at his freshly waxed car - when he said `` just feel the car now - it is incredible '' . He was right . The car was glass smooth - and had a luster you normally only see the first day you drive the car off the lot.I bought the full kit , and have not detailed four of my cars with it , and I am a huge fan . First of all - it is easy to use . You can easily clean a large car with the brick in 1/2 hour - then apply the wax . I use a power buffer that really gets the shine up - and then I finish with Mother 's Top Coat - which makes the paint like new.The Bar strips off all the old wax and residue - and restores a shine I did not think possible . I just detailed a seven year old Range Rover , and my wife was shocked that it looked `` just like new '' . I found that I could get two cars done with each brick - so this kit should do four cars . Finish with a good quality wax , and I recommend the Top Coat .	1
This product brings back the depth to an aging vehicle but it is not for the weak in the arm . It does take hours to claybar your vehicle . Upside ; you can see the difference once you complete the process .	1
Never did this type of detailing to my cars before and was introduced to it by a friend.After getting the hang of using a clay bar on vehicle it is a truly impressive thing to see as it strips off all the junk our cars seem to accumulate over time and gets off the stuff that harms paint and makes it both LOOK and FEEL horrible ! For the money both this kit and the Meguiar 's are a great deal and even though it only has 2 clay bars there is plenty to get the job done on a few cars for sure ! You should definetly get a refill bottle of the detail spray since it needs to be applied liberally when doing the clay bar process . Having a gallon jub handy is good to do since you cant let this stuff dry out during the job ! Cant say enough about this system of cleaning your car off from all the oxidation and grime that builds up over the years !	1
This is a great clay bar kit at a good price . It comes with everything you 'll need . 2 clay bars should be sufficient if you 've never clay bar 'd your car before , 1 is enough if you do so periodically ( 1-2 years ) . Awesome super smooth finish on your car removes pitted particulate and some swirls , but it does require good amount of elbow grease for great results ! The application spray has this nice cinnamon scent to it , but I still do n't think that that means it 's good for you to keep inhaling it .	1
I purchased this product a few years back and have used it periodically prior to polishing and waxing my vehicles . Very easy to use and does an exceptional job cleaning up the paint - the lubricant even smells good ! If you want to do a proper prep job prior to laying down polish and wax/sealant , this is the system that works .	1
This was my first time claying my vehicle . I will say that it does what it says : I tried it on a small part of my car to test it out , and it certainly smoothes the rough , presumably contaminated surface . You can hear and feel the crunchy layer being lifted away , and the paint is returned to a like-new slickness . The process also seemed to make for a much nicer finish after waxing . Count me as another believer in the power of clay.If I were you , reading this review and wondering if this is the right purchase for your first-time claying ( I must have spent several hours Googling and browsing Amazon for info ; I know what you 're going through ) , I would want to be told this : Buy a separate clay bar , and use soapy water for lubricant . Use the saved money to buy a nice bottle of car wash.At first I was hesitant to use soapy water instead of the detailer spray that came with it , but after some research I discovered that many professional detailers use soapy water ( there are YouTube vids with professionals using soap suds for claying ) . I even did a test at first , using soapy water on one area and the detail spray on another , and the clay process worked just as well with soap ( or auto shampoo , rather ) . Just be sure the water is very sudsy and constantly applied . I wound up using the Showtime spray to clay about half the car , and I nearly used up the entire bottle . Maybe I used too much , but I only sprayed enough to cover the surface ( a 2010 Accord ) , and with something like this I figure too much lubricant is better than too little . Detailing spray is n't exactly expensive , but using the spray instead of soap could easily result in adding $ 5- $ 10 to the task . If it offered better performance over soapy water , that would be one thing , but it does n't seem to.Before washing the car I tried using the spray alone as a detailer on a lightly dusty surface , and it cleaned well . I wish I had just used soapy water for the entire clay process and saved the detail spray for its original purpose . In that sense , this kit is probably a nice value along with the microfiber cloth ( also pretty nice quality ) . I ca n't comment on the quality of the clay bar since it 's the only one I 've used . It was soft and did n't fall apart . I did n't see the huge amount of contaminants on the bar like you see in some customer photos ( hardly any , really , but maybe my contaminants were of the transparent sort ) , but it definitely had an impact on surface smoothness.It was a good learning experience and good value considering everything it comes with . However , in the future I 'll buy a separate clay bar . Mothers does sell the bar separately , also , and reviews seem to suggest its quality is competitive .	1
After reading numerous raving reviews here at Amazon.com and at several other sites , and learning that auto clay was safe for clear coat paints because it works through a non-abrasive process , I decided to give it a try -- and boy , was I glad I did ! My car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash . It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and would n't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car . After every car wash , I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit . The results were astounding ! After using it , the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth . The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it had a new coat of paint ! I was immensely pleased with the results.Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants , auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay . The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine ( Play-doh ) and it is used along with the included `` lubricant '' spray ( actually , an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar 's Gold Class -- will work equally well . ) Mind you , car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches ; only a car polish or a polishing compound ( harsher ) can do that . And remember , always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants . Also , clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new ! I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation . Go on , try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint . It 's worth every penny and I 'm sure you 'll be glad you did !	1
The clay bar is excellent , works wonders at removing all the little bits of grit and grime and leaving a mirror smooth-to-the-touch finish . The detailer and microfiber cloth are a bonus , however any quick detailer will work just fine for using the clay bar . I used the clay bar for the first time on my brand new Shelby GT500 which had a bit of grime built up from the trip from the factory to the dealer . I love how it felt after I was done . So smooooooth . I will definitely be using it often and will order another one of these in the future when I need to .	1
I like this kit a lot ! It comes with 2 bigs bars of clay , think double the size of the Meguiars kit.A bottle of detail spray and a average quality microfiber cloth.I used autowash soap/water as a lube for the clay , did a great job on my 7 yr old van , I only washed it in 7 yrs ... .the paint is now smooth as a baby 's bum , waxed it ... .My kids were wondering why the van was sooo slippery smooth and shineyI saved the detail spray to keep my cars looking tip top after washes.Great price here at Amazon , will keep buying it here .	1
I have not used the kit yet , I 'm waiting for summer to come so that I can completely detail my car without worrying that I wasted my time doing so in rainy Oregon . But it looks quite promising and can not wait to use it .	1
I bought this produt reading the reviews in amazon.com . The product is very good but did not removed 100 % the grains of my car , but it gave a nice look .	1
DO NOT WAX OR POLISH YOUR CAR WITHOUT DOING THIS FIRST ! I was APPALLED at how much grit my clear coat was holding on to . Ever walk through tall weeds and get burrs on your jeans ? That 's what your clear coat does with dirt , brake dust , and other nasty grime that actually sticks to your car & SOAP & WATER CA N'T WASH OFF ! After washing and drying your car , take a small amount of the clay ( enough to fit in your palm , knead it so it 's warm , and make it flat , about the size of the thickness of a pencil & large enough to fit flat on your palm ) . Spray a small amount of the lubricant ( that 's what that stuff is meant for ) and then gently without any pressure slide the clay along where you sprayed . At first the clay will grab and you can feel it getting caught . This is the clay actually sticking to the stuff on your paint & as you move the clay back and forth & around , you 'll feel it starting to glide with zero interference or effort . Now , take the clay off the car and look at it . See the black stuff ? That was IN your clear coat ! Simply fold the clay a couple times and then flatten it back out to the size of your palm again . And now with your finger , feel where you just clayed , and then move your finger to the next spot you 're about to clay . See ? Repeat until you do your entire car . Should take maybe an hour at the most.Now it 's time to wax/polish your car . If you have a random orbital polishing system , use it now . Your clear coat will be smooth as glass , and it 's NEVER felt that smooth.Quite honestly , this took a 10 year old ( what I felt was well taken care of ) paint and made it glass smooth . Feels like a show car now !	1
works as intended . tried it today and the paint on my car feels perfectly smooth ! it did not add any scratches either . i used half a clay bar to do a whole care and plenty of fluid left over for at least one more car . its pricey but seem to be worth it , next step cleaner then a few coats of wax . the cars finish was instantly very clear and perfect looking but this was on a dark silver color before even applying any wax	1
There are two ( 2 ) 50 gram bars in the package but there is enough clays on each bar that I cut them in halves & used the halves without any problem.Water hardness makes a noticeable difference . If you have hard ground water like I do , my advice is to spend the few extra bucks to wash & clay your car in a self car wash where the water is softened or deionized.Other wise you will not reap the full benefit of claying a car as you are just grinding the paint with microscopic mineral deposits.Use water as lubricant , do not leave any soap on the paint & use the suds as lubricant as the chemical in soap will quickly break down the clay bar itself . You will find the clay `` disintergrate '' after 1-2 car washes if you rely on soap as lubricant .	1
This product works great by getting out any overspray or adhesives off the clear coat without damaging it . Highly recommended to help get out stubborn light scratches .	1
You really need to use this product if you want your car or truck to be at its best . I 've been using it for the last few years and results are over the top . Your paints surface will be smooth as glass which in turn makes polishing your vehicle so much easier to apply and remove.An awesome product .	1
This was my first clay bar kit and I have to say it 's very effective and easy to use . The microfiber towel they provide is not the best of quality or else I 'd give it 5 stars . Overall , it 's an excellent product and I would n't hesitate to purchase again .	1
When a neighbor doing some spray painting got some paint spots on my car , I first tried removing them using a razor scraper and water . This worked , but it was pretty time consuming , and required a lot of care , so I decided to try Mothers California Gold clay bar kit . The kit contains two bars of clay , a microfiber towel , and a spray bottle of Showtime Instant Detailer.I found that while the clay product does a pretty good job of removing dirt , sap , and small particles , adhering to the paint finish , it does n't do much for removing paint spots . For the uninitiated , using this product effectively requires developing a certain technique , particularly if you have a thick layer of gunk on your finish.Firstly , the surface you are treating should be cleaned of surface dirt , and cool . The Instant Detailer spray is pretty slippery , and there is very little friction when sliding the clay bar across a surface sprayed with this stuff . What you want to try to do is have a thin layer of the Detailer solution on the area , so you can slide the clay over the surface , but still get enough friction so the clay can pickup and remove particles from the finish . If you have never done this before , it may take some trial and error to develop a technique that works.Since the clay is soft , it is constantly changing its shape as you use it , and from time to time , you will need to reshape it . One thing to be very aware of , is not getting any debris into the clay . If you accidentally drop the clay on the ground and happen to get a small rock , piece of metal , or other hard substance stuck in the clay , you could do some major damage to your finish , if you use the clay . I store the clay in a small zip lock bag , and always be sure to have a zip lock with me when working , to try and keep the clay from picking up something that could be destructive.The bottom line is that the product works pretty well , but you will probably need to have a decent technique , and plenty of muscle to get the job done . The process is not a simple spray on and wipe off , it will require some time and physical effort to do an entire vehicle . The clay works on all kinds of finishes , but probably produces the best results on smoother finishes , as there is less friction . Prices for automotive accessories at Amazon fluctuate and are n't always the greatest , so check locally for your best deal . Hopefully this review was helpful .	1
You can clearly see the grime that it pulls up from the paint . Helps bring back you paint from years of abuse .	1
Firm but easily broken so items can be removed for maintenance . I bought this to mount a trolling motor adapter plate on my boat . Worked well if nuts are properly tourqued everything will remain solid despite vibration and temp changes until purposely removed . Only way to better prepare would be to use safety wire and what a pain drilling things out to do so is .	1
Having a Harley vibration wreaks havoc on all your fasteners . Everytime i do any repair i always cllean off the old threadlocker and apply a fresh new amount . I rare if ever have to tighten down any bolts .	1
I have used this product for years and it works exactly as it 's supposed to . It 's not too hard to remove nuts or bolts after using this either , which is nice . I use it as directed in shop manuals and I sometimes put it on fasteners that do n't call for it if I feel its necessary for safety .	1
Threadlocker is pretty difficult to rate . There are many different manufacturers of Threadlocker and each company produces a variety of different strengths . This specific product I feels does the job admirably . I used it on the bolts for my Harley . Have not noticed and & # 34 ; loose & # 34 ; bolts after applying this product . Harley 's vibrate a lot so this product seems to work .	1
This company makes the best clear silicone sealer that I 've ever used . My mechanic always had some of this Threadlocker with him and used it occasionally . I received my little tube of it from Amazon with the rest of my order -- I have yet to apply it -- but I have seen it used and it works . Another tool box must -- to go along with my magnetic grabber and claw grabber . And you know where I found THOSE . Here .	1
I frequently use blue threadlocker on my restoration projects . It adds that extra insurance in putting together suspension components and other parts subject to vibration . Easy to disassemble if necessary , unlike the red Threadlocker product . A must for the auto enthusiast 's tool box .	1
On certain fastener applications , where there is vibration and on rubber bushings , this is a must . make sure you are tightening the bolts to ther correct torque specifications .	1
I bought this to put on all my bolts on my saiga 5.45x39 project every thing holds strong.I recommend this product for any one doing small projects and do n't want screws coming apart .	1
I 've always been a fan of Loctite brand threadlocker , but I can honestly say that the Permatex brand works just as well . Order blue if you still wish to remove the bolt , order red for a permanent lock needing heat to remove .	1
This is n't my first time using this product , and I keep coming back to it . It works well at holding fasteners in place ( make sure there is not grease or other contaminants on it ) , yet it 's still possible to unscrew them with moderate amounts of force .	1
high temp is correct , although the advise against using for head gasket , this works for what its supposed to be used for , no problems , small enough to use and toss ( as it will dry out once opened ) .	1
I use it for all required applications . A friend that builds engines for a living uses it everywhere it can be . I have never had a failure of this product .	1
The open tube of other brands has a short pot life . I buy this one because I get to use the whole tube no matter how long it takes.The tube also is stronger and you do n't end up with a handful of stuff coming out where it is not supposed to.I buy this brand in quantity as I know that down the road when I open a new tube the stuff will be the same as the one I just finished .	1
This is excellent RTV high temp sealant . I use it on my shovel head 's exhaust gaskets to stop a minor leak , it worked like a charm and has not blown out after 1500 miles .	1
For any of you who have used this product before , you know what it is . Otherwise , it 's a gasket-maker for your automotive needs . I just used it to re-seal my rear differential , and it worked great .	1
Shipped in perfect condition and what a great product and a great price ... Amazon.com is like finding Coupons all over the world at the terms you choose . I save , time , money and the conveyance of getting it at home.Sometimes receiving it at home is the biggest coupon , saves me time . Next big savings , super saver , Free Shipping !	1
Seems to hold up very well in parts of the motor that are constantly exposed to engine oil . I use a thin coat on all gaskets exposed to oil like the oil pan , at the rear main cap parting line , intake corners etc . So far it has always worked very well and I 've never experienced a leak from areas I have used it .	1
This RTV is intended for primary use as engine gasket maker - temperature and oil resistant . But it also works well as general purpose RTV when the near-black ( dark gray ) color is desirable . Which was true for my application - making gaskets for mounting car speakers in odd sized door application that required custom spacers . Worked great.The dark color is especially troublesome to get off the hands - use disposable gloves during application.This package , a small & # 34 ; squeeze & # 34 ; tube is not easiest for application of a regular bead . It is easier to use the slightly larger , calk-gun sized package , so consider that if the larger quantity is also helpful .	1
used it on my 1994 f150 2wd for the rear end cover . Sealed it without any issues ! Did not seem to work well when i tried to use it on the plastic center cap though	1
As always , Permatex creates nice products and this is another . I used this to help seal around the knock sensor harness I replaced along with the knock sensors on a newly used 2004 Tahoe Z71 . This product was easy to setup and seal helping to avoid more water from getting to the rear knock sensor . Great product and does exactly what you need it to . Best if you wore gloves for easier cleanup ! highly recommend !	1
This Permatex Ultrablack is wonderful stuff , a tough sealant and it does NOT tend to harden in the tube - - it 's always ready to use when I take off the cap . Unfortunately , this particular item is ONLY 1/2 OUNCE ! ! So it 's not a good deal for the price . There is no info in the item posting , you have to notice the image and the `` 0.5oz '' on the package ( which I did n't ) . Go for the 3.5 ounce tube , much better deal.5 stars for the product , 2 stars for the incomplete description .	1
This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you ca n't find a gasket .	1
I bought this because I thought the red permatex I used on my diff was leaking . Turns out it was a pinion seal leak dripping down . I 've heard good things about all of permatex 's products so I do n't expect any less from this.For differential covers the red stuff worked fine for me and is a bit cheaper too .	1
I would recomend this for any DIYr ! It 's great to have around the garage when you need a gasket on the fly ! Remeber , to let the gasket cure for 24 hours !	1
Works great . Gaskets ... Small leaks ... Temp fixes or permanent . The uses are endless . It 's a liquid rubber that dries into an oil resistant gasket . What 's not to like ? If you lose the cap , you can even make another one out of the substance .	1
Used this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover . Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage . Applied around the bolt holes . Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes . Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts , let set for approx . 1 hour . Then tightened bolts to OEM specs . Filled with gear oil and no leaks .	1
Used this when doing a valve cover gasket replacement . o2 safe which is good . No leaks when using this on my BMW gasket .	1
so this sat around for awhile before i used it and sure enough i go to use it and the top of the UNOPEN tube is hardened and unuse able this is BS and i cant even retuen it	1
Used this on the front and rear diff covers on my 04 Jeep TJ . Just followed the directions and had no leaks whatsoever . Good product ! Always go with Permatex .	1
I bought this in order to seal some parts of my car 's valve cover mating surfaces.The shop I paid for the timing belt service to be done did not do a good job.Valve cover gasket never leaked before , it started leaking after they put a new gasket.Obviously they did not clean the mating surfaces.I did the job myself since I did not trust the mechanics at that particular shop.It does not leak now.This product also helped me repair parts of glass molding ( rubber parts around the rear glass ) that started cracking , falling off.All in all it is a great product and is worth the money .	1
I recently rebuilt the engine on my GSXR and I used this instead of the Suzuki sealant recommended for use in the service manual when putting the case back together . This is a great product and worked great for my application . I have not experienced and leaks or problems by using this product . It has held up the the heat from the engine and has kept the oil inside the case .	1
Works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports . I use this stuff any where I can on the engine to prevent leaks happening .	1
I used this on my 2006 ford f150 spark plugs . This tube has more than enough to do the job . I wo n't know if it keeps theccarbon build up until I change them again . This is a made in the USA product .	1
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles , your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them . Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this . If you use it , torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize . I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I ca n't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance . You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion .	1
Really the only good option for high temp engine and exhaust use . Worth the money , will last forever . I use it on exhaust sensor threads and spark plugs with no issue .	1
I have come to use this on all my spark plugs of all my cars . This is great for aluminum head motors that need special attention to heat expansion and removal . This is a big container so it lasts long and keeps well !	1
I use this to install spark plugs in my f150 . Second time I used and no problems at all . The spark plugs came out without a hitch and they still show the anti seize in their threads .	1
I bought this to use on my suppressor threads . Works great , and a 8oz bottle will last a lifetime as long as it does n't dry up , or I misplace it .	1
Used this product for many sparkplug swaps . A little goes a long way , this product has never let me down .	1
If you are going to change plugs on a 5.5 L ford with the real long plug buy this prior so you can coat the plugs around the flat for possible an easy removal later	1
I used it on a recent spark plug install and I guess it will work OK. Well , it was a little messy going on and I did n't have any trouble with the install . But , I really wo n't know how well it works until I remove the plugs - hopefully , years from now . : -D So , maybe Amazon will still be around by then and I can give an update when that happens . Either it works or it do n't - we 'll see . : - )	1
Good price and decent amount for small projects . Would recommend to others and also recommend others to wear gloves when handling this .	1
Excellent product recommended by everyone . This tube will last a long time . I ordered it to install my spark plugs and they went in with ease .	1
Cover the plugs in these guys and your car will thank you . I use them for spark plug applications without any issues . would n't install without it	1
Permatex 81343 Anti-Seize Lubricant , 1 oz . Tube== & # 62 ; great stuff and works really well on my auto work or vehicles . Thank you very much !	1
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more .	1
For occasional use , this is a perfectly-sized tube . If you need this for a shop , look for larger packages.Does what it needs to do . Simple to apply , evenly and lightly coat the threads , and works well .	1
I bought this after reading a tutorial on changing my own spark plugs . Application was easy but make sure you have a rag to wipe off any that gets on your hands . It is bright silver . I guess when I change my spark plugs next time I will see what kind of a difference it makes . Only time will tell . Many people swear by the stuff so I will continue to use it . It works for many other things than spark plugs .	1
I like anti seize so much I put a little on anything I may need to take off again in the future . ( Almost everything ) It does what it is suppose to . I 'm almost out and will be buying another tube .	1
Purchased a tube of this for routine spark plug replacement as recommended and , as mentioned in other reviews , only ended up using a small amount . Product seems to be good but wo n't really know until I remove the spark plugs again . New spark plugs did thread in much smoother than old ones came out but that is to be expected anyway . I will probably start using this on my lug nuts during tire rotations since I have a tube of it now .	1
Works great and plenty comes in the tube . I have used this anti-seize for years and have had nothing but good results . I apply to treads and when I need to remove whatever I installed , it comes right out . Simple product that works superbly at what it is suppose to do . Would recommend	1
Works as advertised .	1
Needed this with a recent sensor purchase . Wish I had bought three though , since I use it on all my automotive and cycle needs . Great price .	1
I have used this on fuel filter threads and it makes life a lot easier when it 's time to replace the filter again.If you live in a salty environment where corrosion is a problem then use this product and your nuts and bolts will come apart easy .	1
this stuff really helps prevent rust on nuts and bolts . i lubed up my brake studs with the permatex anti seize and it lasted through out the whole winter without needing to be re-applied again . i actually apply this on every bolt i have to take out on my car like the struc bolts , tie-rod , axle nut , brake caliper bolts , etc . i dont know how well this would work against exhaust bolts however . the permatex anti seize does say it can tolerate 500 degree F of heat but never had the chance to test that out .	1
Make sure you use this any time you install new spark plugs - you 'll be glad you did , when it comes time to change them again !	1
I had to put a O2 sensor in my Avalon . The instructions say to put this lube on it so it does n't seize after it 's gotten older . Seems to work like it should so if the part calls for Anti-Seize Lube , then this one works !	1
This stuff is great for keeping threads lubed up so they are easy to install/remove . I used some on my new spark plugs and on my battery clamp . My old plugs were very hard to get out because they did n't have any of this stuff . Now the battery clamp and plugs will come out very easily . It does have a strong smell to it .	1
I 'm sure this product will do what it needs to do . It 's difficult for this product to really screw up what it 's intended purpose is . I use it to put on spark plugs and wheel lug nuts so they do n't seize up and become impossible to remove .	1
Any metal craftsman/mechanic always keeps Permatex in his toolbox . If you have ever struggled with a seized bolt/nut , you will appreciate a product that prevents that from happening , as it always happens when you ca n't spare the time or patience needed to solve it .	1
I put this on all bolts , car rotor hubs , etc ! ! ! Permatex makes the best lubricants so you cant go wrong . Good price on Amazon .	1
Put a small dab on my new spark plugs . Silver color and greasy feel . Each to put on threads and wipe excess off . We 'll see how they work in 50,000 miles when I go to replace the spark plugs . This tube will last me forever .	1
Permatex is the stuff my automotive junkies . It will allow you to undo what you have done . You do know that spark plugs come back out do n't you ? Make sure the application is correct . Some metal combinations will prefer nickel over copper based and so on . but for general use , this is the goop for you .	1
Good product , fair price	1
This is anti-seize lubricant , as stated . It appears to be of good quality , and works as it 's supposed to . I guess the real test will be when I go to remove the bolts again , but that wo n't be for a while .	1
This is a nice item to have in your tool chest / box . I use it whenever I assemble things which may need to be taken apart again . I even use it on my vehicle wheel lugs , with good results . I recommend this item .	1
This is a common problem on all these sealers , the caps are horrible and they are basically one time use . The latest trick i have used is putting a clear wrap under the cap to help seal it but even so after time it hardens . The product itself works well and it costs a bit as you can tell compared to non cooper mix .	1
I used this on a two stroke gas engine head gasket that was blown . I had my doubts , but has been fine for that job .	1
Product is as described . Good sealant , used it to strengthen the seal around an oil pan heater pad . The truck goes through automatic wash bay weekly and I have not had any issues with seal failure causing water to fry the pad .	1
Taking a chance on this product . Had to repair a size able hole in one of my pipes . It just has to hold about 10 days until the replacement part arrives . Been about 5 days now so I may make it . Satisfied with this as I did n't expect it would last this long !	1
all I ever use , AAA+++	1
Used this for my SV650 when I put on my new Delkevic exhaust . First time around I did not put enough around the pipe and as a result exhaust was leaking out of it . The next time i made sure to put enough on it and let it sit for 24 hours to harden . I have had it on there for 6 months now and have not had any problems at all . Just make sure you read the instructions and do n't skimp out on the product .	1
This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint . It does not appear to have any & # 34 ; grinding & # 34 ; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint . It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches . It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping . It ddi make the blemish lighter though .	1
I have scratches on the hood of my truck . ( Black Paint ) I have tried a few other products without much success . With Meguires , I am making progress . Although a lot of elbow grease is required .	1
Used this on a black Dodge Charger with clear coat and the sparkly paint.It did a good job of removing finger nail marks under the door handles and minor scratches where things were dragged over the back bumper to put them in the trunk.It did not harm the clear coat.I would buy this again .	1
this product works wonders , proving that meguiars is one of the best commercial use , body and interior detailers . Not too abbrasive , wont leave scratches and serves its purpose very well . I think this is like the concentrated version of their & # 34 ; ultimate compound & # 34 ; .	1
I had quite a few scratches and scuff marks on my door handles . I had bought this product and tryed it . It was very easy to use . After the treatment of this product on my door handles , I do n't seem to notice any more scratches . I am verry immpressed with this product .	1
I 'm quite impressed at how good this product worked . I have a black car and some careless idiot slammed their white car door into mine , leaving a series of marks . I bought some Scratch X because it had gotten mainly good reviews and tried it . The label simply says to rub it on with a terry cloth , let dry , then buff away , if it were only that easy ! For Scratch X to work you need to apply it to a soft cloth ( I used an old tshirt ) and rub AGAINST the scratch until it ( the Scratch X , not the actual scratch ! ) disappears on the area . Apply more Scratch X and keep repeating this step until the scratch is nearly gone ( it took me about 5 times ) . After that , turn the same cloth ( in my case a tshirt ) over and buff the residue away . I applied quite a bit of pressure to the area and as you could imagine my arm and wrist became quite tired by the time I was finished , but it was indeed worth it . I treated another scratch just behind my side view mirror and while applying more Scratch X to the cloth , I actually lost track as to where the scratch was , so I 'm pleased with the overall results .	1
You need patience , but it works great . I have a short attention span and got pissed off after 30 seconds of rubbing it ( stupid , I know ) and was going to rant about this . Then I calmed down and rubbed a moderately deep scratch for another 2 minutes as hard as I could without damaging the paint . It worked . It was n't perfect but more than 12 inches away there was no way you could tell . It obviously wo n't work on scratches where there 's no paint left , but if there 's the white haze over it , it should work . My method was about half circular motions and half 90 against the grain . If you rub even a little bit in the direction of the scratch , any scratch removing compound is likely to screw you even more .	1
removes fine scratches , not anything deep into the paint . But gets out minor scrapes and scratches . Put a coat of wax on the area after using this product and it will shine beautifully .	1
Let me preface by saying if you have deep scratches ( catch w/your finger nail ) this will help but not do magic.My wonderful mechanic stepped on the bumper of my truck when getting into the engine and it left horrible scratchesfrom his muddy boots . I was sick over it but this cleared it up about 90 % .I had another patch on my hood ( got truck used so this was already on it ) and it looks like someone took a Brillo pad and scrubbed back and forth about 10 times . It was pretty bad and I could almost feel them with my finger nail . The clear coat also appeared to have been removed because in addition to the scratches , the area was very dull ( vehicle is dark blue ) .Well scratch X took about 80 % of the damage away and I followed up with meguiars high gloss polish and their carnauba wax . It now looks 95 % better and I have to look to see any traces of the scratches and the gloss is back.I did all of this in less than 30 minutes . I also noticed this removed the swirl marks as well.Anyone who rates this stuff poorly is either not doing something right in the application process or is expecting it to do miracles with very deep scratches.ps , I did use a mothers powerball attached to a drill with a combination of hand polishing etc	1
I ordered this to try to fix a few long scratches in my New Jeep Wrangler Unlimited doors . My girlfriend drove too close to some branches and scratched the whole side of the vehicle . Our Jeep is the dark green and is otherwise scratch free.I gave the Jeep a good wash and dry and set to work . I used a microfiber cloth and work in small circles until I was done . I would tell you that at first I did n't think it was going to work . I had to rub with good pressure for quite a while , and slowly the scratches began to fade . I got to a point where I was n't seeing much more improvement but could n't see the scratches unless I caught it at the right angle . I followed this up with a good wax with some Mothers Carnuba Wax and I would tell you it looks at least as good as new now.I would guess from my experience that if the scratches were excessively deep than this would not work so well , but for a light surface scratch that does not penetrate the color layer then there is no doubt that it works great .	1
I am very hopeful the Meguiar 's NAME will make the product a 5 star AFTER I use it . Hope to avoid getting scratches on my paint until then : )	1
I would have purchased it on Amazon , but I could not wait to try it out . It works better than I thought on light scratches that do not go through the paint but only through the clear-coat . I was able to quickly fix damage caused by rubbing against a metal fence . The side panel looks 97-99 % as good as new . As others have mentioned , It takes a lot of elbow grease . Nest time I 'll invest in a power polisher . Boy do my arms hurt . But with a power polisher , you have to be careful to not burn the finish . Thank you all Fellow `` Amazonians '' for the reviews and tips .	1
Not to remove scratches , but to conceal and and make look presentable . It works well and does what it is supposed to do . Great for light scratches . Harder to use on black cars , but with a little patience it works well .	1
This product works at least as well as other similary priced scratch removers/hiders ... .only really effective on very shallow and narrow scratches and swirl marks . I have tried 3 of these specialized scratch products , and none of them hide scratches quite as well as regular Eagle One NanoWax ( now discontinued ) . These products work by filling in the scratch with material that makes the scratch visible only under certain lighting conditions and viewing angles . Meguiars , like most of the others , work better than ordinary wax at hiding very minor scratches , but do n't expect miracles .	1
This stuff is absolutely amazing . At first , I thought this is snake oil , but with it being Meguiars I figured I would give it a shot . All I can say is this will pull out a scratch you did n't think would come out . Now I am not saying I have taken a key and used this product , I am no infomercial salesman , but this product works great to pull scratches out of most finishes .	1
I 've purchased a variety of scratch removing products . Many of them worked well but almost all of them left noticeable swirl scratches , sometimes worse than the original scratch I 'm trying to remove , especially on high-gloss black paint and clear-coats . This product works like a charm with minimal swirl/scratch marks ( but suggest you try it on an inconspicuous spot first ) .	1
I was n't surprised when I tried the 2.0 . Very effective polish for novice to enthusiast just as how it was with their original ScratchX.For those that are n't getting good results , you are probably not using the product correctly , or your scratch is just too deep.I like that there is no shaking needed . I just grab the bottle , pour a dab onto my pad , and immediately use.Also the worked in polish easily wipes off the panel.I am very happy with the results.I consider myself a weekend car enthusiast , use professional equipment to detail my cars .	1
Does what it says it does ... ... looks great !	1
I use it to keep the clear lexan cover on my squad car light bar maintained . Makes it look like new and seems to provide a lasting protective finish that is superior to other products that I 've tried . Works well on those `` plastic '' headlight covers that tend to haze over . The container tube is good quality and has not cracked and split open like some other brands I 've used . They even put a hole in the base of the tube so you can hang it on a nail on the garage wall ( or on a chain around your neck , I suppose ) .On paint ? ? ? Outstanding ! ! I think you 'll be pleased .	1
This product removed several scratches from my car , only two were left . Mainly because they most likely too far into the car . But I also had paint from a cart or another car scrape onto mine , and it removed it completely . I was so excited . But I do wish it went a little further into the paint to remove the deep scratches .	1
I closed the garage on my car by accident while backing out . Not sure what happened but my stupid & # 34 ; smart car & # 34 ; did n't detect the garage door closing and it closed on my trunk ! So much for technology making life easier . Back to & # 34 ; looking back & # 34 ; instead of depending on sensors and my back-up cam.Any how , the garage door put a huge scratch on my trunk and taillights . I was able to remove all the surface scratch on my trunk and it looks good as new ! The scratch on the chrome molding and taillight was too deep and could n't be removed . But I knew that when I got this . This product is great for those light scratches.Easy to apply and easy to buff out . I just use a regular cotton towel . Microfiber towels are too soft .	1
I give my 4 year old car a full cleaning treatment at least twice a year . About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way . That 's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job , it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below : WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing , as it removes the grime better . I use microfiber towels to wash. What you use to wash makes a big difference , a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong . Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions . Hot paint finish is also easier to damage . So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it . I wash the top of the car , then the bottom of the car . I do n't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash . I use more micro fiber towels . I like Costco 's micro fiber towel bag , for $ 10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas . I do n't clay the entire car , just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel , spread it on a small portion of the car ( 3 feet by 3 feet ) , then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel . If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off , that 's why working on small areas is better . If I drop a towel , I move on to the next one . Even tiny dirt particles you ca n't see will scratch the paint surface . I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts . If I do get it on the plastic parts , see `` back to black '' described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car . It makes the plastic look new , and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces . Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts , it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour . I love riding in a shiny clean car plus I always get great value back when I sell my cars.Meguiar 's Gold Wax is one of my `` secret '' weapons to make a four year old car look like new . I recommend it ! Ali Julia review	1
I just had my car at a car show and used this to touch up several places on the car . The shine the liquid wax gave was compatible with the paste wax already on the car . The Mequiar 's products are among the best . I use this ONLY as a touch up as I still prefer the paste wax for a deeper coat and longevity . This is great when you do n't want to spend a lot of time or your just need touch ups here and there .	1
Very easy on and off with an excellent shine when done . So far has lasted and makes cleaning the car easy .	1
The key to making this wax stand out is doing the prep work1 ) Washing2 ) claying3 ) Polishing4 ) WaxingThe wax is best applied on a cool surface . If you can comfortably lay your hand on the surface of your vehicle for 30 seconds with out burning your good to go.Apply a very thin coat and buff off after about an hour . You can get about 14 applications or more from this bottle .	1
very easy to use and provide great protection and shine . I see no reason to use separate polish as I did a comparison and this alone provides same level of shine as using Meguairs # 7 polish . Plus this is a wax and provides protection .	1
While you must have your paint cleaned and prepped , GC liquid wax is no doubt will amplify the gloss even more . Application is easy on and easy off . Just avoid from hitting the plastic trim . Comes even easier with the use of DA . longevity is somewhere around 1-3 months . then you need to re-apply the wax . one bottle could easily cover 10 medium sized cars .	1
This is great wax ! It truly deserves the Gold Class name . I use this after the Meguiar 's Ultimate Polish . I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher . I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand , and with the buffer , this turns out great . I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color . Before using the polish/wax combo , it looked more like a darker blue . Nothing really deep . After polishing and waxing , it now looks like the black in black sapphire . It looks great in the shade , as it should and looks beautiful in the sun . There is a nice deep , glassy color , and I am pleased with the results . The water also beads very nice , too .	1
I love taking care of my vehicles . I have used many expensive , imported products over the years . However , Meguiar 's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings . They are of high quality , effective , easy to find , and affordable . However , take the affordable off . I 'd use their products , if they were 3x the price because I 've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar 's Gold Class Liquid Wax is another example of that experience . Meguiar 's effectively markets this wax and who does n't love using something called Gold Class that comes in beautiful packaging ? However , it is not smoke and mirrors . Inside the bottle is a very good wax that will greatly enhance your paint 's finish , while providing all-important protection.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before you apply Gold Class , to clay your car , clean with a paint cleaner ( i.e . Deep Crystal Step 1 ) , polish with a pure polish ( Deep Crystal Step 2 or # 7 Show Car Polish ) , and then apply this wax . The results are truly remarkable . Again , I have used many waxes to top off my detailing , and Gold Class is one I keep going back to . It 's one of my favorites and one of the best.To maintain your shine , remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Detailer , or Ultimate Quick Detailer.Meguiar 's keeps delivering the good stuff , and I 'm a fan .	1
My black seven-year old car had very heavy swirl marks after a `` detailer '' at a car wash removed hard water spots from the paint . The car looked horrible ; it looked worse clean than when it was dirty . I decided that there was nothing I could do to make it look worse , so , rather than repainting the car , I decided to try to restore my car 's paint . Since I have no experience in using DA polisher or any compounds , I searched the web for the instructions and watched a video ( see comments for URL ) .I washed and clayed the car with Mother 's Clay Bar . Then I used Ultra Cut compound with Meguiar 's DA polisher and Meguiar 's 7006 cutting pad followed by Meguiar 's Ultra Finishing Polish using the same DA polisher and Meguiar 's 9006 pad . I saw an impressive reduction in swirl marks and scratches . The black paint looked almost like a mirror . I could not remove every single scratch , but the paint looked much better than before and much better than paint on many seven year old cars.After Cutting and Finishing compounds , I applied Meguiar 's Mirror Glaze and two coats of Meguiar 's NXT was . It worked very well . I am extremely happy with the results.A month later I tried Meguiar 's Ultimate Compound followed by Glaze and NXT , but I did not see any significant improvement from the earlier results .	1
This is a top quality product . It does a really good job of getting a smooth , shiny finish on any car . I use it with a Porter-Cable buffer , and it is well worth the low price . I have standardized on Meguiar 's products .	1
I 've used this product along with several other Meguiar 's car are products and am aware of their quality reputation . Truth be told , I chose this product over the 3m glaze because it was available through Prime and I could get it delivered faster . I prefer 3m products and most likely always will.That aside , this glaze works very well . The glaze has the look of dark mustard . Several thin coats of this glaze provide a deep shine.I 've used this glaze on a black colored vehicle and a white one . It almost seems as if the black car was excessively prone to picking up light lines ( super thin scratches ) . This was not as noticeable on the white paint finish.This glaze is a good buy .	1
I started using meguiar 's polish and wax since 1992. the mirror glaze makes the car looks great if you did it right . If you use the clay bar before waxing and it will provide great results too .	1
This product was used on a silver car with paint in good to very good condition ( some swirl marks , no chips or sun damage ) .It did cause the paint to shine more than without it and was enough that it will be in my regular routine.For this I used a clay bar first , then this polish , then three applications of the NXT wax and the car looks great .	1
I am in love with Meguair 's products and this will leave your car looking like its brand new ! ! Easy on and easy off ! !	1
I will keep this simple . If you want to have a `` Wet Look '' paint finish , this can help you achieve that . This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1 . Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash. Make sure to get all the dirt off . Dry thoroughly . I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process . Make sure to do this in the shade . The car 's surface should be cool to the touch.2 . Use the Meguiars Claybar . Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint . This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3 . Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer . This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4 . Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer . Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5 . Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer . I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6 . Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust , tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car . The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year . Regularly , you just need to wash your car at least once a week . And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat . That is why I only use their products .	1
It works really well with the two different colored foam pads . Use this compound as a one step and it 's great .	1
Meguiar 's wax is great . I use all their products . And no complaints .	1
I have been using this polish on my cars for years . Twice a year I polish THEN wax with meguiars high tech yellow wax . It 's the polish that shines the car , then the wax protects the polish . Easy to wipe on , easy to remove . The best thing is it does not take long to do and it keep the car looking new .	1
This polish , paired with the Number 26 wax gives an incredible result . Highly recommended for a phenomenally deep shine . Serious depth	1
While I have n't tried this with my rotary , M7 definitely will be on my to buy list . hand application is easy as 123 and abc , just follow the instructions behind the bottle and you are good to go . Applied it with the 'straight-line ' application rather than the conventional circular motion.easy on and easy off . Just make sure your paint is clean ie no contiminants or whatsoever .	1
I used this on a 92 Mercedes 500SL which I had found sitting on a lot . Once this car was mine , I noticed it has some weathered and rough looking areas on the hood , where rain had left deposits . I simply rubbed this on that area , left it over night , and took off that coat . The repeated the process about 3 times . Within 4-5 days , the hood looked like the rest of the car . That is exactly what I bought it for , and it worked perfect .	1
Ultimate shine for a black car ! I am quickly becoming a little OCD when it comes to my black car . I am new to personal car detailing but have learned a ton from Meguiar 's website and youtube . I washed my car way too many times at the self serve car wash last winter and swirled the heck out of the paint . I purchased M9 Swirl remover 2.0 and did the car after washing and claying . This glaze does exactly what I expected . It adds depth and really good shine to the paint . A few have said you can apply this with a machine but it dries so fast I cant see how that would work . I used a 3 inch applicator and did one panel at a time . I used a very small amount , maybe a nickel sized drop per panel and little goes a long way . Its suggested to apply this in straight lines and that seemed to work very well . It dries very quickly , almost crusting over before you finish applying it . I buffed it off in the opposite direction of the way it was applied and the luster and shine is really incredible . I used Meguiar 's microfiber towels to remove the glaze . I did n't notice any improvement in hiding the slight blemishes the car still has but the shine is well worth the extra step .	1
We use this glaze as a precursor to a wax . We wash , clay , glaze and wax ... ... ..then we put on cheap sunglasses and hi-5 each other for a job well done.Buy and use this glaze . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Like the shine so far , will see how long it lasts , one week so far and water is still beading off the car	1
Product is easy on/off . Provides a decent length of protection and a great shine . I use this product as my base coat of wax and layer finer waxes on top . Also , the included foam applicator is great . I actually use that applicator with more expensive waxes and use foam applicators from other sites with the NXT gen 2.0 .	1
Used this on two cars , one silver and one black.Both were done on a cool day in the garage after a clay bar routine.The silver car was super easy and looked great when finished . It came off even easier and faster than I expected using micro-fiber cloths.The black car took more work and had swirls at first . I hit it with an orbital buffer and the swirls were gone.Highly recommend two applications of this for full coverage . It goes fast enough that two applications are no big deal .	1
Decent wax ... my car looks nice but I 'm not sure it 's worth the high price . Ca n't really say much more .	1
My father and I restore cars as a hobby for friends . I got my father hooked on this wax after we got done with a 1928 Ford pick-up . Black paint after a buff still has a dul look to it , great shine but a dul look . This wax makes paint POP . After a few washes the wax still holds to the paint .	1
I have had 4 Lexus and I have only used Meguire products on them . My new Lexus is a black 2013 Lexus . This is the best wax to keep a great shine . The car finish is like glass . People remark to me about the shine and want to know what I use . I am a great advertisement for Meguire	1
I 've been using only this car wax for years , it 's been the best for me , easy to apply and wipe off , does n't streak , and lasts long enough in hot weather . I use it every 3 months , I guess it can be used more often .	1
Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years . The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze . You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily . Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You do n't need to apply much , just enough to cover the surface . Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting . Also I use it on chrome , chromed plastic , etc .	1
I decided to try this polish after using both Turtle Wax & Mothers on most ofmy previous cars and to date I have had no regrets.Meguiar 's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2 is very simple to apply and goes on easilyand also wipes off effortlessly without leaving any white waxy residue ; it providesgood protection.It gives a clean bright , deep , long-lasting , beautiful shine to my black 2011 Nissan Tiida ; in addition it leaves the surface smooth and glossy .	1
I do n't have a major problem with this wax but I do n't love it . I can see the lifespan of the wax coating being short .	1
I have a black car and have used several different waxes over the years . I find this wax to have wonderful results when used in conjunction with their Ultimate Compound and Ultimate Polish . I did my entire car by hand over a weekend ( it took many , many hours ) with very good results . I am very pleased with this wax and find it superior to others I have tried .	1
Nu Finish and this product were listed as the top spots with Nu Finish liquid beating this one out only due to a lower cost and it being their best buy then . Well I have Nu Finish and I have used it on a lot of cars and there is nothing wrong with it . I just wanted to try something new . This stuff goes on with less mess than the Nu Finish , comes off easier IMHO and also I believe it has a better shine . I did however use a Meguiars polish before putting this wax on and I had never done that before ever using the Nu Finish . I 'll wax with this stuff about once a month and every weekend when I do n't use this wax I use theMeguiar 's Ultimate Quik Wax	1
Goes on SUPER easy . Comes off super easy . I used one towel to take it off , and another to shine it up . Worked like a charm . I actually did it in the near dark , trying to beat a rainstorm coming in . ( It is fall ! ) My red Ru ( WRX ) looks better than when I drove it off the lot 7 years ago .	1
Car need a good cleanup to shine ? Use this . I have a black Lexus and when used , its amazing how much of the hairline scratches go away and how deep and glossy the black ends up . Use their Ultimate Compound first and follow with this . It will make the shine and depth come out even more . Looks like it just came out of a paint shop , has that & # 34 ; wet & # 34 ; look . Impressed .	1
I am a car nut . I have garage full of waxes that i have acquired over the years . This one is my favorite one . I like this wax and also the spray on version for touch ups . applies like any other wax but the shine is really nice and seems to last longer that some of the other waxes .	1
My experience is purely anecdotal as I have no real comparison here . I bought some last year . I put it on late summer and it survived the winter pretty well . I put another coat on this spring and it looks great still . I have always used liquid waxes since a typical car wash for me lasts 4 hours ( nothing compared to detailing I know ) , I just run out of steam by the time waxing gets on the table . It is by far the easiest to apply of all the ones I have tried in the past . I will probably pick it up again unless this is the year I finally go DA .	1
very expensive and like all coatings you have to love to do this stuff to your car - still , this is a quality product from a trusted name although it does require regular reapplication more often than it claims to whether or not your car goes through a car wash or is washed by hand	1
The benefits of this wax are that it goes on and comes off like butter , and leaves a nice , deep shine . The problem with it is that it does n't LAST LONG . I just waxed my Truck 5 weeks ago and the water is n't beading off anymore . It only rained once here and while i 've done a couple of washes since the wax , my car wash soap ( meguiars or mothers ) wo n't strip off any wax . So while this product looks great , it 's only lasted about a month ... that is n't gon na cut it . I 'm not waxing my truck 12 times a year . I 've read great things about the newly released Ultimate Liquid wax which has the newest in wax technological advances and has some amazing polymer properties ... so I bought 2 bottles of it and will wax sometime in the next couple of weeks . Per Meguiar 's , they say that the ultimate liquid wax will out-last ANY of their other waxes and because of the newest advances in the wax formula itself , ... I 'm anxious to use it . Once I do , rest assured i 'll be leaving a review for that too . All in all this tech wax 2.0 is a good wax but just does n't last long .	1
This wax is great , I 've been a detailer for a couple of years now using other wax 's and polish 's , and I 've recently discovered this product . I mainly use it for my personal car or if I have to quickly wax a black sold car for work , it makes my job easier and I 'm really happy with the final results of the product . I would recommend this product both to other professional detailer 's , or to someone who would use once to twice a year .	1
I love taking care of my vehicles . I have used many expensive , imported products over the years . However , Meguiar 's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings . They are of high quality , effective , easy to find , and affordable . However , take the affordable off . I 'd use their products , if they were 3x the price because I 've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar 's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 highlights that experience . I did n't want to like this wax/sealant as much as ones I paid thirty , forty , or fifty dollars to buy . However , the results were obvious . On my vehicles , this is the best wax/sealant I have ever used.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before apply NXT 2.0 , clay your car , clean with a paint cleaner ( i.e . Scratch X or Deep Crystal Step 1 ) , polish with a pure polish ( Deep Crystal Step 2 or # 7 Show Car Polish ) , and then apply this wax . The results are truly remarkable.To maintain your shine , remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Exterior Detailer , or Ultimate Exterior Detailer.Meguiar 's keeps delivering the good stuff , and I 'm a fan .	1
I tried many expensive wax before even with Perma Plate sole at dealership ( dealer will charge $ 450 for the job ) but , NXT generation wax does the same thing at such low price . You can feel the surface just as smooth as PermaPlate . The best of all , if you apply on the trim and rubber part of the car , It will not leave white residue as other product , and gave the car deeper dark ( like new ) color .	1
I have been a faithful user of Meguiar 's products for a long time . I use a vast array of their products on the SUV , truck , convertible , RV , and granite countertops .	1
You must use mequiars products and pads if you want the best results ! ! ! I have tried others and they are top notch ! ! !	1
I use it for applying polish . Works great . I used it for about 6 uses then it wore out . I suppose I could have gotten another one out of it . The too I think I was pushing on it a little too hard so it would probably last a little longer . I bought more of them . I 'm new to using a polisher to wax a car so I 'm not really one to rate this but its the best ( and only ) one I 've ever used .	1
like stated with the other pads i have bought for my Meguiars DA polisher i get a great shine after using these pads . no complaints what so ever .	1
Meguiar 's makes great products and this is no different . Easy to change the pad and the pad stays in place one it is set . This pad also does not absorb all the wax either . This is a good thing .	1
I had a couple of cars to detail and I used these pads with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5 & # 34 ; PU Velcro Backing Pad on the car that had a pretty even surface with few scratches and blemishes . I used Meguiar 's Ultra Cut Compound 105 ( as there were only light marks to remove ) . Produced a great finish !	1
There 's not too much exciting here , but after using these pads on a couple of cars , I can tell you that they hold up to extended use , do n't break apart , and the hook and loop backing works perfectly . You definitely can not go wrong here .	1
I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van . It saves wear and tear on the shoulders .	1
I used this pad with the Porter Cable buffer and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5 '' PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar 's Ultra Finishing Polish and it worked great . This pad is easy to clean .	1
Used these pads with a Ryobi polisher and the Meguiar 's Ultimate Compound , Polish and NXT 2.0 wax . Cleaned with some Simple Green and warm water in a bucket and they 're good as new .	1
I have a Porter Cable 7336SP dual action polisher with the backing pad and the Meguiar 's 6.5 inch pads fit perfectly and securely . I like these pad very much . I use Meguiar 's Ultimate Polish with this pad to remove minor swirls and minor scratches on the clean coat of my car . I place product on the pad , lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product . The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful , so when I first begin polishing , the machine rotates the pad when I do n't add much pressure . However , as the product becomes loaded with wet polish , the pad begins to drag and loses its rotation . It helps that the pad is not & # 34 ; so & # 34 ; thick and that the edges are tapered . I 've solved the problem by having a second pad to change out to finish the second half of the vehicle . The pads are easy to clean and I let them dry with the Velcro pad facing up . I am pleased with the results .	1
I highly reccomend this with the Meguiar 's DA polisher , perfect to use with Meguiars Ultimate Polish ! But make sure you remove any contaminants from your paint beforehand !	1
Great pad and performs as advertised . Easy to put on and take off of the buffer machine . I highly recommend this work taking excellent car of the paint finish on your car .	1
Needed to buff a new paint job , and was using the Meguires polishing compound . Tried some cloth things , and they did not work . This does work , and does a great job with as little effort as possible . Much better than trying to do it by hand .	1
I use these pads for final polishing and sealant application . Yes , I flat out love these pads . Oh yeah.After washing and cleaning the paint surface with the proper compound , I follow up with Ultra Cut and sealant , both of which I apply using this pad . Surface prep listed below:1 . Wash with Meguiar 's Gold Class Car Wash.2 . Clean surface with Ryobi , 6 & # 34 ; orbital sander and 6 & # 34 ; terry cloth pad combined with Meguiar 's & # 34 ; Ultra Cut Compound & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; Medium Cut Cleaner. & # 34 ; 3 , Polish surface with Ryobi , 6 & # 34 ; orbital sander , with Hook-Loop Velcro strips attached to pad and polish with & # 34 ; Ultra Finishing Polish & # 34 ; applied using a 6.5 & # 34 ; soft foam polishing pad ; the yellow 6.5 & # 34 ; foam pad.4 . Finish using the yellow , 6.5 & # 34 ; soft foam polishing pad . The Synthetic Sealant goes on very easy and with a micro cloth , comes off equally easy and leaves a very satisfying shine.Warning : due to splatter factor , make sure to smear Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant onto the surface before turning the dual action ( DA ) buffer on.After taking the time to wash and clean the surface of the paint with Ultra and/or Medium Cut Compound , applying Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant to the paint is pleasure as with this pad , it goes on very nicely . ( all compounds , polishes and sealants are removed with clean micro fiber cloths . ) In my opinion , for final polish or sealant application , these pads are the bomb .	1
I use it as second stage of polishing my car using Porter Cable 7424XP . It works great after 2-3 usages . I do n't now how long it will last . I will update the review later .	1
I used this pad with theMeguiar 's G110v2 Professional Dual Action Polisherto applyMeguiar 's M-0616 Mirror Glaze Professional Cleaner/Wax . 16 oz . liquidand thenMeguiar 's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 ( 18-Ounce Liquid ) .The pad stayed securely on the polisher ( hooks and loops system ) and followed the car 's body fine . I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Mirror Glaze and before using NXT Wax . I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad . The pad did not fly off.Using the DA Polisher and foam pads allowed me to perform a lot of time and labor consuming tasks in a lot less time if I attempted to do it by hand.I am very satisfied with this pad .	1
I have been a faithful user of Meguiar 's products for a long time . I use a vast array of their products on the SUV , truck , convertible , RV , and granite countertops .	1
I cant smile enough when I use this . If you ever used a cheap pad and then use this one you will never go back ! ! Great product for everyone who wants their job done right !	1
I prefer this pad over the one supplied with my Porter Cablr Polisher . Its really soft and works into the corners and tight places easily . This is also my favorite pad of all the Megs pads as its the easiest to work .	1
bought these for my Meguiars DA polisher . they work like they should . i get a great reflection on my cardinal red truck after using all the pads offered.cant go wrong with meguiars !	1
I used these pads with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5 & # 34 ; PU Velcro Backing Pad to do a finish polish on my car after doing some cutting . The final feel and shine on the car was amazing .	1
This thing works great with a mild abrasive compound . I used it on my Honda Civics , and it shines them right up .	1
works well and easy to clean . great to get swirls out of my black car . I use it with meguiar 's finishing polish .	1
I purchased this with the cuting pad ( Maroon ) . They both are high quality and seem like they will last a decent amount of use .	1
I used this pad on my truck and 5th wheel trailer with good success . Because it 's so soft it holds a lot of polish and is a little hard to clean . It seems to be better quality than some of the other soft pads I 've tried . I hope it can hold up to the hook and loop system taking it off and putting it on . I do recommend this pad . More updates to follow as I use it more times .	1
I used this with the Porter Cable buffer & Astro Pneumatic 4607 5 '' PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar 's Ultimate Liquid Wax and it worked great but I noticed it absorbed a lot of the wax so it was n't easy to clean . I ended up throwing it away because I could n't get all of the wax out of it .	1
This pad works well with my Porter Cable 7424 auto polisher.I used it with wax , polish , and glaze , and it works well with all of them.If I can get a few more uses out of it I will come back and give it 5 stars .	1
Works great with the 205 . Velcro is awesome , swap pads in seconds.easy to clean . totally happy with the shine .	1
I 'm very happy with this product it works great with a Meguiars wax of your choice ( preferably Ultimate Wax due to its forgiveness )	1
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice . It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers , this spray will not do the job . This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling . I like the product . It is easily applied . Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky . I should have known better .	1
I like Meguiars products , they are good value and this Leather Spray is great . No white residue like the other leather cleaner .	1
There is not much left to say about this stuff it is the very best product I have ever used . it just made my seats look new and feel so soft .	1
I really like Meguiar 's products . The leather spray here is no different , it works and I also like it too . Will buy again when I need more .	1
Good day to all This is good for conditioning . But not for cleaning though . I was looking fot this to clean as well . but it failed in that . But it did condition it though . The other Meguiar 's have done the job . But tis one slipped a bit . I know I can fine what I am looking for through them though .	1
I 've used Meguiar 's products for decades , and I trust the brand . I 've used this leather cleaner/conditioner for a few years now on BMW leather , and I 've been pleased with the results . For weekly/monthly cleaning it is great . Easy to use and does not leave excessive residue on the leather . Also works great for any leather in the house - such as leather furniture , etc .	1
This stuff is easy to use , and really works well . Anybody that is a car nut , will use this stuff , and for good reason , it 's a great product .	1
This product I 'm finding does a nice job on my black leather Ford seats . This is my second bottle . A quick spritz on the seats and a couple on a white microfiber towel and i run over the seats quickly . The dirt appears to be on the towel when I am done and the seats shine nicely . It does not leave any grease feel which is important in a convertible in the summer when dust will stick if there is any type of residue like that left over . I use it once a week after a wash just to keep the appearance up . I 'm going to try it on my leather couches inside the house instead of buying the kit that they sold me with the setup which dried out quickly . Meguiars goes on quick and comes off easy . Nice Product ! They also sell products that separate these into two separate bottles . So far , I 'm not changing . The car is a 2012 and does't need deep deep cleaning , which I imagine the other products are for leather that is older and needs more attention	1
Does a super job on brass , copper , silver , aluminum , bronze and stainless steel . Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish . I 've been using this polish for many years and would definitely recommend it .	1
Had I been thinking I would have taken before and after shots of the flute cleaning . Basically , the flute had n't been used in over 30 years and sat around becoming dull and oxidized . Needless to say , after some dabs of Flitz and about 10 or more squares of paper towels , it looks brand new ! The paper towels and my hands were so black with oxidation , it was truly amazing.This stuff has done it all for me and I can easily say it is the best cleaner an polish out there . Hands down .	1
I have used Flitz extensively over a 15 year timeframe . I used to detail corporate aircraft , and we had large panels of polished aluminum on spinners , nacelles , and leading edges of the wings . Flitz made the job go quick , and it provided one of the longest lasting results . Today , I still use it on cars for brightwork , and on jewelry , silverware , and a multitude of other uses . 2 pounds lasts me a long time despite frequent use . Flitz also does a good job restoring plastic headlight lenses .	1
I ordered this polish to clean up my aluminum wheels as demonstrated on a YouTube video . It did a good job with the wheels but I also tried it on the oxidized headlight lenses of the car as well . I did n't use any powered buffing wheel as I was n't sure of the effect on the plastic . However , it did n't take too much rubbing to totally restore the clarity of the lenses . I 've also used this on brass and it really worked there too . A little bit goes a long way so this tube should last quite a while .	1
incredible polish ! it polishes chrome and silver to make it look like new . i use it on many metal objects and it is especially good on polishing a large silver rope bracelet .	1
I have used this before and it works great . I use it on my stainless steel sink and it comes out great . It also does a great job on the brass poles on the outside of my building . It lasts longer than other polishes	1
I used this pad to applyMeguiar 's M10532 Ultra Cut CompoundandMeguiar 's M20532 Ultra Finishing PolishusingMeguiar 's G110v2 Professional Dual Action Polisher.The pad stayed on the polisher ( hooks and loops system ) and followed contours of my car 's body well . I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Ultra Cut Compound and before using Ultra Finishing Polish . I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad . The pad did not fly off.I am very satisfied with this pad .	1
If you want quality than look no further . This is an awesome pad with a nice thickness to it . Not like those cheapies that feel thin and are flimsy .	1
Pad works as described . I used it along with M105 to remove swirls marks on my black Tundra . Product dries quickly so work a small section at a time .	1
bought these for my Meguiars DA polisher . they get swirls out with no problem . use these with some ultimate compound and your swirls are gone ! will be buying more soon .	1
Easy to use and easy to change back and forth between this cutting pad and the polishing pad when I was ready . This pad does not absorb all the wax like other pads I have used.This is the best part of this pad .	1
I used these pads with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5 & # 34 ; PU Velcro Backing Pad to remove some deeper scratches and blemishes and after a couple of attempts all the scratches were gone - use a quality compound like the Meguiar 's Ultra Cut Compound 105/205 and you 'll get a great finish !	1
I just used this pad to remove oxidation of a very large Rv . I used it with McGuires 3 part RV oxidation compound set for fiberglass . It took a med blemished oxidated gelcoat finish and turned it into a mirror finish smooth , no burns or scratches.Oxidation is totally off finish . Its a great pad . Well worth the cost and it really held up enough to do entire 28 ft rv . Good solid foam no junk . Make sure you clean pad as it builds up . I just hold a hand scrub brush on wheel and let in spin on pad . Pad is strong enough to stand up to some good pressure .	1
This pad takes off the tough stuff . Use it , then use a 9000-series pad for final buffing . You 'll love the result .	1
Great product and works well . However the Manufacture as a limitation on the packaging of not for DA ( dual action ) sander/buffer . I called and they said it only applies to this cutting pad and not the Finishing pad ... . With that said I have used the pad with a DA buffer ... . They said it will not hold up . I have no problem with it on a Porter-Cable DA .	1
I used this with the Porter Cable buffer & Astro Pneumatic 4607 5 '' PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar 's Ultimate Compound and it worked great on paint that was oxidized and it was easy to clean the pad .	1
Worked great with the 508 , cuts fast had has a great shine . Easy to clean and I love the Velcro.So easy to swap pads . great stuff	1
This pad and the yellow polishing pad are perfect . Cell foam material is durable , wash and reuse . This pad worked perfectly on my Home Depot 's Ridgid Random Orbital Sander with the hook and loop pad . Do n't spend $ 140+ on a so called `` car '' random orbital polisher . The Ridgid is basically the same thing ... yet only costs $ 60 and I can use it for home improvement work after my car is done . Meguiar 's Scratch X 2.0 also works good with this pad to remove minor scratches and blemishes . Use Ultimate Compound for heavier oxidization .	1
Used to use the bigger counterparts but now I find these to be much more convenient for getting into tighter spaces and allow for more precision . Will be buying the softer pads soon l. I use the red for agressive scratches that wet sanding puts in your auto body . Works like a charm ! I use it with meguiars ultra cutting compound , follow it up with the 8000 yellow with diamond cut and finish with the 9000 with the m205 , ca n't go wrong	1
This cutting pad works wonders on removing light swirls , oxidization , minor scratches , etc . but do not use if you are not familiar with the cut/polish system as it 's a rather aggressive buffing pad . Works great with Meguiar 's Ultimate Compound after a wash & clay bar .	1
I use it as first stage of polishing my car using Porter Cable 7424XP . It works great after 2-3 usages . I do n't now how long it will last . I will update the review later .	1
I 've had a good experience with these ramps . They 're easy to line up , wide enough to provide confidence , and they seem plenty strong . They 're light enough to be very easy to lift and move around.These ramps are not hollow shells ; they have supports on the inside . Because of this , you can not place one ramp inside the other for storage.It took a few times for me to get used to driving up these ramps . Let 's face it , driving up an incline in your garage is not something you are probably used to . The second time I did it , my tires hit the raised lip on the ramp ( the one designed to stop the wheels ) pretty hard . When it did this , it made a loud noise , and I suffered a moment of terror before I realized that nothing was wrong.I decided it would be much easier to drive up these ramps if I could see what I was doing . So , I bought a cheap full-length mirror at Target ( the kind designed to be mounted on the inside of a bedroom door ) . Now when I use these ramps , I set the mirror down on my garage floor lengthwise , leaning against the wall , adjusted so I can see my front driver-side tire the whole time . This has made it vastly easier to drive up the ramps with confidence -- and without killing my transmission . The same trick also makes backing down the ramps easier . It 's important to be going extremely slowly at the point when the tires leave the ramps and make first contact with the floor . If you 're going too fast , the suspension will bounce , which ( depending on the vehicle ) could damage something when the underside of the vehicle hits the higher portion of the ramps .	1
**************ALWAYS CHECK YOUR RAMPS BEFORE EACH USE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I have used these multiple times and have not seen any signs of wear . Traction going up and down is fine as well . Only thing I would have liked is if the first bump was more pronounced like my car set is to let you know you reached the top . Just a note , the ramp portion can not be separated like some other models .	1
I bought this item because my hydraulic jack was leaking and I always had to top it up everytime I wanted to use it , which alone can take me 15 to 20mins to do . With this , I just drive up and in a matter of about 2 mins I 'm ready to work on my car . It makes my DIY fluid changes and inspections MUCH easier and quicker.I have a 2005 Mazda 3 , and I have absolutely no problems with it sliding , moving , or touching when I drive up on it.Although my car is not even half the weight of the 8000lb capacity model , I bought the 12000lb version just to be on the safe side.I 've had this product for just under a year , and I use it every 4 - 5 weeks . I highly recommend it if you like to save money and do your own oil changes .	1
I just got the Ramps this week and used them for the first time TODAY on my 2003 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab with a 5.3 . It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20 '' Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires . I was on my Asphalt Driveway , I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires , Get into my truck , and drove right up them ! ! ! Did n't slip AT ALL . There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front , pretty thick , not large , but it seemed to work for me . I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago , and always had access to Racks . I Changed Occupations for the better , and so I no longer have Rack access . So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered , and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up . I had no problem with these like I said . I put them right up Against the tire , and then drove right on up ! ! ! The Negative is it 's not UP very high , at least on my lowered truck . On my Low to the ground creeper , I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter . I wanted to change the Fuel filter also , but that was ALMOST impossible . It 's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank , I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off . I did manage though . I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job , but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left . Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place . I would n't get my car worked on there now ! ! ! I 'm not going to knock it down any stars because it did n't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them . Again , No slipping for my truck and it 's Rear Wheel Drive ! ! ! It did n't Sink in the Asphalt , or Crack , or anything else . Nice and Solid . The Price was right as $ 48 , with no tax and free 2nd day shipping for me . It 's harder for me to do oil changes these days , having to do it at home , but then again , I 've seen some of the work so called Pro Mechanics do on peoples cars/trucks from different places , and I think I 'll stick doing most ALL that I can , other then things that just is n't feasible for me to do at home . Things like Smog Check .	1
bought this for my CRV originally . now still works with my Honda Pilot . has lasted 5+ years and still going strong . holds the front weight of the car easily . just line it up right and drive slowly up the ramp . it can take a beating and is very hard plastic.i can change my own oil now easily and for dirt cheap yet high quality.extremely satisfied . would highly recommend . ( if you are tight on a budget just park half on a curb and it should give enough space underneath , but this lets you do it in your own garage in a much nicer fashion ) ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO HAVE WHEN CHANGING OIL : - a couple jack stands ( i always use this as a backup as never good to have a car fall on you ) - 4 tire chocks to prevent rear tires from moving by accident ( always use parking brake as well ) - socket wrench ( walmart extendable one is solid ) - oil and oil filter- gloves and lots of newspaper to prevent oil messes ( definitely will be some ) - oil pan ( walmart has a solid large one . the bigger the better . should have built in spout ) - about 1 hr of time ... drive it around a bit first to warm up oil so it flows faster , careful as it will be hot ) - channellock tongue and groove plier in case you need help to remove the oil filter ( it is crazy tight initially but does n't have to be )	1
Agree with everybody else this is a great polisher . A bit on the costly size BUT is seems to last forever because you need so little.Not something I use every day but often enough so I always know where it is . Couple years ago my tube looked empty so I ordered another . That `` empty '' one is still going and going . Just a dab goes and goes.One caviat , use an old T-shirt to polish with and whatever cloth you use do not plan on washing grey to black remains out of the cloth . No big deal.Bought a gorgous old Navy brass 8 '' bell with lots of tarnish . Looked pretty good with the old patena but even better with the bright shine Simicrome put on it . Been hanging outside long enough to put the patena back , LOL . Use it to call the birds at feeding time .	1
Best polish I have found..	1
The luster I got in five minutes polishing with Simichrome took half an hour of elbow grease using another polisher product . I was suspicious of their marketing department writing reviews here , but I must say , Wow ! Best of all it only takes a little bit of product to get great results , and yes , it is somehow shinier than everything else I have tried - as if it removes a veil that prevents the metal from showing its best . Two thumbs up ! !	1
I had heard the lore of Simichrome many years ago from a car enthusiast who raved about it but thought it to be like a unicorn-until I found it on Amazon . After ordering it and trying it , I agree that this is a fine , maybe the best , metal polish out there . It smells strong and somewhat offensive , but works like nothing else I have ever seen . I tried it first on a dull piece of silverware and in minutes , it gleamed . My cars chrome wheels and fenders and exhaust tips never looked so shiny ( feel free to check out the results on my cars in 'Customer Profile images ' ) . Brass buttons on a dress blouse and brass door hardware sparkled . Simichrome is just awesome . It is expensive , but a little goes a long way . Despite all the items I mentioned polishing , I still have ~75 % of the tube left . Just squeeze a little onto a soft cloth , rub on the metal for a minute or two and buff off to a brilliant shine.HINT : This polish works awesome to restore the lustre on many metals , but be careful when using this on items that are metal plated or made of lower quality metals because Simichrome will buff the metal right off of it . For an application like that , be extra careful . That said , it speaks to just how effective this stuff is .	1
I 've had the chance to compare this stuff with Mother 's Mag and Aluminum polish and Harley Davidson 's Bright Chrome polish . Simichrome comes out on top ! Just that simple . It actually shines the metal whereas Mother 's might clean some but Simi outshines it .	1
Yes a bold statement , if you do n't need to heavy grit polishing and are looking for a lasting luster and shine then a little of this goes a long way . Have always bought in the tubes as you use so little but to do my '72 's alloy 's I got this can and it will last beyond that for many years . This is flat out amazing stuff and I use it for jewelry as well .	1
Used this to polish the cases on my 97 Harley Sportster . The aluminum cases and chromed accessories were in pretty neglected shape . I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and it works amazingly well . Not the cheapest polish but it goes a long way . I 've used it with a Mother 's Ball but of course hand polishing works the best .	1
This polish really does a beautiful job on virtually any metal.I would guess I 've been using this polish for over 30 yearsand have found there 's pretty much no end to what this polish is good for.It gives a gleaming shine on : Brass ~ silver ~ copper ~ gold ~ chrome ~ aluminum ~ pewter ~ stainless steel ~ and more.It 's not good on many painted nor plated surfaces as it may remove paint & plating.I can say from experience that it ruins/removes the gold or silver flashing on china.I use this on so many things that I keep tubes of simichrome in the house & garage for convenience.Plus carry it in both the car & truck as it 's proven to be very use-full when antiquing.Especially for checking if an item is Bakelite.The pink polish will turn a yellowish ( dark yellow to a canary ) if it 's Bakelite ~no matter what color of Bakelite your testing.The polish will stay pink if it 's not Bakelite.While cleaning our un-hearted garage this past fall I found a particle tube behind a cabinetthat must have been there for over 20 years ~ and it was still fresh & worked like new ! Freezing does n't damage it , I leave it in the garage & autos years around.This polish leaves a protective finish so metals do n't darken again as quickly ~while adding a beautiful shine .	1
If there was ever a product the exceeds expectations , this is it . If you have ANY kind of bare metal and particularly stainless steel this is it . Yes it is labor intensive but the outcome is never in doubt . Its going to shine . Great automotive or household maintenance product .	1
I 've been away from this product for a few years . Iw as trying a wide variety of different polishes . This is still the best . Nothing else is close .	1
I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle . I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons .	1
I polished all the Aluminum on my banshee ATV with this and it worked great . it was easy to use and made all the aluminum come out like chrome without too much elbow grease . Was here fast and did its job great , if you need to get anything polished you can use this and it will come out great .	1
I have nothing but great things to say about Simichrome . I have quite an arsenal of Detailing supplies ( ask the Mrs , She wants to strangle me ) Literally a few thousand dollars worth . I have put honest effort into all of the metal polishes I have used in the past and none of them stack up to Simichrome . Flitz metal polish is a distant second . If you can find the old Brasso in the metal can grab it ! Its the old formula made prior to the VOC regulation changes and it is amazing . Simichrome paste is pretty damn close to Brasso if not better .	1
For years I have tried different polishing compounds and I have never found one that works better than mothers aluminum polish until now . The polish comes in a tooth paste like tube , just a little bit of this polish gives a nice clean haze free shine on my motorcycle rims . The polish is easy to go on and easy to wipe off . It is not hash or grainy so no need to worry about hairline scratches.I will purchase again when this batch runs out .	1
I have been buying this product for several years now , and I love everything about it . The fragrance and how easy it is to place in vents .	1
Great stuff ! Gets rid of odor takes a little too long to arrive but I knew that when I ordered it .	1
Really was n't sure if this would work . Did n't even understand how to use it until I received it . Sat on the shelf until the heater in my Tundra reminded me that I needed something that would remove that musty , moldy odor . This has a long tube that you insert into the vents in the center of the dash . Push the tubing in as far as you can ( which is almost all of the tubing 's length ) and depress the button on the top . I did it both vents but never emptied the can . Then ran the blower . It was n't until a few days later when the weather was typically that which would make me notice the musty smell but it was n't there ! ! Very , very happy with this and even happier that I did n't have to take the truck to a repair shop for a 'flushing ' of the venting system . Try it , you 'll like it ! !	1
It 's been a month and it 's pretty much has cleared the musty smell from the ax however the car has never had it done in 10 years until so I think I 'll get another one and do it again in a couple of months and see if any left over is there but it does do the job . Oh and be carefull because other people complain that the hose curls up and goes back out and sprays them in the face . It did n't happen to me but just in case . You are not so sharp Ha ! !	1
We fed the line down into the central part of the A/C from the dash side , let it all go , and followed the rest of the instructions . We did this in spring and it 's been fresh since . Now we 're in September there might be a 'hint ' of smell coming back after a long hot summer.. so if I have to do this every year. , okay .	1
This is a very comfortable product to eliminate some stubborn odors from your Car Air conditioning system . I was having a very damp mildew odor from my car but was unable to find a good effective solution to that.I got my air conditioning system cleaned , refrigerant vacuumed and refilled but was unable to get rid of that smell completely . However after reading reviews on Amazon , decided to give it a try and yes , it did it well . Will definitely recommend this if you wanted to get rid of unwanted disturbing odors and will suggest to use it periodically to make your ride more pleasant .	1
This product has to be the best in my opinion , it works on plastics to bring that almost new look back , when car was purchased . Iove this product and will probably purchase again when I run out .	1
This is the only product that I have ever used on the & # 34 ; Soft-touch & # 34 ; interiors on the 5 VWs and 1 Audi that I have owned . I have never had a problem with peeling and probably never will , as long as I use this to clean the itnerior . Has a pleasant smell and works really well !	1
I have just used this product for the first time today . I have been using another very popular interior detailer . I used the other detailer just a short time ago and thought the interior was clean . Einszett Premium not only lifted a lot more grime off my vinyl dash and door panels , it is not slick like the other detailer/cleaner . I will be using Einzett from now on .	1
Works great and has a pleasant citrus smell . But man does the mist burn your eyes . Made my interior look new and dried to a natural low shine . Did not attract dust or stay wet like other products . I will be buying more of this .	1
Will continue to keep ths stuff in the garage . Cleans great , smells great , leaves no residue behind , and seems to keep dust from attracting to the dash .	1
I 've read rave reviews on this stuff for years , finally ordered some and the reviews are right . great product.Pros- no/low shine . no greasy feel . nice smell , after a while.Cons- strong smell at first but it dissipates quickly .	1
This cleaner and protectant works well . The smell is a bit overwhelming but it luckily goes away after a few hours . The results so far are good . Not sure how much better this is vs less expensive products but so far less dust build up . Real test will be in spring and summer .	1
I like this a lot better than ArmorAll . It smells nice and does n't leave any residue behind . It 's more expensive than other stuff , so I 'm not thrilled about that . If it was under $ 10 I would give it 5 stars .	1
ArmorAll is great if you 're in your teens and want your interior to look like you cleaned it with a can of crisco . Even their matte products still leave you with a glossy sheen . When it comes to me and my cars , I tend to look for quality products that I can use over and over again . I 've always found that with einszett products . From interior to exterior , their products work flawlessly and produce great results . The additional minty , slightly clinical yet sweet smell is always welcome in my vehicles . Do n't think twice , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Simply the best protectant I 've ever tried . No greasy feeling like armor all , no tacky feeling like Meguiar 's . The scent is a pleasant & # 34 ; fresh & # 34 ; smell . Does a fairly good job of taking off scuffs and such . It does n't seem to attract dust , so flat trim looks better longer.A little goes a long way . I find I use about a quarter as much of this as I do the other protectants when doing my interior . Given this , while it is n't cheap , it really ends up costing less over the long term .	1
Leaps and bounds better then Armour All . No greasy residue . Product only needs 1 application about every 2 weeks for lasting results .	1
This product is great . I just wish I could find it locally . It cleans so well and does n't leave a greasy film on anything . I hate that it has alcohol in it but seeing as they make/made factory products for BMW I 'm not too concerned.The results are better than anything I used . I even bought some for my Dad !	1
Actually this took a little modification . I changed the bolts that adjust the height to clip pins to make it quicker to change . However the product works great on my Nissan Frontier .	1
Better than using one of those kitchen style steps , because it will not slide out from under you when you are making a long reach . I would recommend picking up a pack of rubber bumpers ( http : //www.amazon.com/Waxman-4215495N-2-Inch-Bumper-Square/dp/B001WAK6E2/ref=pd_sim_indust_3 ) to prevent this from scratching your wheels .	1
This is a tough unit and critical to clean the windows of my RV and truck . I am glad I bought the 'used ' one -- could n't tell it was n't brand new ! The unit is a little heavy - but that 's good for what it does . I wish I could adjust the angle of the step plate though ... right now when mounted it actually is ~10* dropped from level and I would not want to slip off this thing ( but the louvers will preclude that from happening I suspect ) .	1
I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high . Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great , it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire . It fits my 37x12.5 ( it wo n't work with a bigger tire ) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go . It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat . A really great item , and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck .	1
This worked perfectly for my 2003 Ford Excursion . It fit right over the tire and gave me the extra height I wanted to load bikes on the roof and a car top carrier . Seems very sturdy and well made . The bag that comes with it is a nice bonus feature . I see what others have mentioned though about the adjustable step and folding it up in the bag . If you place the step in any position except for the lowest , you will not be able to store it in the bag folded . All that said , it will still fold up in that position and you could easily put a bunge around it and store it that way .	1
This unit is a new experience in loading and retreiving items from the bed of my pickup . It also makes it easier to was the top of my truck . I would buy it again ( that is , if this one ever broke or got lost ) , which is n't likely , since it is very durably made .	1
I tower out at 5'7 & # 34 ; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck . This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything . I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .	1
Very nice item , allows me to reach areas I could n't prior without a step ladder.Keep it right in the truck , assembles easiliy and takes very little space .	1
the bag it came with dosent fit it , if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting , this does exactley what they say , seems pretty rugged , it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob .	1
Glad to find this product . Since my 2013 Tundra is so high that I ca n't even jump up to enter the truck bed .	1
Would be nice if it lighted all the way around , instead of just on one side . Therefore it can only be seen from one direction . It 's not as bright as a regular flare . I guess it would be better than nothing in an emergency .	1
Have n't tried it yet since I purchased it for an emergency . But it seems good . I will let everyone know once I actually use it .	1
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition . I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary . The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver , as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension . This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find . Very pleased with its performance .	1
I 'm going to give this extension 4 stars because it was beefy and did n't rattle when I attached it to my Wrangler . However , I returned it for a refund after finding out that Yakima does not want you to use a hitch extension with their racks . As a matter of fact , no bike carriers do . Knocked off 1 star because the place selling the hitch says you can use it for a bike rack .	1
I wish it came with a locking pin instead of the bolt , but other than that , this is a good solution for mounting my bike on the back of my Jeep with an oversized spare .	1
I have had this item on my jeep for just about 2 years now . I need it because of the 35 inch tire on my tailgate covers access to the normal hitch area . It has been used to haul many items and has worked flawlessly . ( trailer 5x10 , boat , 16ft , and a cargo cart with 300lbs in it ) It has zero rust on it and I am very impressed with it over all . Also noted that I do a lot of 4x4ing with my jeep and have dropped the rear end off a few steep drops and this extension caught the weight of the jeep without any sort of damage to it . A++ in my book !	1
Works as advertised ! Heavy duty construction . Do n't know that I care for the bolt that hold it in place would rather use a locking pin as I do with all of my other hitch devices . But that can probably be remedied if I can get out the threaded insert .	1
The label on the box clearly says `` Not for towing '' . This is used mainly for bike rack.Easy to install and quality is OK . It comes with a bolt and washer for securing the extension to your vehicle . The bolt and washer work together to prevent hitch extension from wobbling . So , it 's like getting both the hitch extension and a wobbling stopper in one good price.In summary , it serves the intended purpose well with the addition of wobbling stopper . Good deal .	1
This does what it says it does . It is really heavy and is a bit much to lug around , but overall good .	1
I added this to my double receiver so as to use my bike rack and cargo hauler at the same time . Without this accessory my cargo hauler was too close to the bikes . This provide the added distance for clearance ,	1
My dad has used Kroil for years but I was n't able to find this in stores anywhere . Amazon to the rescue ! While doing a brake job I had a couple bolts which I was NOT able to move . I tried PB Blaster and got nowhere . I sprayed on the Kroil and first I noticed that even though its thicker in consistency , it penetrates just as well ( if not better ) than PB blaster . It also bubbles a lot more ( which I guess means its having a better chemical reaction . ) After about an hour I tried the bolts again and they came loose right away !	1
You have found the best there is , no more looking - yep , right here - BUY IT ! ! ! !	1
This penetrating solvent is easy to use and seems to work well . I 've used it to free up several rusted up bolts and such and , after giving it time to work , it has worked every time , so far . : - )	1
A friend of mine turned me on to this stuff . I 've not bought anything but Kano products since ( well , I think this stuff is all they make ) . Spray it ( liberally ) onto your stuck fastener ( over torqued , rusted , salted , dirty , whatever ) , and just walk away . Come back in five minutes . Still stuck ? Spray on some more and come back in an hour . If it 's still stuck ( and this has only happened to me once ) , let it soak overnight.I know with other penetrating oils , I 've ended up drilling out my fair share of fasteners . Since I 've been using Kroil , I probably have n't had to drill out a stuck bolt in over a year . ( Smells like flowers , too . Oily flowers . ) And if you 're not the only mechanically oriented person around , either order a bunch , or find a good place to hide the stuff ...	1
Probably the best penetrating oil out there , but by far , the most expensive . Seafoam cost about half the price of SiliKroil , and is also very good . I would say that the Seafoam brand is a close second .	1
I USE THIS ALMOST EVERYDAY - ESPECIALLY DURING THESE ( 15 ) DEGREE DAYS AND NIGHTS . THEY WILL TAKE A TOLL ON YOUR BATTERIES . GOOD PRICE AND FAST DELIVERY . A+	1
have n't used mine yet . Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel . A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody 's ever around . So no more calling someone for a jump .	1
I bought this charger to replace my old one which lasted 18 years and was used at least twice a week in our shop . The new one ways half of what the one did , so I hope it will last as long . This is a great charger , the only thing missing from it , is an automatic shut off , for when the battery is completely charged . But for 1/2 the cost of our old shop charger I Will Take It . So far so good .	1
This item was well packaged and arrived intact . Assembly was pretty easy . It 's a nice looking unit and the quality looks good . I used it once to start my neighbors car . Seems to have plenty of power . It 's nice to know that if my battery gets weak at the house at least , I 'll be ready .	1
I bought this in September 2011 on Amazon , and it 's still performing flawlessly after more than two years of moderate use.There 's already lot 's of reviews of this charger , so I 'll be brief and to the point.What I like : It 's never failed to start a car with a dead battery . Just set it for 200 amps , let it sit for a couple minutes and crank the car up . The cables are generally long enough to accomplish whatever job needs done.What I do n't like : Chintzy wheels could be better.Battery tester is basically a joke ... it does n't give an exact voltage and maxes out at 12.7 volts . I 'd like to have had an option for timed charge and a sensor that would charge to full capacity and then go to & # 34 ; trickle & # 34 ; mode.I 'm giving this charger four stars in spite of its shortcomings because it has worked flawlessly for over two years , and it was reasonably priced when I bought it . I feel comfortable recommending this charger to anyone who need a good battery charger , but would make sure I told them of the weaknesses of this charger .	1
Fits and looks good . Nothing spectacular , but it helps dress up your license plate . Happy with the purchase I made .	1
The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame , no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate . Most bulkier frames cover about a 1 '' wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate . In some states this may be illegal , not sure about my state , PA.I have a `` vanity '' plate , and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate . This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate , which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years , this is the second frame I purchased . The first one lasted about 4 years . However , for the cost , a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car .	1
THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT 'S DESIGN . GOOD PRODUCT .	1
Texas passed a law that the license plate frame could not obscure any lettering on the license plate . I wanted some nice chrome frames for our cars and truck and these fit the bill exactly . The chrome finish is good and through many car washing none of it has peeled or flaked off . These are nice frames for the price .	1
Just installed this today . July 23 , 2013 on the rear of our 2006 Lincoln Town Car and it looks just right . It 's made of chrome plated metal ( zinc ) not plastic . As received , the chrome finish is fine , but after reading reviews about it deteriorating , I gave it a coat of Simoniz front and back including the mounting tabs before mounting . Hope it will help to retard oxidation . I replaced the UGLY black dealership advertising frame with this one and it looks great . Many cars have only two mounting screw anchors at the top of the plate . Initially with the two screws tightened , the bottom of the plate stuck out . I had to gently bend the license plate very slightly to make it not quite flat so it fit flush with the frame at the bottom and all around . It might also be corrected by adding two SHORT mounting screws and nuts to attach the bottom of the plate to only the frame tabs.The `` perimeter '' frame mounts BEHIND the license plate hiding the mounting tabs , thereby exposing the entire plate : just the simple narrow chrome frame shows . Also , no grief from fussy police or vehicle inspectors because of an obscured state name , motto , etc . I found very few available perimeter frames and for Amazon 's cheap price of this one , if it only lasts a year I 'll buy a couple more of them . Will likely buy one or two for our other car as well . I would have given it 5 stars , but for the possible impending corrosion mentioned in several reviews . Mounting screws were not included with the frame.Update 4/5/14 Uh , oh . Downgraded to 2 stars.The nasty snowy , salty winter we had here in NJ took its toll and pitted the chrome frames despite the Simoniz treatment . I plan to order 2 new ones and try clear-coating them on both sides to see if that helps preserve them .	1
Works great if your state requires a front license plate to be installed on you freakin ' , brand new car ! Oklahoma is lucky ! Good quality plastic which appears to be of quality that will last the life of the car . The screws went into the brand new bumper ( ouch ! ) just like butter . Recommended .	1
This plate holder is great . It has many wide cutouts to adjust plate position almost infinitely . Used zipties to hold it through the grill of my car to avoid drilling into the bumper and it holds pretty well .	1
Anything plastic concerns me with durability . About all I can say is it fits , looks nice , and supports our license plate . I do n't know if it could take much winter graveled road abuse but time will tell and the plate should absorb most of the shock . Works for now .	1
This does what I hoped . Easy to install . Holds plate well . I do worry that the plastic will break over time with the temperature changes or with a slight tap from another car . This has not happened yet though . I am glad I bought it .	1
Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best	1
I tried to get at the local auto parts stores , no on had in stock , thank you amazon , now my front plate and it does n't rattle any more	1
My new Focus comes with dealer plate , replacing it with this plus screw cover and there 's no ad anymore , I like it .	1
Okay so i got my truck used , It had a license plate thing on the front , I knew I did n't have screws or anything . I bought this kit , and it worked ! the little small white things you put in the holes that the screws go in , fits perfect and works great ! ! ! Exactly what I needed	1
Works great and looks great so far . I think if someone really wants to take your plate they can , but this will stop most .	1
The fasteners are just like , if not better than what you would buy at your local parts store . Seeing if they will last as long as they should , is a matter of time , but , at first impression , I think they will .	1
This is a very well made as well as thought out product . Come with everything needed for installation . Great bang for the buck .	1
A bit of a splurge but these little touches make me feel good when I look at my Valkyrie .	1
I needed to replace my front tag holder and figured that I would like to have something that people just ca n't come up with a screwdriver and take it off . Granted you can take one look at it and pick up a hollow star key / wrench and take it off but at least it make it a little harder for the drive by plate theft . I gave this 4 starts only because of the construction of the Allen key like wrench which comes with the set . Instead of having the key portion in the short end so that you have the leverage of the long when you tighten the screws down but instead the key portion is in the tip of the long end so that you only have about one inch of tool to tighten the screws with so if they 're tight , you 'll end up like me with a box end wrench looped over the tool to complete the job . I still recommend this product .	1
Yey you can buy stainless steel screws at your local hardware store and get your licence plate mounted but when you are thousands of mile from a Lowes or Ace then this is a great option . The screws are of good quality and so are the plastic plugs . I would imagine a similar item at Advance Auto or Auto Zone being a comparative price , and this way you do n't pay sales tax and shipping is free .	1
This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates . I 'm happy . It does n't fit all cars . Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight ! !	1
This is a great replacement bolt kit for your License plate mounts . I personally did not need the grommets but the bolts were exactly what i needed . Only negative is that the key for the bolts should have been grooved on both ends , as the groove is only on the tip of the long end leaving you to struggle with the short end of the key when the bolt gets really tight . Advise using something like a Ratchet extender on it ... .	1
Not much to say , other than to let people know these work on Ford vehicles.I installed them on my Truck and my wife 's Escape . Both vehicles only use 2 screws so I was able to use one package for the 2 vehicles.On my truck I took the extra time to reach behind and put the white plastic `` nut '' on the end of the screw ( on the tip of the screw that stuck through the bumper ) . This will make it pretty much impossible to remove the screws without holding onto the nut . ( I think the white plastic thing is actually meant as a bushing for larger holes ? ? ? ) For my wife 's escape I could n't reach the back side of the screw without take apart the hatch so I just put the screws in.Like others have said , this is n't `` bulletproof '' - but it will deter theft . I could take out the old screws with my pocketknife so anyone walking by could steal the license plate in about 10 seconds time . This will prevent that type of theft ...	1
Nice fit and Stainless bolts . Nice security feature with the special Torx wrench provided . Wo n't rust in our harsh NY winters .	1
This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates . I 'm happy . It does n't fit all cars . Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight ! !	1
Great product .	1
Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car . Dont know why . Work fine on the front but not the rear . Also they are security screws , so do not lose the device that comes with them . FYI	1
These Cruiser Accessories 81330 Locking Fasteners , Import-Stainless are exactly what I needed to mount my plate securely to my truck . Though I ordered them for my car , it had no plate mount to use them on and I could n't get up behind the plastic bumper to back up the screws with the locking nuts . Nuts !	1
This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation . Great valuie .	1
A bit pricey but high quality fasteners with a tamper resistant head . If you have a good local hardware store you may want to try putting one of these together yourself .	1
A little pricey , should have come with the cruiser plate cover . Bolted right on my 06 M3 , no need for the nuts .	1
This is great for using with your vanity license plates . I highly recommend it . The star shape in the middle is easy to crack into though . All you have to do is spend 10 bucks at your local Lowe 's or Home Depot . As long as your thief is lazy , you will be fine .	1
Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates . If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket , these screws will most likely be too big to fit . I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in . Ended up with a nice tight fit . Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers , Black	1
Clean and as described . No issue with the screws or the nylon nuts . It appeared the nuts were zinc plated ... ( ? )	1
With the proper sized pan head machine screws these plastic chrome screw covers fit well . I 've used them for about three years . In the past year a couple of the caps were lost so I purchased some new sets .	1
Used these on my ventage auto chrome plate frame.They look nice & fit well . I like them & recommend them .	1
Cover fits well with their screw . They should 've sell it as package . Nonetheless , perfect match and my car is now ad free .	1
Very clever item that adds a clean look to your license plate frame . Hides the screw heads and gives a finished look to your license plate installation . I plan on keeping some of these on hand . Wish I had thought of this .	1
I 've gotten a few sets of these ( 4 ) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I 've had mostly good results from these covers . I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers ( I think , who can remember ? ) . These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place . This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring ( which allows the cap to & # 34 ; snap & # 34 ; and be held in place ) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head . So you 'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt . The only other problem I 've had with these caps is that one cap in one set ( new ) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring . I had extras form an old set so no big deal . I never & # 34 ; lost & # 34 ; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they 're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you 're looking for . I recommend this product .	1
A little pricey for something that should have come with the license plate cover , but whatever . They snap right on the screw posts and stay put pretty well -- I have had them fall off when drying the plate with a towel , just fyi ...	1
I decided to try these out , and I 'm glad I did ! The black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame I also got from Amazon -REAL 100 % CARBON FIBER LICENSE PLATE FRAME TAG COVER FFSince most plates only use two screws , one set covers front and rear ( If you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required ) The white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws , and the black cap just snaps over the top . Seems to hold well enough to not fall off , but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws . Another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware . That is good to know . I would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case . ( Which is n't a bad idea anyway )	1
This is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates . I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts ... .why why why ? ? Just remove the frame , get these caps and hide the ugly screws . : ) Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps . Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem .	1
Bought the stainless steel cruiser screws and had no idea how to put them on . The packaging that amazon ship them in did not have proper instructions , so it took a while to figure out . Once it stops raining and Ill put them on they should work perfectly .	1
I have an auto alarm but the blinking led is in a place that is not noticeable to a potential thief . I put loop tape on the back and placed it on my dash and loaded it with 2 Amazon AAA batteries . It has two flashing LEDs that alternated and really attracts attention . Although it does have an on-off switch I left it on 24/7 for a Month and it 's still going strong . Much longer than I expected.It is visible in the daytime so long as it 's not 'directly ' in the sun.Quite happy with this , good product .	1
I have no idea if this has ever prevented anybody from messing with my car , but it gives me a little extra peace of mind when I park my nice car in a not-so-friendly part of town . I debated on buying a real security system for my car , but the general consensus around my neighborhood is that a car alarm wo n't even turn a head and an overly sensitive alarm is likely to get your car vandalized from annoyed neighbors . This works great for my car because it hides nicely on the dash and with my window tint you cant see that it 's a cheap stand-alone box . The lights however shine brightly enough to be seen through the tint even in the day . I 've had the same batteries in it for over a year . I probably only use it a couple hours a month .	1
Although it does n't look like the real car alarm blinking lights that I have or have seen , it is certainly better than nothing . I purchased one for my nephew along with an inexpensive motion alarm . I highly recommend that you get both for a vechicle that has no alarm . It 'd probably be more realistic not to place this device in absolute plain sight . While you want the flashing to be visible , you do n't want the would be theives to see that the unit is NOT built into your vehicle . My advice is to get one of these to ward off potential theives , but first you should at least get a wireless motion detector . If you can only afford one or the other , get the real alarm first . The `` Wireless Motion Sensor Detector Alarm With 2 REMOTE '' by MacTop for $ 14 + $ 7 shipping is pretty good . One nice thing is that it also has a red LED light that is always on , even when the alarm is not enabled . That is good for letting people know there is some type of electronic security in the vehicle . Best of luck avoiding the theives .	1
This product does not seem like much to look at but when used at night , it is very effective and easy to see.I always place mineLED lights in an area of my car that is not to obvious . I would not place on the dashboard but perhaps on the side of my console orin a storage area in the dashboard . It can be a deterrent to car thefts .	1
I recently purchased this item to use for off road recovery while using the Hi-Lift jack . It 's well made , heavy duty and should work just fine !	1
this is a great compliment to anawesome jack ! I highly recommend having this if you own the jack . It can be of great use when using the jack is tough due to angles , etc .	1
bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack . with the 60 '' jack it works perfectly . i originally tried it with a 48 '' and it just was n't enough due to the loss of about 8 '' of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower .	1
This is one other item you need for your Hi-Lift jack . This allows you to lift curved bumpers , or ones without notches in them specifically for this type of jack . Great small accessory that goes well with the jack itself . Heavy duty and will last many years . I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though . If you have plastic bumpers , do n't use this , it will leave marks . A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained . Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid . This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material . Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job . I added larger ones that are stronger , but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading . You need this for your jack . Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well .	1
I have the Hi-Lift jack and felt that this item would be great for an insurance policy if something happened to the jack and I needed to make an emergency repair . In fact , I purchased two of them just in case , and maybe help out someone without the kit . I highly recommend , and they will last as long as the jack does if you never need them .	1
If you own a Hi-Lift , I may suggest to have this repair kit . You do n't know when you will have to use it .	1
i bought this to replace worn out pins and springs on my 20 year old Hi Lift Jack ... Jack is still in good working order and will use the fix it kit , as a back up !	1
I bought this to replace the parts from a jack I 've had for 16 years . It had bent/rusted parts from all of the years of use/abuse I put it through . This kit was drop-in easy and worked perfectly .	1
The great thing about a Hi-Lift jack is that it will last longer than you . However , at some point you 're going to need to replace the climbing pins . If I were buying these separately at the hardware store , I be out $ 6 tops . Oh well , they work and that 's what counts !	1
Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine . Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern .	1
i have a jeep XJ cherokee with about 6 '' of lift and 33 '' tires . I have a 48 '' hi-lift jack . I got the smaller one mainly b/c of space as i wanted it to fit under my rear seat in my jeep . With the 48 '' i can use my front bumper or my rocker rails as jack points , however it would be pretty difficult to get a tire off the ground unless i maxed out the jack . This item helps a lot to raise the wheel off the ground and be able to put something underneath the wheel for better traction like a log or rock . My only small complaint is that there is a nut that holds this onto your hi-lift . would be better if the nut was a bit longer and that it came with a wing nut instead of a lock nut . Otherwise the build quality is very good , it has a rubber pad that goes up against the tire . The hooks are extremely strong and the straps are stitched very very well .	1
I think it is a must when you own a Hi-Lift and your car have soft ( plastic ) bumpers.Just one suggestion , please read carefully how to operate this product because if you do n't do it you have the risk to break it as happened to one friend last weekend when we went off-road .	1
I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with 33 & # 34 ; tires that I just bought last year . I drive it around the 'burbs 99.999 % of the time , so obviously I need a Hi-Lift X-Treme Jack and accessories to go with it the other 0.001 % of the time.For my application , this works great . It 's solid and looks cool .	1
This is a must if you own the Hi-Lift jack . This makes using the jack so much easier in many cicumstances . I bought it to go along with my 48 '' Extreme model for my 2011 Polaris Ranger Crew and unfortunately 9I guess fortunately ) I have not had the opportinuty to use this attachment on my own rig but have already had the chance to use it to help others ! I love it !	1
A very simple concept but someone had to be the first to invent it . I suspect others will soon imitate this.Photos show lifting tires . No doubt it would work fine for that - especially with heavy , over size tires ( as shown ) or farm equipment tires . But it 's good for so much more.A piece of steel under the corner of a small building , set hooks under the steel , and lift the building for re-leveling . Hook it under a mower deck of a riding mower to remove/sharpen blades.You trust your jack , now trust the accessories they provide so you can get the most from it . Be sure to get the base for the jack , better than carrying around a piece of 2x6 and no one will toss it on your camp fire , either .	1
Great accessory for when you get stuck and need to lift just one wheel to perform a self recovery to get back on the trail/street .	1
Hi lift lives up to the name still , and at first i was sceptical , the packing was ify and it didnt seem to solid , but regardless had to test it out attached to my jack , and it lifted my jeep no problem .	1
Bought this to go with my Hi-Lift and it is pretty nifty . Bolts onto the jack and works perfect with the 265/75/16 tires on MT classic lock rims on my Jeep XJ . Very handy and takes up very little space . I have n't abused it much yet so ca n't say anything about durability but it seems solid and well built to me . Sure beats piling stuff under a bottle jack !	1
Great addition for my Hi-lift jack . They should have included a quick release pin rather than a bolt to attach it to the jack . The hand tightened bolt vibrated loose and was lost on the first trail ride . Other than that it was well designed and of good quality and of great use the first time out .	1
i really like this lil thing ! it is well made and very useful for a lot of applications ! hi lift are making great kit these days just seem to be really over priced ... ... ..	1
This product works well . However as some others have said a bolt to hold the thing on the jack is n't really needed and is rather cumbersome to remove and install . A quick pin would have been better . DO YOU HEAR THAT HI-LIFT ?	1
If you have a high lift jack this is a must have . You know you will need this in the worst of situations and this will provide better floatation in soft soil and sand .	1
Very heavy duty and should work just as advertised in soft sand , soil , mud , etc . Have n't actually used it yet but fully expect that it will live up to its claims ! Hi-Lift is a great company and I will continue to buy their products .	1
Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road . Sand = Nope . Mud = Nope . Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly . ( I know from experience - ugh )	1
Product was shipped and received in short order as advertised . Its a thick chunk of plastic that is reinforced with ribbing . Should hold up fairly well in conjunction with the Hi-Lift jack .	1
I have used this a couple of time with my Hi-Lift Extreme jack . Fortunately i have not need to use it for anything important but it is build to last . it is a great compliment to a wonderful product .	1
i like very thing about this product except the color . it really made jacking up my jeep easier . an when using it in the mud it didnt sinkat all really .	1
I just got this today , I was amazed the base is perfect for the HI Lift jack , it is a lot bigger than picture shows ( 12 & # 34 ; x 14 & # 34 ; ) I would highly recommend getting this , it could save your life , or prevent injuries using an unstable jack . & # 34 ; This should come with the jack & # 34 ; . Will last longer than a piece of wood , and is easy to clean .	1
Why is this better than a piece of lumber ? Nobody mistakes it for firewood and tosses it into a camp fire ... leaving you with nothing just when you happen to need it.Have n't tried it in mud but have used it on soft sand and softer dirt . Worked great . The load is spread out over an area of almost one square foot . A bit expensive for a piece of plastic but worth it .	1
I love my Hi-Lift jack and use it frequently , decided to get this to help in mud/sand so the jack does n't sink.The quality is fantastic . Very sturdy , thick , fits the base perfectly . Only thing that sucks is the price -- almost $ 40 for this is ridiculous	1
Havent had to use this base but I glad I have on hand for 4 wheeling if you have a hi lift jack you should have this as well	1
nice jack base ... sturdy with a jagged edge for scraping dirt away to get a flat place to set up jack..	1
The National Seashore requires vehicles carry a piece of plywood to act as a base for a jack . This base puts plywood to shame . The jack wo n't slip off , the base is heavy plastic so it wo n't rot or break . And you ca n't get slivers from it.I got the Off-Road Base so the jack would n't sink out of sight in soft ground .	1
ARB base plate , nice thick plastic , works great . Essential part of your kit if you carry a Hi-Lift on your truck .	1
I live in the desert so this farm jack base is a life saver as most often the jack is used in sand . This base is much larger than expected which is good for better weight distribution .	1
You can use this bad boy as a base for your Wrangler 's bottle jack - especially if your lift kit has put the axles a tad out of reach . If you have a Discovery , you will need to Dremel out small notch for the OEM bottle jack . High Lift jacks are great accessories , but they 're not all that safe for changing tires in the field when you think about it . For that , a bottle jack with a good base and an axle lift point will get you going just fine .	1
The items that came with the kit appear to be of good quality and should be useful on the trail . Seems a bit overpriced for the overall kit . You still need to buy some quality chain to go with the kit . So expect to spend another 50-100 dollars for that .	1
i used it help pull out another car that i couldnt natch out . it was well worth the money an beat having to call a tow truck	1
These jacks can be so comically dangerous they could come with an Emergency room discount . They always have been . That is just the nature of them I guess . Not much gets higher , especially for the weight and bulk . Maybe I will work out a bumper mount .	1
AND IT SAVED MY BUTT , COMBINED WITH A 30FT . STRAP AND THE HILIFT EXTREME I WAS ABLE TO PULL MYSELF OUT OF A GNARLY HOLE I FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF A SNOWMOBILE TRAIL IN MY JEEP YESTERDAY . WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFED WITHOUT IT . THE BAG IT COMES IN IS CRAP BUT THE GEAR IS SOLID .	1
The life of an engine depends on Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycles to prevent friction which causes heat . You can get along without it but you will get along by foot .	1
You can use this oil in for the engine oil , primary , and transmission in Harley 's . My Streetglide seems to run cooler using this full synthetic compared to the dyno oils . With Mobil 1 you cant go wrong . It is a high quality oil and a good price . A lot cheaper than royal purple .	1
Bought this oil for my '09 Buell xb12ss Lightning Long which has a V2 Harley engine.Read much about the specs of all the different oils and this one was the best synthetic. [ ... ]	1
Best price for this item anywhere . A must have for your bike if you do your own work . Will purchase again in a few months .	1
This is the Only oil I use in my Dyna Street Bob since 2008 , Engine runs cooler , Shifts Great , Here in Florida as you all know it gets mighty Hot . This is the only Oil I will ever use in my Bikes .	1
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50I was skeptical about using this oil in my Ducati 696 at first , because the manual had specified 15W-50 and many other riders wanted me to use a 10W-40 instead . Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40 , so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle , and my 696 's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound . I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it , and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696 . Once on the road , I did n't hear/feel anything wrong . WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise . The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes , and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.As for the high-revving engine comment earlier , I looked up Buell 's 1125 and Aprilia 's RSV4 engine oil requirements . They both called for 15W-50 , and Amsoil 's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50 . The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines , they can rev higher than most of Ducati 's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.Overall : 5/5 stars , great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50 .	1
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycle is great synthetic oil for your bike and the price is very competitive .	1
Bought it for a friend.He was recommended by another as with 19 years of using this oil on his shadow vlx , the engine still didnt need a rebuild .	1
This is the only oil I 've used in my Harley 's for many many years . It does what it 's designed to do and it does it very well . Great stuff .	1
Bought this for our 2003 BMW R 1150R.Even as a female I understand that Mobil 1 is THE standard for synthetic , and we would never buy another brand for any of our engines .	1
I recommend this oil to all Harley owners . I have extensively researched what motor oil to run in my 2006 Sportster 883 and decided to go with Mobil 1 V-Twin . This is the same oil weight as the Harley & # 34 ; formula & # 34 ; stuff , only you do n't have to go to the dealer to get it . I firmly believe this makes my bike run better and it has been proven to run Harley 's cooler . I run my bike hard in the Texas heat and conventional oils would break down and turn black after only ~1,200 miles or so ; I wo n't make that mistake again as I wo n't have that problem with Mobil 1 . I also use this as my primary fluid on the Sporty . Simply drain the primary oil and drop in a quary of Mobil 1 and you 're back out riding with superior protection.KEEP IN MIND THAT A CASE OF THESE MAY COST MORE THAN ORDERING INDIVIDUAL BOTTLES SO CHECK BOTH PRICES BEFORE BUYING	1
I have used Mobil 1 on all my vehicle 's for years and after buying a new to me , HD 2010 ultra Limited was pleased to see the they also made the V-twin moil 1 for it . I call them to ask what makes this a better product than the OEM oil that HD sell 's and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled HD engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements . I believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike .	1
20W50 should really protect my bike and I love Mobil 1 oil for my cars , so this worked out fine ... price was n't even that bad	1
After a few cycles using the HD SYN3 oil , I decided to change my own oil and use this Mobil 1 in the engine . Having never been satisfied with the `` just after the oil change feeling '' with SYN3 , there was a noticeable improvement in engine smoothness and reduction in engine noise during the next 2,500 miles I kept this oil in the bike . These are things you notice when you become connected to your bike , as you fellow bikers know . I have used Mobil 1 since because of this experience and because I can get it from Amazon cheap . It 's probably not as good as AIMSOIL , but it 's very good and I 'm confident it 's doing a great job .	1
I bought this only to use the pump and it is great . I like it that the pump shows you the air pressure at the same time that you are putting air in the tire .	1
What can I say , simple & quick flat repair especially for my motorcycle . Rode 2100 miles after pulling a nail out before getting internal patch put on , never ever leaked one pound of air the entire trip with this Slime in it ! ! It would have been a long hard push to a safe spot and waiting for a tow truck then finding a MC shop to repair the tire if not for Slime kit . A serious MUST have !	1
Our BMW came with run-flat tires and no room for a spare . Those run flats were noisier , wore out faster , and rode rougher than the non-run flat version of the same tire . They were also much more expensive . We swapped to those non-run-flat tires but worried about finding a roofing nail or bad pothole in the road one day and regretting it.Thanks to this kit we no longer have to worry . I 've used slime in other cars before an it outperforms fix-a-flat easily . Its a little harder to put in than the competitor but you can keep this in your car year-round and you could n't do that with an aerosol can.This kit can help provide peace of mind for you whether you keep it in your car , your spouse 's car , your kid 's car , or wherever .	1
Just bought one today . Tested it and it works fine.Pros : Gauge is fairly accurate ( better one so far ) Not bad overall build quality , slightly beefier than the other cheap ones i 've seenThe tire valve plug seals very well and comes off just as easily - GREAT ! The cables wrap around the case and fits snugly inside the compressor neatlyNice compact sizeNice carry case.Cons : Loud as hellLifespan : unknown yetConclusion : not bad for a cheap compressor . If you are looking a cheap decent compressor this is it .	1
My experience with Slime has been limited to bicycle tires , where the product does a good job sealing up pinhole and other small punctures in the tire tube . I have never used Slime in an automobile tire , but since the materials are basically the same , I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile , where the flat occurs makes a big difference . If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat , this kit would probably be quite useful . You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is . If it is a fast leak , you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem . The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven , the problem is more serious . When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat , most times you will do heavy duty damage , or tear the tire . If that happens , Slime wo n't help . The tire will need to be replaced . The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch . So basically , Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal . It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime , and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet . According to the label , a 16 ounce bottle , should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire . The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars . Subtract this cost from the price of the kit , and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars , which is not a bad deal . The compressor has a pressure valve , ten foot cord , and on/off switch . It is pretty noisy , and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate . It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit . Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps , so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair . Based on the good ( though limited ) experience I have with Slime , I thought it would be good to have around , just in case . There are many situations , where changing a tire at the side of the road , can be hazardous . A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of , jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire . It does not take a mechanical genius to follow the directions .	1
I am still searching for the best black car wax , but this is pretty good . I can not give it five stars though . I would probably rate it at 3.5 stars . I am toying with the idea of using Carbon Zymol but it seems very expensive at $ 50 - $ 70 . I have used this Turtle Wax product on our 2 year old Black Nissan Altima . I love the shiny jet black color , but it is a very unforgiving paint color , as every single chip , scratch , swirl , defect will show , not to mention water spots right after rinsing the car , prior to drying it off . The only thing that I can do is to take it to the car wash and let them wash it so that there are no spots . Our water is just too hard to wash it at home unless you have a white car or silver . Take it home after the wash and clay bar the sucker ( Meguiars makes the best clay bar kit ) . Then you can use their ultimate compound to make it even smoother or visa-versa . If you do use the Ultimate compound be prepared that it will remove any old wax or dye that may be hiding the small scratches . Then you can use a nice car wax . Meguiars NXT 2.0 is good ( no I do n't work for Meguiars , they just make excellent products ) . This Turtle wax product does hide a few small scratches and the chip stick works pretty good . The shine is not fantastic , but it is pretty good , and it is inexpensive . I am going to try a black crayon next , instead of the chip stick , just to see if it works as well . I bet it will . The chip stick works best in the full sun by the way . Be prepared to get your hands a little blackened and your microfiber cloths blackened as well . They will still work after a good wash , so you do not have to throw them away . Still searching ... .	1
I have a '97 S/C Cobra I use as a daily driver . This stuff works great for getting rid of small imperfections and keeping the car `` Black '' . Does n't work for bigger scratches or chips tho ... .	1
I have an 11 year old chevy pickup which we use on the ranch and the finish on the truck gets abused on a regular basis . I waxed the truck a couple of months ago and the rain water still beads and the dirt easily comes off now when I wash the truck .	1
I use this regularly and have been for quite some time . Keeps everything running smooth !	1
Listen folks google Ethanol Damage and see what is going on these days . Our engines are being burnt up due to the ethanol in our gas . You have to use something to help with the drying effect of ethanol . I use a couple things , MMO Techron and this product . Techron is a great cleaner , but does not help lubricate the upper cylinder and this product does . MMO is like between the two products , a decent cleaner and a decent lube . Lucas Upper Cylinder is the `` Lube '' only , even though it says cleaner it is not . The `` cleaner '' is a product they use in oil that cleans , but not in the sense as you know what a cleaner is . The cleaner in MMO and Techron are flat out solvents which are very good cleaners . This product has no solvent , and the cleaner is an additive that cleans similar to what calcium does for engine oil . Whether or not you `` feel '' a difference has nothing to do with your cylinders needing this lube to protect your engine . I actually do feel a difference sometimes in various vehicles , and also I have not felt a difference in others . Some day your engine will be burnt out and you will have wished that you used an upper cylinder lube . Gas has a natural oil lubrication , ethanol does not , and that is why you need to add extra lubricating oil to it . 26 bucks a gallon with free shipping is a no brainier , a gallon lasts me over a year . I buy a small 4 ounce version from the auto parts store and use that to refill with my gallon . The gallon gives you 32 gas tanks worth of treatment.I actually do n't like Lucas 's product line . Their oil products are junk if you ask me . But this product is the real deal , and whether or not you buy Lucas or another Upper Cylinder Lube , your engine needs these types of products to minimize the damage that ethanol is currently doing to it . Use a cleaner like Techron once every 4 tanks and use a lube in every tank . I 've seen newer engines with 25k miles on them that look like burnt out engines that are 40 years old . THIS IS NO JOKE , THE U.S. GOV'T IS GIVING US THE SHAFT BY FORCING US TO BURN ETHANOL IN OUR GAS .	1
These 'miracle-in-a-bottle ' things can get reviews from all over the place , both positive and negative , so I do n't want to join the extreme voices here . My experience is based on necessity since the winter fuel here in the northwest is so lousy that all of our vehicles start rough and burn hard . The awful performance is most obviously when you need to suddenly accelerate hard and the vehicle misfires or stutters.So I tried a couple bottles of this Lucas fuel stuff in two or our rigs and the main thing I noticed was that things are smoother , as you 'd expect in normal circumstances . Now I bought the gallon version and am refilling these smaller bottles and using it full time ( pencils out to be about a buck a treatment doing it this way ) and it 's been about five tanks . Definitely smoother but not noticing any savings in the miles per gallon department yet . Perhaps on long trips where it 's mostly freeway mileage ? Do n't know and really do n't care . The injectors are clear and things are as they should be.Not a miracle , just maintenance ...	1
geat stuff i use it ones in a whie , really helps to clean the system , to be honest i do not notice the effect but the car run really smoth like brand new so cant be better	1
I had K & N ; filters before on BMW cars in the early 2000s , despite all sorts of warnings about it can damage mass air flow ( MAF ) meter . Love them because they do give that extra-something to the engine during acceleration.K & N ; now assures public that its tests were accepted by major car manufacturers , and that it will not void any warranty by the dealer service centers . That obviously speaks volumes . I got this for a recent model Sienna V6 and it fits fine . Look forward to save money over the lifetime while increase engine performance a bit .	1
I have installed this on each of my cars and my motor cycle . I 'm not sure exactly what & # 34 ; extra power & # 34 ; it gives me , but I am sure that cleaning and reusing this is better than throwing a disposable away . Cheaper also	1
I immediately noticed a change in performance . The old filter was dirty and replacing with this one gives my Camry more power and acceleration .	1
This is my third K & N ; filter that I had purchased . When Amazon had a sale , I immediately bought a third for my 05 Camry . I also have filters for my 2007 Highlander and 1997 Chevy G3500 . They all have given me smoother acceleration and a 10 % increase in fuel economy . I went from 19-20MPG to 22-23MPG . It 's only a couple MPG , but it really adds up in the long run . I was n't expecting massive gains , because as other reviewers have said , if these filters gave significant increases in MPG , all the Car manufacturers would be installing these as standard or creating their own versions.As for the horsepower increase claim , I would only know if I put the car on a Dyno , so I ca n't say if there 's a difference.Overall , worth the buy if you do n't want to keep buying new disposable filters .	1
Well I purchased these to save me money in replacement costs and the promise of saving some gas also , no issues	1
What more can I say ; it 's a K & N . I do n't know about gas mileage and horsepower but I do know that I spend less money on air filters and my car and low-pressure turbo breathes better .	1
This filter is cheaper over the long run that buying replacement paper filters . You will also enjoy better filtering and more airflow with this unit .	1
No directions and I was confused which side to put it in . Google it I guess . However no issues . I did not look to see if there was any gas improvements .	1
This is actually my second K & N ; filter purchase for the same vehicle . I find it easier to have two so I can quickly swap them out and have the car ready to go while I wash , clean and more importantly let dry the other filter . I 've never had any issues with this filter , been using it on my 08 Toyota Highlander V6 for over 50k miles so far . I have cleaned the MAF twice as part of my routine maintenance procedure using CRC Mass Air Flow Cleaner . The stuff works like a charm . Use this filter on the 08 Highlander 3.5 V6 with confidence , just my opinion of course ! Note : this is a tight fit for the my vehicle , so please make sure you have some patience . Tip : Disconnect the main intake hose first ( loosen the collar with a 10mm socket ) . and then remove all of the mini vacuum hoses and then loosen the two 10mm lid screws . The whole top should come free .	1
The fact that you do n't have to buy any more air filters is why all my cars have K & N filters .	1
Great product . Just to confirm its quality I asked a very well known detail shop what they use and it was Lexol	1
The Lexol cleaner works just as claimed . I used it on a small , out of the way patch before doing all the seats in our vehicle .	1
I have been using Lexol Cleaner and Conditioner on my cars , trucks and leather furniture for years . It preserves the leather perfectly and I highly recommend it to any who is looking for leather cleaner . I recommend getting the conditioner as well . I will buy this product again .	1
I needed this cleaner for my leather couches . These are big couches , a lot of surface area to clean . Prior to that , I was n't getting the leather clean all the time using just a damp cloth.While I do n't enjoy cleaning , I did n't mind too much using this Lexol product . This is a very mild product that you do n't have to be careful about in terms of breathing or getting it on your clothes . With a little scrubbing action , like circular movements , it foams up a bit and the leather gets cleaned . It really works.I 've used the Lexol leather conditioner for awhile . That one is not as easy to work with because you have to buff your leather , and you 'll want to ventilate the room while using a lot of it as I do . But the Lexol leather cleaner is mild and easy to use .	1
Easy to apply , easy to use . Moisten the surface to be cleaned lightly with a bit of water spray , then pour some Lexol cleaner on your hands . Do n't worry , it 's safe ( as are most leather cleaning products . Remember , leather is basically skin ) . Rub it in everywhere , then use a soft brush to agitate the surface . Use a wet cloth to wipe the Lexol off . Bam ! Clean as can be . You might be surprised how dirty your chair can get when you see the colour of the Lexol foam after scrubbing . Make sure you apply leather conditioner/oil after cleaning to maintain the leather itself . This product is only the cleaner side of things .	1
Works great . Even used it on a very old pair of leather shoes I had given up on . Did a great job of cleaning them .	1
Tried using meguiars in the past with mediocre results . Switched to Lexol to clean the leather in an SL550 , made the leather look brand new . Finished the leather cleaning with the Lexol conditioner as lexol suggests .	1
As with all lexol products ... excellant quality and serves my needs extremely well . I highly recommend all of lexol products .	1
I purchased this because our 16 year old and 9 year old cars both have leather interiors , and , ashamedly , I 've never done much with them other than go over them with a `` leather wipe '' .Plus , I have a wallet which I really like , but after 4 years of carrying it , age is showing.The Lexol did well getting everything clean , and it was both easy-to-apply and easy to remove . I can say this size is a little difficult to get just a little on a rag or heavy-duty paper towel . Actually , I found a wet , and I mean wet , not damp , paper towel was the best applicator.A little goes a pretty long way . I see the back seats of both cars on the docket for next weekend , and then , after recovering , I 'll tackle the L-shaped leather sofa . That 'll take a couple of hours , at least , but it 'll look great.Tip : Follow up with Leather Honey . Just go check out the reviews ... they 're not exaggerating .	1
I always use this followed by an application of lexol leather conditioner . I 've also used Blue Magic leather cleaner and conditioner and I found this to be much better . The blue magic stuff generally leaves my leather feeling a bit dry and not slick . I usually apply to leather then leave it to sit for 15 minutes before applying leather conditioner . It gets rid of dirt smudges quite well without leaving much of a spot like you see if cleaning with water.I 've also tried this on leather shoes . It helped remove a few minor scuffs ( probably just dirt ) . but bigger scuffs do remain . Should always follow with leather conditioner .	1
Good cleaner , really remove the dirt from my car seats and sofa . 1 star off for the flimsy bottle cap , broke when I try to tighten it harder .	1
I own my own auto detailing business and I use this 80 % of the time to clean the leather before conditioning . The only time that I do not is when the leather is really dirty , in that case I will use APC to clean the leather . But most of the time this works perfect . Make sure to use the conditioner after for perfect leather .	1
I 'm not a professional and I have n't spent a lot of time detailing my car , but I did some research and wanted to get the best feel and look for my car and tried this product . I 've heard everyone talk about the clay and I really do n't know the difference , but that may be simply that I am new to detailing my car . Anyway , it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass . I can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds ! And it was fun ! I took the time and did my car in less than an hour and it 's look great ever since .	1
This will definitely be on my to do list when I wash/wax my car . Even though I cleaned and rinsed my car , the clay picked up other surface impurities missed earlier . The resulting smooth surface allowed me to have a mirror like finish to the car . It was fast and easy to do .	1
If you have not used a clay bar , I can tell you that it really does work and it is extremely easy to use . Do not be afraid to complete a few extra passes with it . This is actually step 3 out of 4 steps . The first is to wash your car , then polish it , then clay bar the car , then use Megiuars Tech 2.0 polymer sealer . The clay bar step is actually effortless . You just have to remember not to drop the clay , and do extra passes/wipes , a small section ( 12 & # 34 ; x 12 & # 34 ; ) at a time . The last few passes with the clay bar you can use the weight of the clay itself . One reviewer wrote that this was too mild and it did not remove a lot of contaminants . This is because he may be missing the & # 34 ; polishing step & # 34 ; . The & # 34 ; contaminants & # 34 ; should come off with the washing and polishing . The clay bar is for removing fine contaminants . Your paint will be very smooth and silky . That is no joke either ; it really feels smooth . The car will then be ready for a polymer-sealant or a wax if you prefer.In Summary : Step 1 Wash your car with Megiuars Gold Class ( better than the stinky yellow hazy Meguiars Ultimate Wash ) . Step 2 - Polish it with either of the following depending on the contaminants . Feel the paint . Is there a lot of grittiness ? Then you may want to use Megiuars medium/fine cut cleaner . The medium cut cleaner will remove some heavy duty water spots that you just can not get out with anything else . If you do use the & # 34 ; medium cut cleaner & # 34 ; , then you may want to use a & # 34 ; swirl remover & # 34 ; after this step . If your paint feels all right ( a small amount of grittiness ) , then a normal & # 34 ; polish & # 34 ; ( Megiuars Ultimate Compound is great ) will work just fine . Helpful hint . Purchase an inexpensive sponge , not a real loop sponge , one of those large smooth cheapy sponges for $ 1.75 . If you use a round hand applicator , you may obtain a zebra stripe pattern . The zebra pattern means that the product is working , but your fingers are smashing down more than the applicator portion in between your fingers . You need an even pressure and your large cheapy sponge will achieve that . I also tried a large circular sponge applicator for my drill and that actually worked very well and it saved my arm a bit too . The circular applicator for my drill achieved the best results . I had major hard water spot damage that I just could not get out . Always remember that even though the paint appears very good after this step has been completed , do not stop at this step . There is no protection and your paint needs it since you just removed the protection . Step 3 - Clay Bar your car - use this kit or & # 34 ; Mothers & # 34 ; , although since I am writing a review in Megiuars product , use it . It works very well . Follow the directions . Use medium to light pressure . The last pass can be the weight of your clay and hand . I usually use 10-12 passes . Do not be afraid to make extra passes . The clay is really non-abrasive , and almost effortless to use . Complete the entire car . Do not drop the clay . If you do drop it there may be some grit hiding in the clay and you will scratch the heck out of your paint . I have used it after I dropped it , but it is a hassle removing the top layer of the clay that dropped . Step 4 - Waxing time - There are many many decisions to be made on this step . The different types of wax and sealants , paste wax , liquid wax will confuse even the most experienced car enthusiast . Do you enjoy waxing your vehicle every other week or once a month ? Then a very good quality Carnuba wax will work for you . Do you want the shine to last for 90 days or so ? The poly-sealant is right for you . Do you want to use a & # 34 ; paste wax & # 34 ; and enjoy a good workout for your biceps and triceps ? Then a good paste wax is good for you . For me I want the shine to last for 90 days with minimal amount of effort to apply and remove . This is why I use Megiuars Tech 2.0 Wax which is technically not a wax at all , it is a synthetic polymer that shines very well . It will also last about 3 times longer than the carnuba wax and it is very easy to apply and remove . If you absolutely hate waxing your car and you do not mind the wonderful chemical smell , the once a year Nu Finish is actually a very good deal . It may not last a full year , but i tell you what , it is really close to it . I have used it and it works very well . It is also about $ 7 - $ 8 a can . Be sure to seal it up after you use it though , as it will age if you do not seal it up . But boy does it stink ! ! ! Have fun it is a great hobby ! !	1
Meguiar 's Clay kit took the bugs ground into the front of my 2011 GMC Terrain without marring the surface . Very solid product .	1
I clayed the SUV in just several hours ! This kit comes complete with the spray , 2 clay bars , and a microfiber cloth . Just wash the car well and start claying . You will be very happy with the difference your car feels after you clay !	1
I think meguiars is the best product for the price on the market today , you cant go wrong with all of the items they sell just read the directions first .	1
This is a nice kit for a beginner like myself who wants to get all of the sap and tar off the finish of my car . I had an issue with my order though . I was missing one of the bars . Amazon refunded me though they always come through ! That is why i love ordering from Amazon.Although this product works great , it is time consuming as is any clay bar on a car .	1
Alright first off i want to start by sayiing there is plenty of clay in this kit to clay multiple cars . All of the reviews claiming the amount of clay in this kit is not enough are crazy.I use nothing but Meguiars products for detailing vehicles whether they are my own or for someone else . Everything i have used from this company leaves great results with the right technique.Claying a vehicle cleans and removes any kind of bonded contaminants from the paint on your vehicle . This process greatly inproves the results you get from polishing and waxing your vhicle . it allows the wax to do its job and protect the paint . I just finished detailing a 2002 Mustang GT and a 2010 Camaro RS , both yellow in color . after claying the vehicles the paint was very smooth , applied my polish , Meguiar 's Ultimate Polish - 16 oz.and followed with wax , Meguiar 's Ultimate Liquid Wax - 16 oz.and on the Camaro i gave Megs yellow wax a try instead of the ultimate wax.Meguiars Hi-Tech Yellow Wax 16 ouncesboth waxes performed great and left the cars looking great ! everything was applied using Megs DA poolisherMeguiar 's Professional Dual Action PolisherClaying is a must when trying to get a great show car paint finish !	1
Claying your car is a very important step nowadays . There is so much pollution in the air and it sits on the paint surface and often gets ground into the paint . My car was brand new , but it sat on the car lot front line , next to a major Highway and major feeder street , so it had quite a bit of particles on it . You could not see it , but you could feel it . I used the clay kit by Meguiar 's to remove all of the particles before I waxed my car . The surface , after claying , was absolutely smooth and the wax went on easily .	1
Pretty good deal for a clay bar . The microfiber towel is a good size too and the kit is cheaper than other setups I 've seen . It does what it 's suppose to with regards to prepping the surface for compound/polish/wax or really whatever you end up applying . Do n't drop the clay though it sticks to everything . Sadly the kit probably is only good for 2 applications but I doubt you 'll see any greater options for cheaper .	1
Started this on a silver car with a pretty good finish.When done , the finish looked better and felt much smoother.Great way to prep for the wax job .	1
I keep my car in Showroom condition , and this Clay bar is a major reason I can keep it that way.Pros : Easy to useProduces a mirror like finish every timeNecessary before applying a base waxKit is inexpensiveClay bar caseRemoves paint over sprayConsI wish the clay bar was larger so it was easier to hold.SummaryProfessional detailed mirror finish . A must buy for people that want to keep their car looking it 's best .	1
If you have never used a clay bar on your car - buy this kit . You will be amazed at the results .	1
When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass , I found this clay kit . Works wonders , especially on weathered finishes . Test your paint surface for roughness ( everyone 's has some ) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint . If it feels rough , which it should , then Meguiar 's Clay Detailer is the cure ! Using the spray as a lubricant , the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which can not be removed by washing alone ( tar , etc. ) . I love it !	1
I was expecting more clay but I guess for the price it is okay . I have had to park my new car under trees and the paint has gotten all sorts of specs and things that appear to be imbedded in it . I hope this product works ; I have not had the time to try it out yet but only expect the best from Meguiars .	1
this product did smooth out my hood pretty well . Not quite the results I expected but it was still a big improvement . Very easy to use/apply etc .	1
This is the only clay bar kit I 've used , so I ca n't compare it to others , but based on the results , all I can say is `` Holy Cow '' ! I 've been washing and waxing my cars for 20 years , usually using a 3-step system ( cleaner , polish , wax ) , and I usually get pretty decent results . But I 've heard so much about claying , I had to give it a try , and I 'm glad I did.On my 2006 Honda Pilot with 100K+ miles , I washed and clayed first and was amazed at how much smoother the paint was . I then tested a panel with Meguairs ' Ultimate Cleaning Compound , and it did make an improvement , so I `` cleaned '' the car , then polished ( Ultimate Polish ) and waxed ( Ultimate Wax ) , using an orbital polisher . It took a few hours , but the results are astounding . The paint is literally ( not figuratively ) smooth as glass . I do n't think it even felt like this when it was brand new . The mirror finish is incredible.So if you 've never clayed your car before , do n't hesitate . Just be sure to use lots of the included Quick Detailer for lubricant.I found the Meguiar 's kit to be very good . I broke off about 1/3 of the clay bar and that got me through half the car , then I used another 1/3 for the rest ( including the windows ) . So assuming that was the proper amount , I should be able to do 3 cars with the 2 bars in this kit . Watch a few of the YouTube videos showing how to clay ( including `` folding '' the clay when it becomes dirty ) so you know exactly what to do .	1
While researching which wax to buy , I found out about clay kits . I 'd never used them before . What a difference in the finish . I 'm amazed .	1
This kit was easy to use . Removed years of neglect on my newly acquired truck . Removed a great deal of contaminents from the paint .	1
It is easy to apply . It makes my car look really nice and fun . I love it and recommend it	1
Never did this type of detailing to my cars before and was introduced to it by a friend.After getting the hang of using a clay bar on vehicle it is a truly impressive thing to see as it strips off all the junk our cars seem to accumulate over time and gets off the stuff that harms paint and makes it both LOOK and FEEL horrible ! For the money both this kit and the Mothers are a great deal and even though it only has 2 clay bars there is plenty to get the job done on a few cars for sure ! You should definetly get a refill bottle of the detail spray since it needs to be applied liberally when doing the clay bar process . Having a gallon jub handy is good to do since you cant let this stuff dry out during the job ! Cant say enough about this system of cleaning your car off from all the oxidation and grime that builds up over the years !	1
After the initial car wash , use the quick detailer ( spray a lot ) and the clay bar to remove the stains or bird droppings that would n't come off with the car was alone . This is my first time using this and it is amazing . It leaves your car feeling very smooth too , and it even has a pleasant smell !	1
I have never had a car I cared enough about to clay before , but now I do , I purchased this kit , and I 've liked it.Other reviews go into more detail - No complaints from me , I 'd buy this again ...	1
I had used another brand up to this point and the clay would consistently fall apart on me . The Meguiar 's clay held together and I was able to use way less on my car . The QD spray is a perfect lubricant to use with the clay and it smells good .	1
So many people who clean their own cars never clay ( most never heard of it ) . It 's so simple to do , just once every few months do a clay of your car . This kit is great , because it includes a bottle of Quik Detailer . You spray the Quik Detailer , rub the clay , and *bam* watch your car shine.If you want to save money , you could just buy the clay seperately and use some sort of liquid . Clay does require a liquid application in order to work . But if you just want to save hassle and get it all in one shot , do this . Then you can figure out how to save money after you 've got the hang of claying .	1
I wondered about whether I really should use this . It is extra work , my car is always protected . Well , guess what ? Some areas ( protected from the wind ) hardly changed the color of the clay . Others , like leading edges ... wow ! I also found a couple of old bug deposits and this scrubbed them clean ( with a little help from a fingernail ) and smooth . I ca n't believe what it did ! So then I used Meguiar 's wax , and my car is like a NEW CAR ! I could not believe what it did to that paint ! It looks better than when I bought it . It was new , but in its second year as a loss leader . ( A red little WRX hotrod ! Long story sort , I wanted a red cute car , and did n't know I bought a hotrod until much later . ) Anyway , it is AWESOME now ! The mirrors had started to lose their red most of all , and now they are as deep as the rest of it . LOVE it , and the extra time is very worth it . It does n't even take all that long to use , either . Spray , scrub , wipe , and then wax it . Love their wax , too .	1
Do what as it says and you 'll get the results you wanted . do n't expect it to remove heavy sapping or years neglected birds dropping on the paint . otherwise , this kit will ready your car for polsihing or waxing	1
This clay bar kit makes keeping my car surface smooth . This one time I parked under a tree and tree sap flew all over my car . made my car feel ugly . I just rubbed the clay over my car after washing and it was smooth again.The clay works well , but it requires a lot of effort.Do n't have to use the detail spray if you run out , i 've been using water and it still picks up the contaminants .	1
I like this and the Mother 's kit.It did a great job on one of my cars , clay bar is pretty small , therefore the 4/5 stars ... Clay is pretty mild compared to the Mother 's kit clay bar.The Meguiar 's kit did come with a cleaner wax sample bottle ... I have not used this sample yet , but from what i heard , is pretty effective in removing anything the `` mild '' Meguiars clay can not remove.It comes with a nice microfiber cloth & a case for the clay.The bottle of detail spray was not enough ... but since it was my 1st time using a clay kit , I assume I used too much ? I highly recommend this kit on what you get , just wish the clay bars were as big as the Mothers kit , but since the Mothers did not come with a case or cleaner wax sample ... .I guess it depends on what you value more ? Meguiars kit : smaller clay barsclaybar casedetail spraycleaner wax sample bottlebigger microfiber clothMothers Kit : larger clay bars ( almost twice as much as the Megs kit ) detail sprayslightly smaller microfiber clothAgain , i like both kits	1
Did a nice job though the clay was a bit too tacky which required more of the spray lubricant to be applied . Car looks and feels new again .	1
I bought this clay kit because i had used the mothers clay kit before and i wanted to try this one . It is very good the only thing that make this product not make me want to buy it again is that the microfiber towel that came with it is not as soft as the one in the mothers clay kit it is a bit bigger but not as soft .	1
It is what it is . I have tried a few different brands and have yet to discern a difference . I buy whatever is cheapest at the time . This worked well while I had it . I did notice it sticks a bit more than some others I have tried . Not enough for me to avoid it in the future if it is on sale .	1
When I first read about claying your vehicles , several years ago , I was a bit skeptical . It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car , but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash , Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step . Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint 's surface : bits of overspray , tar , etc . and lots of other things you can or more likely ca n't even see . After washing your car , rub your flat hand across the surface . It wo n't smooth as glass . Furthermore , listen ! You 'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants . This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed . Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants . Furthermore , once clayed , it 's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year , depending on the environment your car is in . Honestly , claying your vehicle does n't take a particularly long amount of time . I 'd say it 's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar 's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle . Again , after washing your vehicle , spray an area with the Quick Detailer , and then use the clay bar across the surface . You can search Youtube for Meguiar 's Clay kit , to see demonstrations from users , but it is n't hard to do . Do a thorough job on your vehicle , and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you . I 'm amazed every time.After claying , you have several options . The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax , and you can certainly use that . It has some mild cleaners and some protection . However , if you use a cleaner wax , I 'd recommend waxing the car more often as it is n't quite as durable as dedicated separate products . Once a month for example with the cleaner wax , would be good . Or , you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar 's Gold Class or NXT 2.0 , and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying , you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar 's for below surface contaminants right after claying , and then optionally a Pure Polish after that . You 'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar 's Gold Class , or Meguiar 's NXT 2.0.Furthermore , pick up more of the Quick Detailer , and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis , and you can actually find you wo n't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose , regular maintenance of your car 's finish will keep you smiling for years to come . Meguiar 's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass , but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface , providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product . Highly recommended .	1
Never clayed befor , but seemed to work decent enough ... I used the spray that comes with it as the lubricant , and all went well ... I never noticed the gritty feel to the car before , but once you know about it , and use this , you 'll understand ... makes it smooth like glass !	1
If you have never used a clay bar to remove contaminents , this is the one to try . It works exactly as advertised .	1
It comes with 2 100gram bar . Based on some reviews , I cut each into 4 pieces . It works pretty well . It is not sticky . The solution smells good . I am little bit concerned when the liquid runs out . Somebody point out that you can use Dawn dish liquid ( 1oz per 32 oz of water ) would do the good lubricated job .	1
Great clay bar kit that anyone can use , includes two large clay bars , microfiber towel , and clay lube spray .	1
Worked well for me , hard to apply - after work is done get ready to spend even more time cleaning your car from CLAY . But overall - it worked , ca n't complain . Removed contaminants very good and price is fair . ( See my other reviews of Meguiar 's products . ) Recommended .	1
great compressor..was afraid if i used it 1 hr to inflate 4 large tires it would burn out..but no..it seems to be well built for china made..and u cant beat the cost	1
I needed an air compressor for my Polaris Rzr . This one is compact and does n't take up much room . Works off a cigarrette 12v plug or alligator clips to a battery . Works well and is a necessity if you 're trail riding and get a flat .	1
This is a pretty simple , cheap compressor . As others have said , you can take it out of the housing and turn it into a compact compressor that you can store easily . Especially useful for motorcycles . Do n't try to use it on the battery without turning on the engine though . You might end up draining your battery.I attach it to a gauge that has a passthrough valve and can check tire pressure and fill up easily before going out for a ride . Since it 's always best to do the tires before you start riding on them , this works out well for me.Accu Gage Air Check Inflate TiresIs the gauge I use	1
I have owned mine for at least 10 years and have used it quite often during that period . For the price it 's a great value . The only hit is that you will need a gauge to check how much pressure is in your tire . There is a valve attached that allows you to check pressure without removing the air hose from the tire.Once again mine has workked well for a lot of years and it has taken quite a bit of abuse in that time . If you are looking for an occasional use inexpensivve inflator and do not mind using a gauge to check pressure than this one fits the bill.Update : Had to finally purchase a new one . Even though the product posting states the pressure check valve comes with DO NOT BELIEVE IT . The new ones do NOT have it and that brings my rating down on this . Had I known that I would not have purchased it . Not worth returning because I bundled it with something else and got free shipping which they would now charge me . My first bad purchase on here . Bummer !	1
I have been using this product for years and it has never failed me . I now have one in each car for emergency purposes . It is noisybut strong and durable .	1
I have three of these and they all work just fine ! I keep them in the trunk of my cars with a tire repair kit ! They are a little noisy and rattles around a bit when inflating , but it does the job !	1
No complaints . The thing does jump around a bit and scoot across the ground/floor whenever you are using it but it works and has worked for me for 10 or 12 tire top-offs now w/no issues .	1
This duster is very handy to clean up your car or truck . It is a fairly large wand that has treated fibers that attract and hold the dust so you can quickly clean your dash , seats and any surface in your vehicle . Dust sticks to the fibers so you are not just stirring up the dust you are collecting it.I like it because I do n't have to spray any cleaner and wipe it all up . This is much faster . They say you should not wash it as it will remove the treatment from the fibers so I just shake the duster off when I am done . I ca n't stand a dusty dirty car and I want to make it look nice and protect my investment . This duster works quickly and does n't scratch your car 's interior . The tapered and flat dusting wand even reaches into tight spaces like along the front of your dash against the front window.I like mine and use it all the time !	1
Despite the 2 negative reviews , this duster works surprisingly well for me . I have several dusters for picking up dust and this is the best one I have.Pros:1 ) Nice shape , has a sharp tip to go into corners . Easy to hold and does n't cause fatigue because it is light.2 ) Catches a lot of dust . Mine does n't leave any lint behind and I do n't know why the other reviewers ' do . Perhaps they did n't whack out all the lint when it was new.3 ) I have feather like dusters as well and I do n't like those because those handles bend . This one you can run it anywhere and push it in places because the handle does n't bend.In fact , it works so well that I take it out and use it inside the house . Once it picks up enough dust I take it outside and whack it against another similar duster . It is very surprising how much dust flies out.Anyway , my experience is that it has worked well for me and I wished I 'd bought more than one . It works so well that I use it for computer screens as well as blinds and table tops .	1
I use this with my Viair compressor and it makes things much easier . Also great for bypassing the cigarette lighter to charge the battery for many trickle chargers.Only thing I wish was that the clamps opened a little more to fit easier on the terminals/connectors .	1
I bought this for the cig end , so I cut off the alligator clips . The clips seem a bit cheap , but the the cig end seems well made .	1
I got a power plug to power plug style & # 34 ; jumper & # 34 ; device for my daughter , in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies . Since the Prius does n't use the 12V battery to start the motor , she does n't need real jumper cables . However , it 's a keyless ignition , so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug . The battery on the Prius is has small terminals , so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else 's light to her battery .	1
This is put together well . Not sure why I would need it but just in case I want to run an inverter off of a 12 vdc battery then I can	1
I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances . This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery . Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter ( cigarette lighter type ) , so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter .	1
The cord is long enough for my Jeep , but may not be long enough for larger vehicles if used for a tire air compressor ( which is why I bought it ) . Seems to be fine , other then as I said the handles easily fall off . But for the price , it should work fine for occasional use .	1
Very handy to toss in the trunk . Using this will protect your ciggy lighter socket that could get overloaded . Every car should have one . I use it for an air pump and a very powerful camp light.Note , most lighter plugs are limited to around 10 amps by fuse or circuit breaker in addition they have long run of small ( higher resistance ) wire to the jack which 'may ' cause a voltage drop to your equipment.Short of 'hard wiring directly ' this is the next best thing.This has none of that and of course it 's the same as hooking directly to the battery so know what you are doing ( sparks , load , polarity , fingers ) ... You might also want to pick up a heavy duty male to female ciggy plug extension cord ...	1
Got this for use with my tire pump , and this works well ! My pump kept on tripping my 30 amp AC fuse , the pump was approved for 30amp but I could n't get it to work . Using this bypasses the AC fuse and it works . I just wish it was a bit longer .	1
We bought my dad an automatic satellite for his camper , so he would never miss his Twin 's games . The dish needed a 12v power source and this was the cheapest easiest solution for us at the time . He just hooks this to his battery and plugs in the dish , and boom , there is his baseball game . I also bought him a 120v to cigarette converter but he uses this since it is handier .	1
I have used this to power a compressor I used to change my break fluid and to put air in my tires . I love this little gadget . I lost a sleeve on one of the negative ( black ) clips . Still works great but I deducted a star due to the sleeve sliding off . Not a deal breaker by any means.Buy this product . It is very handy .	1
I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute .	1
I got this when I read the reviews about the lighter outlet blowing fuses . I do n't like the clamp quality but they are ok , I can fix anything so if they go bad I will just replace them with better quailty	1
I bought this to work with the Master Flow 1040 air pump . I have one and it never blew my fuse . I have been reading that some vehicles may have lower rated fuses in the Accessory circuit . I tested this by connecting it to the battery and the pump ran just fine .	1
I use this cable with my solar kit and am very happy with the durable construction . I use a small solar panel to charge up my deep cell battery , and then attach these clamps to the positive and negative posts . Voila ; an instant DC power socket.I also use these clamps on my car battery when I want to get the most watt power for electronic devices . When paired with a small USB inverter , I can get the full 140 watts from it , instead of the 100 watts available through my cigarette lighter.The cables are of middle thickness , but are smooth and well constructed . The clamps are secure when attached to battery posts , and easy to remove . The length is a bit on the spare side , but I understand that these cables can not be too long and still provide useful electrical juice . I 'm pleased with this purchase , and plan to order a second one to live inside my car .	1
I bought this to use with a Vivair air compressor that draws about 15A . It will work off some accessory sockets , my bimmer works for instance , but not for very long without the engine running . In my truck , the amp draw is high for the accessory socket and it is only active with the engine running . This is a bit of a pain when you want to check and air up your tires . So I clip this to the battery terminals and I am good to go . The clips are not huge but work fine for me and the construction overall is fine . It is nothing very fancy but it is well worth the modest price IMHO .	1
It looks as if it should work but I have yet to test it so the jury is still out on its overall performance .	1
Bought this to use with an air compressor . I did n't want to risk shorting out a fuse using the compressor in the cigarette lighter in the car .	1
Instant 12v receptacle , not much more I can say about it . the leads are a little scrawny but comparable to similar products .	1
I got this to go along with my 12volt air compressor I got . I 'll carry it in my atv in case I run across any situation that I may need it . It 's heavy duty made so it should n't build up to much heat when in continuous use .	1
I use these to run a 12v air inflater that is 13 amps . and prevent blowing the fuse on the cigarette fuse . works well , heavier wire than others .	1
Nothing special , i just got it and it works . Will post in the future if any problems occur or if it holds up well .	1
Given the reviews , I expected a good quality product , but this item exceeded my expectations . This is not just some piece of junk that will get the job done , I expect it to last . I ordered this to hook up to a 12v tractor battery to supply power to my electronics while camping . I quickly hooked the clamps to my battery , plugged in my phones charger and it began to charge . I plan on putting together a complete set-up with a solar charger and power inverter . I am going to order a few more of these for other uses as they come up .	1
Headline says it all . I use it to pump up a water well pressure tank from a 12 v battery using a small portable air compressor .	1
Does exactly what I had planned . Fairly sturdy item that should perform well for a long time . Not complicated to use .	1
Shopped around and found the best price on Amazon . This is a handy device to have around whether you own a boat or just a car . Well built and can charge anthing that has a 12V adapter..	1
These are well build and durable . Although i cut the alligator clips off the product works great and will last .	1
I sit in my deer blind from dark to dark and texting my buddies and playing games on the cell phone helps alleviate the bordom . Bad thing is , the cell goes dead before dark . I carted a 12 volt ar battery to my blind , hooked the Roadpro to it and now my cell battery never goes dead . Plus , the car battery will keep you charged for a long long time . I do n't keep the phone plugged in , only when it starts going dead I charge it enough to get me by and then charge it at camp for the night .	1
Good to have on hand for emergencies . Small so it does n't take up a lot of space . Worth the price .	1
I have a buick lasabre and we were blowing fuses running laptops and a few other things the cigarette lighter . But as it was n't designed with all the appliances in mind , the built in wiring is light and designed for 7.5A max.Since the battery is under the back seat , I just needed a simple connector that would run into the cabin . This has 12 gage wire and I put a 20A fuse in line and it has worked without problems every since .	1
I was pleasantly surprised to find out it has 14 gauge wiring which should handle most anything required and nice clamps . A very good item for the price I paid .	1
I use it to hook the compressor right up to my battery . The clamps connect well .Three more words	1
Just what I was looking for . Works well and have not had any issues . The quality could be better , but it was also priced right .	1
I have not used this product yet but it arrived on time and well packaged . Appears durable enough . When I do use it in the spring I expect no problems since it is a pretty simple mechanism . Two wires running off clamps should present no problem . I will update after use .	1
The gauge on this wire is only 16gauge and it will not safely power all the items that you may wish to run off your battery .	1
I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery 's voltage . Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car 's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac ( with engine running ) as well . It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery , bypassing the car 's fuses .	1
This gizmo is just what I needed to run my tire inflator directly off the battery to avoid blowing fuses . This does n't seem super heavy duty , but does the job just fine . btw , the compressor runs much faster directly off the battery than from the cigarette lighter.Note , the length of the cord is n't too long so I recommend the cigarette lighter extesion cord .	1
If you know why you need one of these , you wo n't be disappointed . Quality construction and works well . Great buy .	1
I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A , and my 12V socket can only handle 10A . This item is perfect , and small enough to fit in my air compressor 's case . It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle , but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need .	1
After recently purchasing a new motorcycle , I like to be seen . So I purchased these PIAA bulbs and wow , what a differance they make . Although they are claimed to be legal in all states , these babies really light up the night.Now if they last a while , I 'll be completely happy with them . Some other brands seem to wear out quickly . PIAA has the best name in automotive lighting . But right now , I am completely happy with them . I ride during the day with my brights on and use the dims at night . But when I own the road by myself and switch on the high-beams , the night turns into day . You can see it all . I do n't think many hazards will be able to jump out in front of me without me seeing them first . And that in its self is worth everything to me.They were a little more expensive , but as far as I 'm concerned , worth every penney . Still a really good deal .	1
I installed these to replace my stock , yellowish , non-impressive Toyota FJ Cruiser headlamps . You can see the difference in a pic I posted , the drivers side is the PIAA and the passenger side is the stock lamp . The PIAA is visually whiter without the blue look . I have not spent a lot of time with them on dark country roads yet but the initial feeling is that they should be an excellent upgrade . I will post up once I have a few miles on them in the dead of dark ! Update July 2013 . I love these lights and they are still going strong . Excellent white light for dark , dark country road driving . FJ should have come with white lights like this from the factory , they are a great match ! Update October 2013 ... .they are still working GREAT !	1
These bulbs are fantastic ! They are n't `` blue '' at all . Instead they are pure white . If you look at the bulbs when they 're turned on , they give a tiny hint of blue , but the light they emit is completely pure white . They light up the road VERY well and reflect much better off objects than my previous stock halogens . A VERY good buy ! !	1
I always have my headlights on whenever I 'm driving - day or night . I had read these bulbs burn out quickly , but I got a full year before the first one burnt out , leading to this order . That was not really any different than my normal bulb life experience prior to switching to PIAA Xtreme White.During the burnt out time I used a standard bulb . The difference in brightness and visibility was signifcant . These make a difference in helping me see better when night driving .	1
These bulbs work as described . The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues . They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs , but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness .	1
I just made the switch from the traditional sealed beams on my E30 to some Hella H4 's and H1 's so I needed some bulbs that would emit a bright white light since I could do that in the new headlights . I almost went for the generic yellow bulbs that allegedly last longer , but I am so glad I did n't and spent a few extra pennies on these . They are so bright that when I combine them with the high beams which are also the same type of high performance bulbs these are , I can see almost a full mile down the highway at night . The generic sealed beams lit up the road well , but nowhere NEAR as much as these do.And for all of the people complaining and moaning about these high performace bulbs not lasting very long : DO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS OF THE BULB ! ! ! This will allow the oil on your hands to get onto the bulb so when it heats up during operation , it heats it up even more , cracks the bulb , and there you have it . Roasted bulbs . So when you are handling them , I suggest you use rubber gloves and do n't even THINK about touching the glass of the bulbs . Instead , handle the bulbs by the metal endings so you do will not crack the bulbs . Use your heads before you bash a high quality product and undermine its reputation .	1
I bought this because the other lights that put out similar Lumens do n't last as long.Also it was bought to replace the HID that I was very disappointed in because of a 2 bulb system that distorts , and has holes in the light pattern.This light does a great job and I will see if it last as long as the company says .	1
The stock headlight and bulb in my Harley are just okay . I put this bulb in and the light went from `` on the border of '' yellow to very white with a hint of blue . I went down a dark , unlit road the other day and flipped on the brights - WOW ! Be sure your headlight is aimed right , because these things project out much farther than your old standard bulb . We 'll see how long they last on a rumbling Harley with a stiff suspension , but so far I 'd recommend them if you can get them for around $ 50 .	1
These horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns . These are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn . Perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a Big Rig .	1
Like title says I bought them to replace the wimpy locking acknowledgement/alarm horn with this low tone American truck sounding that is also louderThe only downside I can think of , it is considerably larger and I had to cut the factory harness to attach it.I 'm buying a second set for my dads Silverado . His horn just crapped out on himWould give 5 stars if it was louderPS I bought them & # 34 ; used & # 34 ; but were like new . no signs of wear at all . just got a cheaper price	1
There are two horns , not one . One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn ( 400/500Hz ) # 85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts . A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt . They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports . All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns . Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement . You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns , but I chose not to . I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire , 5 inches long . One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect . The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal . Since I used 18 gauge wire , I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly . The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit .	1
I bought this dual horn kit from another outlet , but figured I 'd add my review here . This was purchased for a 2012 Wrangler Unlimited . The stock horn is fairly weak and usually does n't produce a reaction from anyone who has cut me off or drives 15 mph while chatting on their phones.The install was rather tight . I did n't remove the front grill and just worked from the top down , right above the driver-side headlight . I mounted one right to the bracket where the stock horn was , and the other was mounted in a nearby hole where a hood alarm sensor would be located . Since I do n't have a remote start kit , the sensor was absent.I highly recommend that you have some type of magnetic tool to pick up dropped bolts . Unless you remove the grill , you will be dropping things . Also , the kit comes with nothing more than the two horns and 2 ground wires . I had to purchase the mounting bolts/nuts and decided that , rather than splice into the factory wiring , to make a couple of harnesses ( see image ) . I used male blade connectors on one end of ( 2 ) 10 '' , 18 gauge wires , then used splice connectors to attach another 6 '' wire to each of these leads . On all of the ( 4 ) remaining wire ends , I placed female blade connectors . It turned the wiring job into a simple plug-n-play operation , while utilizing the factory hot and ground.The horns are definitely louder and the dual horn tone cuts through like a champ . It does startle people all around me when I lay on it . That was the idea , so I 'm really happy with it . Supposedly , they upgraded 2013 models to a dual horn . Some report that it 's still weaker than this PIAA upgrade . I recommend this horn kit if you want to restore your horn 's functionality .	1
My 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser 's stock horn was , well , pretty pathetic . A single horn that was n't very loud and would easily get lost on the highway - and it 's amazing how many people are unable to see that bright yellow SUV so a horn that works is cruicial to my survival . The PIAA horns dropped in with very little work - the FJ is wired for a second horn , so all you need are a couple of electrical tips , about 3 feet of copper wire , and a 10mm bolt and you can put the pair of these in front of your radiator where they 'll do the most good - most other cars , I suspect , will have similarly easy installations . The difference in volume was immediately noticeable . They 're not train horns , and they wo n't make your ears bleed , but they 're appropriately loud car horns that install easily .	1
Put on 2009 Street Bob . Stickers came off fine . Fits at the A section of the front frame , little hole there . Find a bolt , done . ( Well , that and plug it in ) .	1
Really like this wash. Has a very sweet smell like candy . Truck came out looking great and water sheened right off .	1
I love this car soap , it 's just rather expensive . However , unlike many other car soaps , like Meguiars Gold Class ( which is easy to find locally and less expensive ) , this needs very little to create a lot of suds . This is a very rich soap that clings to the paint while you are washing , helping to protect your finish from dirt and other debris that could scratch . Highly recommend .	1
I previously used a Turtle Wax car wash to wash my vehicle . Decided to pay a little bit more and try this out . Excellent product . It leaves a distinct shine on the vehicle . A couple of my co-workers even asked if I had gotten the car detailed . I paid $ 13 before Amazon dropped the price to $ 10 so I got a little ripped off , but this product is definitely worth the few dollars more you pay over the mainstream brands .	1
I use this in a sprayer with a bit of water for dilution . It smells nice , like bubble gum . : - )	1
I love all of Mothers products . They truly are a good value and product . My car does really look clean after using this , but it is Vermont , so it does n't last long !	1
Here in Texas our cars do n't get that dirty , however this soap does a great job getting what dirt we do get off .	1
Plenty of suds with my soft water . Do n't need to use much , just follow instructions . Mother 's makes nice products IMHO .	1
Before Mothers California Gold , I was using Meguiar 's Gold Class exclusively for my car wash . I thought the Meguiar 's was quite good . It had the best cleaning power and was the least harsh of the car washes that you could get at the auto parts store . After using Mothers , I think I will be switching car wash soaps . This soap actually made it easier for me to dry the car ! As the label states , I was able to achieve a dry , spot-free car with fewer passes of the towel as compared to the Meguiar 's , which took more passes.Make the switch . I know I will .	1
this is a wounderful bottle of washing soap for your car or truck or van or just about anything as it makes the vehicale look better and yet brighter and it shows that you care about your vehicale enough to keep it clean as its a investment and is worth the cash to buy this soap and will give you a shiney and clean look and i highly recommend this soap to everyone and all my friends and employees and family thank you ...	1
This is the best wash Ive found , you need very little to do the job . Try this Iam sure you will like it also !	1
The soap suds well and keeps it 's suds during my entire car wash . It leaves a nice shine and does n't streak much at all .	1
I use this paired with a lambs wool mitt to clean my car every time and it turns out great every time . This stuff will last too because it is super concentrated . The car shines even if I do n't use wax .	1
Does n't take much per bucket , so this will last me quite a while , especially with my tiny smart car.Does a good job cleaning , as others have said , little residue so it rinses well and with a chamois dry , leaves the finish looking very good.And does n't `` funk up '' your washing mitt and other washing accessories as some other products I 've used in the past did .	1
It really does make a difference to use soap that is made for cars . I was using Simple Green before , which was fine , but this stuff cleans the bugs and other sticky stuff right off and leaves the car looking good , with less effort . Nice smell too .	1
Mothers ' products are always top notch . An ounce or so in a 2 gallon bucket and you have all the suds and cleaning power you need for the average wash .	1
I have been using Zip Wax Car Wash for a while now.Last week I decided to switched to Mothers Car Wash ; to be honestI have seen no major difference in the products ; they all do mostly the same job , cleaning grime and dirty from the paint surface without destroying the wax .	1
This is one of the best car washes I 've ever used . What surprised me is how great this stuff smells ! It 's really a nice touch when washing your car to have such a pleasant odor , no joke . But the bottom line is that this does a great job of cleaning the car without anything hazardous to your vehicle . I use this on my Porsche Boxster S and know many other Porsche owners who swear by it for good reason.Cheers	1
I recently put this through the paces on my car.First , I used it with a foam gun just to get the loose dirt off and initial impressions were very nice ! It covered the car with a nice sudsy coating ( not SUPER sudsy , but more than a budget car wash liquid ) and smelled like bubble gum ! However , the suds disappeared quickly , almost TOO quickly . Made me a bit worried . But I moved on to the hand wash.Poured some in a bucket , filled it up with water , and as expected , LOTS of suds , but they seemed to die down very quickly ... After the rinsing off the soap and drying the car though , this is where the car wash liquid REALLY shines ( bad puns are bad ) .In the sun , the paint was deep , reflective , and it just looked CONSIDERABLY cleaner than before . It looked like a whole new depth was added to the paint . Coming fromMeguiar 's Wash and Wax - 48 oz. , this car wash liquid takes the cake in final finish and cleaning ability . However , I think the Meguiar 's takes the trophy home for best smelling ( to me ) , most suds , and longest lasting suds . The Mothers left an awesome finish and kept water spots away when drying , but the bubblegum smell was nearly non-existent and the suds were worrying at first.I would consider Mothers California Gold as a nice start to a full-on DIY detailing job ( or even just a quick , light detailing job ) . It gives a nice base to work off of . It seems to clean dirt off more effectively than Meguiar 's ( tested by clay bar ) and leaves a nice , smooth finish , giving you a bit more peace-of-mind.However , if you are short on time and would rather just give it a quick wash , consider the Meguiar 's . It 'll give you a one-two combo of a wash that 's ever so slightly less shiny and will coat it with a ( very ) light wax.Sum : - Good : Smells like bubble gum , leaves a deep finish ( whole new depth - especially on darker colors ! ) , keeps water spots from forming while drying , cleaning ability is awesome ! - Not-So-Good : Suds are a bit disappointing , scent is n't as defined or noticeable once rinsed off.Recommended !	1
Product does a good job sudsing as any good car wash detergent should . Bonus , has a pleasant smell to it . Would recommend it to any car enthusiast .	1
The smell alone is five stars , smells like bubble gum . But the product works really well too ... it leaves a great shine and I barely put any in the bucket and it produced a lot of suds so this bottle will last me a long time .	1
I got this for my dad as a gift , he loves taking care of his car and he was pleased with it .	1
This vehicle cleaning solution did a nice job . It effectively washed the vehicle ( dried bug guts and all ) , left very few streaks and was easy to rinse off . I see no reason to look elsewhere for another product .	1
Works just like the nearly interchangable Meguiar 's . Top notch stuff , everything it makes . These two the only brands I use .	1
This stuff is expensive and you only get a small amount . Lets face it , 32oz is a medium soda . MOTHERS , please give us a little more for the $ , your product is great though . 4 stars for quality , loses the 5th for the amount you get for the $ .	1
It 's a carwash and a sort of garage/yard freshener . After every carwash my yard and garage smells good so it 's a kinda dual purpose to me . Aside from smell the carwash does it 's job on cleaning my SUV pretty well . My son likes to help me wash the car because of the smell and that is an extra selling point to me :	1
The product works well . I 've used it for years with good results . You do n't need very much , I use 1/4 cup in a five gallon bucket . It cleans the car without stripping the wax , and dries to a streak-free clean .	1
Are you kidding me ... the bubblegum smell is awesome ! When paired with warm water and a decent wash mitt , this product does seem to loosen up dirt and bugs and makes cleaning rather easy.I 've been using this product for years and have n't had any complaints until I left my car inside my warehouse and used the acetylene torch to do some metal cutting . The fallout from the torch stuck to the car like glue and nothing has been able to take it off except for a product called Super Gloss Ultimate.Unfortunately , the Super Gloss Ultimate is extremely hard to find , but for those interested it can be purchased at iShoptogive.com . No , it 's not a car wash soap , it 's a wax .	1
When the grime and break dust on my aluminum wheels gets really thick and hard to remove , that 's when I break out the aluminum wheel wash and mini detail brushes : Meguiar 's G14324 Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Wash - 24 oz. , Mothers Detail Brush Set - 2 Pack.But even these may not restore the shine . For that , I use Mothers Mag & Aluminum Polish . It works great , and it leaves my aluminum wheels looking shiny and like new.I normally use one of my husband 's old ( white ) athletic socks to apply it - by wearing it on my hand like a sock puppet . The instructions say to use the polish sparingly , so I just put a dab on the sock and rub it around . It removes any remaining road grime , brake dust - and water stains , which are sometimes the hardest to clean - fully restoring the finish to its previous luster . The old sock `` hand puppet '' allows me to reach into every nook and cranny . I then use a cheap microfiber wiping cloth to finish the job and remove the polish.I could n't be happier with the results . This is n't something I use every time I wash my car or my wheels . But when I need it - nothing else works quite as well . I highly recommend Mother 's Mag & Aluminum Polish . This jar will probably last you a really long time . Enjoy.p.s . I find it 's sometimes easier and more comfortable to polish my wheels - by taking the tires & wheels off of the car . Gee , is n't that what hubby 's are for ? If he 's in the mood , he does n't seem to mind . This allows me to stand up while I work . Just a suggestion .	1
This polish works very well . Mothers is a great brand and have not had any issues with any of there products . Using this polish is simple and very effective . It will make metals look brand new when you spend the time to get down into the crevices.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a good polish .	1
Just a smidge of this product will turn a once tarnished nasty piece of aluminum into a beautiful shine that you would n't believe . Really you can see your reflection in the surface after polishing it up . Will always purchase Mothers Mag and Al polish	1
Using this for polishing stainless steel pistols as well as internal gun parts . So far , it works great without the usual noxious fumes and stench of some other cleaners .	1
Been looking for something to shine up this ole diamond plate toolbox I bought from craigslist.Tried regular car wax , nothing , Brasso , nothing.Decide to try this & see what happened.Made the box look brand new.Couldnt be happier.Might have to get more to have on hand.Took some pics to show how this stuff worked , but I only see a way to add a video.Thought you used to be to put pics here.Oh well .	1
this is a wounderful polish and cleaner for rimms and wheeles and makes them shine and look good i highly recomend this polish to all my friends and family and customers and now i recomend it to you please try i know you will like it and will continue to use it as we shure do thanks again	1
I use this stuff for all kinds of metals that I need to shine up . Mainly use this on my Ruger Mark III Hunter , it is all stainless steel and this stuff really cleans/polish 's very well , a little goes along way .	1
I used some to polish my kitchen sink . I think the sink is made of galvanized metal and I am not sure if this works on that , because it did n't make it shine anymore than it was . But on the faucets and sprayer , this thing made it like a mirror shine . It was amazing . Definately give this stuff a try , just be sure to test it first . Read the directions carefully .	1
I have 19 '' Aluminum wheels on my BMW . I had the lip refinished a few years ago to fix some curb rash . The refinisher did n't redo the clearcoat , so the wheels eventually got water stains on the refinished rim . This stuff really worked well to clean it up . It takes some elbow grease , but the results are remarkable.Beware , as it says on the package , if your rag does n't turn black , the surface ca n't be polished.I did n't realize how small this 5oz package was though . I used about a quarter of the tub doing four wheels .	1
This is some of the best metal polish paste I 've ever used . Even though it is n't explicitly stated in the description , it does work on other surfaces if care is taken . For example , I polished and buffed the tinted windscreen for a vintage Japanese motorcycle I am restoring . Took off all the dirt and allowed it to be polished and buffed . Looks much better than it previously did . Works on any household metals like tea kettles , stainless steel sinks , silverware , etc . Ca n't go wrong and the price is right .	1
This product works great as advertised . Be sure to constantly change or use a clean cloth.I would recommend it without a doubt .	1
Mothers 5101 Mag & Aluminum Polish Paste - 10 ozWOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My wheels look better 8 years later than they did new.Worked hours polishing and cleaning but ... .. The final product is amazing.Buy this stuff.Recommend the small power ball using this.RagenRat	1
I 've used every kind of wax and polish there is and this Mag and Aluminum Polish works great on wheels . It will add shine and luster to polished aluminum wheels where they have faded or tarnished a bit . I use it by hand but you could use it with a buffer if your wheels are really tarnished.I would not recommend it for highly polished wheels or aluminum , for that I recommend Mother 's Billet Polish . The difference between the two Mother 's polishes is the amount of abrasive and cleaners in each one . If your wheels or aluminum parts are in really good shape , the Billet Polish will give them a mirror finish , the Mag and Aluminum Polish will probably slightly dull the finish . If the wheels or aluminum parts have lost their shine then I would recommend the Mag and Aluminum Polish . There is a big difference between the two but not detailed enough on Mother 's website .	1
This is a brilliant metal polish . My wife even uses it on the candle holders . It will shine up the dullest brass until it literally gleans . Great , great stuff .	1
My new Accord did n't respond well to Windex , the so-called & # 34 ; supreme & # 34 ; glass cleaner . I thought something was wrong with my window , being coated with oil or something . Not the case once I determined Windex = pure junk after trying this Mothers ' glass cleaner . Wow ! What it cleaned perfectly without any streaks at all , even with using cheap paper towels . So if you 're frustrated with poor quality glass cleaning because of Windex or some other junk cleaner , do n't hesitate to click and buy ! It 's rarely in stores by the way .	1
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows . This does the job quite nicely . It is n't how well it does , rather how safely it does it .	1
Here in central New England Windshield attract grime and saltin winter . It is too cold ( 27 ) to use most glass cleaners.This Mothers cleans better than others and is practicallystreak free .	1
I 'm an absolute fan of 90 % of Mother 's products and this glass cleaner is worth the price for removing streaks and that & # 34 ; film & # 34 ; on the inside windshield . Was hoping the price was a little lower since this is only glass cleaner , however , was less than what I 'd pay at the local auto store ( which does n't carry it anyway , so the price is irrelevant I guess ) .	1
Works as advertised , glass turns out very cleaned , almost even reflective at certain lights/angles.The best way to use this is to apply it like a wax - use one towel to spread it around , and a dry towel to & # 34 ; buff & # 34 ; it . It will show if you do n't	1
This cleaner works very well on my auto windows . I have tried many auto window cleaners and so far this is the best . Unfortunately you can not find this product in stores . So , I will buy this on Amazon cause it works .	1
AWESOME PRODUCT as usual from Mothers.This company never lets me down and always has top quality products for my car ... ~ !	1
This works extremely well at removing scratches from instrument cluster plastic . When trying to remove scratches from very soft plastic like an instrument cluster , you need to make sure you are using a soft application method . At first , get a nitrile glove and gently apply the product with your finger . Make sure to not let the product dry as it will be hard to remove . If that does n't work , use a high quality microfiber towel and do n't apply too much pressure . Worked perfectly for me.This also is great at removing scratches from a motorcycle windscreen . I used this on my bike with a Smartwax 70301 foam applicator pad and it remvoed 90 % of the scratches .	1
There are no Mother 's products that I have tried that are not good and do just as advertised.I use this one on the windshield of my two motorcycles .	1
I only use mothers brand for all my Jeep needs . very good plastic polish . if you have a jeep with plastic windows this is the product for your jeep keeps windows clear and scratch free .	1
This is a Very Good product I bought a New 2013 KIA RIO and bugs and Dirt and Grime get on those Plastic Headlights , and Small Scratches . this is a Very Good product I have found that When you clean the plastic with mothers glass cleaner and then buff by hand this stuff into the lenses it helps with the bugs and scratches .	1
Lately , there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound . The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive , scratches , etc ... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint . Paint whatever with metallic paint first , then spray a few layers of clear paint ( gloss ) . Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth . You 'd be happy with the result .	1
with plastic bumpers being the norm , thought I 'd use this plastic polish . It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal .	1
This is a GREAT product ( what is n't from Mothers honestly ? ? ) to buff up and polish plastics . I used this for my upper third brake light for my ranger and it took the dull hazy out of it and made it nice and shiny . Used it also on the plastic on the gauge cluster and it made it nice as well.I would NOT use this to polish the headlights ... get a kit that is DESIGNED for headlight restores , that is a multistep process ... etc . This has minor abrasives but once buffed out leaves the plastic with a nice smooth almost deep finish to it . I 'm sure it has oils to put back into the pores of the plastic.Overall a solid product to bring back some life in dull and worn looking plastic pieces . Plus it does n't break the bank ... Thanks , -Nige	1
Charges without fear of overcharging . Does a great job of maintaining my battery in perfect condition in all conditions . Super compact unit with ample cord length . Highly recommended !	1
I bough this because I have a Honda accord that a track and sits in the garage all winter . I need something to keep my Otpima red top charged and this does the job perfectly ! ! No issues and highly recommend it ! ! !	1
I do not know if this is any better than any other but I have 4 of them and have given several as presents . This works on all types of batteries and even my 2009 BMW motorcycle when BMW says it will not.Good product	1
I am using this device to trickle charge 2 scooters , a Honda & a Yamaha . The quick connectors ( which I have n't installed yet ) are great and will make make this process of switching from one scooter to another much easier . I highly recommend this charger .	1
EXPERIENCE : I have found this charger to be pretty cool ! First of all , it was packaged well from Amazon.com , they like to use the air pocket material for packing , which works great , and is less messy then foam peanuts . The charger comes inside a plastic packaging case with both alligator and permanent wiring connectors . It also comes with a warrantee slip and a paper manual . The first thing I noticed was how light weight the charger is , right around 3-LBS , as opposed to my heavy 8-LBS fast charger counterpart.I really like the cables the charger comes with , the alligator clip ends are made of actual copper , which as you know , allow for better conductivity , which is why copper is used on computer heat sinks to dissipate heat . This particular wire also includes an 7.5-AMP inline fuse , with a cover over it to keep water out . At the other end of the wire uses a proprietary connector system , so that you can disconnect it from the charger incase of emergency , without the need to unplug the charger ! The permanent style wire , uses your typical battery bolt type connectors , which allow you to permanently install the charger , for year round use . This also uses a 7.5-AMP inline fuse , and also uses the proprietary connector at the other end . All I had to do to hook it up was , connect the alligators to the battery , connect the other end to the charger output wire , and then plug in the power , that simple ! The first thing I saw was a steady `` RED '' light , to indicate that the charger was charging the battery . However , since my battery was at 12-volts at the get go , it did n't take long for the charger to start flashing the `` GREEN '' light , which indicates battery at 80 % charged . Remember , a fully charged battery will actually show 13.5 to 14.5 volts . So , it took a while , charging at a 1.2-AMP interval , to get my battery there.TIP : With a lot of modern day vehicles , they have onboard systems which have a low power draw off the battery at all times while the vehicle is sitting . This is unfortunate , as the charger only charges at a 1.2-AMP interval , any onboard systems sucking that amount , will keep the charger from charging your battery . In this particular case , it is best to disconnect your battery from your vehicle.Once my battery was charged , it went into float mode . You know when its in float mode , when the `` RED '' light goes off and the `` GREEN '' light stays on steady . At this point of time , it is not putting a charge on my battery . But it will wait till it drops due to the freezing temperature , and then it will kick back on till its charged again . Think of it like the furnace in your home , the heater comes on when the temperature falls , and turns off when the temperature reaches your set temp setting.CONCLUSION : My fast charger would always be very warm when I used it , but the BTPLUS is only luke warm , you hardly even notice it ! My fast charger also emitted a noticeable loud humming sound , my BTPLUS emits a sound so quiet , that you have to put your ear up to the charger to hear it ! My fast charger has the ability to cook a battery and destroy it , where as the BTPLUS will maintain my battery and make it last a long time . Sometimes people think that speed is everything , I say no , cause when it comes to batteries , slower is better . The way I look at it is , this is an awesome charger , and I recommend it with 5-stars !	1
Have used it to charge my Beemer . Good unit , I believe the OEM BMW unit is also a rebranded Deltran . I fried the first one by plugging it into a 220V outlet and bought a second one with no hesitation .	1
This is Battery Tender 's `` smart '' charger which can be used with the new AGM battery technology - which is exactly why I bought it . It works great and my seasonal sports car ( allergic to ice and snow ) will require fewer batteries now . This is the best product of its type on the market .	1
I tried the Same , model BMW had made for their Parts Department . Even with a discount and the BMW Sticker and a Car Club Discount , Not the Same as the Real Thing . ( Returned it Promptly back to BMW ) Amazon.com comes through again ! The Battery Tender has all the Features for your Car , Bike or Outdoor Equipment ! The Extra Battery Connectors were first to get added to my cart , then the 25 ' Extension . It also has traditional Clamp on Clips for regular jobs . Much More flexible for long term needs of a Car Nut , Motorcycle Nut or anything else that has a Battery ! 12V and Stored most of the time . Perfect to leave in Float Mode and the Battery life will definitely be extended.I am going to wire up everything I own and permanently wire them for a Battery Tender , Even the Generator ! Bought a Battery Tender Bag to keep all of the Accessories , GREAT Engineering and Options ! I will one day own a wall mount to power my entire collection of Toys ! Enjoy ! BatmanDSM	1
I have used Battery Tender chargers for decades now . The product is always well-made and reliable . It can handle any battery and is great for batteries being stored long-term for maintaining a charge . I use it in my garage to keep the motorcycle battery charged during the winter . Highly recommended .	1
Works great ! Had one from Griot 's and it fried 3 batteries before I figured out it was the charger , not the batteries . Bought this one and it	1
The & # 34 ; Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger & # 34 ; is a best buy . It does everything they say it will do . The add for it is not over blown and it did bring my battery back to life . I am really glad I got it ;	1
I bought this for my 1996 Harley and found this to be the best battery tender . It works great and keeps my battery conditioned over a long Pennsylvania winter ! When spring comes my bike 's battery is ready to go . I have owned this product for about 2 years and it is great . It is so simple to use and has the connections necessary to use on different batteries . My uncle ended up buying this exact one for his tractor and trolling motor on his boat . He is also impressed by the quality !	1
I 've had one for years on my Harley FatBoy . I got 7 years out of the HD battery cus this thing is always on the bike when the bike is parked in the garage , a fantastic product , low cost top quality . It keeps the battery in perfect shape , always . It does everything claimed by the mfg . I have even used it in an emergency once for my car battery , where I left something on inside the car all week without realizing , battery was dead , rather then jump and possible cause a problem in the newer cars with damaging all the electronics in the car I put the Deltran on for a couple of hours and it brought the battery back to life to start the car . This tiny thing charged up an Audi A6 battery which is enormous , and it paid for itelf over time by keeping my HD batttery good for 7 years ! ! ! And bike batterys sit around unused a lot more than a car does . Fantastic product , it is teh best out there too , other brand chargers have issues , these do n't . Perfect	1
This is a good little charger.. no bullcrap .. you just plug it in and it kicks butt.. i like it : - )	1
At the time when I bought this I only had once motorcycle . Now I have two and with I bought the one with multiple ends . I would recomend to anyone who want to keep a battery on standby and not be dead when you go to try to start it .	1
I loved the connections that came with this the easy on and off . I use these on many vehicles and usually buy the cheap harbor freight ones . However I spent up for this for my prize motorcycle . I have it plugged into a battery backup for tv equipment . It stopped working and has a burning smell into it . Customer Service said they would replace it if I sent it in . It is 7 months old but was only put in service for the past week as I had so many others . Thbey scared me saying they often find user error . What could I have done ? I could n't treat it better . Because it is under a year they said to send in in at my expense and the turnaround is 7- 10 days if they do n't determine user error . That 's scarey .I still find trusting people is best and I will take the time and expense to send it in though many companies just replace things . I can see why they do not this is n't a cheap piece of equipment . I was very happy for the 7 months ( week it worked ) and I love their quick disconnect plug , sadly I may have lost my battery as it could of broke anytime since it was put in service . I know it was working when first hooked up . Because I value my equipment so much I am going trust this was a fluke and buy a extra one to have as I am disabled and these save batteries on vehicles that rarely are driven . I am a little disappointed I had a failure so quick again it was in the first week of use after I stored my purchase since Jan 2013 . Failures was the reason I stopped using the Harbor Freight $ 6 on sale ones but their so cheap I keep a half a dozen at the house and with any hint of a problem put a new one on . I use these devices on several items and would have to replace about 2 harbor freight ones each year . Also with theirs you do not have that nice disconnect that is so great on snowmobiles , mopeds , or motorcycles . I would even like to have one on the cars and may as they can fit the accessory connectors . I did expect this to be much more trustworthy but will give it one more chance before I give up . Though at up to $ 69 retail that 's a lot of money to loose for burning up a few penny capacitor if Lorreta at Deltran is correct . She said they will go poof if their is any fluctuation in voltage . Nothing else on that circuit or any others had issues at all . It was just placed in service . I will update after sending in . They did not require it verbally when calling in but I will pay the extra money to have it signed for . It helps since it is the first year not to have to pay the $ 8 inspection fee . You can smell it is burnt . Frustrating , I hate electronic devices because they do often have such high failure rates .Note : it took three weeks and I had to be home to sign for the one sent back which caused me to spend a whole day watching for Fedx but they replaced the bad unit . I had a surge suppressor on the other one and have since upgraded it to another Monster unit that was a daily deal . I also have gone with a 14 kw Kohler generator with a whole whose surge protector . The electric grid here is going down several times a year and it does n't look like that is going to turn around anytime soon . With all the sensitive electronics that are becoming necessities it seems like good defense and being ill having no water , heat , toilets etc is too much .	1
I had the 'Jr . ' version of this Battery Tender and for my VT1100 it was n't sufficient to keep the battery at the ready to start ; all it did was prevent battery deterioration and sulfation . The 'Plus ' model does the battery tickling to prevent self-destruction , but it also charges the battery and keeps it at max for me and ready anytime I want to start the bike , including in the cold weather .	1
Charges my Harley Streetglide battery flawlessly . I love that it also has a storage mode on it so that you do not overcharge your battery . For the price it is a must have in your home or shop .	1
I have one Battery Tender Plus and love it , No problems with it . Works Great on the quads and motorcycle , Also put it on my electric start generator . I make a habit of every month to swap it from one unit to the other for a couple of days.Till fully charged . All batteries keep at full charge . Also put it on my pick up and jeep when i do n't drive them much.Also i charge the battery in the trailer . I guess i am to cheap to buy another . But this way i look at the batteries and check.The pick up and Jeep and trailer have big batteries and take a little longer to fully charge . Great unit.A must have and AMAZON has a great price .	1
So , I have both a Battery Tender Plus and a Junior . They 're great devices ; I 've brought batteries seemingly back from the dead with them when some other chargers I had could not . However , there are two points worth making : The Junior and Plus have the same logic ; they only differ in the maximum charging current . Basically , the Plus will charge a battery up faster . If you 're only using them for storage or you 're not in a hurry , save nearly $ 20 and get the Junior . But I expect that you 'll be happy with either one.The one complaint I have is with the Warranty . My Plus stopped working recently . I 'm not sure why ; perhaps a power surge or something ; it 's not like I 've ever dropped or abused it . In any event , since they have a 10 year warranty , I called Deltran up . I can send the unit in ( which will cost me $ 8+ for shipping with some kind of tracking so I can verify that it arrived ) and then they charge $ 17 and change for a `` warranty diagnosic '' and return shipping . So , it basically costs around $ 25 to get my $ 40 device serviced under warranty . It 's not a completely unreasonable sum , but if Deltran really had faith in their products , they could easily eat that cost - I think I should at least not have to pay for a diagnostic fee on something under warranty which I 've already proven to not work in multiple outlets and on multiple batteries . I think I 'll just pay the extra $ 15 to get a brand new one , and use this as a paper weight.But anyway , the products work really well . My advice is just to buy this assuming there 's really no warranty ; as long as that 's your expectation , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Bought this to maintain a VMAX battery to work with an inverter . Seems to be doing it 's job correctly . My spouse has a few of these in the Jr. model , I think.I wanted this plus model , I hate to wait ...	1
This charger is just what is needed for those times when your battery is low or dead and you need to get back in the action.Small but large on help for your AUtomotive Battery . Can be used on any type of Automotive Battery . Even charges and normalizes Deep cycle batteries and wo n't over charge either . A real little Dynamo	1
Very good ! if you do n't have one and you are thinking of getting one , just get it !	1
Bought this to recharge my riding Lawn Mower battery . It has not been run during the winter as my grass is dormant . I tried to start it the other day and it just would not start . It sounded like the battery was getting weak . So I purchased this at a reasonable price and tried it . It charged the battery over night and now it starts just fine . Easy to use . You can leave it attached and after charging the battery , it will switch to the & # 34 ; trickle & # 34 ; mode , keeping the battery charge topped off .	1
A neighbor told me about this - its not a full fledged battery charge , but it offers convenience as I have a number of vehicles that sit idle at times and having a trickle charger without worrying about overcharging is great .	1
This is perfect to keep my battery charged in my dual battery truck that is used seldomit took over 8 hours to load the batteries as I expected not bad for a 1.25a charger	1
I have had motorcycles and cars for years . Keeping the batteries from sulphating is a big problem for other than every day drivers . The technology in the Battery Tender Plus is exactly what I need for the batteries in my classic cars as well as my Harley . I like it so much that I bought Battery Tender Plus units for my two brothers so that they can keep the batteries alive in their motorcycles too ... Great product and I hope to be able to save some bucks not having to replace batteries as often , not to mention that I can hop on my Harley and take off at a moment 's notice ... I plan to use it on my boat marine battery too ... .. I may order the 4-up model to be able to keep multiple batteries alive at the same time ... .	1
Living on a farm I have many pieces of equipment that is not used every day and this unit keeps the batteries topped up so when I need the equipment it is ready to go . Also it keeps my second truck charged up during the winter .	1
Of all the battery chargers on the market , the Battery Tender is the best . The device is small and portable , works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge ( over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery ) . It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use . The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc . or not . Highly recommended . I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review .	1
Does the job it says it does . I connected the quick-connect to my battery in my 2004 Honda Civic LX . I poked the quick-connect through my hood so I do n't have to raise my hood every time I want to change the battery . I pull in the garage ( after driving ) and connect the battery charger with the quick-connect . I let it charge all the time . I rarely drive ; so it helps keep the battery charged .	1
Time will tell , but this battery tender appears to be very well made . The unit is pretty compact and solidly built . I am not a fan of plastic in my garage . It typically indicates to me that the manufacturer is looking to cut costs and maximize profit vs. putting out the highest quality product that they can . This unit has a metal housing.Anyhow , this unit was super easy to set up on my motorcycle and lawnmower . With the leads already installed , I just have to plug it in . The conditioning mode of this tender will go a long ways in increasing the battery life as well.I would certainly recommend this unit !	1
This is the Cadillac of battery chargers . I put my Miata on the charger each winter . Does n't overcharge the battery , does n't dry out the cells , just works perfectly . It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days . At this low amperage it is n't ideal for this , but it will work.This is about $ 50 . A new battery is about $ 100 . Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time ( months ) kills the battery . Do the math and you see you ca n't afford not to have one .	1
Bought this to keep the battery fully charged when I store my mustang for the winter . Does a great job at keeping it charged and if I ever try to turn the car on it starts up right away . With new cars constantly draining the batteries , I think this is a must if your car sits for more than a week .	1
I have one on my motorcycle , and purchased this one to tend my trailer batteries through the winter . I went onto the Battery tender web site to find out how to hook up batteries in parallel so I can charge the 2 Marine deep cycle batteries that power my trailer . It is working great and looking at the diagrams I will be able to hook up my 2 spare trailer batteries in parallel for a total of 4 deep cycle batteries .	1
This is one of the better battery chargers out there . Why ? Because it is temperature compensated . This is important if the battery will be exposed to variations in temperature , either hot or cold . Other brands offer desulfation and remote temperature sensing , which is valuable , but this one can be found cheap , and gives good performance .	1
I got this because my battery kept dying on me . I think I found the source of the problem after I ordered it but this thing will make sure my battery is kept at full charge . It comes with 0-ring terminals and alligator clips . The alligator clips are very easy to put on the terminals . I read somewhere that the 0-rings are for motorcycles and lawn mowers and stuff so I will just keep them for that . Anyways , I used regular jumper cables to give my battery enough juice to start my car . No where in the instructions does it say if the vehicle should be on or off while charging . My best guess was off since it takes almost 2 days for a complete charge and who leaves their car on for that long , and plus you can charge it with the battery out of the car . So anyways , I made that little charge for my battery to get up and running and disconnected the jumper cables . This next part is very important . First you should connect the alligator cables to the quick connect ends on the battery charger . Then put the alligator clips on the car positive/negetive leads . Then if you used an extension cord like I did , plug that into a socket . Now line up the charger end with the extension cord end . Make sure all your connections are well on , and then connect the extension cord to the battery charger . If all goes well , like it did with mine , the red light should come on and say Charging . I read somewhere that if both the green/red lights STAY on , that your battery is completely dead and that you should disconnect the battery right away or it could lead to bad damage . The red/green lights flash at startup but then it turned to red . So anyways , now I am waiting for the complete charge to fill up my battery . It is 3pm now on a Thursday and I will fill in this space with when it completed . Keep in mind the instructions say to keep this charger as far away from the battery as possible while charging . I have mine on the ground right in front of the car so that should work just fine . I would n't recommend putting it inside the engine anywhere like the instructions say . All in all , for the money of this thing , it is definately worth having around . I wish I knew about this when I had my motorcycle , because that thing died on me every other day and the quick connect on this would have made charging that thing a breeze . Also with a riding mower that wo n't start . I might get a socket end for the cord so it can charge while in the car . Other people have said this in their reviews and I will see what it 's all about . Good luck charging ! Edit : So the cigarette adapter just makes hooking it up easier , but it still needs to be connected to a DC outlet so I will pass on that . Also , I found out that the unit gets very very hot . I had it on for like 4 hours and touched it and it almost burned me . Being close to 90 degrees outside could n't have helped much either , but just be careful.Edit : So my battery is fully charged now . It took about a day to charge the whole thing . Not bad for a device of this size to charge a full battery that was dead at once . Very good item , I highly recommend it .	1
This is perfect . It comes with some small alligator clamps and also comes with wires that can be more permanently installed . It charges and cycles the battery so it wo n't overcharge . Cord lengths are long enough and the unit has a nice led system to tell you what it is doing . This is exactly what I needed for my car which sometimes spends a few weeks in the garage without being used . Tired of coming home from business trips to a dead battery that needs to be jumped ( then replaced ) .	1
I purchased this Battery Tender Plus in July of 2011 , it 's now March 2014 and it still works flawlessly.I use it in the winter to keep my motorcycle battery topped off.Not much else to say except that this was a wise investment . Trickle charging with this is the best way to maintain the longevity of your battery.Would recommend to anyone parking a car , truck , or motor home for more than 3-4 weeks . Or anyone parking a motorcycle for over 2-3 weeks .	1
A good handy item to have . I have used it on my motorcycle , lawn motor , 2 scooters and have tender leads on all of these items plus my farm tractor . I also brought a couple of tender leads with the battery clamps , one in my motorcycle and the other is with my farm tractor in case I have a dead battery all I have to do is hook those leads to jumper cable and battery tender leads , am ready to start whatever the jumper cables are hook up to . Make sure that the jumper cable negative and positive are not touching each other	1
I had my Vespa dealership recharge my Piaggio BV250 battery after winter storage . They actually used this battery tender to charge it for me . However , they only sold the Deltran Tender Jr ( 0.75 Amp ) . This charger has a faster charging time than the 0.75 Amp . My batteries charge in about 4-6 hours whereas the Jr take about double that ( though exact timing obviously depends on how depleted your batteries are ) . I 've used this charger since then and it 's been great . It 's simple to use : plug it in , connect the clamps or leads to your battery and wait for the green light to light up ( indicating a full charge ) . There are two sets of connecting cables ( one is a clamp and the other a screw on ) which is good depending on your need . One benefit of these two cables is that they actually fit into each other and can be used to connect your battery to your bike WHILE your battery is outside of your bike - I had to use this feature because I accidentally shut my seat ( lock is battery powered ) when the battery was out and had to connect my battery remotely.If you have a Vespa or other scooter , I would highly recommend getting this charger . In cold weather , scooter batteries die in about 3-6 weeks of inactivity .	1
I have several of this model and one with less output but that one is weather/water tight for my boat and jet skis and have been using them for around ten plus years and none have failed yet , other chargers I have bought at auto parts suppliers have never lasted and did not maintain batteries as well it is apparent the batteries are either made better or these charges just maintain them better I am pretty sure it is these chargers .	1
Great for those batteries that you do n't use year round on motorcycles , rvs , lawn mowers , etc.Like it enough to purchase a double one the following year .	1
this charger works perfectly and is just what i needed to keep my bmw battery topped off for it does n't get driven much .	1
A car we store for the winter in an un-heated garagehas the battery go dead with-in a month .And a couple of times the parasitic drain ruined a cell/battery.So we bought a Battery Tender for that issue.One does n't need to be versed about an automobileor a BT to use one and solve a variety of problems.It 's a worry free ~ wonderful product that completely monitors itself.You can leave it hooked up for weeks or months etc.All though you ought to check on it every once in a while.The cab light in our truck was left on overnight & would n't startthe BT restored it enough with-in two hours to turn the motor over.A battery must have at least 3 volts left or the BT wo n't initiate chargingThen your down to jumping it , if the battery is n't yet ruined.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord ( box to outlet ) 6 ft 2 '' longCable that clips to a battery ( with clips attached - box to battery ) 7 ftGiving a possible continual length of over 13 ft.If that 's not long enough , the 25 ft BT extension is economicaland our experience is that the BT is just as effective weather the ex is used or not.Footnote : A warning in the instructions say ~ quote1 . `` If the positive battery post is connected to the vehicle chassis , then the vehicle has a positive ground system.2 . If the negative battery post is connected to the vehicle chassisthen the vehicle has a negative ground system . ( Most systems are negative ) 3 . For negative ground systems connect the positive alligator clip to the positive battery post.4 . Then connect the negative alligator clip to the vehicle chassis . `` Then it goes on to state several areas NOT to connect to.This language has always worried me what exactly was the right thing to do here.So I phoned Deltran Corp and asked.They said they have to state that to protect themselves butthat it 's fine to hook both clips to the two appropriate terminals of the battery.I must say here that the folks at Deltran are very accessible ~ knowledgeable ~and offered comparison information between the BT Jr verses the BT plus ~ cheerfully.I was impressed with their customer service .	1
I have a 1967 Ford truck that can be quite a drain on the battery at times , especially during the colder months . I purchased this before last winter , and never once had an issue with the battery being too low or too cold , despite some pretty frigid temps . I set this on a shelf just in front of and above my truck , and leave the lead to the charger hanging . I then wired the battery end to my battery and channeled it so the plug end can be pulled through the grill . It 's nearly invisible when it 's not in use , but is very quick and easy to plug up . I 've gotten used to just plugging up the truck every time I 'm done with it , and this little puppy brings it up to full charge fairly quickly ! Highly recommended , especially if you have an older car that either does n't get driven much or is a heavy drain on the battery . **********************************************************************************Update 01/02/11 : Unfortunately , I sold my '67 truck back in the late summer of 2010 . However , this little battery tender was still going strong , so I immediately hooked it up to my 4-wheeler . It has been doing a great job keeping the battery on it charged up through some especially cold weather we 've had . So after @ 3years of use , I still give it 5-stars . Awesome product ! Update 11/19/12 : I noticed something really smelling in my garage , and spent quite a while trying to find it . It was a horrible `` ozone '' like smell , but clearly was the smell of burning electronics . When I got to my Battery Tender , I noticed the light was no longer on and it smelled really bad , so I immediately unplugged it . I 'm not quite sure what happened , but am a little concerned about this . That said , I will consider replacing it as I still believe it 's a good product.Update 02/19/13 : As these units carry a 10-year limited warranty ( if you have your receipt ) , I decided to send it in . The cost of mailing it was around $ 9 for standard post , and $ 11 for Priority Mail . The warranty replacement charge is $ 12.95 ( why not just $ 13 ? ) . So in total , it will cost me just under $ 25 . That is , assuming they replace it , which I certainly hope they will ! I will post follow-up later.Update 03/20/13 : It took approximately 2 weeks , but Deltran DID replace my charger under warranty . The thing is , the replacement charger - which appears to be brand new , and not refurbished - did not come with ANY paperwork . No `` we 're sorry for your inconvenience '' letter , no receipt , no packing slip ... nothing . So my warranty on the replacement will only be as good as the remainder of what I had left on my original 10 years ( approx 4 years ) . The inconvenience of the return was frustrating , and I 'd have liked at least an acknowledgement of that from Deltran , but it `` is what it is '' . Hopefully this new one holds up at least as long as the first .	1
I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle . I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck ( 2 batteries ) . It seems to work great so far . I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you . The Junior 's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room . The Plus ' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable . They apparently do n't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way , the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours . They are new batteries and the truck 's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday . However , there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite . Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert , the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead . It is not designed to . Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need . I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter . By spec , the Battery Tender Plus can not recharge these large batteries from dead . Again , know what you need . The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that .	1
Had a bit of bad luck with my first unit I ordered . the charger would not enter its 'float ' mode where it maintains charge from 100-103 % . amazon replaced no problem ( love amazon 's returns ! no hassle ) and got one that worked great . I love this thing . In the winter It gets quite cold where I live and I have 2 cars . Sometimes I do n't run 1 for maybe a week or more at a time , so while it sits I throw the charger on it . When I go to drive , disconnect cords , and she roars to life . When I first got this I was using to charge a battery that had completely died . It charged the battery in about 24 hours , the battery was a full size 12v car battery . I believe the manual said it should have taken around 18 hours . Either way , for getting a battery maintaining and charging device for this price I have been very happy with the product . These come with 2 types of cords , one is just the alligator clips and the other you can use to actually put under the screw that holds the battery cables in place to the battery . I have the more permanent one on my car and just use the alligator clips for my truck . If you really like the permanent ones you can order and extra set of them , I think they cost 5-6 $ . Overall very happy with product and would buy again if I needed another charger .	1
I 've had my Battery Tender Plus for 10 years , it has bounced off the concrete garage floor a number of times and still works fine . It has really extended the life of my motorcycle batteries . I leave it plugged in all of the time , it will not overcharge or boil a battery . Excellent product .	1
I got this to plug in to my lawn mower a few weeks till spring to make sure the battery had a good charge , since I had to use a motorcycle to jump it earlier in the winter , to see if it worked after I bought it ( came with the house ) . This Battery Tender did the job . I plugged it in for a few weeks , and then when it came time to start up the mower , it had no issues.The small size of the unit is a plus , as it is easy to store when not in use .	1
I 'm one of the klutzy people who really ca n't manage technology , but I bought this one because my friend suggested it . I loved how easy this charger was to use , and it came with very easy to follow instructions . It 's a really top notch product , and I recommend it to all my car-savvy chicks .	1
I doubt this thing needs another 5-star review on top of the thousand it already has but just to chime in , this product is great : simple , easy to setup and understand and comes with more parts and connectors than you probably need.I have this paired with an Odyssey battery ( B0000BYEXOand it was no trouble , straight out of the box . Plugged it in , attached it with clips ( there are other options here , but the clips seemed easiest ) and it started charging . I checked back a bit later and it was in `` Storage '' mode and nothing exploded so all happy on that front.I was surprised that something this small and inexpensive could be such a nice battery charger and tender .	1
I have one permanently connected on my mini-motorhome . It works great while connected to AC power AND the engine is running . Whenever I 'm hooked up to AC power , the battery is maintained when powered up and not damaged when the engine is running . I 'd surely call this a must have for RV 's .	1
Have a Junior for my Toro Zero Turn lawn mower and two tender plusses for my Fiat Abarth and Benz AMG ... they are easy to install and work great ... ..you can not go wrong with this product .	1
No complain , is working right and perfect . 4 stars cause it should bring a switch to turn on and off and the clam to connect to battery is week it should be stronger .I will update . let 's see how long last , I never have one .	1
I have a 2000 Mustang GT convertible that I keep garaged and drive on nice , sunny days . I had been using a cheap trickle charger from Harbor Freight . Recently I discovered the battery had died so I decided it was time for a & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; charger . The reviews were great so I decided to give it a try . It is a small but powerful unit . It took my battery from stone dead to a full charge within 24 hours and it automatically maintains a full charge . It uses LED lights to let you know the status of your battery . I wish it had a gauge instead of the lights but I still would highly recommend this to friends and family .	1
After owning this for only a short duration , this seems to be the ticket to a longer lasting battery . For a vehicle that sits more that it is driven this is certainly cheaper than the headache of a dead , and possibly damaged battery . Very small size with nice build quality and cables .	1
I now have 5 Battery Tender Plus chargers . Ever since I started keeping my little used batteries on a Battery Tender , I have not had a battery failure.When I first bought my Generator ( over 15 years ago ) the starter batteries would only last a couple years because the Generator was used so infrequently , sometimes not for a couple years . Since then , I now leave a Battery Tender connected and also start the Generator once a year . The current battery in my Generator has now been in for almost 10 years ! I had to replace the battery recently ( 2 years ago ) in my Polaris 800 ATV because it kept going dead ( after couple months ) because I did n't keep it on a charger ( it sits in a shed with no electricity ) . I did n't think it would be a problem because I use the ATV 4-5 times a year . But modern AGM and Freedom Batteries can not tolerate repeated deep discharges . I knew better but was too lazy to keep pulling the battery out or running a very long extension cord to the shed . Now I remove the battery and keep it connected to a Battery Tender.I could site many more instances where I am now getting triple or even greater life from equipment or vehicle batteries by keeping them connected to a Battery Tender Plus . Given that even a small ATV battery costs upwards of $ 60 , the cost of a Battery Tender will pay for itself in a few years.And Battery Tenders have a 10 year warranty , unheard of for any battery charger .	1
It works , and that 's all that matters . Returning from overseas , I got home and went straight to the garage to fire up my Harley . The battery tender showed a good charge . I disconnected it and she started right up .	1
I have used this for years on my motorcycle battery . The adapters are included , so I leave it hooked up to my battery and run the wire under the seat . When I 'm ready to hook it up , all i have to do is plug it in .This one i bought for my mother to use when her car sits idle for a few months every year while she travels .	1
I have used Battery Tender products for some years so had high expectations of the Battery Tender Plus . I use it to keep my truck and ATV batteries in tip top condition as they are not used regularly and have had a tendency to go flat . The charger makes light work of recharging and when in maintenance mode keeps the batteries fully charged . Electrical consumption while maintaining charge is very light .	1
The day before I was to leave on a trip I found the battery was dead in my car . I do n't drive this particular one often so I knew I could jump it but sometimes when they are that low driving it does n't bring it back up enough . So I checked Amazon for this charger and they just happened to have it local so I got it that day - awesome luck ! Charged it over night and the next day we were off . It did n't get to a full charge so when we got back I put it back on until the green light came on . Then I stuck it on the other car . I plan to use this once a week on both cars . The size of this charger is so convenient I will take it with me just in case .	1
Never lost a battery to winter low temperatures/forgetting to charge it since I got this . I peer thru a garage door window occasionally to check that it 's little LED light is green , and that 's it . I chose this brand because it does n't drain your battery if the power goes off . We have power outages here from time to time , and our old wiring has had some bad connections show up in our house 's history , so I did n't want that worry.Chose the Plus model because I 'm using it on a size 27 or 29 ( ca n't recall which ) deep cycle battery . It took a long while charging when the battery was 50 % discharged , but it does do it - no need to fast charge the battery first with another charger .	1
Works very well , good for the bike , car or boat . The unit does tend to get a bit warm whne in use .	1
I was tired of my RV batteries not correctly maintaining charge . Had used other `` Bargain Brand '' chargers with poor results . Seems to be working fine . I use it to maintain two 6 volt batteries wired in series . I am monitoring the price of this item and plan to buy another if and when the price drops . ( Easy to do if you leave one in your Amazon Cart.Steve	1
I bought a battery tender Jr & the BIG ONE , for cold weather in Pa.Cant really tell the difference , suggest the Jr unless you have specific needs .	1
We have a 2006 MDX which is rarely driven ... .its a family car . That fact alone means that the battery wont have enough juice to start the car when we need it . The TENDER not only charged this battery , but kept it under control so that the car started perfect when we needed it . This is a must have product for your garage .	1
Battery Tender Plus - supports my 2-Bank system & allows me to keep charged all batteries ... definitely recommend to others . Would buy again & again & again . Great price & fast shipping .	1
Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast ( received next day ) and just got done hooking it up . I remove the battery from my vehicle because I did n't have any outlets near the car and I did n't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery ( via alligator clips or ring terminals ) . I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged . It 's been on for about an hour now , but that 's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery , not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item , however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $ 15.95 with the unit for evaluation , shipping & handling . Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made , the company will notify you of the cost . Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me , but if this unit ever fails ( hopefully in many years to come ) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $ 5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer , then you need to include your $ 16 fee and then pay for any repairs . The darn thing only costs $ 40 ... why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty ? All in all , I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy . ***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I 've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase .	1
Fairly new battery from autozone . Brand new , it measured14v . Left the cabin light/3rd stop light on overnight by accident and battery was down to 12.7v . Still good enough , but my alternator was n't taking the battery back to 14v . Tried this tender for about 12 hours . Voltage is better . It works .	1
This is an excellent way to keep your battery topped up all year round , with the very slow charging rate and safety cut outs your battery will always be in tip top shape . i have two , one on each of my bikes and i think they were a great buy .	1
This is a nice little compact charger that I like so much that I got the accessory plug-in battery hookups so I could use it without the clamps on my pickup and motorcycles .	1
Purchased the battery tender to maintain a full , healthy charge on my vehicle and generator batteries . My vehicles and generator do n't get used very often , so i 'm really hoping this product extends the life and performance of my batteries . Since it has arrived , I 've been very impressed with it 's performance . This product is much smaller and safer than any other charger/tender I 've yet to come across . Keep in mind that this is a trickle charger , charging only 1.25amps per hour , so it does take some time to properly charge a battery . As the instructions annotate , it will NOT charge a totally dead battery ( for safety reasons ) . This is defined as a battery with 3V or less charge , per the manual . It goes on to explain that when this is the case , the battery is likely defective and needs to be tested/replaced . Overall , very happy with this purchase . Only thing that could 've made me happier would be if it was made in America .	1
I use this to keep the battery charged on my motorcycle during the off season . No problems or complaints whatsoever .	1
If you have one of the millions of GM pick ups with the base mirrors these are a reasonable add on for towing . They are easy to install after some practice . Easy to remove - not sure why some other reviewers had problems with this ... Just unscrew the clamp and slide them off . They are a little tough to adjust because you need to move the mirror beyond where you want it and let it snap back a bit . Just takes a little time . Once adjusted they stayed put . They are stable on the highway but on bumpy roads they cause my OEM mirror glass to vibrate more than the add ons . This is probably due to the extra weight of these . You will definitely want to take them off when you are not towing . They make your truck look like Dumbo and people will bump them in parking lots . Best price by far was Amazon when I bought them .	1
Exactly what was offered , fit nicely , no major prep work , wo n't fade or crack , adjusts perfectly , easy removal and fits under seat in truck	1
Can see the sides of my camper and vehicles behind me just perfect ! ! Easy to mount ! They look like factory mirrors and do not shake or rattle . Love em ' ! !	1
Put these on a 2006 Yukon Denali XL to see around a 26 ' travel trailer . They fit like a glove and look very nice . Both the mount and the mirror are solid . You can adjust the little mirror , but it is stiff enough that it does n't vibrate going down the road . The instructions recommend cleaning your mirror before you put these on and I would recommend it too . The did n't scratch my mirrors and they were hard to slide on and off , but they are tight enough that if you have a large chunk of something on your mirror , it may cause damage to your mirror over time .	1
These mirrors are just what I expected . They are easy to install , fit perfectly , project far enough to see along the side of the trailer and do not vibrate in the wind . I feel that they are better than the built-in extending mirrors , and cost far less . I have not had to adjust them since the first time I set them up .	1
Our Chevy truck has chrome on the forward facing part of the mirror . After using these mirrors for a few camping trips , it ended up getting a little scuffed . It was n't bad , but it was noticable.I would have taken them off after each trip , but the installation ( although not overly difficult ) was not easy enough for me to do so every day.As for functionality , the mirror is a little small , and although it DID give me increased visiblity , it was n't quite what I was expecting.Maybe I was expecting too much from this mirror , but I could n't bring myself to give it 5-stars . I 'll keep using them ( especially since the chrome is already scuffed ! ! ! ) , but this is n't a 5-star item .	1
Let me tell you , backing up a 35 foot camper is a pain when you only have the stock mirrors ! ! ! ! These made all those troubles disappear and might have saved my marriage too . My wife ca n't seem to get the hang guiding me back . There was usually lots of yelling and cussing involved ! ! ! Anyway these mirrors work great and are very easy to take on and off . I 've had them on at 85 mph and they did n't even budge . And no the camper was n't hooked up at the time ! ! !	1
I purchased this for my 2005 Avalanche to use while I am towing my 28 foot camper . Prior to having these all I could see behind me was my camper , now I can see any car that is behind me , it 's a must have for anyone pulling a trailer that is difficult to see behind and is much better and more stock looking than the other mirror options out there .	1
Repeat Order . This is nothing more to say . I bought this the first time based on others recommendations , was pleased , and now have re-ordered . That about says it all .	1
Love these . They actually make the & # 34 ; black water & # 34 ; black . When dumping with a clear elbow , it 's a bit more pleasant .	1
You cant beat this product for keeping your RV tanks smelling fresh and clean . I have tried just about everything else and nothing compares . Also , fyi , the house boats at lake powell ( near grand canyon ) also use this product daily in the boat tanks .	1
Easy to use and really did a good job eliminating holding tank odors . I 've tried many different options and I 'll stay with this one . Drop a packet or two into the tank and forget about it !	1
I 've been using these for the last year . I have had no real odor problems . Easy to use , just drop one in the tank and your good to go .	1
Aside from the fact that it kinda reminds me of bubble gum when I put it in the tank ( I have no idea why it smells like that to me ) , this product does what it needs to do - keeps the odor of our waste tank to a minimum . We combine these with Walex BIO-11530 Bio-Pak Natural Holding Tank Deodorizer and Waste Digester to manage the odor with these , and digest the waste products with the other . Combined they allow you to empty your tank less often and take longer off-grid trips without being revolted when you get back to a dumping station .	1
Drop a few of these blue bomb to ward of those nasty tank odors . They help keep the sensors clean too !	1
This product is added to the black tank only when we are traveling in an attempt to control the `` morning startup slosh odors .	1
Ok , finally have actually used this in the travel trailer . It was a 3 day 3 night trip . When time to empty the waste water , the smell was not nearly as bad as we were expecting ( from watching youtube videos ) , and these porta- pak packets is why . My sister uses a fluid deodorizer that breaks down waste and I use these . She has tote that gallon sized thing each trip , mix it up with the correct water etc ... . All you do with these is 'drop it in ' . No it does n't add a citrus smell or cutesy smell , it just simply does what it 's supposed to do . As easy as the dishwasher gel packs ... .really like this product .	1
These seem to work a bit better than some of the other packets . Maybe it 's that my waste is stinkier than others '	1
this is a great value vs the packs of 10 at the camping stores . I will repurchase here only , thanks !	1
Smell the freshness in these tablets . I usually will toss one in the toilet on my travel trailer at the beginning of my camping trip and it will deodorize it . I never get a smell from the toilet while using these . They are great . One per camping trip is all you need . I have a 40 gallon black water tank . I have not tried other tablets because I am very happy with these .	1
Walex TOI-91799 Porta-Pak Holding Tank Deodorizer , Not as well as I thought it should would work . Had to put several pak 's in . And yes I empty my tanks every week .	1
These packets do an amazing job at keeping my RV tanks from stinking on hot days.Best I have triedHighly Recommended	1
These work just fine . We 're new to RV'ing and any advise is welcome . But these seem to keep things in good working order .	1
This product screws into the city water inlet and then I hook up my air compressor to it to pressurize the lines to blow them out . This is my first time winterizing and we 'll see if I did an adequate job , but it was pretty easy to use . If I did n't and I have some plumbing damage , it was n't because of this product but rather that I did n't do an adequate job of clearing all the water out of the system .	1
To keep plastic water pipes from freezing in winter , this device is used to blow any excess water out the pipes . Easier to use and cheaper than using marine antifreeze .	1
This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV 's plumbing system . Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet , so when winterizing , it ca n't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots ( elbows , valves ) from freezing .	1
I bought this one which cost a bit more but I am sick of all the plastic junk and this one appears it will last forever .	1
For years I make shifted air hose attachments for blowing water out othoses and lines before freezing season . Lo and behold , here is a handyattachment for hoses that simplifies the work tremendously .	1
Have not used it yet but nice to have when needed . Thought this would help winterize if no RV antifreeze available .	1
This plug is a must if you winterized your own trailer to blow the water from the lines so they do n't freeze .	1
Makes blowing out you water system do winterizing so much easier . Only thing better would be a way for it to hang on to the air hose by itself ; - )	1
I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer . Simply screw it on to your water hook-up , and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you 're in business.The tip is flexible , but secure . That is , after connecting your air hose to this plug , you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress , and it will flex . This is great , because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV , and I would purchase it again .	1
I bought this version over the plastic version because you can connect any type of air compressor to it . The adapter is the same kind as used in car and bicycle tires.I used it last weekend to clear the water lines of my travel trailer and it worked as advertized.I initially was going to just use a bicycle pump to push the water out , but I managed to borrow an air compressor at the last minute . I blew the lines for about 30 minutes and then pumped in some RV antifreeze as recommended by my trailer manufacturer.Even though you 'll only use this adapter once a year , I would recommend this over the plastic version because it should last a lifetime .	1
I have at present two coaches and have had to do the line blowing out thing on them both and am very glad I bought this handy little item	1
Great for blowing out the water lines in a RV . While I 've been using one for several years to winterize my RV , I bought this one to winterize a vacant rental home I have . Very heavy duty metal and does exactly what they claim .	1
This is a great tool . Due to arthritis , I could never get the drain plug insertedcorrectly so it leaked profusely . This enabled me to insert the plug ( a replacementmetal one ) with no leaks !	1
Got this to use with the valve I purchased which was the wrong size , so have not used it , but never hurts to have it in case .	1
I could easily have made this tool , but I 'm getting lazy in my old age . It beats using a pair of channel locks , and much neater .	1
I have not had to use this yet but it seems well built and would get the job done right	1
This little guy helps keep a 'cold plate ' fridge with a balanced temperature . You may find the fridge running more often due to air movement.The 4 star rating is due to the considerations required on placement due to the air intake location .	1
seems to be working pretty good . has n't had any food smell hanging around in fridge . uses 2 d batt h	1
Keeps items from falling out on TT/RV	1
I just installed 3 of these and they fit well and are well made . I am expecting them to hold up for years .	1
I think this is going to save the eggs . The last few times we have taken the trailer on a trip all was well but the it items in the refrigerator that shifted . Last trip it was three dozen eggs that fell when the door was opened . I hope all will be well now .	1
this refrigerator bar works great ! I like it because it 's adjustable and keeps items from moving around as I travel .	1
Works great with the single bars to keep things in order in the refrig . Traveling every other day makes it easy to step up with out having to go in and setting everything back in place or clearing up spills .	1
We ordered a couple of these because we bought one when we got our RV and see how useful it can be . Also lots cheaper than at RV center . Thanks	1
This keeps taller items in my RVs fridge secure as we are going down the road ! ! No more crying over spilled milk !	1
This helps to keep things in my RV frisge from shifting while we are motering down the road . It sets up with ease .	1
I purchase two of these for when we are traveling from home to campsite in our motorcoach . These are not spring loaded , like I originally thought . You install by placing it where you want it and then turning each rod to tighten against the side of your refrigerator . Removal requires that you loosen the rods . Works great . We leave on in place but the second one is used only during transportation .	1
These things actually work . They keep stuff secure and they are not just for use in the fridge . I would buy again .	1
Clever item . You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling . To lengthen , you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod . Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them .	1
This holds milk , 2 liters and other tall items in place in you do not have to worry about them spilling as you travel .	1
Easy to install . Screw out each tube to the necessary length , and the rubber ends hold the bar in place . Just got back from a trip . My refrigerator door somehow came open . Thank goodness I had these in place or I would have had a major clean-up .	1
What a difference it makes . There are many varieties of hose support . This one is tough plastic . Easy to store , and works perfectly . Expands very easily and slopes perfectly to make dumping easy , quick and hassle free . Never dump without it .	1
I have two sewer connections on my trailer , so I initially was n't sure what to do . The first two trips I just connected up the hoses to the Y connected and then had to `` milk '' the contents into the sewer . This was not fun . This product almost completely eliminates that horrible process and keeps things flowing downhill . I actually purchased two - one for each sewer connection . This keeps the elevation correct to the Y connector . After that , the site was pretty level , so there was n't much of a problem.I 've only used these once , so I can not comment on longevity , but I would likely replace them if they break sooner than later .	1
Trivia : You ca n't have a sewer hose on the ground in Oregon . It must be elevated ! Betcha did n't know that , but what the heck ! It 's always nice to have your `` stuff '' run downhill into the dump station instead of just sitting there in the hose ! Some people ( Joe Flatlanders ) carry a rain gutter to accomplish the same thing , but is a rain gutter collapsible into a nice little package with a handle ? Word to the wise : NEVER leave you black tank gate valve open ! It 's ok to leave your gray tank open but NEVER leave your blank tank valve open !	1
The sewer hose support is very handy . Comes small enought and with a nice handle to carry . It expands from 1 foot to 20 feet and inbetween . Now there is no worries about not having enough of a pitch on the sewer hose from the camper to the sewer drain . With this placed properly so that the sewer hose slants away from the camper towards the drain ( and not up hill ) I dont have to worry about a potiential clog in the hose and everything empting out with a proper flow .	1
A must have item , but use care as this can break ( and still be usable ) .I would not be without one .	1
I would not buy this product again . It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra .	-1
Bought this for my spare tire on my utility trailer . Very inexpensive ( cheap ) , flimsy and loose fitting . Seems like it can be broken off easily . Will probably end up getting a cable lock . This device does n't really give me a sense of security . I suppose for only five bucks you get what you pay for .	-1
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous . The funnel is 10 '' long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6 '' long . It states that the funnel is 4 '' x 4 '' but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4 '' in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless .	-1
I am using this on a Curt receiver and the length is perfect . It appears to be of high quality construction ( with a bit if weight to it ) and this design prevents any rattling on bumpy roads . My only complaint is that it gets rust buildup inside the lock mechanism after a few months , so you need to clean it periodically.Update : A great deal of dirt has found its way into the lock mechanism so I guess the fit is not secure like it should be . Also it is now rusting which I find a bit odd in all stainless construction . I see the head design has changed based on the new picture here so maybe the issue is fixed now .	-1
I am a car RV detail guy . My car and RV must be shining new all the time . I thought I had found the best shine wax protection using an rv wax called protect-all with UV inhibitors in it prior to trying this Flagship wax and used it for years and it did the job and nothing else on the market ( so I thought ) was going to top it for fiberglass . I use McGuires Fiberglass restorer and that did the most amazing removal of oxidation on an older RV I restored back to new so I knew it had to be good and tried it.I ADDED REVISED REVIEW TO END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW ON THIS PAGE ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .Well after applying this Flagship wax to my already clean and shiny RV it took the shine to a whole higher level . 1st off it does go on easy , once on its stays kind of moist like but drys SOFT LIKE but it comes off nice , then I follow with 2nd dry cloth to make sure its completly off and shiny and it does come off easy and it does clean finish up leaving a nice shiny glazed surface . But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try . One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed , shiny , and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before . It also does not cling to plastic , windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it , So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013 . AFTER USING THIS AND LIKING IT AT 1ST ... I FOUND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAD BUT WATER STREAKS SEEM TO STICK AND STAY ON WAXED SURFACE ON FIBERGLASS EVEN WASHING WONT REMOVE THEM EASY . SO I WENT BACK TO USING PROTECT-ALL ON MY RV . IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax . I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF ... ... ... So we tried it- liked it at first but then a week or so later found the flagship to not be as good as what I used for years in the Protect-all brand . I LOVE McGUIRES PRODUCTS MOST TIMES .	-1
I used this for a while . Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did . One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it .	-1
Only fair . NOT very durable and do NOT fully secure the trailer . Spend the extra $ $ $ and get the X-Block and / or the Fastaway ( we now use both , Fastway for intiial set and the x block for final lock in )	-1
The & # 34 ; feet & # 34 ; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended , the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck .	-1
Bit of a let down here . From all the reviews , I thought maybe my search for the perfect nozzle would come to an end . It did n't . The sequencing of spray patterns on this nozzle is not what you are used to . Sure , it has a unique ability to produce a fine spray and a fire hose kind of effect , but when switching between patterns it passes mostly through various streams of concentrated water that dench anything in its way . If you are trying not to splatter mud , create craters or wash away feshly planted seeds , this is not your nozzle . Maybe it makes more sense on cars .	-1
You are better off going to your local department store and buying the Craftsman brand nozzle instead . It is identical to this one except the green part is silver . And it comes with a lifetime replacement guarantee unlike this Bon-Aire one . It 's also about the same price.That said , I prefer a trigger type nozzle because to turn this off , you have to rotate it several revolutions and then it does n't remember the spray setting you were at . This type of nozzle may be good if you 're holding it for a long period of time watering your garden or something like that , but for washing your car when you only turn the water on periodically , it does n't work as well as a trigger type hose nozzle .	-1
When looking at these products , simply calculate the actual cost per square foot . for example this '' speaker kit '' contains 1.38 square feet , for around 22 bucks ( price fluxuates like its a stock or something ? ) can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot ? there are so many cheaper alternatives . dynamat is an awsome product , and it does work . but for those of us not made of money , search this `` butyl flashing tape '' u will be glad u did .	-1
I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference .	-1
Does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it 's cost . I installed it inside of my doors using the roller and lots of elbow grease . All parts of the dynamat that I installed have good contact with the metal . I would return this but it is stuck to my car door ...	-1
You 'd better trust your Jack Stands if you have any intention of getting under your car.I thought these were a good option but I changed my mind after receiving them ... For whatever reason , justified or not , I felt uneasy seeing how much they rattle.I decided to take my car to the mechanics and ended up never using them . I forgot to return them and then it was too late ... So two stars because they do not inspire me any confidence .	-1
the first time I used it out of the box , one stand 's neck is broken . I decided this brand is the one I should avoid . And let my friend know it .	-1
BAD PRODUCT , WRONG WELDED , ITS ONLY WELD INSIDE , BUT NOT OUT SIDE , SO IS NOT RECOMENDED TO USE IT UNDER CAR . PLEASE DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE , IS NOT WELD RIGHT.THIS ITEM HAVE TO BE WELD IN BOTH SIDE , INSIDE AND OUT SITE , NOT ONLY INSIDE.THE PIN OR SECOND SAFETY PIN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL , IT MOVE AND DOES NOT HOLD THE POST RIGHT , ITS LIKE NOTHING , SO DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IT. -- - TORIN WANTS TO SEND IT BACK EVERY YEAR FOR ANNUAL INSPECTION , BUT THEY DONT PAY FOR S/H . THIS SHOUL BE 1 TON , NOT 3 TON WITH THIS WELD FORM.MY ITEM LOOK USED NOT NEW , LOOK 'S LIKE SOME ONE USE IT AND RETURNED AND THEN , THEY SENT THEM TO ME . THE UPS DROP IT TO THE FLOOR , CAUSE I HAVE A GATE , SO BE AWARE OF UPS , THEY DONT CARE IF THEY BRAKE IT .	-1
Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail . Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities . There are websites devoted to discussing oil and oil filters and Fram products are nearly universally criticized and avoided . There are also videos online that investigate Fram oil filters and they are nearly all universally negative.Purolator , Wix ( NAPA ) , Mann , Mahle , are some quality filters . Fram are the worst filters and you are risking harming your bike .	-1
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle , but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach , with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you do n't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit , you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel . It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body , but if the area is n't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel , raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver 's side window.Finally , when they are detached from the door , they make for a very bulky awkward device that does n't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I 'm sending them back .	-1
This is a piece of junk. ! The straps stretch , the plastic clips slip off while tightening , and the dam things fall off while driving . Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on . They do work well .	-1
1 . The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2 . I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it . The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible . WD40 did not work , neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3 . So if you try to adjust the mirror after it 's mounted , you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4 . When adjusting the mirror , the day/night button kept flipping on/off . Very annoying.5 . The mirror surface itself is very good , no ripples .	-1
I gave these things a 2 star rating because we have 8 sets of them installed on our county patrol cars . Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate . I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night , 01/23.2014 . Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time . Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue . Other than that , they are a great , powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you . Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these .	-1
I used it on decent-looking leather seats of a 2003 Toyota Sienna.I bought both the cleaner and the conditioner and used them as described . Even if they did what they are supposed to do , I did not realize that . It has not made a difference appearance-wise.Hopefully the treatment will help keep them alive longer . Do I regret buying them ? No . I do not .	-1
I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store ... and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell . Suddenly half through cleaning the passenger front seat the sprayer broke . At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.So I went online and after much research orderedGriot 's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit . Well , the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing .	-1
I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna . If they made a difference I have not realized it.I do not regret buying these , I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance .	-1
THE JACK STANDS FELL WITH NOTHING ON THEM WHEN I BARELY SHOOK THEM . MADE IN CHINA JUNK . WASTE OF TIME . IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE BUY AMERICAN JACK STANDS .	-1
I ordered and paid for next day air because I needed it this weekend . It arrived , but it was n't what I ordered . I ordered a pair of jack stands . I received an engine hoist leveler.I understand mistakes happen.. but it was the way the return has been handled that I have issues with . UPS dropped it off , but I have to take it to the post office to send it back ? And I was n't told if they 'll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service.. so I have no idea when the replacement order will arrive . A week ? Two weeks ? This was n't my mistake or even a defective product.. this was human error on their part . They should have told me they 'd IMMEDIATELY ship the replacements next day like I ordered . So far I 'm left hanging . Should I go out locally and get what I need and then end up with an extra set ? Should I hold off a day because they 're coming next day ? I do n't know.. and that 's the point and that 's why I gave them one star .	-1
I used this on my pickup truck because I had been getting some hard starts and rough idles and decreased fuel economy . For about the past 6 months , I have noticed about a 2mpg drop in fuel economy.A couple of my friends have used this stuff and claimed success , so I gave it a shot . I added a can to the fuel tank , and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake . Let it sit and drove it around . It smoked like crazy as promised.Now , anecdotally , I do think it smoothed out my idle and I have n't had a hard start . But , there is nothing I can quantify , and I am not sure that the improvements are not all psychological . I think my truck runs better if I wax it . My use also coincided with the end of winter , so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements , too . I did not see an improvement in mpg.So , if this is where my story ended , I 'd say give it a go . If it works , great . If not , you did n't lose too much.BUT ... The second tank after using this I got a o2 sensor code and had to replace a downstream sensor . To be fair , the truck has 100k , and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor . Since I had already noticed a drop in mpg , the sensor was likely on its way out . At the same time , I think it is rather interesting that it failed less than 300 miles after using this product when I 've been driving around with the diminished mpg for several thousand miles . My personal belief is that the big blast of smoke just pushed a failing sensor over the edge.So , no , I wo n't use this stuff again . Most people have had fine luck , but its not worth the risk for me .	-1
I have used both cans of this product on different cars . The product results in a tremendous amount of emissions being spewed into the air when sucked into the vacuum system as described in the articles I read about the product before purchasing it . In addition to creating air pollution and drawing angry stares from neighbors , I am simply not convinced the product is effective .	-1
I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior . I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield , which is annoying . It also does n't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off , the dash looks very dry.I 've since found303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz , and that works much better . It does n't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues , ie. , it does n't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield , and the shine lasts longer . It also protects from UV just as well , if not better . Note that Vinylex contains silicone , which actually damages the vinyl/plastic over time.I 'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather .	-1
This thing leaks on first use . The hoses are not tight and the brake fluids leak everywhere under my hood . Lucky I put 3 towels around the brake fluid tank because I knew this would happen . Will not buy this again .	-1
There is no swiveling between the cap , the tube and the bottle . In other words , when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car 's brake fluid container , there will be kinking on the tube itself . Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid . They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose . That would be an ideal solution , but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature . However , I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each . I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem .	-1
The quality of the Bleeder is awesome , however it will take hours upon hours if you plan on actually using this product to bleed your car 's brake fluid . You are far better off either using a buddy to pump the brakes and you open the bleeder valve and then press the brakes in 5-10 times , and then closing the bleeder valve and repeat as necessary . You get a higher amount of fluid out each time than using this bleeder . After squeezing the top on it managed to keep 14 PSI ( 14.5 Recommended for by VW mechanics manual ) , which literally pushed out 10 drops every minute.If you are n't too sure how to bleed brakes as I stated above , just go on youtube and you 'll see what I am talking about.Also the bleeder bottle you can find on amazon as an item frequently bought with this item is worth the money .	-1
These test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use . Ifter a couple of them pulled apart then I just threw the rest of them out . Low grade product .	-1
CHEEP	-1
yes , they are wire leads with alligator clips , so if that 's your only standard for giving them a good rating ... otherwise , trying to use these as jumper wires in electrical work is useless since they have so much resistance due to the very small gauge wire and shoddy connections . they make good clips for hanging paper , lol	-1
These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small . they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed . Lights feel well made and sturdy . The wiring harness is very well made . Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however , the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs . The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on , but i wont be using it.EDIT : CRAP ! lights started to leak . seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right . took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didnt give me the light output desired . after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked . going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens . READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING . THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST .	-1
I mounted these on the bumper of my Ford F250 . They are about 24 '' off the ground ; not too close to the pavement by any means . The housings started to leak within a week or two of being installed . I removed the lights and tried sealing with black silicone , but they still leaked . Perhaps because of the leak , the chrome started flaking off within a few weeks . I now have very good looking lights , which leak , produce nearly no helpful light , and wo n't stay aimed in the direction I angled them .	-1
These things are burning our right and left . We have these installed in 8 of our patrol cars and they do n't seem to last more than a few months . Be careful if you order the KC lights with the 130 watt bulbs . The light reaches out as good as any I 've ever seen but the quality of the bulb leave much to be desired	-1
Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless . The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly . I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun .	-1
Hard to apply and very hard to take off . This will go in the back of the supply cabinet and only be useed when I am out of P21S . You definitely get what you pay for in this case .	-1
Maybe its just me , but I did n't see much difference . I have a 2010 370Z that I baby , and decided after three years it might be time to detail the finish . As I said , I baby the darn thing so its garage kept and pretty clean to start with . I followed the long , involved instructions written by one of the experienced reviewers to the letter . I decided to just do the hood , and then clean/wax the rest of the car for comparison . . I could see some different in the hood . It was definitely a higher gloss . But not a difference that any one else would notice . Maybe it would be more noticeable in an older car with faded paint . But I would n't waste time doing this again .	-1
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector . Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result , but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought . The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific . This was a waste of money . I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place .	-1
I 'm not shocked that there were no wires , even though the picture shows wires . But I am surprised that the dust cover - which appears to be integral in the picture - is not included . All that 's in the package is the clamp itself and some self-drilling sheetmetal screws . Maybe I 'll check back some day and see that the picture has been changed or the description has been updated to reflect reality , in which case I 'll change the number of stars . But for now , I 'm knocking two stars off for the deceptive ad , and another star for the product really being a fairly cheap piece . In my opinion , the piece is n't a great value ; the price is at best only `` fair '' . And yeah , I know , we 're not reviewing prices . But it 's a cheaply-made product which lacks finish ; I think the bottom side could 've been solid instead of having the exposed ribbing , and I think the included screws ( which appear to at least be stainless ) should 've come with appropriately-sized washers to distribute the load on the plastic .	-1
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller . There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware .	-1
Not sure why , but my this adapter doesnt light up to do the checks as it is suppose to . I think it is my suv ( Audi ) that doesnt support just the leds to verify operation . I kept it anyway as it works fine with the trailer and all the lights work .	-1
I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat . Very cheaply made . The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat . Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !	-1
I used this product on the rear of my disc brake calibers and it was a big wasted of time.Did not push in the piston.I had to use a 6in . C-CLAMP which worked out pretty well.Lisle Disc Brake Pad Spreader LIS-24400	-1
The tool worked great on the first set of pads . Went to do the other side and the threaded rod broke loose from the knob . NOT recommended .	-1
I 'm bucking the trend of favorable reviews here.I do give it two stars because it does go on easy , smells decent , and has excellent cleaning capability . The towel came out more black than with other products , which I assume indicates it is removing a lot of oxidized black rubber/trim.Unfortunately , this product does NOT last . I covered all the rubber/plastic on my car ( two thorough coats ) , let it soak in/settle for a day , then washed it to get the overwipe/streaks of nearby body panels , etc . The Meguiar 's # 40 washed completely off . It was left worse than before I used the product . The finish remaining was also very splotchy and looks bad . Even some interior parts that I applied # 40 to were mostly wiped clean after just wiping with a damp towel used to pick up accumulated dust/dirt . It remained splotchy where there were minor nicks scratches in the plastic/rubber where more # 40 had absorbed.Overall , I was very unsatisfied with the results . I 'm not going to say it is the worst product I have ever used , but others that I use are far and away better . These include 303 Aerospace Protectant which is a very mild , water-based product which also does n't last but is better than this Meguiars product and has almost no sheen.My previous staple and which I recommend most is actually Armor All Original . I purchased a Guru Reports analysis on these types of products several years ago and was surprised that this `` old '' product was one of the two best-in-category products ( along with Zaino ) among over 50 that were tested . Armor All Original ( not other formulations ) is very low sheen and also lasts several washes . It is also about 1/4 the price or less and available everywhere.I 'm going back to Armor All Original and recommend that you try it as it performs better than `` boutique '' products . I would also recommend that you use water-based products on permanent trim , rubber , etc. , as the solvent/petroleum-based ones have a tendency to degrade the rubber/plastic over time . These may be OK for replaceable items like tires or parts that are severely oxidized . You can generally tell the difference in that water-based products are milky color while the petroleum-based ones are clear . I do like Meguiar 's Hot Shine for severe problems , but not this product .	-1
dont buy this product , I bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing , the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn , waste of money . at least amazon let me return it broken .	-1
3 things. # 1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly . Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right ( better ) way and twist the ends toward inside more , because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum. # 2 Size is too big for regular car filters . Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC . Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around , or a huge SUV or a pickup truck. # 3 Removal only . does not work the other way around to tight the filter .	-1
I had this thing for a few months and it worked really well for taking off oil filters . It only made it through like 3 or 4 filters until the spring broke though . I do n't recommend buying it .	-1
I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying . I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth ... What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches ... I am sure I 'll use it , just not as much use as I 'd hoped it would get .	-1
When I first got it , the wrench did work , however , it was never that easy to use due to needing to be flared out first to fit over the filter . At some point , I lost the spring ( not sure why it could even detatch ) and then it was rendered completely useless . Ended up buying a couple of the large socket looking ones that come in three sizes to fit common filters . They 're a bit cheaper , but I had to buy multiple so they end up costing more . But , they also work , easily , every time .	-1
Tool feels sturdy and like it would help , but ended up being a useless tool in the arsenal . I would n't recommend this since you can hand tighten the oil filter if you used a textured one like the purolator .	-1
I 've used my Mityvac 7201 less than 10 times . I have treated it very carefully , as I do all my stuff . But still , it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate . I ca n't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it . No , I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman , and hope I do n't break anything ( including my fingers ) . I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray , and operating it repeatedly . But ( 1 ) It 's still not easy to operate , and ( 2 ) I should n't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove . It 's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode . I had to pay over $ 27 to get a replacement `` Tube Connector Kit '' ( 822566 ) , since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again , I found that the top plate leaks . I had not noticed this before , but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil ! When I use it in dispense mode now , the main tube does n't leak anymore , but air and oil come out from under the top plate . I removed the top plate , and sure enough , `` Look Ma , no seal ! '' It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed , but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable . Because I did n't notice this problem sooner , the seal ( 822821 ) is costing me an additional $ 13 , including a ridiculous $ 8.75 fee for shipping.Now I 've added ( not replaced -- added ) the top seal , and while doing a test , I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly . I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it did n't cost me so much money .	-1
If it works , it works pretty good . Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though . Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself . I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered . I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum . They said `` yep it might be '' and that was it , no `` we will get one right out to you '' or ship it back for an exchange . They were very rude . I just sealed it with some gasket maker and it works now but looks terrible . I would go with a different unit with beter quality control .	-1
Used this tool to remove my fuel line on a fuel filter change ... OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it ! Eventually the tool broke ! What a piece of junk ! I ordered the metal sissor one off of Amazon , got the fuel line off in 2 minutes ! ! ! LITERALLY ! I heard the click , and the fuel filter just came out ! Save yourself some time and aggrevation ... if you have a Ford truck , get the sissor tool , not this plastic junk .	-1
I got this to try to change out a fuel filter on a 03 F150 . It 's very nice that it has a bunch of different sizes , but there 's nothing to grab onto . Once you slip it over the fuel line there 's only the little larger piece of plastic to grab , and I was not about to generate enough force to pop off the back fuel line . I also found that the harder I pushed the more the tool sort of opened up . If you could get your fingers directly behind the wide end of this tool you could really generate a lot of force and probably pop the fuel line off easily . The way it 's set up , though , you can't.While it 's more expensive , I think the larger aluminum one-size tools seem like the way to go . There you actually have something to hold onto . I should add , though , that I have a feeling my fuel line is a bit rusted / gummed up and so perhaps under normal conditions this tool might work without a huge amount of effort . Pushing as hard as I could , though , I was not able to get the fuel line off with this tool .	-1
I decided I needed a new seal puller and picked this up cheap here on Amazon . I tried to pull two seals with it today and it just tore through them like a can opener . It would have been easier to use a hammer and a chisel .	-1
These will slip off and damage the clamp as well as skin your knuckles.Maybe if you were in a place with good access to the clamp it would work . I was despirate when I bought these and just wasted money	-1
Nice rig but it becomes unhappy and sticks if you use it in cold weather , below 40 sit seems to stick . So if it sticks your back to using it as a tire inflator and using your tire pressure guage again . The entire reason for this thing is to pump air in read it your done . Not the case . If it sticks not you have lost faith in it .	-1
I should have returned this . It 's no strobe light . The Inductive Timing light is so much easier , at least where you have battery power . Its made well but be sure to have the device fully inserted into the wires . Mine fell on the floor for not double checking the wire attachments and it could have damage it .	-1
I bought this first thinking it would be a good buy . I left it in my glove box , only to find it one day , bent . Did not last long in storage . I then I bought the digital tire pressure and tread depth combo . Way better product . Look up - Accutire MS-48B Digital Combination Tire Thread Depth Gauge and Tire Pressure Gauge	-1
Far too flimsy . This thing feels like it needs to be packed to the gills in order to retain its rectangular shape . Would also appreciate some type of rubber/velcro grip on the bottom so it 's not sliding around in my trunk when lightly loaded.It does it 's job , hence the no-return , but at the same time I did n't expect & # 34 ; soft sided & # 34 ; to mean & # 34 ; collapsable in all situations except fully loaded .	-1
I wish this had rigid dividers instead of just fabric . The unit is too floppy in general unless you load it up with a lot of stuff.This is only a tiny but more useful than a standard duffel bag.I would recommend you spend a bit more and get this one -Snap-on 870116 21-Inch Trunk Organizer and Tool Carrier . I did and am much happier with it as it is ridid and seems to hold just about as much stuff .	-1
I really was n't impressed with the overall result of this Polish , as part of the Mother 's 3-step kit . I used all 3 steps , and still think I get better results from Tech Wax .	-1
It would have been a five star review . But 409 works better , on cleaning up a bike . Mother just makes the part you use it on look wet , and leaves the dirt beneath . Four stars ...	-1
This kit seems like more of a hassle than it was worth . After using one clay bar , my car 's finish was indeed smoother , but it looked exactly the same . A few little spots of sap came out here and there , but I honestly think the same thing could 've been achieved with Goo Gone and Windex .	-1
I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years.I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go.I 'm am a old school Simoniz guy . Yea , lots of work ... but it works.I would always use a cleaner first , Dupont worked.I figured it might be time to try something new.So I tried the Mothers clay bar . Did not work well.I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great.Tried Klasse , real good stuff.Micro fiber.. the more you spend , the better you get.The clay was a joke .	-1
Purchased this product to remove a minor scratch , it ate through my clearcoat and left me with $ 400 in damage . Had an auto detailer look at the damage before getting it fixed , he asked what product caused it and I told him & # 34 ; ScratchX 2.0 & # 34 ; - he replied & # 34 ; Oh , I would never even use that stuff , it 's too abrasive. & # 34 ; Bottom line , from my experience with this product : do not purchase it under any circumstance unless you are very experienced working on cars.This is truly a one star item . Avoid at all costs .	-1
i tried it on a superficial scratch , and kept rubbing the product several times , and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there , i tried it with foam pad , microfiber pad , microfiber towel , worst product meguairs produce .	-1
This is not a rub on , buff off product , like wax . It takes a lot of rubbing against the scratch.It appears to be doing more harm than good , adding scratches to my fairly dark vehicle . I 'm using it by hand with a foam applicator , which never has scratched my finish when waxing . I find the results of a good coat of wax do a better job and do n't add additional swirlmark scratches like this stuff . It may work better with a power buffer . By hand , it 's pretty useless .	-1
Does n't work worth a darn . Regular wax works better than this product . Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand . I will go back to Turtle products from now on .	-1
As title says - waste of time , money and calories . I have 08 BMW 335i Sport . Silver color . Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images . Spent almost an hour , tried all different techniques . This product simply does n't work . If you have a new car with nice paint , I would avoid buying this . It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition , but not for me - sorry.P.S : I bought a full set of Meguiar 's paint care , you can find my reviews on other products as well . What actually worked for me ( somewhat ) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit ( contaminant removal kit ) , Clay Kit is very hard to apply though , but it works .	-1
Not really impressed with this product . The Meguiar 's cleaner/wax product does a much better job . This may be good for some cars , but not mine .	-1
this product is good but not outstanding as Barry Meguiar says not last as long as he says I 've used both summer and winter and in 6 weeks lost many of its properties . in the real world , not in the world of Barry Meguiar you have to wax the car every month if you want to protect your car . is not true that regardless of price waxes last for many months.since you apply the wax starts to degrade the environment , sun . uv , rain , dust . when you wash you remove the wax inevitably part because dust and pollution and the polluters and stick to the wax and when you remove these contaminants also remove the wax .	-1
I 've owned this wax for some time . It does n't last more than a month - if that . It 's a pain to put on and take off . It goes on ok , but taking it off is another story , leaves a almost a oily residue until you wash your car , or use numerous towels/microfiber to take it off . How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off ( I have black paint ) ? I have n't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs . One postitive is that it does smell good when applying it but I 'm sure Meguiars added the fragrance for some marketing perspective . All in all , for the price compared to durability - this stuff is a waste and not sure why Meguiars even put it on the market .	-1
Meguiars came out with the original NXT around 2005 and it was actually a pretty good product . Not the greatest shine but was fairly durable and easy to apply . Then , sometime a few years later , NXT 2.0 was introduced and to me , it was a huge step backwards . Although it just received a highly favorable rating from the big consumer magazine , it is far from one of the best products on the market . This version 2.0 has very poor gloss characteristics on dark colored cars and the durability is just terrible , literally no more than six weeks before water stops sheeting off the car.I maintain eight different personal cars and so am almost always waxing something . I think all the high priced , multi-step products are just so much snake oil being sold at outrageous prices and trust me , I 've tried almost all of them . Good surface prep is the key to the success of any wax/synthetic product and that involves clay , light cut cleaner , polish and then the final way . Once prepped properly , just about any product will do really well and , if applied regularly , will protect the finish and make future preps unnecessary . My current favorite for durability and shine is Turtle Wax cleaner/carnuba although the good old Meguiars cleaner was in the purple bottle is still a darn good product at a bargain price .	-1
This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off . But , on black cars especially , it does not give a nice deep glossy or `` wet look '' shine . It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day . I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it 's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car , and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics . Meguiar 's to make great products , but this one fails to impress.I get a better shine off of Meguiar 's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand . I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane .	-1
After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the `` frequently bought together deal '' including the 6.5 '' finishing pad and the 6.5 '' polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7 '' which include a recess to make centering the polisher 's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7 '' pads are actually machine washable . The Velcro pad is attached far more securely . The older 6.5 '' pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0 '' or this older 6.5 '' pad , it 's just that Meguiar 's has improved and updated their pads now . The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad , that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0 '' pad a no-brainer . Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads : SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar 's W 9207 7 '' Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad	-1
Also had some baked on oil stains on tti ceramic coated headers on our 70 challenger caused by leaking rear main seal . Once repaired tried semichrome to remove them . No success at all . Again pulled out the mother 's , , , ,although slow and tedious , it did the job with no damage to ceramic coating.Screw on lid on mother 's makes far better sense . Semichrome lid requires an inconvenient pry tool to remove , , , ,which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well . Additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive . I should have purchased a tube instead of a can to give it a try , , , would have saved 15 or so dollars .	-1
From the moment you touch the package , you 'll begin to wonder if this came from a dollar store . It has that knockoff look and feel that you just do n't see in mainstream stores.And once you have the `` flare '' out of the packaging , you 'll probably notice how it 's about ready to crack before you even screw on the battery cap . You may even notice ( or be disturbed by ) the similar look this has to a more adult-oriented item.But hey , the box says it 's a super-bright LED that 's as good as a flare , right ? Well , that 's not so true . The dopey LED is n't very bright at all . If this is as bright as a flare , then a MagLite is as bright as the sun . I wrote it off to the crazy no-name AAA batteries and tried some fresh Duracells . Same result.But ... but ... it says it has a map light , too ! Indeed , it does . Hopefully , there 's nothing red on your map , because the `` map light '' is that same dopey red LED -- but not blinking . And really , that 's something to give some serious thought to . If it was really that bright , would they suggest you use it as a map light ? I think not.If anything , I 'd think that using this as a road flare is more likely to confuse drivers than warn them . In fact , the only useful application this has that I can think of , is using the loophole to tie it to your kid on Halloween . That is , if you 're angry with your kid and want to shame them with something that 's not even as bright as a Glow Stick.Paying more than the cost of a candy bar for this is pure insanity .	-1
This is a little red flashlight , period . Yes , the red light is bright , and yes , it blinks if you set it to do so . But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit ! ! ! ! Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube . This one has the light coming off the side , like a beacon or lighthouse . It can ONLY be viewed from straight on ! While a flare puts out intense light in all directions ( like a sparkler ) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam . DO NOT BUY , except as a toy , or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare ? No way .	-1
I thought this sounded like a handy item to have in my car for emergencies , so when the Amazon Vine program offered it for review , I ordered it . First of all , it 's cheap plastic and made in China . That alone will usually put me off of buying an item I see in a store.I inserted the included batteries and turned it on . It emits a red light that can either blink or remain static . I thought the light seemed small and feeble , but I waited until nighttime to give it a real test . I set it on my car with the magnetic end holding it to the hood and walked down the driveway to see it from a distance . Although the red light was visible , it was n't nearly bright enough to be used as a flare in a roadside emergency . It was n't even as bright or eyecatching as the lights you see on bicycle riders at night.I would never rely on this product to warn oncoming cars of a breakdown . Nobody would know what it was even if they saw it in time to react . I 'm sticking with real flares , which are visible from far away and instantly tell other drivers of an accident or hazard ahead.I hope nobody decides to use this product as a `` safety flare '' in their cars ! I wo n't even keep it in my car as a `` map light '' as they suggest on the package . I 'll rely on the small mag light I already have in the car .	-1
I was enthused when I first saw this product . I strive to keep safety items in the car and house , so this one seemed perfect . A flare that runs on batteries ? I could get a bunch of these for my car and for my boyfriend 's car , and make sure we 're always safe ! I popped in the batteries and turned it on . This is a flare ? I took it outside . I tried it at night . There NO way a car coming down a highway is going to see that tiny light and know anything is going on . A person relying on this is setting themselves up for a catastrophic disaster . Having a high-powered flare is n't just a casual `` nice to have '' thing . It can literally be the difference between staying alive and having a sleepy trucker barrel into the car , demolishing it.The light is n't even strong enough to read by in the car . There 's nothing I would use this for . And the fact that they market it as a flare safety device concerns me greatly . I worry that someone will fall for that claim , try to use it as a flare , and end up with serious injuries - or worse.I highly recommend that people buy REAL FLARES for their cars and check on them every year or two . Have flashlights . Check the batteries . Safety is important.Definitely do not buy this product .	-1
When I received Heininger 1020 CommuteMate `` Flameless Flare '' , I had high hopes ... real flares can be dangerous , messy , and difficult to use . I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down . I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say , I was rather disappointed . The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED . In the daylight , the light output from the flare is barely noticeable . At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention . Or , if you were using it on a dark trail , it might be visible from a short distance . But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door . The light is also uni-directional ( only coming from one side of the flare ) , so careful positioning would be a must . I think it would be tricky to use as a map light , too , since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said , I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself . It is re-usable , and it could function as a secondary warning marker . It is not flammable , and it came with batteries which seems rare these days . The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good , if most vehicles were made of steel . But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light , it might be acceptable . One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a `` failsafe '' . After all , the more lights the better . However , the idea that it would serve as a `` flare '' is just not correct . If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road , for example , I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights . I would expect something MUCH brighter for an application such as that , and given that expectation this product unfortunately fell short of both its name and purpose .	-1
If you 're familiar with the red flashing LED bicycle tailights seen on so many bikes these days , then you 'll understand whan I say that this unit is essentially a one-LED version of those lights . Yes , it 's visible from a good distance away , but only if you 're directly behind it ; the lens that focuses the light from the LED concentrates it over perhaps 10 degrees . The base has a magnet it it that will allow it to stand up on the roof of a car , assuming the roof is metal , which is still true for most cars . So as a road flare , it 's better than nothing , but still nowhere near as visible as a traditional flare , or just putting on on your car 's four-way emergency flashers.So what use it is ? It might be useful as a rescue device , for signaling , or locating someone in the woods at night ( if they had the presence of mind to bring it along with them ) . Given the low price , it might be worth experimenting with .	-1
There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare . It will last much longer , and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car . The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining . It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it is n't anywhere near as bright as a flare . It has a single LED that is very directional . If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue , 2010	-1
At first look , the Heininger 1020 CommuteMate Flameless Flare seems like a good idea . In certain limited circumstances , I 'm sure it might be useful . For most circumstances , however , I would only use it as an absolute last resort.The item is made of plastic . Not just any plastic , but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle , which after all , is where this item is meant to be kept . While it is battery powered , and does n't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard , its usefulness is severely limited.First of all , one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries . Dead batteries do noone any good , and I 've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box , and forget about it , not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work ? Well yes , sort of . The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off , or lights up continuously . The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light , while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists . Unfortunately , the LED is not very bright , and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards , and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed , it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon . While we certainly do n't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers , we also do n't want something so dim that it does n't trigger anyone 's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway ? Forget it , buy some reflective triangles . Rural highways ? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds . Well lit neighborhoods ? It likely wo n't get noticed . From my perspective , about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under , and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides . Then , if your vehicle 's hazard flashers do n't work , by all means this is better than absolutely nothing . Just remember to check the batteries .	-1
Pros : battery driven ; flashing or steady light ; flameless flare ; can be used as a map light ; reusable . Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons : Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft , but this is only possible within a few degrees of view . One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation , but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight . Consequently , the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light . It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional . This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle , buy the real thing . If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver , or to see where you 're walking without seriously degrading your night vision , this red light will do that well .	-1
This item shipped defective . Parts not covered with chrome are rusting . This is usually a good product , I have purchased the same product recently and did have any problem . I need to have these two plates replaced .	-1
fell off almost immediately -- - but it was cheap so no big loss ... only someone anal as me would think the small lic plate screws need covering : )	-1
These chrome caps would not work on my plate . The license plate screws heads were larger than the plastic rings that hold the caps . I ended up using them on my motorcycle . These caps were less money at my local Harley dealer too . I 'd give them a pass next time .	-1
I have two cars , both of which require the large # 14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate ( the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into ) . Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw 's large diameter head . The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch ( 11 millimeters ) . Option 1 : Replace the nylon retainers on the car , but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a # 12 screw . Option 2 : Try to find # 14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads . I shopped around for # 14 screws with smaller heads to no avail . Option 3 : Grind down the screw head 's diameter . Option 4 ( not good ) : On one car I used # 12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter , but DO fit the rings , and wrapped the threads with tape . This sort of works , but I really ca n't tighten them down satisfactorily . So I have to check their security now and then . I 'm leaving the other car as is for now . Maybe someone has more practical ideas ? Sure would like to hear of them . BTW , SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13 : I think I 've found a viable solution to the above problem . I used a # 12 sheet metal self-tapping screw , placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing ( 1/4 '' i.d . ) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw . Used a heat gun ( or you can use a match , BIC lighter or soldering iron ) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a # 14 screw . This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape . One more thing : The THICKNESS of the screw head does n't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring . The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips `` X '' to use the screwdriver .	-1
I 'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover , but they feel incredibly cheap and I do n't expect them to stay on while driving down the road . I understand you need to be able to take them back off , but I feel like they 're going to fall off on their own ! We 'll see how it turns out .	-1
The covers pop off and are worthless . Do n't buy this junk ! Looks great when you install but the covers wo n't stay on when the car is moving .	-1
This is a cheap piece of junk made in a well-known foreign Asian land known for producing junk . The two lights are NOT LED and do not flash quickly like a real security system . They are dull lights , alternating from one to the other . Do n't waste your money or batteries . Anyone will tell its fake . I threw mine in the garbage ... was n't worth sending back .	-1
This kit is just ok. Every piece in the kit is extremely light weight . If you are a mall crawler and only hit fire roads than this will do fine , if it 's much more than that then look at the ARB kits .	-1
Let 's start off by examining the product claims made by the manufacturer , since some people seem to think that those of us who are n't fans of this product are at fault for expecting it to live up to those claims : * Cleans and lubricates the fuel system* Cleans and lubricates the carburetor and injectorsThese are the words of Lucas Oil Products ( on lucasoil.com ) , not me . So , if you want to lambaste me ( or us ) for expecting this product to clean our fuel systems , you will have to first explain why we should not expect it to , given that the manufacturer says it will.Sea Foam Motor Treatment is claimed by the manufacturer ( on seafoamsales.com ) to : * Cleans internal fuel system components* Clean carburetors , fuel injectorsDo you see the ( claimed ) overlap between the Lucas and Sea Foam products ? I bought a couple 5.25-ounce bottles of this stuff for my car , which had a very rough idle . Certain that all the positive reviews could n't be wrong , I also bought a gallon of it at my local auto parts store ( fortunately , I got a steep discount ) .I put one bottle through the fuel system . No improvement . Then another bottle . Still nothing . No noticeable improvement whatsoever.Eventually , I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment , and with one bottle of that , got the results I was after . No , I did n't mix the products.As far as I am concerned , this product is positively useless for cleaning the fuel system . & lt ; -- And is `` cleaning the fuel system '' a stated product claim ? Yes it is , thanks for asking !	-1
i have used it a few times and it dise not do what is said of the product the interior doea not come clean it does take up a little dust but thats it , it did not clean all the dust like it said it would	-1
If your interior is already cleaned , do n't use it . It will leave lots of lint on your dash . I have a one week new car and i wanted to keep my interior dust free . So I got this from Amazon with other car care products . I had applied some ArmorAll on my dash and leather seats to keep it protected . After a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash . So I wanted to start using this duster . After opening it brand new out of the blister pack , I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel . I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should `` Pick UP '' dust instead of leaving `` LINT '' ? Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again ... .	-1
the clamps are chincy , the wire guage is smaller than the 12 ' extension I put on the other end of it . If you 're not going to put a huge load on it then I 'm sure it will work but you get what you pay for . If it was heavier duty and had an in-line fuse then I 'd be happy with it .	-1
First of all , the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car 's motor . Secondly , the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable .	-1
Both the stock photo , and the J.Koster JPG you see of this product are no longer valid , and whatyou get is what my JPG shows.The product has been cheapened by shortening the wires by half ( now 1 foot ) by the time you spread the wires apart enough for the clamps to reach bothterminals on a standard sized 12 volt car battery , you have just taken up halfthe wire length which leaves you 6 inches left over.I have not stripped the insulation of the wires to check gauge , but it ca n't be anymorethan 18 ; 16 at the most.While the product does work , you would have to use it right on top of the battery , which isOK for me , as I only use it for test purposes.As far as the whole `` Front panel illumination '' line , I ca n't figure out why that is in theproduct blurb ! The product comes in a cheap clear plastic bag , NOT A THERMAL FORMED PACK ! as is shown , sothe product you see is not the product you get.Again , see my JPG of what you ACTUALLY GET.Due to the low price , it is not worth returning , but you should be aware of these changes .	-1
I use a lot of Mothers products but this glass cleaners is the worse . It leave streaks all over the glass . Also , when used on the inside of the glass it fogs up the glass . At night the glass fogs up so bad it becomes dangerous . I 've tried using a Microfiber and Terry cloth towel . I 've switched back to straight water to clean the glass .	-1
I purchased a bottle of Mothers Glass cleaner simply because I have used other Mothers products ( waxes ) and they seem to work very well . Also , this cleaner is safe for tinted windows because it does not contain ammonia.Unfortunately , I was extremely disappointed with this glass cleaner as it streaked more than Windex and no matter what I tried , I could not remove the streaks at all ! I did not notice any difference in the streakiness between non-tinted and tinted glass . Both were pretty bad.I ended up just throwing the bottle out and went back to using microfiber cloths and purified/distilled water .	-1
The tender works marginally well and after a few years the grounding prong pulled loose of the plug . I cut the unit 's plug off and replaced it . This unit keeps the battery charged but I 've noticed my voltmeter reads just over 13 volts every morning so it seems to me that this unit is keeping the battery barely charged instead of fully charged . I recently bought a Solar ProLogix 12 amp battery charger that seems much better built and keeps the battery more fully charged . If the ProLogix literature is to be believed , it is a much more sophisticated unit than the battery tender while the cost is just a few bucks more .	-1
I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years . it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode . It killed the battery from overcharging . hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing ( not going into float mode ) . the 3rd one lasted less than a week ... ... ... .. each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their `` tech '' . he can not understand my problem ... ... .. tried on different batteries . plugged into outlet first blah , blah , blah . I paid over $ 100.00 for 3 of these Chinese junk chargers.I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping . poor customer service , bad quality . for what these cost they should last.Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy these battery tender chargers ... ... ..Update : 1-15-2014 buy an xtreme charger ... ... I have 3 of the red xtreme charger , see my review ... ... ..	-1
I purchased this Battery Tender to keep the battery in my summer car charged up in the off season . Unfortunately this battery tender caused my battery to leak acid all over the trunk of my car causing corrosion and requiring an expensive repair . I purchased this unit specifically because it 's NOT supposed to overcharge a car battery . What a mistake . Do n't buy this product - it does n't work as advertised . I reached out to the manufacturer via their website twice but they never responded to me . Faulty product + no customer service = fail .	-1
Add me to the list of failures ... after 11 months . I do not know why I ignored over 30 one star reviews . I thought with all of the positives , they must be flukes . Well mine just fried , nasty burnt electronics smell , no lights , no output . It did not hurt the car it was attached to and I discovered it very soon after failure . It is not worth the hassle indicated by others to file a warranty claim . I ordered an Xtreme hoping for longer life and good performance . Anybody reading this review , beware ! The failure rate on these Deltrans is too high .	-1
Had my battery tender plus for just over 2 years and it worked great for those 2 years maintaining the battery in an antique car . Recently I put it on the battery on my daily driver and the charge light did n't come on . Testing on several other batteries seems its lost its status lights and all its regulation and just puts out a constant 15 volts now cooking whatever battery I hook it up to . Their tech support was rude and unknowledgeable . Of course their warranty is a joke since it will cost 50 % of its value just to make use of their warranty . I considered buying another but with so many other choices now on the market I ca n't rationalize the battery tenders high price . I replaced it with a Vector for the same price which has twice the features .	-1
Bought this because of all the reviews , but it did not work for me . My Harley uses an AGM battery , and found out after the purchase that this charger can not charge an AGM battery . For a simple battery maintainer , this product is big and heavy . I expected more .	-1
save your money . cheap plastic stuff that wont work . it wont stay on the mirror it is supposed to attach to . falls off blows off .	-1
Highly recommended . Just make sure it has ample water to get started ( 1 gallon minimum ) . Used in warm and cooler weather without issue . *Update : 4/2014 : after camping an entire season with these , I found that they did n't work very well . Tissue and waste did n't seem to break down very well , and it most certainly does n't mask odors very well . I even tried using 2 packets instead of one ( for a 30 gallon tank ) ; no difference aside from things being very blue ! I think I 'm going to try the `` tried and true '' Happy Campers Organic treatment next .	-1
I have been using the liquid blue stuff for 4 years and never had a problem until trying these blue packets . Now I had to call out a pluber because the toilet paper was not breaking down . Do n't waste your money on this stuff ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! And by the way amazon won ; t let you return it either ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Works like crap . Does not allow enough air in to blow lines out . Save your money and use an air nozzle instead . Trust me !	-1
This product is for turning a petcock valve , not for removing/installing a drain plug . It 's my fault for not reading the description clearly , but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer . The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension ( which I dont ' have ) it is a pain to screw and unscrew . Even though this plug is only finger-tight .	-1
I had this unit for about 2 months . Works fairly well . The tabs on the bottom of the unit broke after a month . I used tape for awhile and then gave up on it . Try the : Valterra A10-2606 FridgeCool 11.28 mA Fan with On/Off Switch . I 've had it for five years without any problem . The Valterra is much easier on batteries too .	-1
Maybe on bus-sized class A motorhomes with larger refrigerators this is useful , but it is not any good for my RV refrigerator ( 26 ft vehicle , decent sized refrigerator ) . I do n't use this , as it is too large , and use the single bars instead . They work well .	-1
broke on day 1. bit cheap in construction.would recommend different product , or even a different approach all together	-1
I found washing cars at home in Florida did not give the same results as California Bay Area water . Too much spoting and white residue left.Saw a review where some one else used this filter for improving car wash water so I bought this filter.PROGreat looking product for the costGret looking packagingProduct screw thread fit water tight to water source and hoseAfter a few gallons the water comes out clear and works well for washing a car and rinsing it offCONWater flow a first was about 60 % of normal due I assume to flow restrictionWater flow after a few more minutes and less than 5 gallons was reduced to 10 % of normalThe reduced flow could barely remove the car wash soapFirst few gallons had a lot of black , I assume carbon , color to the water that became clean and clear water as seen in the bucketNote : I did verify the high flow direction as the lable showed . I may try to upload photos later.OverallFor Florida hose water in the space coast area and used for car wash this is not a good product . For a motorcycle or small product okay.For other uses I have no ideaWould not buy again	-1
The valve looks good but I ended up returning it as it wouldnt work for the way I needed to hook this into my RV 's water system . Application was for a 2012 Keystone Cougar 327RES .	-1
Seemed like a good idea , but it leaked incessantly no matter how much I tightened even with Teflon tape on the threads . I returned it .	-1
No matter how little or how much plummers tape I used this unit would not seal . And the butterfly valve metal bends easily . Would not recommend . I ended up putting the original plastic plug back in . DIsappointed .	-1
I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater , as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location . If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense , let me save you the time -- in my case , the better part of an afternoon.First , a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play : 1 ) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater , 2 ) a secondary plug that screws into the first , and 3 ) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water . I believe the intent of this design is to allow & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve , while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly ( due to the larger diameter ) . Sidenote : opening the actual valve ( the smallest component ) drains the tank very , very slowly , and sometimes only at a trickle if you ca n't get air behind the water -- in my case , I had to open the pressure relief valve ( in addition to all faucets ) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking , the other components did . I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape , and at various depths . No matter what the combination , there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces . There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking . I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape ( 5+ wraps ) , to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering , returned the valve to Amazon , and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug . Hint : Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs .	-1
This valve is exactly what I needed to make draining the hot water tank in my RV a breeze . Unfortunately , it arrived with a quality control problem - the T-handle was not properly crimped onto the valve shaft . The first time I tried to use the valve , the handle came right off in my hand . Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it , I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch . I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose . Hopefully , it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road .	-1
First off , my fault for not realizing these are sold in single units and not in pairs . That being said , I 'm glad I did n't buy a second one , as these are hard plastic and will slide easily and not take hold unless you put a rubber mat under it . The good news is , you can pick up a pair of real rubber chocks at Harbor Freight for less than 20 bucks which work great .	-1
You just do n't expect these to be made of hard plastic and so small . But then you look at the price and kick yourself for expecting more . They work , but I highly doubt they 'll still be around in 10 years .	-1
This does not fit my wheels . It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations . The 100 is identical , except for the 0-60 it is 0-100 , but states it has a 11 '' hose but it does n't . I recommend a type with a hose for versatility . The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications . If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100 . This is not for all applications . Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away .	-1
I purchased the Camco 11553 Anode Rod for my Atwood heater . The anode was poorly manufactured and had a slight bend in the shaft . This slight bend is enough to mis-align the treads in the cap section to the point where if forced into place , it would cross thread the female threads in the water heater . It is not worth the time or hassle to return , so there it is . . . scrap . In the event the anode did thread in properly , the instructions indicate you should pull the anode once a month to be sure you keep the anode in a removable state . Apparently , if you do not remove it once a month , it will corrode in position , making it extremely difficult to remove . I have decided to keep my factory installed nylon drain plug as the plug of choice . My previous RV was over 8 years old when I sold it and I never had corrosion problems with the nylon plug . Save your money .	-1
Easy to install but on the 4th day the self tapping bolts came out-stripped out of the frame . It was adjusted as recommended and I never backed up or turned too tightly . I felt it helped and will likely pay to have it welded in place . Lost one pin and 4three bolts . I would probably buy a Reese equalizer hitch with anti-sway next time but I have an Eaz type .	-1
Do n't buy Optima Batteries ! Pure junk . After Johnson Controls bought Optima and moved the factory to Mexico they have gone downhill . The last three I bought all went bad , one before I was even able to use it . I had bought an Optima to power my 56 Chevy , and after it sat unused for a month , I went to try and start a new motor ... nothing . Would n't even take a charge . Save your money and get one at the local parts store with a warranty.FYI essentially all auto batteries in the US are made by only 2 companies and then branded . Exide and Johnson Controls . Check it out .	-1
They are rather small and really cheaply constructed i could have bought stuff at the store to build these cheaper they went with my old pop up trailer when i traded it in .	-1
Only the stand is aluminum . The center shaft , handle , and top are steel . Mine started to rust within a week of use .	-1
All of frams oil filters are nothing but cardboard inside . I saw several video 's on youtube showing how bad these are so I cut my old one open at 3000 mi . to see if its true . Its TRUE ! All cardboard even the end caps . Even the tough guards ! All fram filters are like this . Whats worse is the pleats . The cardboard pleats close shut and this makes the oil have to seek another open pleat to enter . Mine had half of its pleats closed . That means only half the oil filter was working.Next is the seem were the pleated rows are connected . It was open half way up the seam because the glue came loose ! That means dirty oil was by passing the filter all together . These are the worst filters on the market no doubt . Fram just spent so much money blowing smoke up our tails we believe they are good filters ... .Cut your old fram open and look inside . If you dont want to get dirty just go too youtube and type in fram oil filter . NOTHING BUT GARBAGE ! Fram could'nt care less about the life of your car . Buy anything else but fram ! ANYTHING .	-1
Cheapo replacement for the one I wore out . But the tip has not cover on the metal wire wrapped around the bristles so I can pretty much guarantee it 'll scratch the tire . Until I find a good rubber tip to glue on it wo n't get used on my wheels . Not worth sending back . This is not the one to buy until they fix that little tip .	-1
I bought this due to positive reviews but never again . I leaves streaks and smudging no matter how I tried to use it even applied more than once . Tried it on window glass in the home , mirrors , and car glass , all the same result . Really wanted it to work but plain water would do better . I rarely write a review this negative but this one earned it .	-1
On the advice of a friend , I replaced my Toyota Tacoma 's manual transmission gear oil with this Royal Purple Max . From the start , I encountered poor shifting and excessive gear noise . After two months the shifting got so bad , I opted to replace it with the previous gear oil I was using ( Redline MT90 ) . Now my shifting is back to being easier , with the gear noise gone ... For the price of this oil it should have performed better than it did - I was very disappointed .	-1
I bought this to polish chrome wheels . The PowerBall Mini is a huge letdown . The foam started disintegrating almost immediately when run across any angle of the wheels surface . The foam is simply too weak , it rips and shreds . I would only use this on very smooth surfaces that have no angles to them , ridges , bumps , etc . But if you 're polishing something that simple in shape - you do n't need this in the first place . Grab a rag and you 'll be done a lot faster .	-1
To costly abd does n't work any better or easier than a brush anddetergent to clean the tires and rims . WOULD NOT buy again .	-1
I used this to clean an expensive set of whitewall tires before selling a classic car at auction and it was a big mistake ! I bought this because I wanted to use something safe to clean the whitewalls . It did OK on the white area , as in it did n't ruin it . The black part of the tires ended up discolored with streaks . It looked horrible ! The tires looked better before I used it ! 409 and Simple Green do a better of cleaning than this product.I will never trust this brand for any product .	-1
I bought three bottles , all sprayed very poorly . It came out in blotches , would not cover the tire well . I had to take a sponge to spread it evenly on the tires . The cleaning was not very good , better results with car wash suds .	-1
Per another reviewer : AN EXPIRATION DATE ? ! ? ! ? Give me a break . Mine arrived Dec 2012 and they expire Jul 2016 , so I at least have 3.5 years to enjoy my purchase . Perhaps the resin gets brittle ? Perhaps that 's as long as the lawyers wanted to wait for a suit ? They are also placarded ( and , to be fair , noted in the description ) to be used with 29 '' tires max . Fine for cars and trailers , not usable for motorhomes which will typically start at 30 '' and go up from there . The tight curve of the chock means that the larger tire , even a 30 '' or a 31 '' , hits the TOP of the chock first ; and this chock 's hard , slick plastic will not grab a surface like concrete or asphalt , so the tire just pushes the chock along.Too bad really , because it 's a really beefy chock with a great ergonomic design , allowing you to easily grab it for insertion or extraction . Sad to say , I do n't think the basic purpose is functional .	-1
this is a wallpaper seam roller . i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks . u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store . im sure this roller does work , but 13 bucks is crazy . i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going .	-1
My 6 years old Mazda 6 2.5 liters GH 5 speed shifts abruptly from 1-2 gear , did tranny filter change and drain fill 3x , before pouring this whole bottle in ( ATF requires 8.5 liters ) . No difference at all , stills shift hard . However it does n't makes the shift worse so I 'll give it 2 stars for wasting my $ though it 's a cheap gamble .	-1
This gauge is accurate and easy to read , but it is very difficult to get a good seal . There is no rubber inside the stem and you have to get the right angle to get a good seal . In the meantime air is escaping and its a game to get the tire pressure right where you want it .	-1
I bought this tire gauge a a little over two months ago . The first few times I used it , it performed admirably . It 's ergonomic , with a clear LCD display that gave a fast , precise reading.Fast forward to the end of June . After only three uses ( and being stored in my glove compartment otherwise ) , the gauge is now wildly off . After reading the tires on my truck as 32 PSI four weeks ago , plugging it in today registered 41.5 PSI . I thought maybe it was the heat we 've had this past week , but a change of 9.5 PSI seemed a little high , so I tested it with two other tire gauges , which read 33 and 33.5 PSI , respectively . I used a pump with a manual gauge to drain a tire and inflate it to 33 PSI , but when I tested the tire with this gauge it read it first as 41.5 PSI and ten seconds later as 40 PSI.Perhaps I got a dud , but any gauge that 's off by that much so soon raises a red flag for me . I 'll be looking for my next tire gauge elsewhere .	-1
we bought this at canadian tire and within a year or so the tire gauge split lengthwise along the seam - making it useless - as the air just leaks out the side and does n't measure the pressure ... i give it one star for lack of durability ( its not like we use it daily ... so maybe 10 uses ? )	-1
I purchased this tire gauge becuase I wanted a digital display gauge that provides1 psi resolution . While the Accutire MS-4021B generally does the job , there are twoannoying features that should be changed :1 . Batteries can not be replaced by the user2 . On some valve stems , the Accutire MS-4021B does not make a seal to get an accurate readingRef . # 1 : you have to send the gage in to the manufacturer who will replace the batteries free of charge . However , their turnaround time is more than two weeks , and I had to call their service department both times I had batteries replaced to get a replacement tire gauge.Furthermore , the batteries do not last more than a year or so , but I use tha gauge on a weekly basis for all my vehiclesRef . # 2 : this appears to be due to the chuck design , i.e . the contact pin does notprotrude far enough to allow a positive seal on some valve stemsI am still searching for a digital tire gauge that allows the user to replace the batteries	-1
Do Not waste your money . Bough a mid grade & # 34 ; full size & # 34 ; digital gauge and found this one to be off by 5lbs !	-1
Well , it works . Look , I expect a product to be user friendly ... this one is awkward to put on the valve and then read . It does not always give you a good readout the first try . I will have to check the valve two or three times to get a proper read . By time you do four tires your knees are shot . The digital read out is not very bright either . All and all I am looking for a better gauge . Lots of folks liked it though , that is way I tryed it , so its up to you.Of course , if your are young enough , and have good eyes and knees this is probably just right for you . Good luck .	-1
I , like other reviewer , was unable to get a wide enough positioning for the lasers to reach the center dash of both cars . I had to dremel out the surrounds of one of the lasers to get it to go to the right position for my garage ceiling height . Other than that it works fine and is a moderate improvement over the tennis ball method . *Update*After installing this device for a months , we have noticed both lasers are getting pretty dim . A few times I have completely missed seeing them on my dashboard and pulled the car too far . Luckily I use a brick as a safety stop under the tire or else I would have nicked the wall . Short product life .	-1
Junk . Watch the videos on Youtube . It 's effortless to get off .	-1
I tried this out , twice as per the instructions . Didnt make much difference at all . Should have just kept my $ 20 .	-1
Paint was thick and didnt spray on very even at all . Was trying to tint fog lights and just didnt work .	-1
I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue . Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work . Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg . to obtain return number . Then had to contact seller again . Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer . Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package .	-1
I wanted good quality and these were the highest priced covers listed on Amazon . They said `` only 4 sets left ... order soon '' . I ordered the correct size and part number . The correct size and part # was on the receipt/invoice when they arrived ( 19 days later ) , but they sent covers for a 13 '' wheel ( I needed 28 '' ) . When I contacted Amazon , they said my size was no longer available so they sent these . Are you kidding me ? ? ? 13 '' covers for 28 '' wheels ! ! Who made this decision ... a monkey ? So I sent it back for a refund . I could n't tell if the covers were good quality , cause I never opened the box . What a major let down after waiting almost 3 weeks . I went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day . Sometimes , saving a few bucks just ai n't worth it ! !	-1
Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price ... does exactly what it is suppose to do . ( Update ) After using this charger less than 5 mos . to maintain my R.V. , which is seldom driven , I have found that , because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly , the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead . Now , I 'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty . ( Update ) I have contacted the manufacturer , Schumacher , concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks , have received no response and it does n't look like I am going to . So , I guess I 'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it . BTW , I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers , one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable . Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender .	-1
Had it for a week , does what it says it does , but make absolutely sure the clips do n't touch anything when it 's attached . Positive alligator clip got close to inner hood liner and burned . Flamed up . Burnt the red plastic boot off and if i did n't blow the liner out ( I freaked ! ) , my vehicle would have gone poof ! Pilot error ? Bad design ? Who knows.Edit : Just called Schumacher and they 're replacing it , no problem . Upping my rating from a ** to *** . Thanks Schumacher .	-1
I 've sent back two of these and both have failed . Talk about cheap junk do n't waist your money . I now own a Genius G3500 3.5amp and it kicks big time butt .	-1
Another reviewer mentioned this charger puts out 15.0V in AGM mode and that 's too many volts for some AGM batteries and it caused his to outgas ( reducing the battery 's life ) . My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it , but the charger I got puts out 15.5V ! I did find specs that say 15.6V `` regulated voltage '' is okay for `` rapid charging '' on my battery but they do n't define what rapid charging means . They do say with 15.6V to `` charge until current drops below 1 amp '' which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage . Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite , starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90 % charge ( which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery ) . The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged , which may take hours , so it seems unlikely that 's good for most batteries and I 'm pretty sure it 's against the charging specs on my battery . Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it 's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery was n't hot ( it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max ) and was n't hissing ( hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas , permanently reducing its life ) . It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100 % charged and go into maintenance mode , but when it did , it picked 12.4V ! AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance ( float ) charging , so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V . I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3 , at which point I took it off the charger . Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I ca n't decide if this charger is broken , has a weird charging algorithm , or is actually very smart . I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago , well below the voltage it 's designed to be discharged to ( it 's a `` deep cycle '' but even deep cycles do n't tolerate discharging below 50 % , and even below 10.5V may hurt them ) , so it 's now damaged and wo n't hold the full 13.6V it 's supposed to . Instead , if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour , it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes . So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was `` full charge '' on my damaged battery so that 's what it used as its float charge . I do n't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge , but who knows.I also do n't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery , or for the `` average AGM '' . I spent awhile researching but could n't find any real authoritative information , just a bunch of people theorizing . Since it 's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I do n't think it 's a good thing , but then again I also found research ( nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf ) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life . So I do n't know what to think , but I 'm leaning towards thinking it 's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer 's spec sheet unless you 're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger did n't do a thing for my damaged battery . In fact I do n't think it even kicked in . I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode ( I think - the manual does n't say how you 're supposed to know ) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said `` bad bat '' on its screen and stopped charging . In all that time the battery never showed over 15 % charged on the charger , though it did end up holding about 10.9V . In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I 'm pretty dubious about it . It definitely did n't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm , which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage . I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts , and this is in 2amp charging mode , so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it 's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged . When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100 % charged . So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage , but I do n't know enough to be sure . Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car 's electronics if you do n't remove the battery from the car to charge it . 16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle , and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that , so it 's definitely a concern . I do n't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car . Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage , but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that , the design of the charger is nice . Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle . It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging ( although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter , which is annoying ) . A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent . It lets you choose standard , AGM , and gel cell , and choose from three rates of charge . The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries , so use 2A or 6A if you are n't in a hurry . I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you do n't have to worry about it `` autodetecting '' ( actually , auto-misdetecting ) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V , which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor , I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible . One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode . If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger 's output , and your battery is n't damaged , it 's probably fine , but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design , especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature . I also do n't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage .	-1
I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee . It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window . It only has about 8 & # 34 ; of contact . I will not purchase this again .	-1
It was quiet and smooth for about 2 months in rainy Seattle . It 's not particularly great . It 's squeaking now . The plastic & # 34 ; booty & # 34 ; that covers the arms I guess supposed to work to prevent snow from clogging the wiper but did it help ? Meh ... .hard to say . The ends of the wipers have some RED plastic caps on them and it 's very distracting to see something RED swooshing in front of my face in the rain . Why could n't they use black caps ? I 'm going to look for a triple bladed wiper blade which worked better .	-1
09-19-2012 . Not delighted with this product . Perfect fit for Jeep Commanders I own . Products were new in manufacturer packaging . Buying them from amazon.com saved me time and effort . I installed them within minutes of opening the shipping containers . Ready to go within two minutes . Great service , but the end result after only 90 days of use is VERY dissappointing.1-24-2013 . Nothing I do will make these wiper blades lay flat on the windshield and this leaves uncleared mess right in the driver 's viewing area . I 'm replacing them with PIAA Super Silicone blades . I expect the PIAA will perform better in the Washinton , D.C. area . I 've used the ANCO Winter blades before without problems but these units have a serious problem in cold ( below 20 Degrees F. ) weather . The rubber case around the mechanism gets stiff and the blade will not stay flat against the windshield when it moves off the curved `` rest position '' of the windshield . This leaves an uncleared area in the middle of the driver 's viewing . Not a good thing . I will not use them again . We have had several warm winters in middle-Atlantic coast area so I did n't experience this issue before . The rubber case to keep the ice and snow out of the wiper mechanism is a good idea but it just does n't work . Sad .	-1
I actually bought these from a local auto parts store . This was about a year ago . It started raining out of no where and my old blades were not helping . Right out of the box these worked `` ok '' . Within a few months they were streaking , by the time the wet season ended they were totally ineffective . They actually made things worse .	-1
These blades did not last a month before I had to get new ones.I no this has been a harsh winter in NYC but the regular wiper blades lasted longer.Not recommended .	-1
Do n't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB , it will NOT fit ! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere !	-1
Very cheap blade , mine started chattering in 1 week and I returned them . Buy a quality Motorcraft ( or similar blade ) Amazon has the best customer service and took them back ...	-1
The worst blade I have ever used . I assumed the first one was defective , so Amazon replaced it . The 2nd one was just as bad . About 30 % of the blade did not contact the glass - so a huge portion of the windshield was never touched .	-1
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander , and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However , this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander , nor would it fit other Toyota 's with the rear blade that has a `` wider than normal '' base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander	-1
I used for 1 day and and it destroyed itself with a pine needle . Now I get streaks where the pine needle , or any other item I assume , has been dragged . So unless you are meticulous and clean your blades before you use them everyday and or get out of your car and clean them immediately anytime any item may fall onto your window , do not buy these . Unless you do not mind streaks . The damage is permanent , not only when the item is still on the window .	-1
So I pour in a good amount and mix it with water . In the bucket there is a lot of suds , but then when I apply it to the car , the suds do n't carry over.To me , soap is just soap , however this soap has a nice smell to it.It does n't remove dirt or debris any better than the next soap , however I used to use Rain X with Carnauba wax , and that was a great car wash soap . It left my car shiny after washing and this -- I have to wax it after . I bought this at Costco for like 12 dollars , and it lasted me quite a while . I would n't go back to this as it does n't wax my car . Also -- it dries fairly quickly for some reason and leaves a soap residue .	-1
Difficult to apply and gooey . Made a mess . After I am done using this up I will be going back to my spray from Meguiar which is great and lasts .	-1
So I recommend this to clean your tires , but it will strip the wax coating off the rims and leave the rims really dry ... ...	-1
NO PROTECTION FOR LIQUID so it leaked all over the place . Was just placed in a box 20 times the size with brown paper on top . As they used UPS , and UPS does not handle with care this tends to happen . So I am out of my monies as will not allow returns on this product and it was damaged in shippment !	-1
I have not read anyones reviews , but I can tell you I bought a dozen of these , what a waste I ised them on aluminum , plastic and chrome rims , and the brake dust does not disolve , loosen etc ... water and scrubbing works better . Find another product .	-1
I love meguiar 's products but this wheel cleaner was a waste of money . It really did not clean the wheels as suggested . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I 've used this on two cars and I 'm not sure it 's actually better than the soap and water wash I gave the tires and wheels before applying . It just seems like fancy spray bottle of soap .	-1
I 'm generally a big fan of the Meguiar 's products , and use them for washing , drying , waxing , etc . Got this thinking it would be a good addition to the lineup . However , not only does it not really add much to the overall look , but the application method is all wrong.This product comes as a spray , and is designed , as per the instructions , to spray right onto the tires . After doing so , it does make the areas where applied shiny , but the application is uneven , and even then , because it 's a mist , it goes everywhere ( onto the paint , the wheels , etc ) , which is bad . So you end up having to use something like a paper towel or a cloth to spread the product evenly , which ends up removing most of the product ( and making a mess overall ) . Then the shine is gone.This product would be better made as a bottle that is made to apply to a pad or some other applying tool , as the spray is too difficult to control to get it only on the tires.Since evening it out also means removing most of the shine , whatever soaks in leaves a dull but darker look . So , in the end , the best it was able to do was darken the tires slightly . The product briefly mentions protective qualities , so a star for that , but it seems like an afterthought in the advertising materials , so I 'm somewhat doubtful about that . So overall , this product does n't seem worthwhile ; it 's more trouble than it 's worth . It basically made a mess , made the tires darker , but duller looking , and made the logos/letters/numbers on the tires less visible , which in the end made it look less cool than before . So , I wo n't be using this particular product again.Other Meguiar 's products are great ; but this one is not an essential . It seems like a very niche product that one would only need for special photo shoots , etc , in a controlled environment , but not as an everyday car polishing tool .	-1
The meguiar 's hot shine high gloss tire spray is not impressive . When I spray the tire shine on my tires , I find myself having to go back after about 5 minutes and wipe it down with a towel because it leaves drip lines down the tire . Kind of like if you put too much paint onto something and it leaves runs . The consistency is equivelent to regular grade milk , It is not a gel consistency . Another issue I ran into is , I will let the spray dry on the tires for approximately 30-1 hour and I still notice that it shoots up on the side of my car makings spots on my rear bumper and front doors after driving . I like using the gel type of tire shine better , that you brush on . It flows on better without leaving streaks or runs and it sticks better to the tires , not the side of your car . One last thing I noticed is when I spray the tire shine on my tires , it leaves a dark crescent shape on my driveway that lasts for months . Not a big deal , but it angers me that it sticks better to my black asphalt driveway than my tires .	-1
I purchased some much thicker microfibre towels , as these ones just are n't thick enough to soak up sufficient water . These are now relegated to cleaning the windows and wiping down the interior	-1
After drying my black car a few times with this towel , it performs no better than any other towel I 've ever used . Sure , it holds a lot of water but that is part of the problem . It does n't easily wring out so after just a few swipes it is completely saturated with water . Anything that I dry with it after it becomes wet leaves huge water streak marks behind unless I follow up with another dry towel . My best results have been a traditional chamois that is easy to wring and does n't leave streaks behind after the first pass .	-1
Once it gets wet , there is n't much you can do about wringing it out . It 's title is true . I do not know why some give five stars to this product is very difficult to use it . might not have used it and lie so bad that confuse buyers because they believe that having five stars is a good product but it is not true .. I recommend the pva Chomu . I have one for seven years and works extremely well .	-1
Let me state up front - I was my car a lot and I mean a lot . Two to three times a week or more . I normally use soft cotton bath towels and change them out as I go so I always have one semi dry towel to remove the last bit of water . I do n't have problems with this method as I clean my towels often and keep my car waxed so the system works well for me . No scratches or swirls.But ... I thought I might be missing something so I got one of these towels and frankly I really ca n't see the point . While it might be softer than a normal cotton or terrycloth towel and does soak up a lot of water , it pretty much stays wet after that . You can wring it out , but it just spreads water after the initial use no matter how much you wring it . If you 're going to use it as a first pass to soak up the majority of the water then I guess it 's okay . But as your car starts to dry you end up putting more water down then was there when you started . Unless you have a bunch of these towels so you can always have a dry one , it 's not any better than the method I use now.I just do n't get the point or value in using these towels and they 're pretty small too . I do n't know that it will ever be part of my normal car washing routine , but it 's unlikely . It 's a nice towel , so I might find some other use for it as some point.I ca n't recommend this to anyone for it 's intended purpose . Just use some good soft bath towels and save your money .	-1
Meguiar 's has always had great products so I thought I 'd try it and compare it to my Viking Microfiber Waffle Weave Drying Towel . It does n't really compare ... .far less absorbent , and too small . I can dry my whole Range Rover with the Viking ... this barely made it past the 2nd quarter panel .	-1
To be honest , the towel was n't really that water `` magnet '' . I personally find my old towel would do a much better job .	-1
No luck with this Meguiars product , Its does just okay when drying the paint after I wash my car but the glass is another sad story	-1
I was looking for a nice towel and after read these reviews I was convinced to buy this product . Im disappointed because im Meguiars fans and I was sure that would be a nice product . Its does not abborb the water as announced .	-1
Bought this despite the poor reviews , figuring maybe since most of the reviews were older that they may have improved the towel since then . Nope . Quite possibly the worst towel I 've ever used . It basically just pushes the water around on my car and soaks up some of it , but does n't really DRY the car . It just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air . My old beach towel worked 100x better . And I thought Meguiar 's was supposed to sell good quality products . Live and learn , I guess .	-1
This product is so inferior to Griots that it is not funny . Look , Meguiar 's makes great car wax products , this is probably a product they sub out and then add a make up too . It 's too thin , to small , just all together beneath the reputation of Meguiar 's product line . As a drying cloth not very good at all . As a wax removal cloth just not good enough . Listen if you detail your engine compartment these are just fine . If you are not a car person , these are going to be good enough for you , really . But if you are fussy about your car , wax it , detail it ... . these would be the product you want to use for wheels , engines and door jams . I already own them so that is what I will use them for , same a an old house towel would be used . If that is what you are looking for , look no further , these will do . But for drying or wax removal ... .NOT .	-1
I used it to wax my daughters car . It fell apart before I finished applying wax . Was very dissatisfied with this Meguiars product .	-1
Amazon said it fit a 2007 Honda Element , but the Element wiper arm is not a J hook . Amazon needs to fix their wizard ; this makes me hesitant to purchase other auto parts from them .	-1
According to the selection process , it showed that this product fits my car . I have had trouble making this fit for my car . Again , with all my reviews , I research more than the average person and thus far I had to put the old wiper blades back on my car - sorry ... . I hate giving bad reviews , but this is what I feel .	-1
The three year old Bosch wiper was squeaking because it 'd turned stiff and would n't flip over on the opposite stroke . I replaced it with Rain-X . The wiper streaked along its entire length after installation when I used my windshield washer . I 'd hoped that in a heavy rain it would clean up and work well . WRONG ! It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous . Luckily I did n't have far to go before I could change it . I 've always liked the Rain-X liquid so felt that I could trust the brand . Maybe I got a bad one but I 've never had this happen with other brands . I wo n't chance buying these again .	-1
Did n't last very long in the Florida sun . Not impressed with any of the Rain-X products . Would n't buy again . Prood that a good marketing plan can sell even an inferior product !	-1
Purchased a set of these wipers for my wife 's Rav 4 March of 2012 . As rainy season was about over , decided to keep them in the garage until a couple of days ago . Installed them easily.Fired them up to try them , , , ,windshield was wet from morning dew . Streaked badly.However drove off with them on as was in a hurry and felt that I would deal them later.Later yesterday , got a bit of rain . Turned them on , they streaked so badly that almost unable to see at all , , , ,the left side far worse than right side.Windshield is clean and smooth , , , ,no roughness or defects.Today I called Rain-X support 1-800-416-1600 and spoke to a lady named Adrian.Told her of my issues . She asked when purchased . I said March 2012 and installed a couple of days ago . She then said that there blades were only good for 6 to 12 months . I told her that had been stored . She asked if in `` temperature controlled environment '' ? . I said in the garage where temp never exceeds 85 degrees and were kept in original packaging in a dark closet . She said that was the problem.I told here that the original wipers on the Toyota Rav 4 were 3 years old and still functioned better than Rain-x that were 6 months old , stored properly , , , not exposed to elements and never used , and yet were far worse in smearing of windshield than the old originals.She then told me that they have 90 day warranty and with receipt I could return . I said that I purchased 6 months ago and had kept for when I would need them . She said that was too bad and there was nothing that could be done , , , , , that my improper storage was why they failed.I asked her if 3 year old originals that had been used and baked in the sun and elements were superior to Rain-X blades that had been stored properly for 6 months and unused . She said that she was not suggesting that at all.As an aside , , , ,made in Korea , assembled in China. Can not understand why Rain-X even provides a Customer Support number , , , ,as there certainly is no support here . If Adrian was my employee , I could can her as she truly is inept.Likely the worst product that I 've ever purchased .	-1
.Car waxes seem to have a fair amount of sizzle and hype included at no extra charge.After using both products , I preferNu Finish Liquid Car PolishZymol is : * Much less durable than Nu Finish , according to Consumer Reports tests ( Nov 2011 ) * About twice the cost ( see Note 1 ) - Shelf life is not as good ( see Note 2 ) If your time counts for anything , durability is a big deal . Same protection , fewer waxings.- - - Paste Wax Alternatives - - -These paste waxes are even more durable , according to the CR report.Nu Finish Paste Car PolishorTurtle Wax T-465 8 Oz Ice Polish Paste- - - Notes - - -Note 1 : Amazon price for Nu Finish swings mostly between 7 and 11 . Wal-Mart has it for about 8 . This compares with about $ 16 for Zymol.There 's an `` Online Price Alert '' that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price . Google it . It 's nicely done . Or try camemcamelcamel.Note 2 : Shelf life : I have bottles of Nu Finish and also Zymol from about 6 years ago . The Zymol is separated into grainy chunks and thin liquid -- hard to re-homogenize , but the Nu Finish is perfectly good .	-1
These little things are really cool , so I would recommend them if you do n't mind drilling out your plate mounts . I just wonder what kind of idiot would use larger screws in their product than the US standard .	-1
STOP ! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71 . It does NOT fit , no way , no how ! Get a 7/8 '' combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end ! My sensors were n't even that tight !	-1
It is a cheap steel receiver tow hook . Nothing more.A retainer clip to keep the strap in the hook should have been included at the very least . Otherwise any slack might make your tow strap pop out , or worse yet , stab your strap over the end of the hook and rip it.I have done a lot of pulling , vehicle recovery , and off-road driving . I 've seen every scary , unimaginable tow method . And , I 've seen people use things that were not designed for pulling like cables and chains . Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people , as well as do major damage to vehicles . Because , when you put thousands of pounds of stress on a tow line and suddenly it breaks or lets loose , it shoots straight back in the opposite direction and will go RIGHT THROUGH windshields , radiators , plastic , sheet metal , and BYSTANDERS.If you want something to keep in your trunk in case you ever get stuck in a ditch , or if you even THINK you 're an off-roader gearing up for the trail , DO N'T BUY THIS.Frame mounted clevis points are the safest bet . But , if you do n't have that luxury at least buy a receiver CLEVIS mount with a closed eye and a screw-pin clevis.Other safety advice from experts : Only use a soft nylon tow strap rated at least twice your vehicle 's weight.Never use a strap with built-in hooks or metal eyelets.Never use chain.Never use wire rope cable.I knew the dangers when I bought it . But I 'm not using it for towing or emergency recovery . And I know how to and not to use it .	-1
I bought this to pull small logs and brush around our farm . I got stuck in a creek bed which was MUCH softer than I thought . My '96 Ford F250 diesel weighs over 7500lbs with an extra fuel tank on it . It is a heavy truck , but it 's no semi or anything . I got pulled out by some guys in a smaller Nissan pickup , which was light enough not to sink in the creek . They took a `` rolling start '' of FIVE FEET , not more , which completely straightened out the hook ! ! ! I do n't know if I got one that somehow missed the tempering process , but what a piece of $ *** . Just for more background , the 10 foot tow strap was rated at 5000lbs , so the force required to straighten this hook was less than that . It might as well have been made from aluminum . I ca n't complain too much at under $ 20 , but I thought smittybuilt meant quality . I was n't taking a 20mph go at a stump or anything . I 'm glad that I could attach my strap to the frame easily enough . If it had been an emergency situation I 'd have been buggered .	-1
I received it as a gift a few weeks ago , and am selling it again.There is no real benefit of having such a unit.First , the mounting is an issue as you have the cable running across your dashboard . Having a second plug on the right side is interfeering with gear shifting and whatever controls you have in your center console . It would be better to have a plug on the left side . Using the one in the back makes the cable run all across the dashboard , no thank you.Second , besides the tachometer ( if you do n't have one ) what data readout do you really need ? Really need ? Nothing , exactly . Codes can be red out by any Auto place for free , and what are you doing if your converter speed is at a certain speed ? Exactly , see what I mean ? Okay , volts maybe , but just maybe.The unit , sent back to ScanGauge for testing , does hardly come on by itself , so you do n't really know if any of the fuel/trip data is accurate . This makes it already questionable , and therefore I do not have any use for it.So , for us it is another item where we have to question its quality and reliability.Less than 1 month old , contact me if you want it . I take of 20 % right away .	-1
Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted . They said it would but it did not . i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work . Not what you read on the package , not what the manufacturer said , and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I 'm a geek .	-1
The grease is perfect . The thing that bothers me is that I used this one time ( very gently I may add ) and the tube that it 's in got a bunch of little pin holes in it and now the grease leaks out in my tool box . To make matters worse , I opened the tool box the other day and the cap had split in two so now there 's even more leaking out ! I thought I could buy this and keep it around for future use , but now I am going to have to throw it away after using just a tiny bit on my spark plug wires . What a bummer .	-1
I started out very happy with these , but see updates at the end of the review.The hatch on my 2002 Grand Cherokee developed a nasty habit of falling on my head because the struts were starting to lose their lifting power . I bought two of these , and in about 20 minutes , the problem was solved . They have been installed for about a month , and seem to be working just fine.Installation was easy . The old struts were held by two bolts on each strut . Once they were removed , the new ones popped could be screwed in . You may have to hold the tailgate as far open as possible to install the strut.A couple tips from the installation:1 . Get a helper . Much easier if someone holds up the tailgate while you are trying to replace these.2 . You will need a Torx bit- not sure of the size , but it was the largest one in my kit.3 . The existing bolts are on pretty tight . A drop of penetrating oil on the screw made it easier to remove the bolts.4 . My Torx kit only had a cheap `` screwdriver '' handle to hold the Torx bits . I ended up destroying this handle because the existing screws were in so tight . It is probably worth buying a ratchet wrench setup before you start.5 . One tip- when installing the new strut , it helps if you snug up the upper screw first . This slightly lifts the strut , making it easier to line up the bottom screw.Hope that helps . The whole process was actually pretty easy- if you can use a socket wrench , you can do this.UPDATE : 9/9/13After 7 months of relatively light use ( I open the tailgate roughly 3 times per week ) , my opinion of these has gone from 5 to 1 star . They still work , but they make so much noise I am ashamed to open my tailgate within 100 yards of people . Opening or closing the gate will result in a very loud screech from both struts . Not an annoying little squeak , but a very lout , annoying , nails-on-a-chalkboard screech.I have tried a film of oil , silicon spray and creative language , but nothing will remove the screech.I finally tracked down the StrongArm supplier , AVM industries and left an email message on their customer service website.Update 9/24/13I guess after 2 weeks , they have no intention of replying to their emails . I called their tech support number 800-790-5438 . No answer , but left message.Update 9/25/13Another phone call , another message . Still no answer back.Update 9/26/13I passed the Amazon 30 day window , and thought I was stuck . But I contacted Amazon customer service and told them my story . Within an hour I received a reply , and Amazon is taking them back and providing a refund.So , a happy ending , but I will never touch another product made by AVM Industries.Update 10/16/13Got my refund , less a 20 % `` restocking '' fee . Chalk up $ 7.50 to `` experience '' And Finally- 10/18/13After contacting Amazon Customer Service again , the refunded my restocking fee .	-1
Bought two of these for my 2003 Grand Cherokee Limited . One fit well but the other was longer . I could n't compress the piston enough to fit it , and trying to screw it in ended up snapping the metal , making it useless . I put the stock lift support back in and now I have one new and one old . It opens better but still not very good .	-1
I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product , Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax , I was really disappointed about its wash performance : - the & # 34 ; concentrate & # 34 ; in the bottle is very watery to begin with ; no comparison to Turtle Wax 's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl . oz . ( ~ 30 ml ) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off ; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews ; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product , and I got the newest version .	-1
Meguiar 's Quik is cheap , which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean . It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it 's own beyond that of water . In other words , it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth . Any dirt that ca n't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put . It does have a nice scent , which dissipates in a matter of hours . You 'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers .	-1
I use a lot of Meguires products . This product turned my dash board splotchy and brown in spots . I went over the cart a few times to make sure the product was being absorbed evenly . It made no difference . The plastic on my console shifter indicator also turn blotchy . I waited a day and then went over everything with Meguiars # 40 Vinyl and Rubber conditioner and everything turned out great . I believe the # 40 is a much better product at least on my car . I called Meguires and told them what happened . They told me the # 40 has as much uv protection as the Quick Detailer . They had no explanation as to why I had bad results.The plastic on my console is still blotchy but I will try some plastic lens polish to try and fix that . Just glad I did n't use this on my instrument panel .	-1
I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out do n't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2 . In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they do n't stay put . When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along . I have to `` hold '' them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers . Yes , they have the rubber feet on their base but they do n't hold . Hate them ... .and would n't buy them again . I returned them .	-1
I bought this stuff for my 1947 Willys Jeep . The transfer case/transmission has developed a nasty leak recently , and I hoped this product would help . I added a full bottle to the transfer case ( which was leaking the most ) and a bit to the transmission sump ; they are interconnected , but have separate fill and drain holes . It was very difficult to get into the fill holes because of the viscosity of the stuff ( about the consistency of molasses ) . I drove around today , about 40 miles or so , and both the transfer case and the transmission still leak about the same as when I put it in . I can not recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission .	-1
Appears to be honda civic compatible . But after using Lubegard I have found a stark difference ( better ) with Lubegard . Lucas works but it slows down shifts ( about a 2 seconds delay ) and I had to gun the engine to get that power transfer up a hill or long shallow incline . Lubegard transfers power to the civic very quickly . I suspect that the reason is because lubegard is very thin and Lucas is too thick and tacky . Maybe it will work for you in a much more positive way , but not for me . I am surprised that other reviewers are saying that it makes shifting BETTER ? ? ? I will assume they never compared it to lubegard , so they would have known what smooth really is , like i did . OR perhaps it really shifts better based on the particular car make and degree of tranny damage ; so in all fairness , I can not knock those reviewers , but you can try lubegard . I stand by it ; if you want smoother shifting ( does not stop leaks if you have any ! Conclusion : I deleted my initial review , in favor of lubegard . Lubegard is clearly a better product ( but not all their other products are superior though ) . Lucas works so-so . I took off two stars after I found another product that works better . No , I do not work for them OR sell their products - I just love to tell people about great discoveries .	-1
This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does . I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers ( truck drivers ) who have used this with the same results . I will never touch another Lucas product . This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money . If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil .	-1
I wanted to save a few bucks and paint instead of buying caliper covers . I know paint prep is important for this type of job and spend at least 30 min on each wheel . I also followed the temperature and curing times closely . I used 3 to 4 coats on each caliper . Within the week there where multiple large chips flaking off .	-1
This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.I checked my tires once a month , but , I already have to change battery about once per year.The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure . come to think about it , thepre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars . ( Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting ) . The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap , I expect it should last at least 5 years .	-1
I must have misunderstood how this siphon works . I have never been able to get it work at all . I have tried every possible method and no luck . I understand how gravity works but apparently this device does n't . If you get it to work , more power to you .	-1
I had a time trying to keep the connections from leaking . As you tighten the connector on it would torque the hose and it would unwind and loosen the connector causing a leak . I ended up putting a pressure regulator on that had a rotating connector . It allowed the hose to untorque itself without unscrewing the connector .	-1
Found this dangerous for my 29 ' Airstream . It 's fine for level parking , but do n't use this on sloping grades . Trust me on this one . For smaller , lighter campers I 'm sure this would be ideal .	-1
I bought this jack stand to replace the assortment of wood blocks that I used under the front tongue of our 20 ' camper , weight about 500lbs , when parked at the storage lot or while out camping . By the second season the base had fatigued and cracked in a circular manner and by the third season I had to remove it from service because I felt it would not safely hold the weight of the tongue . I was pretty disappointed considering how much I spent and inconvenient is was to store away . I 've moved on to the & # 34 ; Flip-foot & # 34 ; jack extension .	-1
When I bought this product I thought `` great I wo n't need to bring heavy cinder blocks with me anymore . '' Well , I was wrong . The top is too narrow for my jack to go on safely . When I put the camper on it , it seems way to unstable .	-1
used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area . I had 2 little spots approx . 1x2 & # 34 ; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket ... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top . let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat . It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products . I used & # 34 ; Rost-Egal & # 34 ; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far . You use it once and just know it works . With this very liquid product I am not so sure ... It did not even seem to & # 34 ; stick & # 34 ; very well to vertical surfaces . For the next job I will look for a & # 34 ; thicker & # 34 ; product that will cling more to the treated area .	-1
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do . I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency . AND - I hope that I never do . It does not inspire confidence . It feels like something that would be included in a child 's toy tool set . Extremely lightweight . Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency . I was hoping for a tool with enough weight , which added to acceleration , would break the window . Again , I have not used it , and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product . I do not recommend this item ... at any cost .	-1
I had higher hopes for this , but for the cost , I guess I should n't have.Unit is light - about the weight of a candy bar is how it feels in your hands . The cutter has a horrible entry angle , you 'd think in an emergency your tendency while using this would be to pull straight up , but this is angled at more of a 45 degree angle so that wo n't work quite as well - things have a habit of getting caught and folding over with my testing.But the mount - oh my , it 's just horrible . In every respect . There 's a little sheet inside that recommends using sticky backed velcro to mount it . But the back is hollowed , with just a few thin lines of plastic that the velcro sticky side could even stick to - no way there 's nearly enough surface contact for that to be even remotely feasible . There are screw mounts , but not many people want to drill screws through their cars interior . Then it 's a really tight pull to get this thing out of it . Hardly what I 'd want to have to deal with in an emergency , trying to pull this out , having the whole thing come out because the velcro sticky back could n't adhere to the base at all . Then trying to pull this out of the base while I 'm fumbling to pull both sides apart from each other , while theoretically in an emergency situation in which I may be in a deadly situation , or addled because of an impact or airbag deployment ... Going to look for a better solution , since this one clearly is not it .	-1
I used Royal Purple Synthetic in my last Truck for a few years until they started asking arms , legs and first born children for the oil . I did my homework and started reading reports of independent lab 's testing . I found out that Royal Purple ranks below Mobil 1 and Amsoil . I switched to the best oil made , Amsoil , and never looked back .	-1
Do n't buy this unit . Buy Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate Valve instead . This unit will let you back flush but guess what happens when you want to disconnect the hose.I guess it 's only good for connecting a hose for extending the drain ...	-1
After the battery is mostly charged , this charger goes to 16.4 volts and starts boiling the electrolyte . Normally when battery is mostly charged , the voltage should not go that high ! ! ! The charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to.To make sure it is not a battery issue , I tried to use this charger on 3 different batteries and saw the same result . Charger at 16.4 volts and boiling electrolyte . If I was not keeping a close eye on the charger , it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte . I thought this thing is `` smart '' and `` automatic . `` Did I also mention that one time I was tried to use the charger ( see above for results ) it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan .	-1
I was expecting a better charger I could not recommend it to any one.ps it works ok but it has a cheap look to it .	-1
I planned on using this unit to charge my auto batteries and then leave it on trickle charge . However , it has a FAN which constantly runs and will wear out , just like the fans in the PC 's do . I do n't know , but I also bet that if the fan bearings fail and the blades wo n't spin , the charger microprocessor will not operate for safety reasons . Really poor product design to use up fan life when you want to trickle charge a battery over the winter .	-1
I tried to charge my car battery and it showed 12v at 40 % so after four hours it showed 12v at 100 % . I removed the cables and after 30 minutes it showed 12.1v at 52 % and after two hours it was at 100 % . Let it sit again and it was 12.3v at 71 % . I tested the voltage at times while charging and it never went above 12.5v . I do not believe that this is a reliable charger so I returned it for a older model SE-5212A . I have used Midtronics products so I understand the microprocessors and there quirks but nothing beats the old tried and true charges that have metal cases and transformers . Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this it 's junk . P.S it 's 3/12 Amp not 3/6/12 Amp . This charger works if you have a battery that is weak but if your battery is under 9 volts you have to keep unplugging it and start over and over until it reaches a threshold to maintain it . The cooling fan does not run all the time and the unit over heats and then I would have to let it cool down and start over again .	-1
I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting . Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70 % which is nice and after full charge at 100 % the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that 's where it stops working like others have reported ... came back to the battery after two days and the battery is n't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52 % . The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked . It only seems to charge and not maintain so It 's being returned to Amazon.Do n't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update . Amazon replace charger and was quick about it ... but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund . Done with this brand .	-1
I wanted to use this to fill transmission oil into the transmission after performing a filter change and dropping the transmission pan . It broke not even after putting 2 quarts in the pan.. Needless to say that I was not happy as I had to WALK to the next car store to buy a replacement since I coudl not drive with only 2 quarts in the tranny . Buy 2 or 3 to be on the safe side if one fails or use a different solution to begin with . I am using a funnel from now on in combination with a longer plastic tube going down from over the engine .	-1
First the good : It seems well made , pumps very easily and moves a decent amount of fluid with each pump.The bad : It says it fits quart containers but it would not screw on to my Redline quart bottles . I also had a gallon jug to pump out ( which it did not fit on either ) and while doing so , the pick up tube dropped off into the jug . Naturally the tube is an odd size and nothing I could find laying around the garage would fit on there so I ended up cutting off the top of the jug to retrieve the tube so I could finish the job . The end result was quite a mess of gear oil all over the garage floor . If you buy this product make sure the bottom tube is pushed in place tightly ! ! !	-1
Pump works great but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired . I should have realized that the cc volume it delivers per pump was going to take forever to empty a quart of fluid . Live and learn . I will still use it , but only when all else fails .	-1
Honesty look like a toy , really is a toy.This pump is too weak and it does n't hold almost nothing .If you plan to buy , check another bigger .	-1
This did n't do what I need it to which was to remove glue from my paint car . I even heated the remnants of glue and still did n't work . I 'm disappointed .	-1
Horrible material ! I have to say that this was a total waste of money ! I would not recommend this to my worst enemy ( yes I would ) !	-1
i bought these for my rv trailer . They are too flimsy and thin for the weight ofmy trailer and the do not fit well under the tires . the lip is guess you would call it is too thing to fit snug in place . there is no string to help you remove or pull them away when packing up . i am buying a different set .	-1
What was I thinking ? What was I expecting for 4 bucks ? I thought I was getting a solid hard plastic product ( maybe I did n't read closely enough ) . Instead I got cheap hollow thin walled plastic that is n't fit to chock a tricycle , let alone a 10,0000 lb trailer . These things will obliterate the first time a tire even comes in contact . Your tongue jack , and stabilizers are the only thing that will hold you . Do n't even think about using them when you disconnect from your truck unless you 're on perfectly level ground . use a piece of fire wood . These things will crack like an egg in cold weather , and melt like putty on any day over 60 degrees . Is n't there some sort of safety standards for this sort of product ? Do n't waste your money.Was n't even worth the time to return .	-1
These things slip on a hard painted concrete floor . Possibly OK on asphalt , but not concrete . Pass on them , get something else .	-1
Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Does n't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back , or hard-place them at the tires , because as soon as enough drift happens , the tire and chock move together .	-1
I was expecting a solid rubber-like product . It looks and feels like moulded plastic . Seems to do the job though , and it 's very light-weight.Update - Changed my mind . Forgot they were in place and rolled my trailer right over the top of them . Crushed them flat . Worthless , in my opinion .	-1
For myself , these might work ? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs . These are not solid , they are a thinner plastic , maybe 1/4 of an inch thick . They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them . I would n't recommend these to anyone , not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups .	-1
I brought this product to my mechanic to see if it is advisable to add to my coolant while at service . He told me never use with aluminum radiators . Also there is nothing wrong with my coolant system so he flushed the system with distill water and added Toyota Red coolant to a mix approximately 50/50.The mechanic added , only Royal Purple product he might use is brake fluid for its color so when you flush the brake system you can easier to tell the fluid is clear when purple fluid starts breeds out.I was laughing reading those reviews of swearing up and down how good all the Royal Purple products are . Those clowns are very likely working for or owning Royal Purple .	-1
This thing will mess up your water coolant pump . For some reason due to the additives it has , it corrodes aluminum parts . I had to replace mu thermostat and water pump on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee . Royal Purple claim that this additive is compatible with all coolants including Mopar , GMC ... etc . I do n't think so . Not from what I experienced . I strongly suggest you do n't use this product . Plus It did not make any difference in cooling although I had a 180F thermostat . If you are looking for better cooling go other ways such as upgraded radiators or different thermostats rather than this cheap product which can damage your coolant system !	-1
Put this in a Envoy XUV with 17,500 original miles hoping to maybe squeeze a little MPG 's based on the other reviews I read here on Amazon . What a crock ! Did nothing remotely close to lowering temp . Just lowered my pocket book by $ 28 and change because I bought 2 bottles based on Purple 's rep . I had e-mailed telling me 1oz per quart of capacity . Figured I would then put the rest in my wife 's Accord . Temp is actually higher ! I e-mailed rep back and here is what he said : I 'm sorry that you having noticed a temperature drop as of yet , but Purple Ice will not cause an increase in operating temperature . Was this vehicle running hot to begin with ? If so , was the root cause investigated ? No radiator additive will cause an a thermostatically controlled cooling system to run consistently colder than the thermostat set-point . The thermostat is there to help the engine warm up quickly be restricting coolant flow until the coolant reaches a certain temperature . That is its function . If the coolant goes below that set-point the thermostat closes and the coolant begins to increase in temperature until the t-stat opens again.If you were not having overheating problems , why did you purchase and use a product that is intended to alleviate overheating problems ? The product works as exactly advertised . If you would like the vehicle to run colder that the current t-stat set-point you may try installing a cooler t-stat . Purple Ice will help you vehicle achieve this lower temperature after the mechanical restrictions to such an end are removed.In my opinion FALSE ADVERTISING and a SNAKE OIL product BEWARE .	-1
The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV 's . Not so , not even close . There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work . Was a total waste of money . I 've had RV 's for over 40+ years , and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit . Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost . Would not recommend this product to anyone . To bad you have even give it one star , in order to leave a review	-1
it looks good and good quality however description was not clear , you will need to unscrew the guter and then drill and then put back ... . i did not even try , I had one before that was snap on , much easier . this one i will not use it.sorry	-1
The install was pretty easy and the theory seems solid however this just does n't work . I tried multiple times with almost zero cleaning . I would skip this product .	-1
First of all , when these work they are pretty useful . That said , I bought 2 ( one for black water and one for grey ) and I tested the spray nozzles on my garden hose before installing . Only one seems to spin fairly regularly , and even that one locked up on occasion . The one that was locked up from the beginning did spin if you twisted it with your fingers to give it a push , but that 's obviously going to be impossible once it 's installed.I chose to install them because even if they are n't spinning , they spray water in an almost 360 degree dome of water , so I speculate that even if they 're locked up they will help dislodge solids and give your tanks that extra rinse we all need . That said , this unique concept of a product is fatally flawed and does not work reliably as advertised . Oh and , like others - the clear hose that comes with it was also kinked bad - on both of them - which restricts the flow of water quite a bit.It 's an admirable attempt by Camco , but similar to other products from them - it 's hit or miss on the quality of manufacturing and the effectiveness of an advertised feature set . Purchase with caution , or just settle for the non-spinning versions from either Camco or other vendors.Another word of caution - pre-drilling the holes for the mounting screws on your tanks is not recommended even though the instructions recommend it . Your tank material is usually a soft plastic , and the screws strip the holes easily . Pre-drilling does not help . Plan on using a lot of silicon to make sure it stays on !	-1
Like other reviewers , I found that the nozzle spins or not , as it chooses . I tested it three different times , and it only spun one of those times . Obviously , this is something you ca n't easily detect or fix once the unit is installed.Back to Amazon . I 'll use the wand-down-the-toilet until I find a product that works properly .	-1
Should you make the mistake of purchasing these , do yourself a favor . Before you cut a hole in one of your holding tanks , hook this thing up to a hose to see just how useless it would be actually installed in the tank itself . I bought two , thought the first one was just bad because the & # 34 ; Tornado & # 34 ; ... ..well ... was n't . Really is a waste of money . Thankfully Amazon have a fantastic return policy !	-1
We have tried this product several times and found `` IT DOES NOT DISSOLVE '' as advertised . ( Camco 2 Ply RV & Marine Toilet Tissue ) It plugs up against the gate valve so when you open it to dump , the `` solids '' and the tissue can not come through.We have had our Black Tank Line snaked twice due to this product plugging up against the drain line gate valve . ( and yes we use the appropriate chemicals ) '' Do Not '' use this product in your RV . Try `` Thetford '' brand . Although only single ply , it will not plug up your sewer line and it dissolves as advertised .	-1
Found the same 4 pack at Walmart for $ 2 less . I think Amazon is padding prices to make up for free shipping.As far as the product goes . Very thin typical RV paper your finger will go through eventually . Have soap and sanitizer ready . 4 Sheets equal one square of Charmin .	-1
These are not good . I bought them for a fifth wheel landing gear pad and they are slippery and small . My landing gear almost slipped off one of them ! I would not buy again . I went back to good old pre-cut wood blocks and am glad I did . Do n't waste your money on these junky pads .	-1
I was very optimist about this product to help avoiding the stabalizers to sink in the grass , this past weekend I used for the first time in the grass , it rained and it sank deep and when I pulled the stabilizers up , and removed the pads they were bent , they do not hold their flat struture in a `` soft '' grass , if you do grass camping with motorhome that will not work , I am thinking I will still need a piece of 2x6 under the pad .	-1
WARNING UPDATE : 2013-09-04 . So the wife and I have recently returned from a wonderful 4 month trip around the USA . We left home on April 26 , and returned on August 19th . We towed a 29 ' Airstream . Naturally during that time we used theCamco 44622 RV Wheel Stop ( Large ) a lot . We also used the [ ASIN : B0012FEN0K Camco 44642 RV Wheel Stop with Padlock ] ] on the opposite side . I purchased them both at the same time 7 months earlier . I did use them before posting my original review , but I used them daily for nearly 4 months since this past April . Both are relatively easy to put on and remove and they seem secure , but we did have a serious incident which scared the H*ll out of us and is why I 've lowered my original stars from 5 to 2.DO NOT trust these devices to prevent your trailer from rolling . We nearly had a serious accident in a state campground in New Mexico where we were on a slight back to front incline . At the time these devices were all we were using to hold our wheels . Our tongue jack was resting on aValterra A10-0900 Red Trailer Tongue Jack Stand . In my opinion , another dangerous product . Long story short , the Camco Wheel Stops did not hold and our trailer rolled back over a foot tipping off the Valterra Jack Stand , crashing our tongue jack to the ground . After changing our britches and finding that , fortunately , nothing had been damaged other than our egos , we jacked the tongue back up and placed rocks behind and between our wheels to chock them . We immediately stopped using the Valterra Jack Stand . Temporarily I used some of the yellow interlocking leveling blocks I purchased at Camping World , covered with an 8 '' 2x6 . Eventually I got a scrap piece of an 8x6 beam and cut it to 8x8x6 . This makes a nice , wide , squat tongues rest and it will not tip over . We also purchased some good old fashioned wheel chocks and continued to always back up our Camco Wheel Stops with wheel chocks.We were lucky , neither of us were hurt and no damage was done . My hope is that by relating this experience I will prevent it from happening to others . Happy Travels .	-1
I tried to be careful , so I enter my car information . Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400 . I ordered and found out it did n't fit . My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit .	-1
I bought these cause the price seemed good.They chatter unless its pouring out I wont get them again for sure . If you want good wipers get the Rainx lattitudes or Trico Neoform they are both superior to Bosch crap..	-1
I bought this because it comes up when searching for a Cadillac Eldorado 1994 but this blade is too curved . It stands an inch above the window in the middle the whole way across .	-1
These are well-built ( made in China though , not like previous Bosch from Europe ) , they seem to be long-lasting and streak free , but the 26 '' left a HUGE swath of my windshield uncleared on my '07 accord . The 18 '' works great though .	-1
I purchased two Bosch Evolution blades for my 2007 Hyundai Accent on 02/07/2014 . Today , 05/19/2014 , I finally gave up and replaced them . I have never had wiper blades that performed this poorly . There was almost no contact with the windshield on either side . They left haze and streaks and would spatter water about requiring incessant re-wiping of the windshield to get it to clear . This , the 22 & # 34 ; blade frequently chattered and hopped when there was only light moisture . I 've never had new beam style wiper blades do that.I purchased these Evolution blades because last season I had a set of Bosch 's Clear Advantage on the car and really liked the way they performed . Unfortunately none of the local stores had them in stock when I needed new blades so I thought spending more on these supposedly better Evolution blades would be a no-brainer . With less than 3,000 miles and three months of use I just threw away thirty bucks because I trusted a company to make a quality product.Highly dissatisfied .	-1
I bought these at my local Firestone because there was a special on wiper blades . I paid 8 dollars for a pair.I needed replacement wiper blades as my OEM Nissan ones were starting to streak.I cleaned my windshield and put these wiper blades on . First rainy day came after 2 months of putting them on and they STREAK . These are TERRIBLE blades . My OEM Nissan ones that were older than these Bosch Blades streaked less ! I did n't expect this from Bosch at all ! It was past the 30 day return so I ca n't return them at all . Stuck with them until the next Fall.I do not recommend .	-1
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it .	-1
I thought these would be better than the $ 5 ANCO ones but they are n't . They are the same at best . Save your money and buy the cheapies .	-1
Bosch has always been my wiper blade choice , until now . These blades just do not conform to the windshield . It 's not on an unusual vehicle , just a plain old Dodge Dakota . They miss strips in both passes resulting in a messy windshield most of the time .	-1
these are suppose to fit , but do not clip well . the holes are too small . save your cash and just get the wipers directly from a BMW dealer , they are not that much more expensive , this was a complete waste of time and money	-1
These seem to be OK. Cheaper than OEM . Better than unbranded parts . Seem to get a year or two before they disintegrate ! Update ! ! ! Does not fit Hitachi L4 F23a4 Distributor ! Went to install and is wrong part . Will try to exchange or return . Do n't trust that Amazon `` This part fits your ... .Car '' thing at the top of your page . I tried several parts and a few were wrong .	-1
I did n't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it . After removing the cap I found moisture had made its way into the components inside , under the cap . I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap that came with the cap , see my other review . There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust , which I 've never seen in any other vehicles I 've owned over the past 20 yrs . This rotor was a PITA to remove ! Due to the lousy cap , the rotor was rusted on and had to be cut off . Even after installing the new one , I tried to remove it just out of curiosity and it was very hard to remove . I 've never had this problem with OEM parts . I wo n't buy this rotor or the matching cap again .	-1

Purchased as a replacement for a 2004 Ford Taurus . Lasted about 7 months before it burned out . Replaced this item with NGK brand , OEM manufacturer . I do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car .	-1
I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire . Right on the tread , small holes . Exactly what this product is designed for . I followed the directions to a 'T ' , the Slime `` clotted '' in the hole and stopped the leak , and then I drove a few miles slowly to get the stuff well distributed in the tire . I measured the pressure over a few hours and it held . The next day I drove to work and when I came to my car that evening , the tire was flat . Lost pressure faster than when I had the staple in . It 's been extremely cold here ( Boston in February ) and we 've got a lot of snow , so my guess is that this stuff does n't work too well in those conditions.I know people seem to have good luck with this , but I figured it would be useful to temper things a bit with the perspective of somebody for whom this product did n't work at all . Most importantly , watch out when using this in very cold weather.One more thing : if you look at the reviews you 'll see that 's it 's pretty much either 5 stars ( worked for people ) or 1 star ( did n't at all ) with not much in between . It appears to work for about 3 out of 4 people , resulting in a pretty high average review ( hence the four star overall rating ) . And that 's assuming the Slime people are uncommonly honest and do n't post false positive reviews . Put another way , THERE IS AT LEAST a 25 % CHANCE THIS PRODUCT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR YOU . A 25 % chance this will cause you far more trouble than if you 'd just had the tire patched or used a more conventional tire sealnt , and that will make you deeply regret buying this . I 'd actually say that for a product like this a 25 % chance of failure is WAY too high . So , consider the 4/5 star review in that context . 4/5 might be a good rating for a TV , but for a product that is fixing something as important to your safety as a car tire , having a 3:1 ratio of five to one star reviews actually is n't that great .	-1
When I ordered this , I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine . When it arrived , it was not the correct size . i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store , however , I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in .	-1
The Amazon fitment guide said this would fit my 2004 Chevrolet Silverado LS , 5.8L V8 . It DID screw into the tank opening but after about five minutes of driving , I got a & # 34 ; tighten fuel cap & # 34 ; warning on my truck computer . This cap can only be tightened so tight before it starts to & # 34 ; click. & # 34 ; It turns out that my truck has a cap that does not have threads on it like this model has . Look closely at your factory gas cap . If it doesn ' have threads and has a geometrical triangle pattern on the side of it , skip this cap . I ended up getting an ACDelco , GT264 cap from Amazon and it works just like the factory cap . The Amazon picture for the GT264 does not show a side view of the cap , but all you have to do is Google the model number and there are hundreds of pictures on the internet . I commend Amazon for their great shipping and return policy . I will NEVER take them for granted . I am a true LIFETIME Amazon customer .	-1
This cap was not good for my vehicle , the truck emission light came on which means the gas cap is not good and did not seal good .	-1
T.he website assured me this was a correct part for my model and year of honda . Well the sensor was right , but the connector was female rather than the needed male connector . The vendor needs to update his specs . The part was almost right , but completely wrong .	-1
VERY CHEAP . LOCKING MECHANISM FELL OUT THE FIRST TIME I USED THIS CAP . PASS ON THIS ONE . CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP . WASTE OF MONEY .	-1
I wound up spending $ 200 or more replacing my Vent Valve Solenoid , purge valve and Evap Canister because I was sold a defective AcDelco GT276 gas cap . I got the dreaded p0400 code and learned the first thing to check is the gas cap . Bought the Delco brand because of the tassle and hoped that it would be the same as the oem cap . Well , it 's not ! After replacing the gas cap and getting the same code a couple weeks later , I began to try and troubleshoot the EVAP system and quickly learned that it is a booger ... After spending the time and money to replace the above mentioned parts and continuing to get the SES light and monitoring results thru my system/code reader , I turned my focus back to the Gas Cap . I had noticed that the tension on the cap before it began to click was n't even as strong as the old oem cap I had replaced . At my wits end , I decided to go ahead and purchase the STANT brand gas cap and give it a shot . I read some good reviews about Stant . The new cap arrived and the tension and fit on it was 10 times better than this cap . After replacing with the Stant cap , I monitored the cars system and it PASSED the EVAP check . At that time I felt relieved that I found my problem , but I was also peeved that I had spent $ 200 on other parts because of this defective cap . So I would advise anybody out there to buy a Stant instead ... .. Oh , and the Delco is made in Germany	-1
while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart , the one for this item was off . the item was as described , and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like , however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine . this is not true for one reason . - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different . you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect ' but you also have to get a different filter . Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand 's website . If you do n't have flex fuel on your engine , this should be the right one , and its just a matter of purging the fuel system , and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side . the change only takes about 10 minutes . make sure you know what you need before ordering .	-1
Delivered today and looking forward to having this new cap to possibly get rid of the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODE for gas cap . WRONG CAP ... they sent the one for a 2004 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN 1500 LS FLEX FUEL ENGINE ... ..so do n't trust the amazon CHECK car app to see if it matches your vehicle ... this has been twice that the app has been wrong ... anyway ... ... ..THIS CAP IS FOR THE FLEX NOT THE NON FLEX FUEL ENGINE ... .DIF . IS THE FLEX IS THE SCREW CAP TYPE , THE NORMAL FUEL ENGINE IS A PLUG STYLE ... ... ... Once you open the package you ca n't it back , almost like burning 20ish dollar with a lighter ... .NOT a HAPPY CAMPER !	-1
I ordered two of these filters . The packaging was safe and nice with more than enough padding in the box . However both of the filters were defective with top of the metal cans were bent.I returned them for a refund.Metal endcaps on both sides makes the total filtering area smaller than equivalent Toyota filters.Maybe a reason to use the bigger size .	-1
In the reviews of this sheepskin pad I found two differing opinions , one excellent , one not . I needed two pads and decided to chance it and so ordered . ( Item # 8000CAINT8 , # 019912525297 ) When they arrived one was simply outstanding , the other could not have been much worse . The sheepskin or whatever it was , was thin and ragged ; it looked like my dog had been chewing it . The other was thick and fluffy and fit perfectly.I also ordered one fabric Ergo Seat Belt Shoulder Pad as a backup . ( Item # 8001SL9LYG , # 019912535920 ) This pad is a bit smaller but works really well , I am very pleased with it and will use it on another vehicle.None of the three pads had any noticeable odor and all fit well.I am sorry for those ordering to have to face this quality situation . The good sheepskin pad is perfect but both sheepskin pads have the same number ( # 019912525297 ) . If you really need a pad , as I did for neck injury , I recommend trying the sheepskin - you might get lucky . The fabric pad is extremely nice as well .	-1
The plastic was broken when I received it . Does n't appear to affect function or fit of the filter though , so it is in my car today .	-1
I bought this from Amazon last year and went to use it again the other day . The cap had rusted through for some reason ! I keep this in a waterproof toolbox with a desiccant to keep the humidity low , but somehow it just rotted away . They product itself is great , but it 's pretty hard to use now that the lid is gone .	-1
I thought these were great because they worked great at first , but it was n't long until they started streaking ( just a few months I believe ) . The streaking was very noticeable and annoying .	-1
2 days after I installed these , I noticed the drivers side wiper looked loose/crooked . I went to inspect it and the little plastic piece that locks onto the wiper had cracked . I figured I just had a dud , so I returned it to amazon and they sent me a new one right away.This time the blade lasted about a month and then the same exact thing happened . The same plastic piece cracked . Maybe it ca n't handle the cold weather or something . It is very thin , cheap plastic.I usually buy Bosch brand wipers , but Amazon had these on sale for 2 for $ 20 , so I gave them a try . I 'll be sticking with Bosch for now on .	-1
Too hard to install compared with other brands.I am going to return to rain-x brand in the future even though it costs more it will save my fingers from getting bloody .	-1
Picked one of these up because it indicated it 'd fit with my dodge caliber , but unfortunately it did not . I did n't want to deal with the hassle of returning this , so instead I removed the blades from the wiper itself and slide them into my old OEM one . It works fine after doing that , but it was a lot more of a headache than a quick and easy swap I would certainly have preferred .	-1
I am disappointed with the Valeo wipers . They were expensive and have failed to deliver better performance than the cheaper wipers . In fact , they began to streak noticibly on two of the three vehicles that I installed them on , after only one month of use . Do n't waste your money ; get the cheaper wipers and refils ...	-1
on my car 's windshield . I lost one piece while driving in the rain . I do n't know why it came off completely without warning .	-1
I purchased this for my Honda Accord . It aligns TERRIBLY with the contour of my windshield and missing about 4-5 & # 34 ; of the windshield when wiping . I had a must more positive alignment experience with my truck , thus 2 stars instead of just 1 .	-1
Very small cars only . SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product . I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws , each 2 inches long , into my garage slab . The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up . The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless . I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab . You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire . I ca n't return it because it 's damaged from use due to faulty design . Wasted my money .	-1
Didnt work . Gimmick . Dont take this product as anything better than any other product claiming to do the same thing .	-1
I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. ( 021-0123 ) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it & # 8217 ; s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging . This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off ( Has a built-in timer ) . I called Deltran ( 877-456-7901 ) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus . I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus ( 021-0128 ) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead ( DBT081-0148-12 ) . The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery . I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment . Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it & # 8217 ; s not really intended for car/truck batteries . Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans & # 8217 ; complete line .	-1
I had one of these and paid way to much for it . I bought it to top off three 12v scooter batteries before daisy chaining them for a 36v scooter . Got it out recently to do the same with 4 small scooter batteries and it burnt out before I could them done . I 'm buying a real SC-300A charger/maintainer for about what I paid for this thing . This is a miniscule 0.75AMP compared to 3.0AMP for the SC-300A . Both come with the same 3 connectors .	-1
For many , many years I used the Battery Tender Jr. on all my stored batteries with no problems . The light is either green or red . No light indicates either a bad connection or the tender is dead , in which case you chuck it and buy a new one . But last year my garage went up in flames . The cause , determined by investigations from the local fire captain , fire marshal and a private investigator hired by my insurance company , was a Battery Tender Jr. ( the only thing plugged in and operating in the garage ) . It was plugged into my lawn tractor.I 'm not sure how old the tender was that caused the fire but on Thursday evening the light was green indicating it was working properly . Less than 36 hrs later it had malfunctioned and apparently overheated enough to ignite the wall behind it . Another reviewer commented , his became so hot it melted the case . He was very lucky ! Could it happen with other brands , I do n't know and do n't want to find out , but this is my personal experience . I 'm going to try another name brand tender now .	-1
The battery is brand new and barely used . I bought a battery tender to keep the battery charged , because of the lack of use . The Battery Tender Jr topped off the charge within 15 to 30 minutes the first 4 times I used the tender . Then the fifth time , the tender charge light stayed red . I phoned Deltran to discuss . The first person interrupted my first sentence to tell me it takes up to 72 hours to charge . I tried to tell her how I do n't use the battery , and about the 4 previous charges taking only minutes , and suddenly # 5 was different , but she kept innterrupting me to lecture me that I had to let her finish talking . No clue how she could provide usable information , since she did n't let me explain what has happened . After she went on lecturing excessively about letting her talk , I finally asked for another technician , who was excellent . I did a couple tests with her on the phone , and , while the indicator light passed the functionality test , it stayed red when connected to the battery . One thing I learned was that , after two hours , the charger should have been hot , and it was only warm to the touch. -- Later : My brother tested the charger , and it is not giving power . Battery is fine . Amz 's return policy expired two months after the purchase , so I emailed Deltran to see about getting it replaced . Have n't heard back yet .	-1
Probably a good filter but did n't fit the application . Amazon made it right , but be sure this fits your car before buying .	-1
Havent had the need for it just yet , but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though .	-1
I have a full size sedan and this windshield cover was too small . It also tended to & # 34 ; ride up & # 34 ; the window and not keep the wipers covered .	-1
Bought one from Amazon warehouse that came with the lower tool tray cracked where the front wheels bolt on , obviously a customer return . But still , bad design ( easy to over tighten bolts and snap the plastic ) . Want to like this little seat , but it 's so cheap and I doubt I will pass it down to my kids . You have to view this item as a `` good deal '' and run with it ; you 're not buying this item for the quality.PROS : Size , nice and compact but enough to save your knees/backPrice $ 21 amazon warehouseLooks cool , adds character to your shop/garageCONS : Quality not very goodDurability , plastic tool tray is very thin no doubt will one day shatter to pieces	-1
The whole thing is made of plastic , so if you over tighten even the tiniest bit , you strip the plastic threads and you end with with a handful of plastic pieces that can no longer be secured to the hood of your car.It 's a very fine balance between loose , snug , and too tight with this kit . I was screwing the star nut by hand to tighten down the nozzle to the hood . I could feel the nut just getting a bit snug when all of a sudden the little resistance I was feeling went to nothing and then I realized that the plastic threads in the plastic screw had stripped out of the plastic nut . So the left wiper nozzle now freely moves around the hood of my car despite trying to glue it down and use electrical tape to keep it one spot . Very annoying since I barely put any significant amount of pressure on the nut .	-1
Ok I think this is way overpriced for the product you buying , it 's defiantly overpriced , and it 's basically just a bag and it 's not attachable to nothing so yes you can place your locking Kay in there but where can you place it if it 's not attachable to nothing	-1
2000 BMW 323i 5 speed transmission went rought instead of SMOOTH as the product claim.I flushed it 2 months after and it was dark black and smelled like VERY OLD TRANSMISSION OIL.Refilled with Royal Purple.Dont like redline .	-1
After reading such rave reviews everywhere , I decided to change my manual trans oil in my Mazda 3 to the Red Line . I changed it at approximately 50k miles . Unfortunately , I 'm not happy with the results at all.The main reason I decided to change to Red Line it was because I had read it was supposed to do better in cold weather than the stock oil and I figured 50k was a reasonable time to change it ( yes , earlier than manual recommends ) . The stock oil was very stiff to shift with when the temps got into the teens and below , but shifted fine for the most part when warmed up or in warm weather . Now that I 've put the Red Line in , shifting is frustrating and notch-y at all times . It can be difficult to get into first and second gears . Warm up does n't smooth it out . It is indeed less stiff in the cold , but at the cost of poor shifting the rest of the time.It 's been almost 5 months now , and I REALLY wish i did n't change to this oil . I 'm thinking I 'll end up switching to something else ( or back to whatever was stock ) this summer . So much for & # 34 ; Improved shiftability & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Helps prevent hard shifting. & # 34 ; Wish I could share in ever one else 's success .	-1
I have been using mobil 1 1- 30 in my ax15 5 speed manual trans yj and it worked fine , but everyone said this is the stuff to use . I switched to it , and now the shifter is harder to engage , needs to go into first to get into reverse , just not as good as the mobil 1 and more expensive .	-1
Had Redline MT90 transmission fluid in my 2008 Mazdaspeed3 for about 1200 miles . Although Redline was recommended on some online forums , it did not work well for me when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear until the car was warmed up . If the temperature where you live is always above 50 degrees Redline would probably be fine in this vehicle . Anyway , I replace the Redline fluid with Ford XT-M5-QS fluid and that has solved my problem . All shifts feel buttery smooth and the car is a pleasure to drive again .	-1
$ 14 a quart now for ATF ? Amazon has to keep the price at $ 10.49 per bottle . Otherwise there is no point in buying it from amazon . Local auto-racing stores sell it for $ 10.49.As for performance I did 3 drain and refills on my car , I have not seen any difference in shifting . The fluid gets dark very fast ( after driving a few miles ) , unlike some other ATFs .	-1
supposed to slip in.. well you got ta smash it in and am scared to try it with my trailer hitch lights. wan na see if I can return it	-1
This adapter works for certain functions , such as the brakes lights and turn signals . It is missing the center pin ground needed for the running lights to work . I purchased another manufacturer 's unit elsewhere , and the system now works fine . This is a cheap , inadequate part .	-1
I replaced my Honda Fit horn with this disappointment . All the reviewers that said this is not loud were correct.It sounds like the stock horn . This was a waste of time and money .	-1
Sounded better than the OEM horn on my bike , but it only worked for a little over a year , then croaked .	-1
`` El Grande '' translates to `` The Largest '' . Hopefully Fiamm is n't a woman-owned company , otherwise they 've been living their lives full of disappointment.Want to get the attention of other drivers ? Do n't install the horns . Instead , keep them in your glove box and simply throw them at the car of the driver who pissed you off.Fiamm should have used a room full of bitchy ex wives as their design target .	-1
I bought this to spray colored stain but tried it out with oil based enamel paint first . Had to thin the enamel ( rustoleum ) 30-40 % before it would spray properly . Yes , this works with thin materials close to the viscosity of water . Good finish , minimal overspray , easy application . Next I tried a latex stain . Even after it was thinned 50-60 % it would not spray well . Totally useless for this material . Water clean up required a lot of scrubbing because the paint that gets in the air passages ends up being blow dried . I 'm glad I have less than $ 55 into mine because its not worth the retail price . Buy spray cans instead , no clean up and less expensive .	-1
If u buy this unit , for your own sake , only use water clean up material , because you will be doin a lot of it . Unlike my othe HVLP system I use for Urathanes and fine finish , this unit gets material EVERYWHERE and mostly where you DO N'T WANT IT ... ... ...	-1
Performs nothing like what it advertises . It is very weak , and easily oversprays an area . If you use it indoors make sure you have EVERY other thing covered . If you do n't , almost everything will be sprinkled with paint . I found this out and had to stop and do the paint job by hand . So I basically have it stored away forever now , never to be used again . I fully disagree with the High volume Low pressure that the product claims , as the volume it outputs is actually very low and `` sprinkly '' rather than a good solid `` wall of paint '' like those cheap spray paints in a can . You are better off using a paintbrush or roller , faster and better control .	-1
K & N Filters are some of the best I have ever used but there is a major problem with the description . It states this filer will work on a 2003 FLHTCUI , Ultra Classic Electra Glide . It does not . I bought 4 of these thinking they did due to the description saying it would work on my bike . I went thru two filters thinking the first one was defective . I the bought and changed out the oil filter housing , thinking it went bad , and installed a third one . It still leaked badly after taking it for a ride . I finally looked on another site and saw this would not work for my bike , the KN-170 works but not the KN171 . The only reason I 'm giving it two stars is due to the incorrect description . It ended up costing me a lot of money ( $ 49.84 for 4 filters and $ 65.00 for the parts ) and a lot of hours changing out a unneeded part . This is the first time I have been let down by Amazon with a incorrect description . It took me to long to do all of the changing out of parts to get any refunds so $ 114.84 thrown out the window , about 6 hours in labor and the frustration of it all ! !	-1
After 200-300 miles i realized i had a leak from under my SV1000S . after investigation it was the o-ring that was dry rotted . no telling how long this thing sat on the shelf before it was sent to me . I guess this is a problem that could have happened when buying it from a local store but nonetheless frustrating	-1
These filters now come from Korea/China , etc . They are no longer USA made . I have read on some forums that when the manufacturing moved overseas that the filtration percentage has also decreased . For the price they are charging , it does n't seem worth it anymore . I usually stick with OEM filters , which is what I did for my VFR . Yes , the 17mm nut is nice , but I 'm not going to spend more and risk filtration for ease of install .	-1
You 'll notice that all the five star reviews go back a couple of years when this bag was obviously made of nylon/canvas and was a quality product . Since then , the manufacturer has changed it into a cheap piece of plastic material that looks for all the world like a large , and admittedly reinforced , Hefty bag . It 's plastic inside and out with some type of reinforcing fiber woven through it . Feels like it 's about 6-7mil thick . The accompanying warnings about adding a down piece to your tailpipe should be well heeded because even with the exhaust 7-8 inches away , it will melt this product.Speaking of melting , I have serious doubts about the durability of this product in extreme cold - it will either become too stiff to work with or crack , neither a desirable outcome . About the only good thing I can say is that it is obviously waterproof with a good zipper system built into it . Unfortunately , I had to keep it because I actually took it out of the box , thinking that maybe the inside was canvas and they had moved the plastic coating to the outside for better weather protection . Well , once it 's out of the box and opened , I defy any normal human to roll it back up to the size to fit back in the box ! Oh , and the picture of the box it came in is not representative of what is inside the box . So , Amazon is simply using the advertising literature provided by the manufacturer although they should still remove it from their inventory ( or sell it for the $ 25 it 's obviously worth ) . Find yourself a higher quality product that will last for more than a few trips and if it costs a little more , in the end it will be worth it . Unfortunately for me , this is one of the very few products that is the correct size for my rear hitch carrier.Late edit : While the product remains questionable , Amazon came through in their typical customer oriented fashion and made it good with me . They also promised to look into the issues with the item and delete it from their inventory if appropriate .	-1
Some months ago there was a review here where a Tacoma 2.7L owner talked about Purolator filters being too restrictive causing excessive valve noise and possibly contributing to the early demise of his engine . I do n't know where that review went but having used Wix or Purolator filters exclusively on my 2008 Tacoma I have noticed occasions where it was exceptionally valvey sounding though I did not equate it with a particular oil filter being on it . On my last oil change I replaced the Purolator that was on there with a Toyota filter , and used the same weight Mobil 1 oil that I always use , and the valve noise went away ! I realize now that our old Corolla went through periods where I thought the valve noise was excessive too and it was probably when I had a Purolator on it . I hate to say this about Purolators , because I have always considered them to be fantastic filters , but maybe they do n't play well with Toyotas . I am going to stick with Toyota filters from now on.Edit : I finally found the other review I had seen and it was posted to the Purolator PL14476 ( which is the Corolla filter ) instead of this one as I had thought . Now there are 2 reviews there talking about the same issue .	-1
Pure One oil filters are grossly over hyped ; I 'm not saying their bad filters , but there is much better for the same price . I prefer Mann or Mahle oil filters , both made in Europe . The canister is 100 % heavier than Pure Ones and I like that their not available everywhere , and are intended as an OEM part . Do n't purchase Fram oil filters , they fail often and are very poorly manufactured . Wix is also good product . Fram = Fail.Maybe anything but Fram would be the best advice .	-1

Purchased July 2013 , used for 7,500 miles and carefully cut open with a longacre tool , the media had a tear at the attachment of a pleat to the end cap.I have pics but curiously neither the page nor the reviews allows pictures to be uploaded . Take a look over on BITOG forum for pictures . Since most filters are thrown away uncut , most people will never know about this problem . I guess I could make a video but I 'm done with Purolator for a few decades , why waste my time .	-1
I 'm not sure what I was expecting when I ordered these license plate shields . I ordered two Nouveau frames to go along with them , but paired together they did n't live up to my expectations . My license plates stuck out slightly around the edges , and I just was n't digging the look . I gave these to a friend , who seemed more than happy with them . To each his own ... these just are n't for me .	-1
warning : results may vary . Especially if you do n't fix the crack immediately.Both of my cars got windshield cracks . One had a long crack from the right side to the middel of the glass.The other is more recent and had a crack no more than 1 '' in diameter.Since the crack , I 've had to wash the car , use the windshield fluid , driving for a about 2 months , before I bought this kit and attempted the repair.The result is not good . It is just about as visible as it was before the repair.I 've done it step by step to the instructions given but I think the pressure to inject the epoxy into the crack is not enough pressure so it does n't really get into the gaps.I then used the remaining liquid epoxy to repair the other long crack and to no surprise , it did little improvement to the long crack.I am not saying it 's not a good product ( it 's even patented with patent number printed on the blister pack ) .But buyer be warned . And repair any crack ASAP without washing the car or driving under dusty conditions.I even cleaned the crack area with cleaner spray for my Mac computer . It as good as you can get , but still not good enough because dirt has already gotten into the gaps ( I think . ) Good luck on your repair and remember : time is of the essence .	-1
I bought these mainly because they were cheap and sometimes passengers have difficulty climbing into my TJ , however once installed they looked totally ridiculous on the roll bars . They are huge , look very out of place . Quality of the product seems decent , its just the appearance of it on the vehicle I don ` t like	-1
I was very disappointed with this product . I purchase this product based on the great reviews here . It says on the label it is a industrial and machinery cleaner . I am rebuilding a mobility scooter so i wanted to clean the grease out of the transmission . After draining the oil out of the transmission and dissembling it I soak the cases all night , tried different mixtures and it did absolutely nothing . Dawn dish washing liquid did a better job then this product . the residue justs smears but this chemical did n't dissolve any of the grease or stains . I wo n't purchase again that is for sure..	-1
I bought a pair one year ago based on the good reviews . It is cheaply made and does not stay in place . The straps are poor quality they do not fit easily and the tension has already tore one of the straps up completely rendering it useless . So I am left with one only . The picture is misleading and there is no way it will look like that . Most probably it will be something that repeatedly piles up at your back and at every red light you will battle to relocate it . The only positive thing about it is that it is comfortable if you manage to keep it at place . I have already started looking for alternatives , do n't buy	-1
Product looks good . Padding a bit thin . Elastic strap securing the vertical ( back of cushion ) stretches easily but loses it 's elasticity very quickly therefore allows the back to move far too much . The seat of the cushion has four very thin hold-down straps that depend on tiny plastic hooks to secure it in place . Seat cushion constantly comes loose . These hooks are so small they barely are able to grip the car seat base/plastic surround . With a more robust securing system this would be an adequate product . In it 's present form , keep looking.The 5 star reviews snookered me into this purchase . I 'm glad the product worked for these reviewers but it failed miserably when used on a BMW seat .	-1
Rubber is way to soft they all 4 tore within three days . Need to be made of neopreme or something stronger . wo n't buy again	-1
My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications . Can not recommend . The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it .	-1
Kit did not work the way I thought it would . Had a hard time keeping the spring attached either to the door or RV body . Spring is so strong that it kept pulling the screws out of the door or RV body . Would not use this item . I ended up not using is at all.Would not recommend this kit ... ... ... ... ... ... ...	-1
Although I consider myself reasonably , handy , I could never find a way to install this screen door closure kit on my Winnebago-Itasca motorhome . None of the examples cited in the instructions would apply to my screen door . Fortunately , I had less than six bucks invested , so it was no great loss to throw the kit away .	-1
2 of these were purchased and one arrived damaged . However , they were so flimsy that I decided these were not the solution to placing some sort of grille on the RV screen doors . Whoever makes these should be ashamed because it is a rip off and Amazon should not sell them !	-1
This level indicator works great on cool days ( 65-80 degrees , outside ) . I use it on the a-frame of my 34 foot trailer . On hot days , the water inside the level expands to such a degree that the bubble is no longer present . When I first experienced this , I thought all the liquid had leaked out . The next morning , when it was cool outside , the bubble had miraculously reappeared ! As a result , I can not depend on this level to keep my trailer level . It might work if I had not permanently installed it on the A-frame ( kept it cool until I needed to use it ) but , being exposed to the hot Utah temperatures makes this level undependable .	-1
would not stay in place . ever one who used it pushed it the wrong way & had to be reset each time it was used . better off with out it ... .	-1
If your thinking about getting this device take a look at the Camco screen door cross bar instead.This is a pain in the **s to install and wears quite easily	-1
I found out by accident that on my RV , you can simply push down on the round `` handle '' that is on the slider , and that will open the door . So at least for my RV ( 2012 Keystone Springdale TT ) this device is not needed . You might want to try it on yours too . This was not in any manual that came with my RV , but it is clearly designed to work this way . The slider is spring loaded in the vertical dimension .	-1
OK ... this seems like a good idea ; however , the instructions call for a 9/16 drill bit . Good luck finding that . I have several bit sets and none of them had this size . Home Depot said the could 'special order ' it ! Obviously it would have made much more sense to have an installation that used readily available tools . One could spend more on the installation material ( aka unusual sized drill bit ) than on the actual product .	-1
These looked descent when put up in my travel trailer but where on the floor the next day ... then on the floor the day after . the double sided tape sucks on these and needs a more heavy duty industrial type hold double sided tape.When put up you can see the white double sided tape form the side and it looks a bit ugly.Not impressed at all and bought different organizers from camping world that look WAY better and hold perfectly and are flush.Was past my 30 days return so I sold these on eBay for a few bucks ... lost 90 % of my original purchase price ! I would never buy these again.But all depending on the surface and for the price I guess they would okay for some if they would hold.Not for me and my trailer though .	-1
Purchased 3 . Good idea and worked for about 2-3 weeks then I opened up my RV one day to find them on the ground . Double sided tape is a major flaw . I only had 2 DVD 's in one and other 2 empty so should of held up . I did everything like clean the wall prior to installing but still ca n't expect a thin piece of tape to hold it for to long . Another thing is you can see the white foam tape on the sides after attaching which looks poor . I did n't give up though ... I mounted them with small brass L brackets and screws now and no more issues .	-1
This would be a great idea if it actually was n't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets . I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit . But you really ca n't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description . Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully . Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing . It was a waste and I did n't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions , and doing some thoughtful measuring .	-1
We started with this one but were loathe to drill into the door to secure it . We tried double sided tape but the plastic was warped and curved and would not stay . This product is cheap ( in every sense ) . It does not hold that many bags and is a bit of a pain to use since it does not hold that much and you really have to push and pull to get the bags in and out . We replaced it with a metal version that hangs over the top of the door and is working much better .	-1
does n't hang very secure to under sink door , even when I gently put bag in or out I have to hold it with my other hand worried it will come apart	-1
Would I buy this again NO . Here 's why . I missed it but no where do they say these are Sheep skin . I may be wrong but suspect this one I got is domestic goat skin . A smaller one I bought I have no doubt is Pig Skin . Since they are made in China this has made me really compare and check them closely , since most Chinese products are inferior quality . First the package has 4 LARGE STAPLES that go through the skin Every layer ) and if you do n't open these CAREFULLY you will tear it , since they double back on themselves . Some reviewers report holes developing when used and I can believe that . Second no where does this company say it is lamb or sheep skin , which leads me to believe it probably is pig or domestic goat skin , or horse hide . Is it going to scratch my new cars paint or hold up long ? Good question . I also bought the 2 foot one and have no doubt it 's not sheep or lambs skin . I 'll review it later and probably will never use it on my car paint since I fear it will scratch the new Clear Coat paint . The 5 foot one is thin enough and buffed fairly well , so its soft . But I have the ACME Brand made in Turkey also ( same sizes ) and those have instructions to wash with a mild soap to remove excess cod oil before using , ( that 's normal ) and when you do you will see the excess oil . ( I use mild bar hand soap ) These Detailer 's Choice ones do n't tell you that and if you compare them you can see a difference in the amount of oil used when looking at them unwashed . ( AS an aside the Chinese made chamois have had import restrictions place on them in Europe due to the inferior quality , deceptive advertising , etc . But not those from Turkey ) Both of the Detailer 's Choice leather skins are cut nice and rectangular , which shows they come from a large skin . Now I do n't often write negative reviews but check what I 'm saying by researching on the net . If I had done that first I would never have bought these . Yes I could return them but after deducting the return fee and shipping it is n't worth it . I think of this mistake as a lesson learned and would not recommend these nor buy them again . Other negative reviews are probably right on the mark.ADDENDUM : After writing this review while showing these to my wife I laid them on a dark bedspread . MISTAKE ; since they left a ton of hide lint behind on it , ( had to vacuum ) . So I washed them with hand soap and water in a sink and could n't believe the amount of hide lint in the water . Washed them twice then rinsed them three times and was still getting a large amount of hide lint coming off . My wife saw that and said , '' No way are you using those on my car . '' Haaa So my next step is to hang them out side after drying and use a water hose to try and stop the lint problem . I 'm 69 years old and have used both synthetic and natural Chamois for years and have never seen anything to match this . With that much lint coming off no way to wax after use . Another negative reviewer rated them as a POS and believe he has that right . Never would buy again nor recommend to anyone . Hope this helps someone not to make a mistake .	-1
This chamois is very thin and will not last long . I purchased same item two months ago and is falling apart . After purchasing again realized this chamois is too thin and will not hold up with repeated usage .	-1
Purchased this for my garage , but was disappointed . The title says this is a smart charger , but it is actually just a big linear charger . Worse , this charger never shuts off , so you can not leave it connected for long periods of time . So I took one star off for bad description , and one star for charger not being turning off . The build quality is rather cheap , so i took another star off for that . Overall , not for me . I will be sending this unit back .	-1
At least my car was in the driveway when it decided not to start so it wasnt too bad . I am now searching on amazon for one with higher than 400 power.It would not start my six cylinder engine on my crossfire . I think it will be ok in the other vehicles that have four cylinders . No way this would ever start a V8 . It was fully charged just not enough oomph . The K & K ; models look interesting but I am not excited about having to tend them while they are charged to prevent damage . Unit does work well for powering less taxing things though and the pump works well , just wont start your car if you have a six cylinder or up.In the end just used them for mobile compressor to air up tires until they all diedHope this helps .	-1
Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts . This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento .	-1
so happy to receive it sooner than I thought . got very disappointed with all missing stuff in the box . manual etc .	-1
Try unit out when I first bought it . Everything seem ok. Did not use for a month and then when I try it again , background light no longer works . Only used it once prior to light burning out . Too late to return unit with incurring shipping cost .	-1
I give it 2 stars because of the following:1 ) it sticks out by about 4 inches from the dash , so its very ackward to leave it in the dash2 ) it will stay on even when the car is completely turned off3 ) I called the manufacture and asked them the current draw , they searched and could not tell meSo based on the above points , i have to give it a 2 star . I do n't feel comfortable leaving it plugged in all the time as it might drain my battery . But if you want to use it as a tester from time to time , it will work very well .	-1
First of all , the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second , once the car is started , you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display , indicating that a charge is occurring . However , this is a static icon , it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom . And in case you should forget I guess , they even added a little battery icon in the display.However , I seriously question the accuracy of these units ( this is the second one ) .When plugged in ( my van has multiple outlets , I check on 4 of them ) , the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light . Wow , never had an issue with my battery nor charging system . Started the car ( which it did fine ) , unit showed 14.8 Volts . Really ! I went to the shop and had everything checked . My high-output alternator ( 120 amps ) was working above manufacturer 's specs ; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit , the replacement showed the same odd numbers . Now , the manual you can download from Equus ( wich does not come with the unit ) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc . etc . I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging ( meaning battery is full ) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to , well , monitor your battery . For this you need accurate readings , and I can not see these on this unit .	-1
INNOVA 3030 Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII Vehiclesi purchased this product last month and i do n't know why . it reads your on-board computer alright . but if you want a detail report of a problem you might be having with your check engine light on , they charge you a fee for a complete detail report.AUTOZONE , ADVANCEAUTO AND CARQUEST will test your vehicle free of charge and will provide you with a detail report for free.the fleecing of america continues by online companies.AMAZON , SHAME OF YOU ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I 'm surprised so many people give this high marks . To me it seems like nothing but a come on to get you to buy a $ 20/month website service with which to interpret the readings .	-1
Battery test lights quit working after after two or three times using it.Do n't waste your $ $	-1
I am NOT impressed with this multimeter . The controlls are NOT intuitive to anyone who is used to using multimeters . The battery check function is just a gimmick . I am NOT comfortable with a meter that ALWAYS shows a reading even when not connected to anything ... .	-1
Ok yes I know this should keep everything in place and tight but does n't look very tight and it has lots of play in it not my time	-1
My petite wife , stands at 5'3 '' , in her 50s , cut through the top portion ( the `` hardened steel '' ) portion of the lock in 75 minutes with a HAND SAW blade . Imagine what a power tool would have done through this lock.I ca n't recommend it .	-1
I just got two of these for my avalanch . They are very load and easy to hook up and mount . I had to come back and edit my review because one has blown out and the other one sounds funny w/o both working . I just ordered new horns and try to mount in a different spot . I was unaware you can Not mount these in oem position , evedently they are not water proof , soo , i will be replacing with different horns .	-1
I bought this to do some revival on some plastics . I actually wrote a small article in a DIY Forum for Ram trucks . It looked good at first but 3 months later all the black has come off.This does n't seem to truely be a dye , more of a paint on color . I cleaned and prepped everything well and do n't believe that to be the issue .	-1
I followed the instructions to the `` T '' on my '10 Wrangler . I let it dry 3-4 hours between three coats . The first time it rained , the `` finish '' spotted up , and looked terrible . VERY Disappointed .	-1
I bought this for the wrong Jeep so I returned it anyway , but it seemed very flimsy to me . A screwdriver could easily get this mechanism open .	-1
I used this is a 2008 Freightliner with a Detroit engine . The engine was in good shape but I just had to try it . It did nothing . Snake oil I tell ya . Pure Snake oil .	-1
I am disappointed on how well you can see through it . I bought it thinking it was mirrored , to be used as a sunblocker . This one is too see-through for my tastes . I had an AGV helmet with a mirrored faceshield that was really like a mirror . **update after 1 month . The silverplating spotted up and rubbed off after a rainstorm -- -I have never used anything but water to clean it . Very diappointed .	-1
To start off , I bought this product from Amazon , and then replaced it with `` another '' unit , then replaced `` another '' with `` another of another '' unit.I was excited about all the features on this product as they fit my needs , and at a very reasonable price . I need a unit to take on camping/long distance trips , to keep in car for emergency , to pump bikes and air beds , and of course to have as spare power for laptops and charging other small devices like cell phones and smart phones . ( Such a nice thought to go to a park and bring my laptop with this unit and work on a picnic table under a tree for entire afternoon ! ) So it 's perfect but was initially hesitant after reading many reviewers having to replace / return their defective units due to battery . And this is n't just Wagan , but Duracell and other units with built-in power storage.First one came . The unit was not flat on the bottom so it wobbled . Charged around the 34 hours max . I was most eager to see how long it can keep my laptop running . To much my disappointment , my laptop ran for 25 minutes before the first couple of beeps , and then 35 minutes before beeping ( low voltage ) becomes continuous and therefore unbearable . Granted it could 've been my power-hungry Thinkpad W510 - the one that uses 135W transformer . However I had another inverter that basically indicates constant use of 65 watts from the laptop , so 30 or so minutes is totally unacceptable . The unit was still able to run the compressor , and can run my car vacuum cleaner with DC adapter for another 20-30 minutes continuously after inverter stop providing AC power to my laptop.I pretty much decided the unit I got has a weak battery based just on the frequency of the reviews , so I requested exchange with Amazon . Amazon sent out a second one and I returned the first without extra charge . This second unit also is n't flat on the bottom and wobbled on hard and flat surface ! After equal amount of charging time as before ( 34 hours ) , I tested this replacement unit with my laptop again . This time , I got 90 minutes of power before it started to beep ! That was acceptable . Few days later I used the compressor to pump up my bike . Guess what ? The compressor gauge was n't working ! It showed zero while my tire was rock hard . I was debating whether to keep it since I was afraid that the next replacement will have weak/bad battery again . At the end I just do n't think it was safe to pump while blindly guessing at the pressure , or keep swapping with a pressure tester.Called Amazon again . The customer rep understood the risks with gauge not working . So she shipped me yet another one . This time , the battery is just as good as the second unit ( around 90 minutes of power to my laptop ) , and compressor gauge worked like it should . All 's good ! But then I noticed this unit also WOBBLES ! What 's with the engineering or with the assembly or case warping ? This third unit wobbles less than the first two so at this point I just thank God.I then tested the USB charger . It worked , but it required turning on of the inverter switch , which therefore kicks up the internal fan . That 's a bit ridiculous to run the fan while charging a USB device . I bet the fan takes more power than the phone I was charging , and then the power loss with the inverter ! The flash light works and it 's not overly bright but acceptable depending what your situation maybe in the dark . I have n't test the jumper cable yet and did n't need to . Cross my fingers that *will* work as it should . At this point , I 'm beginning to think the odds are pretty even ! The funny thing is all 3 units have a little gold oval sticker saying `` QC Passed '' . I wonder who they hired to do the quality control , or what was done before putting on the sticker ? On second thought , I do n't want to know ... The bottom line for me is if it works , it 's very useful and a great all-in-one unit with balance of features I wanted . 5 Stars for Amazon 's handling , 4 Stars for my third and working unit , -5 Stars for Wagan 's ( outsourced ? ) QC department . 3 Stars overall because I have the patience , and a sense of humor to laugh at this whole process . *UPDATE* I finally got a chance to use the car jumper twice . Both on V6 engines . With positive on battery terminal and negative on chasis , it took 2 - 3 cranks . The cars started , but the engines `` reluctantly '' started which leads me to believe this battery is not the strongest . *UPDATE 2* Finally got a situation where a minivan had battery with low crank ( AAA reported 136 cranking amps out of 600 for the battery ) . This Wagan , at 13V , could not start the car . The AAA tow guy with his smaller-than-this-Wagan jump starter started with one crank . He said it needs to be at 15V to have a shot . This mean I must keep this jumpstarter battery real full and ready to go all the time . However because this product does not automatically stop charging when full , then it 's becoming a jumpstarter that is only useful when the car 's battery is not in a weak state . I still need to keep my AAA membership .	-1
I own a previous version of this jump starter . My was made by UST and not Wagan . The exterior is identical to my unit so I assume it is made by the same manufacturer . I normally recharge it every two months even if I have not used it to maintain a full charge for when I need to jump start a car . I forgot to charge it for about 5 months and the unit is completely dead . I have try to charge it but when you press the battery status button , you can see the voltage just keep dropping . I have try to recharge it several times and I think the battery is completely dead . The charger adapter is also dead . I measure the output voltage and it measures a little over 3 volts . I take special care of my adapters so I do not damage the wires . This unit was only used several times to add air to several tires . It has not been used to jump start . Overall very bad quality.I also have a Vector unit which is now Black and Decker and it also was not charged for 5 months . This unit still had two red lights which indicate it was in good condition . I recharge it for several hours and it came back with full power . I also own Jump and Carry JNC660 jump starter . This is a professional unit with 1700 peak amps . It can hold a charge for months and still show plenty of power . This unit is the best but expensive ( $ 130 ) . This unit can jump start big engines and completely dead batteries.One other general comment for those people out there assessing which jump starter to buy . These lower cost , lower peak amp starters are only good for cars that has a weak battery ( i.e . as engine is slow to crank over ) . If your battery is dead where the engine can not even slowly crank over , these starter will not have enough power to start your car so do not blame the jump starter as low quality . I see such comments in other reviews . For a completely dead battery , you need a more powerful jump starter such as JNC660 . I have the same problem with my Vector starter which has only 300 peak amps . It also would not start a completely dead battery . That was the reason I bought the JNC660 and carry it in which ever car we own that has the oldest battery . I need to buy another jump starter ( I keep one in each car ) and am thinking of buying JNC300XL which claims to have 900 peak amp and is about half the price of JNC660 . The reviews seem very good and is made by the same company .	-1
Customer service is extremely slow . My product started failing to take a charge , we contacted the company in june - it took them 6 days to get back to me - plus i had to chase them down by voice after emailing their cs dept failed to get any response ( per the website ) . Then they promised to email the rma instructions -- which took several days -- but they sent the wrong ones ( sent retailer instructions ) ... . when i responded that the instructions made no sense - they finally sent the correct instructions . while waiting for their emails my husband tested the adaptor w/ a multi meter to find out it was just the adaptor that was failed ( and since they expected us to pay to ship the whole unit back we did n't want to pay to send back the whole thing ) -- i requested if i could just send the adaptor -- ( btw - their emails are also full of spelling errors and they could not get my name right ) , it took THREE emails to explain to CS what an adaptor was ... ! ... then 7 more for them to promise to send one ... that was july 7 . 2 days ago i still had not received the adaptor - so emailed once again asking where it was ... was told 'sorry it 's being mailed today ' ... . this product is used the most during the summer for us - we use it camping and at the drive-in , picnics etc etc -- and we have had no ability to use it ( cause we cant charge it ) for all summer ... then after they promised to ship the part a month ago i find out today not only was it not shipped at all - it was sent snail mail today from California ( across country to VA ) after i asked them and 'reminded ' them -- so the likelihood of us getting this time for our next use requirement ( this weekend ) is highly unlikely.finally - its sold as having a compressor capable of inflating truck tires -- it does not . it does not create enough pressure to inflate our 17 '' truck or rv tires.. ( we had to buy another dedicated compressor for them ) A company is only as good as its customer service - and they have failed at every point for theirs . not to mention a simple power adaptor should last more than 6 months . the item is useless if you ca n't charge it . I can not recommend this product .	-1
Outa of box , pleanty of power to fill my dirt bike low tires , and also jump start on a cold day my honda 450x battery , i had battery pigtails on bike all ready for battery tender charger , the fesature of cross polarity a plus ! good package and beats the harbor fright model , and added bonus of inverter cvharger for camping . The DOWN side the radio is very very cheesy , dial is off on settings , the sounds sounds like a radio from 1964 , Havent used the jump start yet , i will today ,	-1
The cover ripped after just 6 months , in the back section right where my license plate is . Despite the holes , it still holds up and fits my SV perfectly . I have the blue cover and it definitely does not look like the picture anymore . With the intense sun we had this summer , it faded pretty quickly . Not sure if I want to buy another one at this point or keep shopping around for a more durable one .	-1
I needed a cover for my bike that I park outside , this cover is made to cover your bike inside to keep the dust off . very thin do n't think it would make it a full year outside so I got a heavy duty one . I use this one for a dust cover on my tool box .	-1
I previously had the Nelson-Rigg and it was a lot better quality . Perhaps it was the Falcon an not the deluxe . In any case , this seemed like cheap plastic to me and the fit was a bit tight.I had purchased the XL for a Boulevard C50 with windshield ( the smaller one ) and saddlebags and it was a really tight fit.I returned it ( thanks Amazon ) and purchased the Falcon 2000 in the XXL . Hopefully that works better .	-1
First time bike left in rain this cover leaked ! Bike was soaking wet ! Do not purchase this cover ! I Just purchased the heavy duty one at twice the price will see how that one does .	-1
Did not work for me , I needed a rest that will adjust back toward me , Kept them on a few weeks but took them off , unless you have really long legs They wo n't work .	-1
Lazy As . Husband would n't put it on Kawasaki bike , have cruise control on Harley Davidson Full Dream Dresser ! ! ! So i do n't know what to do with it .	-1
Not happy with this companies very poor quality . 3rd charger from Amazon and this one was a replacement after the first two stopped working after only one week . First charger was getting very hot and fan stopped working a few days after it arrived and only used 3-4 times . So I asked for a replacement from Amazon and upgraded from the 2,6,12 amp model to the 3,6,15 amp Ship to Shore thinking it might be better since it was $ 12 more but I was wrong . The first Ship to Shore fan started making a lot of noise and then would stay on even when battery was done charging . Then it just stopped working . When connected to half dead batteries it would read fully charged at 100 % but was n't charged at all and used my 20 year old charger back up to finish the job . Now on my second Ship to Shore and that makes three Schumacher chargers in one month . This one right out of the box the cooling fan is not working at all . From my previous experience these chargers microprocessor needs to be cooled or it will overheat ruining the charger . Stay Away from this companies microprocessor controlled chargers ... They are JUNK ! Notice that the price jumps around on Amazon . I purchase this Charger for $ 52 and now a couple of weeks later it 's over $ 60 . Do n't waste your hard earned Money !	-1
So after reading the great reviews here I bought this item at Wal-Mart and took it home to charge my deep cycle marine batteries.Worked fine for about an hour , then I noticed that it seemed to be stalled at 85 % charge . I did some more internet reading and discovered that this is a common problem with this unit , the readout stalls at a given percentage and never changes unless you unhook it and rehook it to the battery . I did that and instantly the readout changed to 100 % .So now I know for a fact I can never trust my brand new charger to tell me when it 's done charging.And worse , despite being 100 % charged the unit never switched over to trickle charge . So despite being billed as a `` smart '' charger it 's just a normal full power charger that will boil your battery dry if you leave it hooked up too long . Why spend $ 45 on something that a $ 10 charger will do ? Not only is it junk , the packaging is a complete lie as well . Now I know and you can bet your sweet cajones I 'll never buy a Schumacher anything again .	-1
very stringy and gets everywhere . it also stains everything it touches and did not seal as well as i had hopes , still have oil leak	-1
While the product applies to the purpose it serves , the packaging is very misleading . Do n't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle . It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full . It goes by weight , but then why use such a large bottle ( besides it is unsealed ) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume . I know the review should only be for the product , but the packaging Is very misleading .	-1
**Edit - If you take something away from my post , it is that automakers design cars to run on specific spark plugs . Buy whatever works great for you car , and avoid spark plugs that do n't run well . These did n't work in my car , but everyone is different . Check forums to see what works best as well . **I drive a 1998 Honda Civic EX with a VTEC engine . I am currently running NGK V-Power spark plugs and the original factory spark plug wires . I bought these spark plugs to see fuel economy gains and maybe a power increase while merging onto the freeway.They work , but I could n't tell they were new . MPG 's for my car went down to 36 , usually 38-40 , and so the price did n't match the product well . What I can tell you is that using the right spark plug for your car is key , and trying to eeek out extra MPG 's from spark plugs does n't work so well . I tried Autolites , NGK , etc . iridium plugs and the traditional copper cores work the best . I get 45-50 mpg highway on standard spark plugs.So save your money ( I think I spent $ 16-24 for the set , it 's been a while since I returned them ) and buy 3-4 sets of copper core NGK V-Power plugs or whatever fits your car.The other thing to note is that replacing severley worn spark plugs with these will net fuel economy gains , but putting any new plugs in will do that . Do n't be fooled by these fancy plugs . Shop for your car and check what your car is recommended to use , because that is usually the best option . Your car 's computer is programed for the original plugs , not different ones.It 's your money , but read the reviews to see if it helps your specific car . It did n't do anything for mine.One plus is that Amazon is amazing with returns .	-1
What a load of crap . I just installed it in my 2000 civic and I did not see any REAL noticeable benefit.After all the hype about increased mileage , increased fuel economy , quicker starts , etc , etc . I have yetto clearly perceive any real benefits from using it . I paid a arm and leg for it and can not realize itsbenefits . For civic owners you can continue using the regular NGK plugs , just change them every 8 monthsand you are good to go . I will not waste any more money on snake-oil plugs like this . I will revert to usingthe regular plugs after I have exhausted using the iridiums ( since I already bought them , might as well use them ) .	-1
This did not do much for perfomance ... the original plug works much better . I use this plug now as a back up .	-1
I bought this pump because the seller described it as a siphon pump and I wanted to drain the gas out of my boat 's gas tank.What I got , was a gas pump that does not siphon gas.I guess it might work for filling a lawn mower from a gas can.It is cheap and worth about five dollars .	-1
The bracket this comes with is way bigger than it needs to be . I could not fit it in desired location confortably . The one I got was also missing one of the mounting bolts . All the other parts were bagged up and heat sealed except one of the baggies had 4 washers , 4 nuts but only 3 bolts . It must have been an error in manufacterers packaging because eveything was sealed up tight when it arrived . I decided to go with the Hella switch and make my own bracket from angle iron .	-1
Good quality , but did not work in 3 inches of snow . These were fairly easy to put on , but I was hesitant that they would slip off and they did .	-1
Bought a few years ago ; lasted 2 years with perhaps 1 use every 2 months.Save your money and shop around via Internet on a more reliable compressor : e.g , Camp.Haus. , or others .	-1
I have dropped my rating to one star after using this for awhile , I repeat BAD design . You ca n't even turn it off and one with one hand because the cigarette lighter adapter cord blocks the switch . It pumps fine , it just is a pain in the tail to use.Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator - Electric Air CompressorPrice : $ 44.99This little inflator does the job . It quickly pumped up my wheelbarrow tire . The design could use work though . Even though I purchased it due to it 's ability to be run from AC or DC , I 'm not happy with their implementation . It works fine but the cigarette lighter adapter gets in the way of the AC power cord . The AC power cord is so short that it necessitates using an extension cord to be able to get close to anything you hope to inflate . Lastly it should have a molded handle on the top . They could have just extruded a little more plastic and given you a handy handle.There are two snap on attachments in a nook on the bottom of the unit . That was smart design , they are handy but not in the way . I guess it looks like something designed by a committee , some good ideas and some not so good . I do n't like the plastic inflator valve . That should be metal.As far as performance , it works fine . I had a full blown compressor that I returned due to an immediate ( when assembling ) crimp in the air hose that prevented it from working correctly . That had a metal inflator valve but the immediate failing of the hose negated the good thinking on the valve.This Black and Decker inflator works well , I am just surprised that a company like B & D ; would not provide a better design . The price is reasonable ( $ 45 at Amazon ) but still for $ 45 I think including a handle , a longer AC cord and a metal valve would not inflate the price dramatically.11/8/13 Retrospect : Design really is cumbersome . The on/off switch is occluded by the DC power cord . You ca n't turn it off and on easily without looking due to that power cord blocking the switch . The gauge is next to useless , it hangs up on the setting needle and thus turn off immediately until you can free it from the setting needle . Kind of pointless to have an automatic off when it is stuck on the setting needle . Overall the pumping part works fine but the cord storage , cord attachment and switch placement as well as the poor gauge makes this far less satisfactory than I originally felt .	-1
I was looking for a small air compressor to fill basketballs , bike tires , car tires , etc . This compressor works fine but it has to be one of the worst designed products I 've purchased in recent memory . The power cord is about 12 '' long , as is the air tube . Who thought that was a good idea ? Meanwhile , there 's about 50 ' long cable for the 12V adapter . This actually makes more sense but since I 'm not using the 12V it just gets in the way . Of course , you can store the 12V cable in a nice little storage space in the unit ... except that 's where they decided the put the power switch ! Are you kidding me ? The power switch is located deep inside some hole in the back of the unit ? Are the designers insane ? I 'm stuck with this thing but you might want to look elsewhere .	-1
It does work , but is Poorly designed ! ! Using the a/c power , the d/c cord has to be removed from it 's storage to get to the on switch . Very inconvenient ! The a/c cord and the air hose should both be about 6 feet longer . Who wants to get out an extension cord every time they want to plug it in ? The coupler on the air hose is very flimsy , cheap and ca n't last long . The previous model air station was so superior to the new one and it was made in the USA ! It was a/c power only but had long cords and hoses and wrap around storage for them . The switch was easy to get to . That thing was used almost daily , like any other home appliance . New one needs re-designed again to be much more user friendly , and made with better quality materials , such as a metal coupler and re-in-forced air hose . Sorry , I just think a company like Black & Decker could have done worlds better . Thanks ! ProsAc or dc poweredConsAc cord is way too shortAir hose is way too short	-1
I now own 3 different trailer coupler locks that are & # 34 ; universal & # 34 ; They are not . I have a Jayco Jayfeather ( 2013 ) and the hitch is such ( wide and high ) that no locks fit it . As is the norm , this unit comes in the typical & # 34 ; user unfriendly & # 34 ; packaging that is destroyed upon opening . I 'd be glad to sell mine to anyone interested in trying it out .	-1
It would serve it 's purpose if the on/off knob was a lever or the neck was longer . I ca n't put it far enough into the filler tube to do any good . This may an isolated case , but it did n't work for me .	-1
Too hard to empty into a small mouth container like a gas can . I store old oil in an old plastic 5 gallon gas can and empty when full this pan is a bear when directly trying to fill the can . I have to use a funnel which is just another item I need to clean .	-1
I 've been looking to purchase a new Jump pack for use in the shop and narrowed my selection down to either the Clore JNC660 or the Shumacker ProSeries DSR PSJ-2212The reviews were about equal on both so I decided to get the JNC660Well , I just received the JNC660 today and it is defective right out of the box.I plugged it in to charge and the amber led that is suppose to be lit does not indicate it is charging . The Green LED does not show it is fully charged either.I verified my power cord has power from the outlet ; even switched to another cord.Disappointed ; I guess companies no longer have QC on their products.UPDATE : Feb 04 , 2014After realizing that Amazon will not accept returns on this item , I contacted Clore Automotive tech support and explained that I had received a defective jump pack . I reviewed with them the various items I had checked to confirm that it was indeed defective.After they confirmed that I had purchased it via Amazon , they shipped a new JNC660 to me along with a prepaid UPS label to return to them the defective unit . I had the replacement unit in 5 days after contacting them . The replacement unit works great.Clore Automotive gets 5 stars from me for making this disappointing defective unit right .	-1
This is a very versatile system . It can save a ton of work . It is durable and solidly made . It works as advertised , BUT : after a few uses , the unit started spraying used motor oil out of the top of the T-handle . What a mess ! Used , black oil everyplace . I called Mityvac and asked if there was some sort of replacement seal kit . They promptly replaced the entire unit at their expense . Great customer service , I was truly impressed . Soon thereafter , the new unit started leaking just like the previous one . Used oil everyplace ! I was given no warning about synthetic oils when I called Mityvac ( if this thing is incompatible with synthetic oils and fluids such as transmission , then I ca n't see what value it has ) .I own several vehicles and need a product which does n't fail after 5 uses . I did not contact Mityvac a second time as my warranty expired , rather have decided that the product may have a design flaw or unknown limitation . I now wrap a wet rag around the T-handle to get a marginal temporary seal to start the flow and can still use the product this way , albeit somewhat ineffectively ( and messily ) .	-1
This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem . The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess , came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it . The signal strength meter dos n't seem to register at all . It was cheap enough and probelly works , but your have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it .	-1
Bad design ... The two doors that cover the hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered , can easily be misplaced . Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit . LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it . I will keep it as long as the pump works .	-1
I purchased two of these for my 1997 Ford F1 50 . Both did not work the company sent me a replacement one it also did not work . When I asked again to return this product they stated to me that I could not as too much time had passed . I feel that they sent me a useless item to set me up while waiting for time to run out . In the end I have three remotes that do not work and am out the money . I wish I would have not purchased this .	-1
I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis . It would not register the tire pressure accurately . It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem . I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem .	-1
Right out of the package I used it first on the front tire of my bike and the gauge and pressure release worked fine and then I used it on the back tire and the pressure gauge read zero . The release malfunctioned after the first use , so the dial would go back to zero right after you pulled the gauge off the tire . I put it back in the box and returned to Amazon.com immediately ! I do NOT recommend !	-1
They say 4100k , color temperature matches my stock 2700k bulbs ( appearance in housing and beam ) . I returned right away . The life is rated poorly too . Not woth the money for fog lights . I purchased quality LED bulbs cheaper that will last as long as I own my car .	-1
I did not want the ghetto blue look at all ... but wanted brighter and a nice hint of the Whitish look ( maybe with a tinge of blue ) ... but these really look VERY close to the original basic cheap Sylvania bulbs . I can see a HINT of difference and not totally yellow but really all it adds a tinge ( and I mean TINGE ) more whitish but still primarily yellow.I saw the Sylvania Silverstar zXe models but the bulbs looked really blue and I thought it would give the ugly blue color so I went with the Ultras ... . kinda thinking the zXe 's would have given me more of the look I was going for.If you want regular yellow with a SLIGHT hint of white ( hardly any ) but brighter then stock then these are good ... if you want a more HID look with more whiteish look then go with the zXe 's as those should give you more of what you want ( I am returning these for the zXe 's in hopes they are what I am wanting ) .I did more research on the zXe models and though the bulb is blueish most all reviews say it is NOT lbue at all ... just really white and that was what I wanted ... I know I could n't get an HID look from a bulb but I wanted something close and still have the same brightness if not more then the regular bulbs.They are ok but just not the white kinda bright like they advertise and I thought they would be plus the brightness really is n't any brighter to me in my GMC Sierra then the basic cheap Sylvanias we're.Overall totally not worth the money .	-1
Put these in my Tacoma and they are nice and bright but low beam went out on one side after 6 months . I drive with my lights on all the time so that had a lot to do with it .	-1
Sure these are white light that peirces the blackest nights . BUT , do they last ? Unfortunatley , no they do not.I had the dealership take out the OEM head light bulbs in my 2012 GMC Sierra and replace them with the Silverstars . The bulbs in this truck are a menace to replace as GM made them very hard to get to on this model year . The first Silverstars lasted about eight months until one burned out . Replaced bulb and six months later the other one burned out.etc . etc.If your vehicle has an easy access to change the bulbs and you do n't mind them lasting about six to eight months then these Silerstars are very good .	-1
I purchased these bulbs for my 2003 explorer in Mid August of 2011 . Its now Feb 2012 and I 've been noticing they are n't as bright . My stock bulbs were brighter and lasted longer compared to these . The reason I was focused on buying the bulbs in the first place was because they were cheaper than Walmart or any auto store in my area . Stores had the same bulbs priced in the $ 50 area and amazon had them for $ 35 . They are decent bulbs when they you first get them they lose the brightness fast .	-1
A close friend with a 2001 ML320 had very poor low beam light performance that needed to be corrected . Given the importance of her need to quickly reach emergencies for her job , I decided to take every action to improve the situation . The most expensive step was replacing the existing bulbs with Sylvania Ultra basically because they were the priciest in the store . Yet of the three actions taken , the replacement yielded the lowest impact results . Basically , there is only so much technology that can be applied to an incandescent light bulb , which differs dramatically from HID and LED.While these measurements are entirely subjective , I would rank the improvement and cost from the following actions:1 ) 3M Headlight restoration kit : +25 % improvement ; cost USD12 + two hours labor ( in urban parking lot , so took longer than normal ) 2 ) Low beam vertical adjustment : +20 % improvement ; cost USDzero + 30 minutes labor3 ) Sylvania Ultra Bulbs installation : +15 % improvement ; cost USD55 at local retail + 20 minutes laborThe end result of this endeavor is that using the restoration kit with vertical adjustment would have been more than sufficient to achieve excellent low beam performance . It is hard to justify a high price for simple incandescent bulbs for the fundamental reason so little technology involved -- no current driver , no ballast . Moreover , like a dirty residential light bulb , a yellowing and crazed headlight lens significantly reduces light transmission . This problem is relatively easy to correct by the least skilled individuals with a 10-15 dollar kit . So , while the Sylvania bulbs subtly improve performance , they should be the last corrective action on your list .	-1
I tried these and was impressed with their bright white light output , but was extremely disappointed with the lifespan . I did n't make it a year with the first set , tried again , and one bulb did n't make it eight months . Living in a small town where overzealous cops pull you over for having lights out , I went back to Xtra-Vision bulbs that last much longer . If you look on the back of the box it clearly indicates that the more expensive brighter bulbs last half as long as some the less bright ones . It is hard to believe they can not make bright white bulbs that last longer . Hopefully LED headlights will have the right performance and price soon .	-1
Purchased a set of these to replace originals in my 2010 SUV . Absolutely no difference in brightness . One of the worst investments I ever made . Do n't waste your money . Having someone walk in front of you with a lit candle would be just as good .	-1
On comparing these 'Ultra ' bulbs with the base Silverstars that preceded them : The base ( blue pak ) Silverstar is a much better light , IMHO . I actually went back to the base Silverstar for what appeared to be its superior illumination down the road that I experienced with both our '03 Honda Civic ( HB2 ) and '03 Focus ( same bulb , but 9003/H4 designated ) . Felt a bit 'scammed ' by this newer 'Ultra ' offering really . And , it 's true ; 6 mos 'tops ' for 'life ' in both cars but.. would n't be without.Bill H. in the Pacific Northwest - rain country !	-1
I bought this due to high review scores and price ... wish I had not.Stupid thing jammed up the first time I put grease into it . I pushed hard the first time and I got it to engage , but the disengagement tab popped out . I took it apart , resolved that issue as best as I could , and the next time it jammed again , but this time a good push just broke the plastic bushing inside.This is n't my first grease gun and not the first one I 've had designed like this . It is the first one I 've had that would jam up like this piece of junk . What a waste of money .	-1
I was deceived by some of the positive reviews of this product . Yes , it is heavy and `` feels '' substantial ( which some other reviewers believed were indices of quality ) ; however , in my opinion , this product 's features really SUCK ! Here is why:1 . The compressor hose detaches off the body of the compressor via a quick connect you push together and pull out to disconnect . The one I received was defective . I pushed it in one time , then pulled it out . When I tried to connect it again , the danged thing would n't connect in with a snap . This is unreliable . How would you like to be stranded with a flat and think , `` ok , I just got to air up the spare and be on my way , '' only to find out you ca n't connect the stupid hose to the compressor . Hoses that are permanently connected are better . I 've had cheaper models I 've kept in my car and used for 20 years and there 's never been a problem of the hose that was permanently connected , failing . This detachalbe hose on the SLIME is worthless.2 . I also completely disagree with other reviewers about the screw on connection to the tire valve . I prefer the snap down clamp type . It 's so much easier to just snap the valve on rather than screw it on to the tire valve . Plus , your tire valve is dirty , so after you spend a few seconds screwing it on , most likely , you hands will be black . I 've had plastic snap down clamps on my other compressors and there 's never been any failure or breakage of the plastic.3 . An the frickin bag that comes with it is too danged small . Good luck trying to fit all the parts back into the bag ! If you want convenience and reliability when it counts , do n't get this compressor . A big PITA !	-1
I unpacked this grease gun , put some thread sealant on the fittings and tightened them up and used it to grease my truck . I was pretty happy with it until the next day when I picked it up and there was grease leaking out of it at the trigger and the bleeder valve . Also , the description says that it 's rated to 10,000 psi . The hose says it 's rated to 4,500 psi . Next time I 'll go with my gut and spend some more money on something that wo n't make me angry every time I see it .	-1
I am sad to report that I have experienced a situation very much like a few other reviewers have mentioned . The grease fitting would not release from the zerk and ripped it right out of the ball joint assembly . I had to re-tap the hole and buy a new zerk to repair the vehicle . I had to get a pair of pliers to remove the zerk from the grease gun , as it was completely and totally stuck . The biggest problem is that there is no size adjustment on this grease gun , so you get what you get and can not adjust the strength of the grip on the zerk.Other than causing me to do an hour of extra work ( going to AutoZone to get a tap and zerk ) , this gun seems to be built really well and it seemed to be able to get enough pressure to get the job done without too much issue.Amazon was EXTREMELY easy to work with on the return of this item.Just because I had a terrible experience with this grease gun does n't mean that you wo n't have good luck . Just be warned that the reviews that mention zerks being ripped out are accurate . I discounted these reviews when I ordered this gun , as I weighted the overwhelmingly-positive review score higher than the negative reviews.Bottom line : not recommended .	-1
I would say the claim of 51 watts equaling 115 watts is just not true ! Based on the claim I figured these bulbs would just blow away my Sylvania Ultra Stars . Put the PIAA in one light and compared to the Sylvannia left in the other . Against my white garage door , I saw no visible difference in light output at all ! Drove the truck and no difference . Color is only a very slightly different shade of white . I am not knocking PIAA as I know they do make quality products , but the claim is misleading .	-1
I was really on the fence with purchasing this battery online . Batteries are heavy -- the carrier ( in my case , UPS ) , will treat this battery like they treat any other heavy package and toss it around . I read the reviews ( the good and the bad ) and thought that they had resolved the poor packaging issue . Sadly , they have not . My battery arrived with three of the four corners of the base snapped off , and the negative post bent.Until Amazon realizes that these batteries need to be packaged better , they should not sell them.UPDATE : I requested a return , but since this battery is considered a hazardous material , they did n't want the battery back but issued a full refund . I tried it in my car and it worked great for three months . The battery was manufactured in February 2012 , but can barely hold a charge now .	-1
Bought one for my 04 GTO , it lasted about a year and then died , sits on the charger and wo n't go above 10.5 volts . I expected better .	-1
Followed all the instruction on filling and charging . I 'm not new to motorcycle batteries . This battery has already failed in taking a full charge . Not even a year old . At first I thought it was my bike that was n't charging ... ..Nope , turns out this battery crapped out . I threw in a 7 year old Drag Specialties battery I had and use this Yuasa as an expensive paperweight .	-1
no sure if this was a good buy , it went dead after sitting a week , recharged it up and it worked fine , need to see how long it holds a charge , i charged it work a week before i install it into bike charged with a batterytender	-1
Fifty cents wort of tubing and a nipple . This is a joke . It now resides in a zip-lock bag in a lower drawer of my tool box , never to see the light of day again .	-1
I planned to use it in a five gallon bucket purchased from one of the two large home center chains but they slope inward toward the bottom so the insert does not sit on the bottom . Therefore it requires more than twice as much soap and water quantity to be useful .	-1
I was excited to get this seal conditioner . Used it the same day I got it , however little more than half of the bottle used and the air in it ran out - BIG bummer , now I ca n't finish the slide out rubber and there will be a waste of product in a can with no air left in it . Big bummer ! Was really expensive for not being able to use the entire can .	-1
I 've used it a few times now on problems areas on the car and it has no effect . I will try something else from a different brand .	-1
I failed when purchasing this tool . I was trying to substitute for the real full size kit to do some of my jobs.I stongly suggest that you do n't follow in my foot steps.I could n't even use it once . Myabe it could have been that it did n't offer the right size or configuration for the car i was working on that day . But there is something else that is wrong with going with a tool like this . Even if it had the right size or configuration , If the caliper piston has come out too far for this tool to fit in between the caliper and the piston then it would render it useless.I would recommend Astro Pneumatic 78618 Brake Caliper Wind Back Tool Set - 18 Piece . Whether it 's for professional use or personal , I strongly suggest a tool like this one . It 's going to be worth the investment , trust me . As of this review time it 's currently $ 36.92 from Amazon.Good luck	-1
I made the mistake of buying this tool to change my rear brake pads on my car thinking that I could get away with getting the cheap tool . I wish I would have just paid a little more for the right tool as this one was such a pain to use.First : There were n't any pin sets that fit my rear brake pistons . There was one side that had 4 house shaped pegs on the corners . I had to grind off two of the pegs and I could use that side . Those house shaped pegs were the only ones that actually fit in my car 's pistons.Second : The metal is so soft on this cube thing that when the cube slips out of the slots in the calilper , the metal deforms and becomes rounded off , and it makes it that much harder to use . After it slips off about 10 times , it is almost unusable . I had to frequently go back and use my dremel to remove more material off the pegs to make them flat again on the sides that had rounded off.Third : Eventually those pegs got too small and they would slip out even though they were n't rounded off . I had to switch to another side that had two round pegs out at the corners . However those round pegs were too big , so I had to go back to my dremel to grind them down a bit to fit . Then started the process of slipping and grinding again.Fourth : This cube tool does not compress the piston while turning it . The compression comes from your arm pushing on it , and if you do n't push it perfectly straignt , the cube slips . So , you ca n't put that much force on it . This leads to taking WAY longer to compress the pistons then it should take . With the proper tool that compresses and turns at the same time , these pistons should be able to be compressed in about 5 minutes each . However , with this tool , it took me over two hours to compress ONE piston.Fith : Because of all the grinding I had to do , this tool is now worn out and would n't be good to use again on another brake job . So I 'm going to have to buy another tool when it comes time to do rear brakes again.There is nothing good about this tool . The only redeeming quality about it is that I was eventually able to get the job done . There were times in the middle where I thought I was going to be running to the auto parts store to buy/rent the proper tool , but it did make it through . It probably would have been quicker to make a trip out and get a new tool though.Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this tool . I would n't buy any of these cube tools based on my experience with this one . Just spend a little more and get one of the rear brake piston sets that compresses the piston while turning . I wish I had done that , and I will do that for my next brake job ( Since this tool is now trash ) .	-1
Lots of glowing praise on this item and while I agree with most of the comments like great leverage , good in tight spaces , easily adjustable , long reach ... and so on ... it failed me miserably on the first use . I had a filter that was not `` hand tight '' as many expect them to be when they 're ready to slide under and twist them off with just a light touch of pressure . The filter on my 1999 Expedition is right behind the bumper so I 'm not sure if that placement exposes it more to the elements and makes removal more difficult or if the filter was last replaced and tightened way too much ... last change was by a Ford dealer because it was a freebie . I clamped onto the top of the filter and it immediately punched holes into it with the claws that are suppose to grip the filter ... and then came the oil down my arm . I tried again at the base of the filter where there 's a little more metal and immediately got another set of holes . I went for the strap wrench but that would n't budge it either . I finally got it off with my KR Tools 12153 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliers . I know all filters are n't difficult to remove but I 've been changing my oil & filters ... plus most repairs ... for about 50 years and this is not the only filter I have had problems removing . I will be purchasing a cap type filter wrench and have given this wrench 1-star because I could not get the filter off with it and it punched holes in the filter ... and since this tool is pretty much useless for any other job it 'll likely be donated or just sink to the bottom of my auto tool drawer . I do n't care about the holes as much as I did the resultant oil leak or the potential that the filter may have to be removed in pieces . I 'm also surprised that one reviewer talks about holes and how this wrench did n't cause any in the removal or install ... and I think anyone who tightens a filter with a wrench is asking for problems . I have purchased quite a few TEKTON tools on Amazon from wrenches to sockets and have not been disappointed ... until now . Lastly , if your filter is on tight you should be able to exert enough pressure with a tool to get it off without punching holes in it.Since I was able to get it off with the pliersKR Tools 12153 Pro Series 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliersthat would seem to be the better tool investment if you have a large filter ... at least the jaws have more teeth for a better grip , the teeth are not likely to puncture the filter , it has a lot more potential for other uses where an oil wrench does not and the price is about the same . I have used the pliers on many other things without an issue or damage to what I was working on ... especially good for my 1-1/2 '' PVC irrigation and pump lines .	-1
They squish flat even lifting my '96 328I which is not a heavy car . Ca n't think about using them on my Tiguan since it is even heavier . The way they bend flat I ca n't imagine them holding up for a long time	-1
Be careful using this . It slipped off my jack while lifting the car causing the jack to dent the undercarriage .	-1
Literally ordered it yesterday and got it today with Amazon prime . Recommended by Scotty Kilmer , so I think it should at least do some good work , My 944 Porsche has a belly pan so I ca n't tell if it leaks on the floor , but it should do something at least.They raised the price of this item 2-3 dollars , and instead of free shipping , you pay for it now . So it used to be about 8.79+ tax , now its 11 something + tax + shipping ... disgusted .	-1
I cant say this product worked on the two vehicles I tried it on . It made one vehicle worse than it was before I added it .	-1
I bought this before a road trip and it arrived the day before I had to depart . The fit guide said that I bought the right size for my tire but it is short by over a foot ! I ca n't really comment on the product , but I really hope it does n't snow on my trip because I 'm in a bad place if it does.SC1036 does n't even come close to fitting on a 265/40R18 !	-1
I have a Power Bright PW1100-12 which works well and the Power Bright specifications state these are very efficient units ( > 90 % max . ) which is why I also tried this smaller unit for another need.This inverter is heavily built and on the outside seems like a quality unit . When first powered up using the accessory outlet adapter , the unit ran my 75 watt current draw okay . I then switched to a set of HD cables I use for the larger inverter ( which probably had nothing to do with this issue ) for another test with the same load and a few seconds later smoke and flames billowed out of the back for several seconds . The green AC power LED in the front was still on and it may have been producing AC power , but I was busy shutting down the test and did not verify.For the money , this seemed like a great unit and it probably is . Defects happen even to the best of items , but I replaced it with a 150 watt Tripplight which will travel better for its intended usage .	-1
All it does is scrape and pit your battery terminals - I really do n't see the point of getting this tool . Scotch-Brite sponge would work better to clean the battery terminals .	-1

Like a few other reviewers , I 've had this `` charger '' kill a few batteries . It seems like if there is a power outage that lasts longer than a few seconds , these guys get confused . The BatteryMINDer has killed 3 batteries for me like this . Everything is fine , power goes off for a couple of hours , you do n't think about it , and then days/weeks/months later you go back and the thing has a red light on and your battery is at 1-2 volts . This is a design problem , the charger should not discharge batteries no matter what . It also does not charge weak batteries.I would have thrown mine away but the desulator mode has brought back a few batteries from the dead.In conclusion , good desulfator , poor charger , and unreliable maintainer .	-1
I knew it was n't for MY grease gun , but with some altering it will squeak by ... for $ 6 and free shipping ? It will hopefully work as good as the large hose clamp I previously used .	-1
First , their site gave me the wrong directions . Took awhile to find the right ones . This thing once installed has never worked right . Sometimes it works fine , then randomly stops working all together . Mute button only works when I hold it down and it cycles on and off ... I have to release it and hope it stops on mute . Volume works for about 4 notches , then wo n't go back down . Also , I need to push the buttons really hard to make this thing respond . Before it was just a light touch . This thing is irritating and frustrating . Go with the Axxess ASWC , same price , does n't need to go though a complicated program process , and actually works !	-1
This product was easy enough to install , as I 'm electronically inclined . However , I ran into a bit of an issue after the installation was completed and the unit was programmed -- it failed to control my Kenwood DNX6960 reliably . Sometimes it worked for every button press ; sometimes it did n't work , at all . Sometimes it worked for all buttons ; other times only some buttons functioned.I triple-checked everything ( which was fine ) and then began researching the problem . While researching I stumbled across a bulletin from the manufacturer . Apparently some of the SWI-JACK units were mis-soldered at the factory and fail to operate Kenwood head units even when properly wired into place . Wow , just wow ... talk about bad quality control.Fortunately mine was properly soldered on the inside . Sadly , though , this did n't help me find a solution . Ultimately I lived with the sporadic functionality of the unit until my Metra Axxess ASWC arrived . I 'm much happier with the Axxess ASWC . It uses a steering wheel control wire off the radio harness rather than needing to be connected directly to the vehicle 's BCM . It also auto-detects the head unit ( it may need a 12k reisstor in the line [ only during auto-detection ] for some Kenwood head units , but the DNX6960 is n't one of them ) -- meaning no programming is necessary . And it 's competitively priced . I strongly recommend the Metra Axxess ASWC over the PAC SWI-JACK unless you just -have- to have a PAC SWI-JACK -- especially if you 're working on a GM truck in conjunction with a Kenwood head unit .	-1
OK so these looked like they might be OK for the price and are made in Washington State ( buy local thing ) . I was terribly disappointed that a local Washington State company would claim these are waterproof ( they know how it rains here ) . These boots leaked buckets as the water ran off my waterproof riding suit pant legs right down into the upper part of the boots . Within minutes of riding the boot was saturated . The zippers also failed after about a week , the upper stop came off and the zipper just pulled right off in my hands ! Do n't expect any support or protection from this boot either , it 's front is sort of `` armored '' but the sides and the rest of the boot is very very thin material . Vega will not deal with any of these issues and say I must go through the dealer I purchased them from ... however the dealer says they did n't make the boot or the claim of waterproofing so that 's a warranty/advertising issue and to go through Vega . Catch 22 right ? If I ever get this resolved to my satisfaction ( return for full refund ) I 'll post how much effort it took . For now I would avoid VEGA at all costs due to poor products and terrible customer service .	-1
I have n't had a chance to use them in the rain but for normal riding they are very good . Easy to put on with the two zippers and they seem to have a complete liner that is waterproof . Comfortable too . They are not SIDI or BMW quality but for the price are fine.This was added after a 4 hour ride in the rain . This boot is a rain magnet , I had so much water in these it could be dumped out . I need to change these to NO STARS as the main point of buying a waterproof boot is to have it be water-proof and these are NOT . Do n't buy these if you want any sort of water resistance or water proofing as they are bad for that .	-1
Super light weight , that 's why the 2 stars . Some people would like how light they are but not me , I 'd think if you crashed the road would chew these up like it was nothing . So ill save my feet and get some real thick boots	-1
If you 're up for a tuneup , these plugs are worth replacing the OEM plugs . My engine runs smoother and throttle response is noticeable . Do n't expect miracles , like a sudden increase in MPG . You 're not turning your car into a hybrid ; just replacing old copper core , single arm plugs with a new material for better spark ... with `` hopes '' of better performance . It 's not much more expensive than copper plugs so it was definitely worth a try.This model was a direct replacement for my aging 1996 Infiniti I30 V6 . No problems with install but make sure to buy the anti-seize lubricant.UPDATE : Took my car to the shop for other work and after pulling these plugs , they said this model 4501 was the wrong one for my 1996 infiniti i30 . But Amazon 's make/model filter listed that these work and they fit fine . Maybe the 4 electrodes makes the plug run hotter that may not be good on my old car ? Not sure ... .I 'll keep them in for a little while longer.UPDATE # 2 : Sept 15 , 2012 . So a little over 6 months ( 5K miles ) of running with these plugs , all of a sudden , my car stumbles on acceleration . After Googling for possible answers , came up on a few complaints about Bosch plugs failing . I replaced them with some single prong NGKs Vpower and the problem went away . The Bosch 's did n't look like they failed but it may burn too hot for my old car . I 'm glad the problem was n't serious . I did receive my $ 4 rebate check so each plug ended up net $ 2 so not worth it going through Bosch 's product guarantee return process ( they do n't cover S/H ) . Read that they discontinued these plugs and using the rebate to get rid of dead inventory . It may work for you but I would stick to something closer to OEM like NGK or Denso if I were you .	-1
With 50,000 miles , my factory ISS was making noise ( like they all do ) . I put this one in with a new green bearing , and it was maybe 50 % better . Then after 2 months , it was noisier than the factory one I took out and threw away . Now its REALLY loud . This was a 100 % waste of money .	-1
this steering shaft is of poor design . the factory shaft is much better than this one . I installed it no problem , but the clearances were bigger then the one I took off . I do n't recommend this item for any one trying to up grade to something better . ITS not ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
One down side , bottles can and will fell off due to the fact of the design . Adjustable arms can not hold a & # 34 ; full heavy & # 34 ; 16oz water bottle ... ... those arms spread easier than a _________ legs.I actually got'em glue with epoxy using a coke bottle as standard measure ; be careful not to glue'em to wide apart or the lid wont close .	-1
I 've had a pair of Rain-X Latitude wipers on my Lexus RX300 for two months . I thought they were great and did a good job clearing the windshield until today . Today , we had our first snow and sleet of the season in Philadelphia . As I drove to the grocery store , the driver 's side wiper failed catastrophically . The entire blade assembly , with the exception of the mounting clip that fits into the car 's metal `` J '' arm ( i.e. , the wiper arm ) , fell off the car as I was driving , immediately costing me visibility in the sleet . If you look at the picture of the wiper , the black plastic part in the middle essentially broke off of the blade assembly . There was not much slush built up on the windshield at the time -- only a bit that the blade had pushed up and to the left side of the windshield while I drove . It was n't as though I was trying to use the wipers on packed ice or anything . Given the premium price of the blades , I was surprised at how weak the construction was.It should go without saying that a product failure of this nature is unacceptable given how important visibility is when driving at speed in inclement weather.I 've been working on cars for more than twenty years . I know how to install blades . I properly installed these wipers according to the included Rain-X directions . After the blade fell off the car , the `` connector '' was still properly mounted to the car 's wiper arm ; however , the product failure was that the Rain-X connector failed to hold the blade . Because I still have the connector , I took a close look at it . It 's only some plastic and , upon inspection , does not seem like a very robust design . These wipers were n't properly designed and/or manufactured to withstand real world conditions . I see other reviewers below have had similar bad experiences.I 'll be sticking with Bosch , etc. , in the future . Buy at your own risk .	-1
After only a few days , my 26 '' wiper developed a large area that it would not wipe , so I had to buy a new wiper . Since it may be due to getting a `` bad one '' and since the smaller wiper seems to work better , I 'll give it two stars instead of just one .	-1
these are the worst wiper blades I have ever used . they leave streaks on the windshield and do a horrible job in the rain . I tried to contact the seller to ask them for an exchange only to be told that my return date expired . If there were negative stars I would use them for this product.. Even cheap wiper blades do a better job than these blades .	-1
I have a 2005 BMW 330xi . These are some of the few wiper blades that have the correct ( very large ) adapter for my model BMW . I only know if this wiper blade and ICON for having the correct fit.These squeak , streak , and are just a pain . There are times where the smallest bit of water is on my windshield , and it just spreads the water around more and it become more of an issue.Maybe it is just the pair I got , but for the price of these I fully expect them to work flawlessly . But sadly , these are absolutely horrid.I have heard good things about Bosch ICON , so I will be giving those a try here soon .	-1
These wiper blades leaves a smear on the driver side 2005 Ford F-150 that is outright dangerous if driving at night . I discovered the problem during a 2,200 road trip through Colorado in January . Not being able to see at night is no fun . Having to stop at gas station to do the wiper 's job is silly . These wipers are expensive but their performance is unacceptable .	-1
I 've had my eye on these wiper blades for a while , because I had heard some pretty good things . Once a sale hit , I was all over them.The very first thing I noticed when I replaced the OEM blades on my 2013 Charger was how massive the brackets are . I did n't have any delusions about a universal-fit part looking like a contiguous part of my wiper arm , but seriously , the bracket on this is just huge.I appreciated how well-constructed the rest of the blade seemed to be , and that in spite of the gigantic bracket , the blade did n't wobble . Then I tried them out . Ugh . They streak like no other . I 've actually treated my windshield withRain-X 800002243 Glass Treatmentand I use Rain-X washer fluid religiously , so if there 's a windshield in town that should be slicker than a ... well ... you know ... it 's mine . Yet , these blades do a horrendous job of keeping my windshield clear.After a couple of weeks , I ended up putting the OEM blades back on . Those year-old blades performed far better than these new ones .	-1
I really thought these blades would be awesome replacements for my OEM 's , I was wrong . They do not form to the window and they leave streaks right in the eye line of the windshield . I 'm definitely going to replace them soon , but will not be buying Rain X ever again .	-1
I purchased this 24 inch wiper blade , thinking it was a quality product . After one month I got one streak , by six months the whole contact area was streaking . I purchased the Good Year Assurance at Costco , buy one get one free for $ 7.99 and after six months on my other car they still work like new.The 18 inch Rainex I purchased still worked fine after six months , but being paired up with a loser I changed them both.Goodyear GY-WB765-24 Assurance Black Premium Rubber Graphite Coated Wiper Blade , 24 '' ( Pack of 1 ) I had the Latitude on my other car in 24 and 18 inch and after a few months they began to squeak . It is amazing how much you pay and how little you get.Rainex works very well , but their wiper blades and window cleaner are not worth buying , just goes to show what happens when a company expands the product line and forgets the quality .	-1
squeep-squeep-thunk.thunk-snack , thunk-snack.knock-whack , knock-whackkveetch-chit-chit-crunk-snitBut why belabor the point . Worked well for about six months , then started smearing a little , and the noises got more interesting over time . And intolerable.Back to Bosch for me .	-1
These work for about a week and then cease to function the way they first did . I would not recommend them for a Jeep vehicle . I would search for a different brand .	-1
Clunky and heavy . I previously used microfiber towels but decided to give this mitt a try . I will be going back to the towels , this thing is clunky , heavy , and hard to remove debris from ( in the wash bucket ) . Skip it . Look into other options .	-1
This is a relatively cheap wash mitt . There is a lot of foam padding , however the actual microfiber content is minimal and not thick or plush . There are many better , higher end microfiber towels available from dedicated detailing stores .	-1
We 've always used a fluffy wash cloth to wash our vehicles , but I figure there must be something better . My search for a wash mit found these , so I bought 2.The pros : + Low cost & the shipping is included , + Very good reviews.The cons : - These are HUGE , way too large for our large & XL hands ! - Awkward for cleaing in tight areas.I 'm not saying these mitts wo n't work for you . We do n't care for these & they 're going in the donation box . We 're back to using a fluffy wash cloth . : (	-1
The mitt is okay but too thin.It feels like a thin towel when you use it to wash your car.And the mitt is too big . My hand was moving all over inside of it.Mitt was okay but material wayyyy tooo thin . Needs to be much thicker if it wants to do the job right.Better off getting a microfiber towel or sponge than this .	-1
This mitt is a bit thinner than I expected and does n't hold as much soap/water as I had hoped . When you pull it out of the bucket , it really just drains off quickly , so you have to hurry and get it onto the car . Also , it 's white , so it shows dirt and grime very quickly as you wash . I was surprised at how much grit and grime actually stuck to the mitt , even though I was using the 2-bucket method . It just did n't wash off in the rinse water . My old trusty microfiber sponge worked better than this mitt , unfortunately . And the grit and grime rinsed right off the sponge , but not this mitt . Another dud from Meguiar 's ( see my Water Magnet review ) .	-1
It may seem soft , which is is but something I do n't like about it . Nowhere to trap dirt . I love the other wool mits or the standard old school ones which work perfect . This seems like good quality but does n't have alot of soap suds and idk scared it will scratch black car .	-1
I was extremely disappointed in this item . Most of the Camco stuff I have is pretty good , but the problem with this meter is the clear plastic face is not static proof.When comparing with my Fluke multimeter , this meter reads about 2VAC high at 120VAC ; or about 1.6 % off.When you get the meter , it has a piece of protective plastic over the bezel , and just removing it will induce enough static electricity to cause the pointer to change . And if you brush across the bezel with your finger , you can make it read anywhere from 110V to 130V , because the static electricity affects the needle.Most meters use a plastic bezel that is immune to static , and does not do this . I do n't know if the problem is the plastic the manufacturer used or perhaps they failed to treat it with some chemical.Sadly there are not a lot of options for other brands . I like an analog meter in this case as you can see voltage fluctuations a whole lot better than you can with a digital meter.Hopefully over time this meter will lose it 's sensitivity to static electricity .	-1
I took a flier on this after reading the reviews . I lost . The meter is easily 5-9 volts off ( tested with my multimeter and confirmed with my volt meter app on my power supply ) .Do n't waste your money . Amazon should seriously consider dropping this item from its website .	-1
After a power outage , I connected my refrigerator to this power supply . Sadly , its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . The Duracell DPP-600HD does n't have enough momentary output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator 's compressor motor . The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts . This equates to 8 amps at 120v . Yet , public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator 's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second . Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing . One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery , which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v. This equates to 336 watt hours . Yet , AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . These losses increase with power output . The following table illustrates this . The last column is my calculation.load ... ... ... ... ... ..watts ... .hours ... .watt-hoursCordless telephone ... ..5 ... ... ..35.0 ... 175Portable stereo ... ... ... 10 ... ... ..22.0 ... 220Laptop computer ... ... .20 ... ... ..7.0 ... .140Fan ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..100 ... ... ... 1.7 ... .17036 '' TV ... ... ... ... ... ... .133 ... ... ..1.2 ... .1603/8 drill ... ... ... ... ... ..300 ... ... ..0.4 ... .115Warm-air fan heater.312 ... ... ..0.4 ... .109Blender ... ... ... ... ... ... 385 ... ... ..0.3 ... .109HID Floodlights ... ... .400 ... ... ..0.3 ... ..107Observe that the total energy delivered ( watt-hour ) drops with power consumption . Ultimately , the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference , a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running . Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50 % to 60 % of the time , which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoes n't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation	-1
I had read many mixed reviews but I ordered this wrench hoping it would work out well for me . Unfortunately , for my circumstances I found it difficult to get the wrench to grip the oil filter . You MUST be able to get one hand on the filter to hold the jaws of the wrench in place as you move the wrench to loosen to filter . I found this to be more trouble than it 's worth . Maybe it would work better on another vehicle with more room to work and a different size filter . I was able to turn my filter by hand , but if I could n't I 'm sure I could have gotten this wrench to work , but it was more difficult than I was expecting .	-1
kind of flimsy . i ultimately just used a channellock tongue and groove plier to grip and unscrew the oil filter . plus the channellock is more useful for other tasks . after you yank the oil filter off the first time , just hand tighten the next times . it is more than enough to prevent leaks ( both by my anecdotal experience 5+ years of changing my own oil and per experts online ) and allows you to hand unscrew it in the future.bottom line , do n't waste your money . get a channellock instead .	-1
I would not recommend to buy this at all . It is very slippery and not useful for holding the jack in place . I do not know why they would sale such unsafe product . Lawyer should make a case out of this product .	-1
When these are attached to the lynx levelling blocks the instant you hit it it pops off the block it 's attached to . So I guess it does let you know when you 're on the blocks , but it 's not confidence inspiring at all . Now sitting in the garage ignored .	-1
This item includes ( 2 ) very small pieces of sandpaper of different coarseness ( It would be nice if they were labeled ) , ( 2 ) small tubes of polishing compound and ( 2 ) small polishing cloths . In my opinion , it & # 8217 ; s not worth the price .	-1
The directions are poorly written ... .the process did not work for me . I was very disappointed after reading so many positive reviews .	-1
Did n't do anything for the scratches , no impact at all ! Frankly , I am highly disappointed . Do not recommend you to buy and use this .	-1
To me ? Grabage ... the quality of this set has gone downhill IMO ... I have an older set that rocks so I bought this newer set for another trailer - garbage . Mismatched looking pins and locks . Hitch cover lock is plactic and doesnt hold well . I would recommend buying local so that you can try it and return it ... Thank you AMAZON for allowing me to return this POG .	-1
The pin ( 10mm ) is too wide for the disc brake holes and the disk is too wide for the lock to easily slip on and off without damaging the dick bake itself . Great lock for other bikes I suspect , but not designed for thick brake disks with smaller holes .	-1
I 've got a sport bike that does n't have any storage.Before , I had a smaller disc lock made by someone else , but the internals on it always locked up - even when I had the key.So , I got this one , wanting something better.This one is too big to mount in the little spot I had before.It came with a little nylon carry bag , and I tried mounting that to the motorcycle , but it did n't stay . I took it off before it fell off and I lost the lock.Now , if I plan to go somewhere that I want to lock up the motorcycle ( Wal-Mart or some sketchy bar ) , I will tuck this into the pocket of my riding jacket if I remember it . The problem is , I have never remember it.I 've never gotten any use out of it , yet there it sits : Brand new and never flawed .	-1
Lock attached to the brake caliber just fine , but found after about 2 weeks of leaving it on , when I inserted key it would n't come loose without hitting and pulling . Once I got it off , I sprayed dry liquid wrench grease and attached . I worked well at that point as I locked and unlock several times . Again , letting it set about 2 weeks , I went to unlock and same problem . This time I resorted to WD-40 and locked and unlocked several times without any problems . Two or three weeks later - here we go again . The lock does attach to the caliber just fine and the tire ca n't be rolled without causing damage to the brake caliber - so security is not a problem . It 's just getting the thing to unlock smoothly without applying alternate means and methods for getting the thing to release .	-1
The Trimax T-3Black receiver lock is one of the best locks offered . It 's plenty long and very well made . The weight and feel of the metal is a testament to it 's quality and workmanship . I am very satisfied with the lock . The rubber lock cover keeps out dirt and water . It is definitely worth the money.Update : After going thru a brutal winter in Ohio , this lock rusted and the key would n't open it . i ended up having to cut it off ( which by the way was n't easy ) Maybe if I would have lubed it good and made sure the cover was on constantly it may have lasted . For that reason alone I reappraised it to One star .	-1
I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes . It was too cheap to hassle with the return .	-1
I see that no one has left a review in a while , so they no one may have ordered for a 2012.I ordered this for my 2012 JK and it does not fit . The circumference for the steering wheel was right but I assume the `` thickness '' of the steerng wheel has changed as this does not cover the steering wheel correctly ( front to back ) and I had to remove and return ...	-1
It was way too small for an adult head . After testing it a couple of times , I started getting dizzy and not sure whether it was the fumes I was smelling when the mask was tight close to my nose . Anyway , I simple can not rate this any higher not because of the small size but more about the odor/fumes .	-1
I 've used Rain-X products on and off for years . While Rain-X does shed water from the windshield as advertised , be advised that it leaves a hazy film on the windshield that produces a glare when illuminated by overhead street lights and on-coming traffic lights , which dangerously impairs vision and the ability to see the road ahead of you . This is true during daytime driving , but is more so while driving at night , especially as you pass underneath amber-colored street lights . Once applied , Rain-X is difficult to remove and takes quite a while to wear off by itself . After a recent windshield replacement , to which I applied Rain-X , I realized just how badly my vision was imparied by using this product . Glass cleaner did n't seem to work , so to remove the Rain-X , I resorted to a super-concentrated windshield cleaner . It took several attempts , and a lot of elbow grease , but I eventually was able to remove the product from my windshield . I tossed the remaining Rain-X products in the trash so my kids wo n't be tempted to use it on their car windshields .	-1
They shipped this in a box with no wrapping around it . This allowed cardboard dust to get all over it . There is a ton of lint and residue left behind . I bought these for auto detailing mainly to remove wax or quick detail . I would not use to buff wax . The residue is annoying . Buy a better quality cloth .	-1
These are perfect for someone who has some extra cash that they 'd prefer to waste , but does n't have a lighter handy to just burn it.As other have said ... cheap , thin , non-absorbent . The reverse side has some kind of fish-netting . God forbid you 're cleaning something recklessly and accidentally get a wipe in with any part of the fish-net facing downward ... you 'll have some nice scratches in your paint , or plastic , or whatever it is you like to polish.To make things even weirder ... they have tags on them ... and they 're on the microfiber side ! ! What ? ? ? Yep . It 's a 1-sided product , and they put the tag on the only usable side ... genius ! Have some scissors ready to cut those off .	-1
As others have mentioned , these have a plastic mesh on one side so you can only use once side of each cloth . The mesh also makes it very precarious and frustrating to use.They do clean glass quite well although in the future I will likely look to another microfiber cloth that does n't have one side which is useless . In fact , after only a few uses , I grew fed-up with these and tossed them in the trash .	-1
Looks cheap . The hooks sit out too far , so I do n't feel comfortable leaving them hanging in the car ... I do n't want someone to accidentally snag themselves or hit their face on this in the back seat ... especially with a child in the back .	-1
Let me say that for the price ( $ 6.50 ) it 's hard to complain.They are a heavy gauge steel and look like they will hold up to a reasonable amount of weight ( that is , I doubt you 'd have anything in a grocery bag that would create a problem for them.They came a little bent up ... easily fixed.What I did n't like was that the protective end was not plastic or rubber , but wood - 2 of them were delivered unattached to the ends of the hooks - and just like in the picture of one of the other reviewers , one of them split in half when I tried to put it back on.I need to find some new caps to replace the wood - as the ends are just a little jagged without the protective ends on - I suggest that the manufacturer switch to plastic or rubber - and something that stays on. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- UPDATE : Downgraded my review ... Soon all of the wooden caps had broken off . This created a hazard for little kids in the back seat as well as my flip up rear seat ... They are only useful if they are in the car - and I had to take them out to save eyes and upholstery .	-1
We own an Air-O-Swiss AOS 7135 ultrasonic humidifier . For a few weeks now , the machine has indicated , through its warning light , that it required cleaning . Our Air-O-Swiss 7135 is hyper-sensitive ; its warning light goes on with the tiniest ( invisible ) speck . So , initially we bought Air-O-Swiss EZ Cal Cleaner / Descaler . Didn & # 8217 ; t do the trick ! Thereafter we replaced the Demineralization Cartridge ( and contents . ) Still no change . Even after following the instructions to the letter and cleaning with specialized brushes , our humidifier wouldn & # 8217 ; t extinguish its cleaning light . So , last resort , this EZCal Pro . Again , applied the product as instructed ; without success . So , our humidifier is presently running with the irritating little light on , but operating as it should be nevertheless . The EZ Cal Cleaner / Descaler and the EZCal Pro liquid didn & # 8217 ; t do wonders in our case either . So , ca n't say that we 're thrilled with the Air-O-Swiss maintenance products . In the future we 'll stick to vinegar or some other generic decalcification agent .	-1
OK , I purchased this for my bike , because I had a good experience with another accutire pressure gauge.But this one & # 34 ; sucks & # 34 ; . It worked ok when I first got it , but after 2 years the battery went dead and I only used it maybe 20 times . My other accutire pressure gauge is 10 years old and I 'm still on the original battery . So I purchased a new battery and found out you have to take this whole thing apart , to get to where the battery is buried . So I take it apart very carefully , not to lose these very small parts and replaced the battery . So happy with my battery install , I go out to my garage and try it out and all I get is 1 psi on the lcd , so I try a different car , same thing 1 psi . This is a disposable item , when the battery dies you just throw it away and buy a new one . No thanks , I will keep using my analog pressure gauge .	-1
Do n't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord ' translates into 'heavy duty ' anything , other than maybe rubber insulation . THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY ! ! ! It is 20-AWG wire inside , barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker . If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator , a 1,000,000 candle spotlight , etc. , you are SADLY MISTAKEN . This is NOT , repeat NOT heavy duty . It is a crime that the wire AWG ( American Wire Gauge ) is not listed in the specs . Otherwise , you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second , or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try . If you want to charge a cell phone , an iPad , etc . on it , go ahead , no problem . But the problem is , most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle . This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load .	-1
I bought this in May of 2013 and it 's now September 1 , 2013 . I tried to use this cord for the first time over the Labor Day weekend holiday with no results . Michigan summers feels many times like your in Kentucky with the heat & humidity . With that said , I needed something to cool me down camping along the West Michigan shorelines . The Endless Breeze did a great job of that but I needed an extension cord to run it . I finally opened this extension cord up and tried to use it . NOTHING ! I thought that maybe I needed to check the fuse ? So I did and guess what . It did n't even have the capability of using a fuse . That 's dangerous and could blow an electronic device up ... I notified Amazon and as usual , they gave me an opportunity to send it back even though I 'm out of the return date . Thanks Amazon , your the best .	-1
So , I bought this after the tool said this would fit my car . Well , after some further research and trying to install it I found that it does n't go in my car nor does my model even take a cabin filter .	-1
it was hard to fit or put inDid I say I smell Chinese dung..well does not fit like it was made for the carI smell Chinese dung.. do n't you	-1
terrible piece of item i have ever purchased.i threw away the product , and purchased a better product at walmart .	-1
Did not fit my car 's filter harness after Amazon 's compatibility tool said it would , there was a 1.5 & # 34 ; gap compared to the OEM filter , I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car	-1
These are ok . They keep the water from reaching the floor , but without ridges - they also keep the water to where it hits your shoes . In and out of the car in snowy and icy conditions and you can be damn sure that you are going to end up getting freezing water in your shoes as an unpleasant surprise . They are hard to empty without spilling because of the lack of a lip on the front of the liner . So , you either wait till the water drys on its own - which does n't happen in winter , soak it up with a towel , or attempt to empty it and end up with water exactly where it was n't supposed to go . However they probably work fine for sandy or muddy conditions , as they are pretty easy to clean off . Overall , there are better options and I wish I had gone with one of the other options instead .	-1
I wo n't recommend this product . I have a compressor for my car ( 12V ) and I bought this . It dose n't work	-1
I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job , returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter , good to go !	-1
We have these on the awning of our RV . The metal portion rusted the first season we use them . Would not buy replacements .	-1
I use my battery tender a lot , so I just throw it in a plastic shopping bag rather then to stuff it in this little case . I ended up using this case for small parts , etc , then to store the battery tender ( that I like ! ) in it . It just needs to be a little larger .	-1
I previously owned the cable luber that only has 1 thumb screw . Could never get that one to work . I thought this one would do the trick . I could not get this one to work as well .	-1
First off , let me say that I am highly doubtful that this pump could possibly reach 300psi . It 's a cheap auto pump equipped with a cheap , dim safety light . The digital pressure gauge does n't seem to work at all . Mine jumps around from 14psi to 98psi in moments . If you want to use the digital display more than once , you have to unplug and replug the unit . Stupid . There are much , much better products out there . Keep looking .	-1
I tried this one one of my tires when I unboxed it , and when it shut off the display would never come back on . I was ready to give up right there until I saw another reviewer had a similar issue , and that it would work again after being unplugged from power and plugged back in . Right there , that makes this unit a fail for me since if you have to remove power between wheels , it becomes much more of a pain to deal with . But a few days later , it actually did NOT kill the display after shutting off automatically with one tire , so it was n't just by design , it seems to just be totally intermittent.The ability to set a pressure and let it stop when it hits that pressure is a great concept , but this thing has n't worked anything nearly as advertised . I set if for 38 PSI , since my tires max at 44 , and the manufacturer suggests 33 , but I like a little stiffer wheels than that . On one tire it shut off about 37.5 , on another I had to stop it at 39 myself because it never did shut off . On the other two it was about 37.5 or so , acceptable . You can pick in 1 PSI increments above 30 , and it reads in 1/2 PSI increments . But when I tested with a very good tire pressure gauge , the readings this was giving was really around the scale . The tire that was inflated to 39 PSI before I shut it off myself was actually at 41 . One of the ones that shut off about 37.5 , one was actually 35 , one was actually 37.Then there 's the issue with the rubber inside the valve piece . The very first tire I put this on and then removed , a piece of the rubber seal inside the nozzle fell to the floor . It 's like it 's dry rotted already or something . And the plastic lever to lock and unlock is not very strong at all , and bends to the point I 'm afraid it will snap when I 'm putting it on or off.Nothing about this unit screams quality , which would explain the low price . The concept is good , but the execution failed in many , many ways .	-1
There are better choices in air compressors than this unit . I do n't like the fact that the digital gauge stops working after it reaches the preset pressure . The unit must be unplugged and plugged in again to get the gauge working again . Also , the gauge is not very accurate . The compressor takes too long to inflate my car tires to the correct pressure ( 32psi ) . It may be good for light duty stuff like pool floats and the like but it is not powerful enough to inflate auto and truck tires . This may be a good compressor to leave in the car for emergencies but there are better choices . I purchased this Campbell Hausfield compressor for under $ 20 several years ago and it is still working great ( but it does n't have a pressure gauge ) : Campbell Hausfeld RP1200 12-Volt Compact Inflator	-1
I bought this for automotive detailing ( interior , engine bay , wheels , etc ) . This product falls short in two very important areas . 1 ) the bristles are not stiff enough to do any real cleaning . You apply pressure and it loses shape very quickly to the point where you are dragging the sides of the bristles around the area you are trying to clean . 2 ) it sheds like CRAZY . I 've used these brushes half a dozen times already and they are still shedding . Whatever I 'm cleaning ends up with loose bristles all over them .	-1
This is a very easy to use gauge that allows for negative adjustment by simply tapping the button on the side to release air while watching the reading . It seems well made and , I hate to say , I have dropped it a couple of times but with no ill effects . Other reviews have led me to believe that Slime makes some of the most accurate gauges out there.Update : 10/1/13 It is now 9 lbs off for no apparent reason and is worthless .	-1
First time I zipped pants leg the zipper broke off right in my hand lol now that 's quality . Buy something else !	-1
I liked the look of these when they arrived . However they are not very heavy gauge metal and bend easily when installed onto the tail lights . The only good thing about this , is that they bend back into place just as easily as they had bent out of shape . Nice looking , but need to be better made .	-1
The fender flares arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date ! The passenger side front fender has a flaw in it ! The side moldings do not fit flush against the fender flares ? The only positive is that the fenders where easy to install ! I would not recommend this product to other !	-1
It 's a little to small to fit my license plate . Anyway I did n't want to take the time to send it back and look for another one so I made it fit mine I just used a pair of tin snips and trimmed off a small piece of the license plate along the bottom . It ca n't be seen since it 's behind the frame . Works fine but I should n't have had to do anything so it 's pretty bad when you ca n't make something to fit what it 's supposed to fit . How hard would it be to measure a few different states license plates and make it big enough to fit the largest one ?	-1
Cheap plastic that cracks easily and a waste of time.Get something that costs more and made better.the end	-1
Seems well made however it is pretty slow pumping 10w30 oil at room temp . ( the engine should be warmed up ) The plastic clip ( used to pinch off the line ) until vacuum is built up , seems to deform the plastic tubing further slowing down flow.I just ordered a 3/8 '' fuel on/off valve ( for under $ 5.00 on Amazon ) and will eliminate that clip which should help.5-12-14 update . Removed the plastic pinch `` valve '' and put on the above brass , 3/8 '' on/off valve . This valve definitly seals better and may allow more flow as the hose is n't pinched at all anymore . It still takes much longer to pump 10w30 oil than I expected , count on a half hour for 4 quarts..If I knew ( and I did watch a video showing oh well it worked ) HOW SLOW this is , I would have simply purchased ( and still may ) an electric pump .	-1
I guess that I 'm `` Old School '' but this product is not for me.First : As others have stated , spatter is a problem - no matter how careful you are.Second : There 's not a lot of surface contact area , so it takes a long time to get anywhere.Third : Even if you are careful in squezing out the ball after you wash it , it takes a very long time ( days ) to dry out.My suggestion is to take some fluffy old athletic socks and do the job by hand . That 's a lot of work , but it seems to go faster than with the ball - it 's also easier to judge where you have been.Disclaimer - My experience is limited and I have only tried this product on an old car that has set unwaxed for nearly 30 years . If your car is newer and the paint has been kept up , you may have better luck with the ball . I plan to try it on a Honda CR-V with nice paint and will provide an update following that.Hopefully the next experience will be magical ...	-1
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails . What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work . Why the heck ca n't these be standardized ? I 've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types . It seems that what is listed is not always what you order , and on top of that , someone like me , who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes wo n't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought , why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance . It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects -- but only if made by CAMCO , and then these quick connect fittings do n't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc . WTF ? I need still another adapter ? And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work ? I 'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect . That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged , knocked out of place , that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok , so I called CAMCO . I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off . It seems Camco parts do n't necessarily fit each other . And they do n't sell adapters to make them fit . It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO 's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also , because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers do n't know what they are getting.Honestly , I 'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them . I 'm an engineer , and if I ca n't figure out what to order , based on conflicting information -- reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4 & # 34 ; npt than specified 3/8 & # 34 ; npt , and a multitude of part numbers -- and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter -- -it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it , there are only so many way propane tanks , hoses and appliances are hooked up . I do n't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks .	-1

For almost $ 9 this is too much . I recycle my old 1 gallon milk jugs and take them to my auto store for recycling . This is much easier on the wallet since you already bought the milk .	-1
The tolerances on the threads of this container are poor . Granted , it is quite inexpensive and the consumer can only expect so much at this price point . I have tested about a dozen of these containers sold at various retail outlets . Not a single one could be tightened such that I was unable to squeeze air out of it . While this may not be a problem for highly viscous oil , other more volatile compounds which may contaminate the oil could leak out.Ironically , you can purchase a similarly sized kitty liter container at Aldi for the same price . Use the litter for an oil absorbent if you do n't own a cat .	-1
During the first week the ANCO wiper was on the drivers side of my outdoor-only car , we had 80+ degree weather , rain , sleet & snow . The ANCO wiper started leaving a small eye-level streak after 4 days . The streak is faint , but definitely there , and , annoyingly , right at eye level.My passenger side wiper , ACDelco 22ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator - 22 '' ( Pack of 1 ) , has been on my car since the beginning of the year and has been through multiple snow storms and freezing temperatures . The AC Delco wiper continues to be streak-free.I am going to put the drivers side ACDelco wiper back on my car . It has a higher profile arm , but it does a great job .	-1
These did not fit my '08 suburban , the description said w/ 9x3 hook , so I assumed that to be included . It was n't and I was unable to use these on my '08 suburban .	-1
I really do like beam style wipers . They do n't rust . They look nicer than the old fashioned style of wiper and they perform better in most instances ... except this one.The 22 '' ANCO Contour wiper I mounted on the driver 's side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent ( a parts match fit according to Amazon 's part finder ) wo n't conform completely or correctly to the curvature of the windshield . It leaves a section of the windshield partially wiped putting a streak of water a couple inches wide and right in my line of sight . I 've tried cleaning the window and wiping down the blade but nothing solves the issue . A visual inspection of the 22 '' blade reveals no physical defects or flaws.The 16 '' ANCO Contour blade I have installed on the passenger side of my Accent clears the window without this problem.I have also noticed that at highway speeds above 65 MPH both blades seem to lift off the windshield and are less effective at clearing water away even though these blades have a spoiler built into them to cut down on this high speed problem.I really wanted to like these blades . They fit on my car without the need of a bulky and unsightly adapter like some other brands require you to use . Unfortunately looks are n't really an important feature in a wiper blade , performance is . And unfortunately these blades ... just do n't cut it . { Update } After just a couple weeks on the vehicle the 22 '' wiper on the driver 's side is leaving a four to six inch wide section of the windshield , right in my line of sight , only partially cleared . Review dropped to one star , blades tossed in the trash .	-1
These wipers were installed on my Prius . I 've had it for several years and the original wipers were just not cleaning as they used to . I was surprised that this small car needed a wiper that was longer than the ones my 4 Runner uses.I 'm not sure why , but the larger blade started to leave about 2 to 3 inches smeared in the middle of the blade . I have reinstalled it , used my old trick of diluted vinegar to clean the blade and the windscreen and it still does not do an adequate job . The smaller blade is working fine , but this larger one will definitely need to be replaced before the next few days of inclement weather .	-1
what junk , scratches way too easy and was scratched when i got them , threw away , dont waste your money is you ipe or wash your car .	-1

It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks . I just do n't know , I may be doing something wrong . But , I do n't think so because I am following the directions on the package . If any one has some tips please post them ... ... ... ... ... ... ..	-1
I was hoping this tool to be good , but it has poor design . In my honest opinion , the tool is way too big/tall and heavy because 50 % of the time I ca n't take a tread reading because the tool is too big to fit in between the tire and the upper wheel walls on most of the cars I work on . This thing weighs like 1/2 pound and that 's just way too heavy for a tire tread gauge . It does feel rock solid sturdier though , but it too difficult to use because it 's hard to quickly retract the measuring point in between taking readings .	-1
Bought from Amazon back in April 2012 , did n't try to use it until just recently . My Yokahama GeoLander tires when brand new had 13/32 of tread . Using this Fowler digital gauge , it told me I had 23/32 of tread ? ? ? How is that possible , these tires are magically growing more rubber ! ! I checked on multiple spots on the tires and was always around 23/32 , so at least that part is consistent . I went to the Fowler home page and emailed them last week , have yet to get a response.I ended up purchasing from amazon the Milton S448 Tire Tread Depth Gauge -- -Works like a charm and much much cheaper ! ! ! Not sure why the Fowler gives me the whacked out reading ( took out battery and replaced it ) but I guess there are always defective ones -- especially when dealing with anything electronic -- -Another reason to go with the Milton tread gauge -- very basic , yet it works .	-1
First I must say I hate purchasing tools that only do one thing ... ( uni-tasker ) . I purchased this socket tool , becouse I had to . Not becase I wanted to , but quickly found out I need another socket to turn it ... and here 's the kicker . The socket is bigger then standard set 19mm or 3/4 ! So you have go out and purchase a 15/16 or 24mm socket , which is a huge socket . I will never use this socket unless I own a diesel truck . Add that to the cost of the wrench . So about 8 dollars for the socket and the price of tool , just to get started . The oil filter was n't on too tight , so the cheaper plastic tool worked out just fine for me . The 24mm socket stays on the aluminum tool and should ship like that . Waste of time and money for a tool that only does one task ... .	-1
I wanted to cover my spare . Received this the day before I went out of town . Right out of the box , one of the seams at the black cording was already frayed . Poor quality , but you get what you pay for .	-1
Vinyl is lined with fleece-like material ; entire sleeve is very pliable ( just warm it up before putting them on ) . Straps are canvass cord with plastic buckles . Highly recommended . *Update 10/27/2013 : barely had these 2 & 1/2 months ( purchased August 7 , 2013 ) and one of the plastic buckle clips have broken . I put them on once for about 1 & 1/2 months , removed them for a month to camp , and just went to put them back on . The clip on one of them just fell apart in my hands . Very cheap - DO NOT RECOMMEND ! ! !	-1
These are cheap and barely cover the tops of the tires . It is also very difficult to maneuver the elastic strap around the back of the tire so it can latch to the other elastic strip . I literally have to use a stick , wrap the long strap around it and push it so I can grab it at the other side . I would think it would be a better design to put elastic all the way around so the tires would be completely covered without having to awkwardly strap it down .	-1
These fit perfectly on my tires but the straps that go around to hold them in place were not easy to connect . I had to climb under the 5th wheel to connect the buckles . Normally this would not be a problem except I park the RV in a gravel lot . Just be aware of how they secure on the back side .	-1
Returned this . Fit was ... okay ... . but with only flimsy magnets to hold it in place , there was no way it was going to stay put in a 50-60 mph wind . I was n't willing to risk it .	-1
I really wanted this to work , it 's exactly what I wanted . The massive tip on the end and the side spring design causes it to pop-out of my lighter socket.I liked the idea of the covers and it feels well built.Description should have said something about required socket depth ... I supposed it will work in a deeper socket , just not mine . Bummer .	-1
I try it out in my car with a voltage meter and it would not work . I check to see if I had fully mated to make sure I had power . Fortunately for me , I touch my meter and it was very warm to the touch . I unplugged it and let it cool off . I remove the adapter and plug my meter directly into the lighter . Fortunately , my meter still works . I thought the adapter had shorted my meter . The green light on the adapter shows it was getting power from my car battery but there must be an internal short which heated up my volt meter . I guess you get what you paid for .	-1
Walmart sells it for $ 14.99 . Amazon needs to drop the price to at least $ 14.99.Edit : Does what it says it does and does it well . 5 stars for the product itselfThanks to Amazon for adjusting the price to market conditions . 5 stars for the price also .	-1

I 've got a Suburban furnace ( model NT16S , if curious ) and while these do fit the diameter of the openings , and the springs hold them on , with the suburban design , there is a big open gap at the bottom underneath the bottom screen . It 's the way the outside plate is molded.. it 's raised most of the way around , except from about 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock . There the screen bridges over the open gap and defeats the purpose ... . any bug that wanted in could get in . ( Granted , it would stop a mouse . ) You 'd be better off , if you have this design , getting a rectangular one that covers the whole plate . That 's what I 'll try next.Still giving it 2 stars because I 'm sure they 'd work fine on a different model , but they should say what models these fit .	-1
The issue I had with these gloves is they are so thin that just the rough handling of the fittings can tear through them . There are better gloves out there ( which are probably more expensive ) , so I suppose you get what you pay for.One thing I found funny . The package also doubles as a case and they give you double-sided tape so you can mount it on a wall , etc.But to use it , you have to break open the & # 34 ; slot & # 34 ; which turns the packaging into a dispenser , remove the gloves ( the gloves are sealed in another piece of plastic , and remove the double-sided tape , which is also inside . But the glove bundle is physically larger than the slot , so you end up having a hard time removing the gloves as well as re-inserting them after removing the inner glove package .	-1
I travel all summer . I am dumping tanks a few times a week . I need a disposable glove to keep my hands from getting dirty with waste so I can toss them and get in the truck to drive off to my next stop.These I would not consider nothing more than cheap thin plastic gloves . Baggie sandwich bags would work as good and fit as good . Maybe even work better as baggies dont rip as easy as these . Save your money and the frustration.They dont fit , they rip so easy and usually fall of half way through and are ripped . So I end up having to wash up in the end like I never used any gloves at all . I would buy good latex gloves that fit snug and wont rip so easily .	-1
Purchased these glove to use when dumping my tank on my RV . I was not very satifiedy with this product . The problem that I had was that before you could get them on you hands the glove would come apart and either they would rip at the finger holes or just come apart putting them on . They are very thin to use and I believe one size fits all . When I did use them I ended up using several gloves just to get the tanks emptied.I ended up buying a box of rubber gloves to use . That were 100 % better then these very thin gloves . Sorry , I would not recommend this product for dumping your tanks..	-1
Too light . Flimsy and just about useless . Great for new RV/Camper owners that are afraid they 'll get their hands dirty while dumping their RV/Camper tanks . They do n't fit well , slide around on your hands .	-1
To thin . Ripped before the job was done . I tossed them and got a heavier glove . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Had some fogging and discoloration on the top edges of my headlights on my 08 civic . Tried out this kit because it was cheaper than having a pro do it . Now I wish I had just paid the extra to begin with . I meticulously followed the directions and went through every step of the process and my end result was worse than where I started . Instead of some fogging at the tops of the lights I now have swirl marks and a hazy look over the entire light . When looking on an angle the lights appear totally white and even from a distance do n't have that new looking shine that they had even when they were fogged . I would not recommend this unless you like cheap looking fixes . Also I scratched my fender because one of the pads Velcro tore loose while I was sanding , not 100 % the kits fault but still very infuriating.EDIT : After cursing myself for hours I decided I had to fix this . I got out multiple polishes and products that I know are from a reputable company ( Meguiar 's ) . With these I polished over the headlight many times and made them look as this kit should have done . The results were great and can be seen in a side by side comparison in the photos I added . I still do not recommend this kit at all because it is far from complete and for the non car enthusiast that is the difference form a good outcome and a horrible disappointment . Also if you do any type of restoration on headlights you remove any remaining clear coat on the lights so they may re-yellow or fog quickly . To prevent this it is a good idea to seal them with something like Opti-Lens or Opti-Coat , they are expensive but work extremely well .	-1

I bought some of this at my local harbor freight anddid not have good results . I wanted to remove some rust from and repaint my skid plates for the SUV . After reading the directions I sanded down the worst spots , covered the parts in paper towels , soaked in the evapo-rust and covered the paper towels with saran wrap to prevent evaporation . After leaving it sit for 12 hours ( the maximum recommended period of time ) there was no difference . The parts were still as rusty as ever.If you have large parts that need rust removal I recommend naval jelly first and foremost . It is a thick gel that you paint on and it eats away the rust within 15-20 minutes . Handle with extreme care because it is highly corrosive , but you will get the results you 're after . In a pinch the napa brand is almost as good and readily available .	-1

Product clips are very flimsy . I would not trust this net on my car during highway driving . As soon as I put it on my roof-top carrier the two opposing corners came apart . On close inspection I realized the corners were simply tied together just as you would tie your shoes . Very dangerous and sloppy workmanship . I was very fortunate the item came apart during installation and not on the road . If you zoom in closely on the product pix you 'll notice the two corners tied together , those are the 2 failure points . NOTE : the net was not stressed nor overstretched during installation in order to cause this type of failure . Be safe on the road , stay away from this item .	-1
some people bought it because the design positions the light to the side and makes driving easier since the light wont block your view while driving and THATS VERY true , it works and thats the reason why i bought it , the problems i had and the reasons i returned it and gave it two stars is 1 ) it came with its own screws which was a plus BUT screws started to rust , and at that time we just hit fall no snow yet ! ! 2 ) the design made it so hard to adjust the lights , i have the rigged indust . D2 lights and it was hard to get the light to go a bit higher it stayed down lighting most of my hood which was very annoying and distracting 3 ) it came with two 4 pieces of double sided stickers ( 2 for each side ) to protect the surface of the paint they were so thin i decided to go to the hardware store and buy 3M double sided stickers my mistake was using the stickers that came with the brackets and the ones i bought ! i found out about this after i took them off is the 2pieces that came with the bracket did n't protect my paint and saw lots of scratches but the other ones i bought from the store held up pretty goodi ended up buying Rugged Ridge 11027.03 Black Windshield Hinge Light Bracket and its much much better choice and since my lights arent as huge as some i dont have any problems with my lights sticking up a lil	-1
I have bike racks , step hitches and trailer hitch attachments and none of them fit as poorly as this . I 'm using a Curt hitch receiver , btw . It is a good 1/4 '' off on the sides . I would never drive around with this thing clanging away at the hitch and possibly bending the pin and damaging the hitch receiver . This is strictly a vehicle toolbox attachment to only be installed when you get stuck . It 's a shame because the quality otherwise seems top notch .	-1

Lots of mixed reviews on this one but I thought I would give it a try.This product WILL NOT fit ANY & # 34 ; D & # 34 ; cell Mag Lite .

I have purchased this gauge from another catalog company several years ago and was very pleased with the quality and performance and features of this type of gauge . UNFORTUNATELY , this gauge purchased on Amazon is terrible . I do n't know if this is a knockoff or if this company is allowing other manufacturers to manufacture under license but the one I got is terrible . The locking chuck on my previous purchases would clip on and stay locked on tight to my tire valve . The ones here do not stay locked on . The second I let go of pushing it on the valve , the pressure drops to zero . I contacted the manufacturef on the package - GH Meiser - and they were so kind as to send me replacement chucks but these were only marginally better . But when I tried inflating my tire thru this gauge , the gauge reading would swing all the way past 100 as the compressor was pumping air . This is not the way my previous years ' purchases behaved . If the recommended pressure was 35 , my old Accugauges would read around 40-ish as the compressor was running ... .not swing wildly to 100 as this one does . I wo n't buy this gauge thru Amazon anymore , as a previous Accugage I bought a couple of weeks earlier was also returned for non-locking chuck .	-1
This is only fair . The clip mechanism does not hold well to a valve stem and must be frequently readjusted .	-1
I had this gauge for about a year and was very pleased with the accuracy and handiness , but the first time I dropped it , it was finished . I took it apart and found the little ball had broken off the stem that provides the seal in the gauge . It looked like it had been glued on.Before I dropped it , it worked great . So much for the rubber armor on the gauge .	-1
Loses accuracy after riding in the saddle bag for a while . I filled up tires with a portable compressor with digital gauge , that shuts off at designated PSI . Double check with this EZ Air Gauge and had to let like 10 pounds out.I think to myself , this is n't right so double check pressure with a pen gauge from the car , and sure enough tire is 10 pounds light . Either my portable compressor and pen gauge are lying identically , or this gauge has lost it 's accuracy.I will know for sure how much it 's off once I get the chance to swing it by a tire shop.All of this may seem minor but on a motorcycle 10 pounds can become a huge safety concern . A gauge that is more than 3-4 pounds off will go in the trash . My safety is worth more than the 5-10 bucks I save on a bargain gauge .	-1
It works pretty well for light use after I cut off the cigarette lighter power plug and replaced it with a10 GAUGE 2 PIN QUICK DISCONNECT HARNESS , into which I can plug a set ofBattery Tender 081-0069-4 Alligator Clips with Black 2-Pin Quick Disconnect Plugor plug directly into aBattery Tender 081-0069-6 Ring Terminal Harness with Black Fused 2-Pin Quick Disconnect Plugattached to my motorcycle battery . It works pretty well now with a direct connection to the battery , especially if the car/motorcycle engine is running.With that modification , this little pump is fine for bicycle and motorcycle tires and for topping off a slightly low car tire , but I would n't want to use it to fully inflate a full-sized car or truck tire from beginning to end . The little pump gets pretty hot after a couple of minutes.The gauge on mine is fairly accurate , close enough to be considered reliable.Before I modified the power connector , it continually blew fuses , and , after putting in a stronger fuse , the connection got exceedingly hot after only a few minutes of use . My new connections do n't get hot at all .	-1
8 x 4 x 11 ! ! ! Dont make my mistake , this thing is tiny , check the dimensions . At nearly $ 13 you would think it would be of some size ? Wrong , again , my fault for not reading . Should be advertised and a bathroom trash can . There is no way this is worth $ 13 bucks !	-1
These seemed like a nice , cheap way to darken up our RV for sleeping in , and keep out unwanted solar heating . However , we really want and need them most when it 's hottest outside . We 've had 100 degree weather this week . I installed these on the door and ceiling skylight , by simply peeling the backing off some Velcro tabs and sticking it between the mat and the window box.Unfortunately after the sun had been beating on ours for about an hour , the Velcro glue let go , and the covers fell off . The Velcro stuck to the window and skylight , but it pulled off the shiny chrome window covers . It sticks fine when it 's cool , but that defeats the purpose of being a `` sunshield '' . Now I 'm concerned that the glue will take the finish off the windowframe if I pull the Velcro tabs back off.I wanted these to be easily removable . Good idea , but I do n't know how you fix that without screwing them down or something else that will leave permanent , unsightly residue or hardware . ? ? ? Buy some custom-fit window shades instead . Your local home-improvement store can help , give you options , and cut them to size .	-1
The velcro that is sent with it is not very good ... on hot days in the RV they fall off and they tear easy .	-1
It is too small for my standard sized RV door which makes me wonder what sort of very thin door it is made for .	-1
This item is very cheaply made and the Velcro that it come with does not stay stuck . As soon as the Velcro heats up is falls off of the RV window . I had to go but industrial strength Velcro to attach it with and it seems to work pretty good . Just be careful when removing them from your window because they will tear very easily . Also , if you are looking for something to keep the light out this is NOT the product ! It will filter some of the light out but if I had to guess I would say that it only filters about fifty percent of it out . Oh well , lesson learned . I would not recommend this product unless you are willing to go buy some industrial strength Velcro . Disappointed in this product . You get what you pay for and it is Not made in the USA therefore you judge the quality of it ! Update : I gave in and bought some industrial strength Velcro , it is black Velcro , and took the Velcro off that came with them and applied the industrial strength Velcro . They stay in place now and the Do help to keep the sun out . They do not darken the room to a blackout but they do help . Happy now that I solved the problem of them staying put in place !	-1
Was hoping they would fit into my BMW e46 and save me $ 40 , but they were 1 & # 34 ; too short . on the drivers side long one . they were almost there ... why wo n't anyone make a refill that fits my BMW you 'd sell a boat load .	-1
The problem with this wash mop is that the head falls off the handle quite easily . If you try to shake it off to get some rinse water out the whole head pops right off . Obviously this is very annoying . And this problem occurred from day 1 it is not that the thing was abused over time .	-1
This thing will break within 5 minutes of your first use . The plastic which holds the head on is incredible thin and unable to move without the wash head flying off .	-1
Went to screw on the pump to a quart of oil and cheap plastic lid broke right off . After fabricating another lid , found that this will work good for topping off the transmission fluid , but not for a fluid change as it took 15 minutes for about 6 ounces of fluid to transfer . Used the old fashioned tube and upside down bottle instead .	-1
Put this in my 04 Jeep TJ ( NV3550 ) and like other reviews on here , it seems to work great in there . Not sure what fluid was in it before and I did n't notice a massive improvement or anything , but shifts smooth and no issues so far . Good price too . Recommended . The NV3550 takes exactly two bottlesUpdate : It has been cold the past few days ( -10C ) and my Jeep is extremely hard to get into gear for the first 5km or so . Was n't doing this before the fluid change . It seems to work fine above 0 though . Just an FYI for anyone living in colder climates	-1
This negative ( One Star ) review is due to Amazon 's problem with their matrix for `` what part fits a particular vehicle '' - I would rate Mann Oil filter at FIVE Stars . I needed an Oil Filter ( Mann ) for a 2006 BMW 325 Ci Convertible . Amazon 's fit guide steered me towards the Mann HU 816 - long story short , the HU 816 does NOT fit my vehicle . I needed a Mann HU-925 ( I had to go to a different web site for fit , and verification ) . I still ordered the correct filter via Amazon because Amazon has the best price . One Star to Amazon 's Vehicle Fit Guide , and Five Star for the Mann Filter .	-1
This thing did n't fit into my 2006 Honda Civic . It 's supposed to , but the frame was not trimmed correctly . The build quality is poor .	-1
It did not fit and I returned it . I ordered a FRAM and it fit right in . Plus FRAM had a rebate .	-1
Why not just keep your tools and other rust-prone items in a dry place ? This is a great idea if you 've got things you absolutely ca n't keep out of rust-prone locations , but at the same time you have to replace these little units every three months and the area they cover is minimal . These little inhibitors start to add up ... fast . Great concept , but it should really last longer , especially for the price .	-1
First off , I could not see any benefit using this product in my toolbox . It 's a 30-day product so what 's the point ? I suggest priming and painting any metal items to prevent rust .	-1
I expected to be able to just put this product in a toolbox , gun case , boat , etc and forget about it . But to my surprise , it only lasts 90 days ! I 'm not sure I fully understand this , if the product vapors a corrosion protection on the contents of the toolbox then why does it have to be replaced ? The only reason I can think of is that if the tools are used then the protection is lost . There are tool box drawer liners that do not have time limitations that would be significantly cheaper in the long run . And it is only good for 2 cubic feet of space , it says that this is the size of an average tool box , most of mine are quite a bit bigger than that . Wiping tools down with an oily rag would also be a lot cheaper . If this product lasted for a year , it might be worthwhile but there are so many other cheaper ways to protect tools and equipment from rust and corrosion . But if you have an enclosure or equipment that can not be protected any other way , then this product might be worthwhile ( if you can remember to replace it and have access to it ) .	-1
Mine has never been used and paint chipped off . Can be a real tight fit too ( can make it work still but the foam gasket has to compress way too far ) .	-1
I ordered this before measuring ( a big mistake ) the distance from the plate to the hole and this wont fit many applications correctly . With the pin in the hole , the plate sticks out way too far from the receiver , over an inch and then rattles . I just threw it away as its too costly to send back . Drilling new holes would be difficult and then rust problems . BOTTOM line , measure your receiver application and then ask them if this unit will fit correctly before buying . Their specs should indicate the distance from the plate backing to the center of the hole .	-1
Thia says 500lb capacity , maybe right over the main support , but otherwise you should balance your load well and I will use straps to help support the outboard corners . I kept it because it is a usefull thing , but not for a heavy items .	-1
The gloves looks great . Looks like a quality built . But after using 5 times , foam paddings from the inside started to come out . Let 's see how long it will last.UPDATE ( 9/17/2013 ) Developed a hole on one of the fingers with only about a month and a half of use . Maybe about 10-15 rides . I still like the fit and feel .	-1
Not sure why these `` guards '' are getting such rave reviews . Sure , they look cool , but the welds on the two vertical bars ( which are weak in and of themselves ) are absolutely terrible . If even a twig gets hung-up in those things , the weld will likely snap -- you might just snap them trying to get the things over your lights . If you 're in this for the looks , go for it . If you want protection for your lights , go elsewhere .	-1
This item that I ordered twice in two different sizes . Always said it would fit my 2013 jeep wrangler sport unlimited . Never fits ! ! Says easy to install , but it does not go over the light cover . Really wanted this to work the second time . Chance the description and say does n't fit 2013 jeeps .	-1
The bristles on this brush are long , but too spaced out to be effective on a multi-spoke wheel . If you have large , flat wheels , this will probably work OK , but it does a horrible job of actually cleaning anything completely . I use a second bucket for my wheels and just ended up using a different wash mitt . It takes easily 3-4x as long to clean a wheel with this brush completely as it does to simply use a mitt . Save your money and just buy a second bucket and a cheap wash mitt and call it a day . The only reason I did n't return it is because it 's handy for washing my suspension and wheel wells , but it 's a worthless wheel brush .	-1
great brush but it wo n't last very long - shows significant wear and tear after a few uses on my SUV 's wheels - some of the polyester bristle is falling out already - will not buy again	-1
Overall , there is nothing wrong with this brush , but it just does n't seem to clean . I have a 2012 for explorer and this brush just does n't seem to do anything between the spokes .	-1
I have a reasonable amount of experience doing car detailing , and I can say this brush really is not suitable for carpets . I was surprised , as this brush has many positive reviews -- these people have to be tearing up their carpets and upholstery with this thing.The bristles are stiff , stiffer than most tire brushes . I sure as heck would n't use this thing on the carpets in my car , it would destroy them . I would be even less inclined to use this on my upholstery , it would tear right through it . For under six dollars , I 'm sure I will find some use for it , perhaps brushing out the wheel wells -- that is about how thick and stiff the bristles are . I suppose if you had rubber car mats it would work well for those , but those usually do n't need much in the way of brushing to get clean.All in all , save your six dollars and go to the hardware store and get a brush with bristles that are n't as stiff . You should be letting your carpet cleaner do most of the work , not your bristles .	-1
Bristles are way too stiff . I used this brush once on my cloth seats ( VW GTI ) to remove a small , quarter-sized stain . It left permanent damage to the surface of the seat . And I did n't even use much pressure . Cleaning should be 80 % chemical and 20 % brush . You do not need a brush this stiff , unless you 're maybe cleaning wood/metal .	-1
It 's a bit flimsy , the wires that loop around are thin and will bend easy . The fuzzy part is also a thin low-count bristle , and does n't really seem to dig in and clean . Good handle though .	-1
Not everything promised , easily bends and losses bristles , not long enough . Not overly happy with the product and would get a longer or bigger brush .	-1
Not really worth having as the brush is smaller than the head making it hard to get it in the hard to reach spots.The brush is not very sturdy so does n't last very long .	-1
I do n't understand why but the two brushes I got were terrible . I used them to wash the small crevasse 's on my motorcycle . The problem was the fact that the brushes would n't go back to their straight position . As I would move them back and forth , the brushes would just follow . It reminded me of a severally bad tooth brush .	-1
After one trip , the pin is coated in rust . The cotter pin was also extremely difficult operate . A tiny bit more flexibility would make it easier to use and would n't compromise any safety.The fact that this is covered in rust would prevent me from buying .	-1
I own 3 different absorbers , and have used 5 in my lifetime , but this one is different . It has all the markings of an absorber , but it definitely has a different texture , and does not work as well . This product ( I would n't even call it an absorber ) has a real hard time soaking up water , unlike my other absorbers , and I believe it to be a clone .	-1
i wouldnt buy again , doesnt last , take the time and do a good hand wax application , might be handy for a quik dusting , thatsd about it , dont use on interior as it eats away the lettering on handles/ etc	-1
the fan is low power . the blades are super small so it doesnt push much air . there are NO FEET as pictured . there is not a switch on front as pictured ( its all on the - which is less convenient for our uses ) , and the handle is grey not white -- and has no hook on it . the power cord ( 12 volt ) is like 9 inch long ( who on earth would put it 9 inches in front of their dash ? ? ? ) we bought it to replace a 'rechargable ' fan that finally died - it was by ozcool and expensive -- since that fan rechargability failed in the 1st 6 months we opted for a standard battery/12 volt fan -- but the ozcool also had large blades , a hook , and a super long 12 volt cord . we need this for the back window in the truck ( the one that slides open ) to give air to the dogs ( fits in perfectly ) . while it works i would n't by this under powered mis-advertised item again . also it has no ac power option . just 12 volt and battery ( d ) .	-1
For the size of this DC fan , you would think it would turn out better air flow ( CFM 's ) , but it is weak at best.I bought an 02Cool from Amazon a couple of weeks ago that impresses me more ( due to it 's small size ) , at under $ 8.00 that does not require ( 8 ) D batteries ( only two ) , and whats with having to leave your keys in the ignition . ( I regress ) Also the product you will receive looks different than the one pictured ; See my 3 JPG's.I would pass on this one .	-1
it works as it says . Hooked it up on the bike for a long distance 12V connection on travels and head phones .	-1
I order this core remover and got a cheap piece of junk . The one sent was silver and did not even have the non slip end on it.I NOTIFIED AMAZON on THIS ITEM .	-1
this is not what i ordered or even close . does not look the same in color shape or size . buyer beware	-1
Very cheaply made if you use your tailgate alot I would not recommend it does the job but do n't think it would hold up if used all the time .	-1
Like other reviewers , I found that this blade only wipes the lower half of the rear window . Unfortunately I no longer have the old wiper to reuse some of the parts.The wiper itself is plastic and can not be bent ( I found out the hard way and broke one of the two wipers that I ordered ) . It appears that a portion of the plastic snap-in adapter is in the way and the blade can not curve enough to touch the window along its entire length .	-1
Bought this for my Subaru forester , the check said it would fit it did n't , wont waste my time sending back poor purchase	-1
The crampbuster does not work as advertised for me . I need to keep adjusting it upward . I tried a piece of 200 grit sandpaper and roughed up the inside of the crampbuster , it did not work any better and I think I wasted my money on this one .	-1
Does not work with late model Dodge canbus autolights . The styrofoam packaging inside the case was damaged upon arrival , but the parts themselves were not visibly damaged .	-1
received open box . looked like everything thrown in the box . neither lights worked . so all these good reviews trying again	-1
I bought this unit as a sales from Amazon warehouse . I had Kensun HID installed in my Van is real good working order . But when I install this kit , I found the light bulb connector can not well connect each other . I check every of the parts is work OK . It ca n't tell are there ( 9006 ) had different in socket size . I hope the seller can specify or check their spec before they list the the HID for sales . At last , I sent my problem to Amazon Customer Service . They issue a return label immediately for me to return Kits . Their service is real high efficiency and promptly to solve out my concern . I 'm sure Amazon provide good care of the customer .	-1
Installed on 2013 Elantra GT ( hatchback ) with OEM projectors.First things first , you will need the signal cancelers ! So the lights in the first delivery were n't working at all . So i got a replacement from amazon and they worked fine for a bit before they began to flicker . Customer service sent me a relay harness for free ( in exchange for good review ) . Even with the relay harness I had a problem with random on/off times.I must say that the cables although well built , the connectors are cheap ! i had to modify one because the pin split ! after a while , i just gave up trying . Sent them back and got another brand . I do n't believe in 3rd time 's a charm ! I 'd say for the price give it a try and see how it works for you . But spending a bit more and get something more solid with better connectors wo n't hurt .	-1
The mechanical device that controls the bixenon lights did not work ( or at least did not work with my truck ) . The lights would immeadiately shift in when the headlights would turn on ( the resting position is outward ) and then would stick in place when the highbeams were triggered ( one would occasionally push out slightly ) . Other than the fact the bi-xenon part did not work , they looked great for a great price . I like having highbeams though , so I sent them back .	-1
DOES NOT WORK with 2001 Acura MDX or 1st generation Honda Pilot.Calling Autel support in the US and they are totally useless because they deny this is their product.Now for the long story ... I purchased this tool to read the code off my 2001 Acura MDX ( equivalent to the 1st generation Honda Pilot ) , well it DOES NOT WORK , keeps scanning and eventually gives a & # 34 ; LINKING ERROR & # 34 ; . I 've tried it with the ignition switch in the ON position ( engine not running ) as well as having the engine running , same & # 34 ; LINKING ERROR & # 34 ; . The documentation states it supports anything 1996 or newer with ODBII connector.However , this reader does work in our 2011 Honda Odyssey ; the linking took about a minute but it connected , and is even able to read the VIN # from the car via the OBDII port , but the scanning is slow , took almost 2 minutes to read the VIN # .Now for the experience with customer support . Went to the website auteltech ( dot ) com as listed in the included manual and called their toll-free support number . Their technician states that & # 34 ; I do n't know where you got the MS309 from , but that is not a US Autel product . We can not support it . Amazon or eBay is selling products that are not ours with our name on it. & # 34 ; When I asked the technician which model supports the 2001 Acura MDX , he said & # 34 ; all of our products , even the low end AI319 ; as long as it is a 1996-2012 car with an OBDII connector it works. & # 34 ; I reiterated my question asking him to confirm that it supported that particular car , he stated & # 34 ; as long as you buy it from us , we support it & # 34 ; . Again , he did not confirm it was tested on any vehicle . So I asked if there are any online sellers , he stated he can not recommend anyone and that I need to ask the retailer for support if it does n't work.So what does that tell me ? RUN FROM THIS COMPANY if you plan on needing support ! My question now is , do I keep this or return it ( purchased from Pocket-Store and was fulfilled by Amazon ) ? In the meantime , I am giving this product 2-stars because it does work in our newer car . However , I can not give it more stars given the response I got from support and the fact that it failed to connect to a 2001 Honda/Acura .	-1
its seems to be ok but the construction of it seems to be cheap but I do n't work on cars for a living ( Backyard Mechanic )	-1
Works on my 2001 Honda Civic.Does not work with 2010 Honda CRV . Link error . It 's so incompatible that when the scanner start to scan , that the Slip Warning light would come on . ( freaked me out , but after I turn the ignition key off and back on , the light would go away ) .I might keep it around just for the civic and as a loaner.I know this thing is cheap , but if I was to do it all over , I would save the money and buy a better unit.I wish there would be a spreadsheet where people can enter type of cars would work or would n't work on this unit.====update 08/13/13Well , I finally called the tech support and see if anything could be done to the `` Link Error '' issue that I 'm having with my CRV ( tricks or updates ) .Apparently , this model MS300 has been discontinued since 2007 . The support person ca n't even find the support document on his side . Since the support person was a nice guy , I did n't want to give him too much hard time , so I asked his opinion on a better model from Autel .	-1
It would n't work for me which could of been a defective scanner . The price was good , but I was unable to reset the ECU to extinguish the check engine light .	-1
If it were possible i would give 0 stars . purchased this unit to scan 2001 Jaguar . unit apparently froze up the transmission shift , threw 2 codes previously unknown { checked at autozone previous day } Codes P1797 P1642 > Contacted seller who immediately responded { very apologetic } I had told seller that the unit was set up for Sept 2008 andt hat a prior post stated `` beware of prior to 2011 edition `` Also advised the S/N was MS50245 . NOTE THAT S/N .Seller then inquired { strange } how I found out the date of the set up/code and the S/N Asking if possible would I send pictures showing details DAHHH ! It 's on the first screen line 6 though only shows briefly.Seller offered 20 % discount if I kept unit . I declined offer . Went on Autel 's { UK } Website No listing for model MS509 , Their current models are in 780 range however they do have big notation for a disclaimer referencing China Copies.THen checked out Autel web site `` chinacardiag.com `` In the 5 reviews listed one was from a gentleman in Brunei who reported problems with this same UNIT SN # 50245 .Hmmm how did it get from Brunei to Texas . Must be that all China clones have same S/N ? ? ? There is no software to update , you can not download instructions to get a print out . The CD supplied is only a copy of the Operation Book..I was very concerned about the effect unit has had on my vehicle since it left the vehiclein `` restricted performance mode '' . Took it to Autozone for code check today and read the codes but the good news is the restricted performance code is gone Returned scanner to amazon today.All I CAN SAY IS YOU mIGHT BE TAKING A BIG RISK IN USING THIS UNITPositive not Received on time by FED EX , Communications from seller good .	-1
I normally do not like giving one star ratings , but this item deserves it for the following reasons : Upon receipt item did not have a battery even though the box clearly stated it contains a nine-volt ? Meter was not in any sort of wrap/bag etc . Cables looked to have been resealed in the plastic bags . The software would not recognize the unit when hooked up though to usb . The burn date for the software on this scanner is 9/11/2008 , Version 2.03 . Obviously this is an older stock , used unit , refurbished and sent to me.I had a Cen-Tech I had taken back , due to display problems , to Harbor Freight that is the identical same thing as this scanner . It came in a small bubble bag , the leads looked new and sealed in the bag , it had a new nine-volt , the software recognized it when hooked to the usb . The burn date for the software on this scanner is 7/25/12 , Version 2.13 . This scanner functioned fine it just had a display problem therefore the take back.Older software , a scanner that appears used , repackaged , software not recognizing it , and no battery . This experience has cost me extra shipping costs and wasted my time trying to figure out just what piece of junk they sent me.Since I have had the experience of having one of these that did function I do know the difference.I would clearly avoid this seller , not reputable .	-1
I used this product about an hour ago . The foam is much to soft and will not reach the areas it should . It does not polish well at all . Grab your rags , polish , tin foil , and a can of elbow grease , do it by hand and you will be a lot happier .	-1
Tried wheel polishers before ( Mother Powerball , cotton buffer wheels , Mequire 's Wheel Restoration kit ) and was left all but appalled with this product . Went to apply pressure to buff some oxidation out only to find out that a plastic rod is what holds the cone together . I was only able to complete one wheel before the product was in three piece on the asphalt . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this cause it was cheap and had good reviews . But its ok at best . I am OCD about washing my cars . The best spray wax is NXT however could n't find so gave this a shot.NXT is actually milky in color and texture leaves a slippery surface behind . This stuff is clear and just scented water , does n't not leave a slippery surface behind , no real shine.If you want a good wax or spray wax look at Meguiar 's NXT Generation	-1
I tried to get this thing to work but could not . The LED light would never come on . I followed the directions exactly as stated for my specific vehicle from the xpresskit web site but no go . It just did not work so I sent it back to Amazon .	-1
Be very careful what model you choose this for . It said it was compatible with my car through Amazon , but the mechanic found out it was for MOST 2005 models , but not ALL of them . Had to return it and wait for a FLCAN to arrive in the mail . My recommendation is to simply plan ahead and buy the FLCAN . A bit more money but a lot less hassle .	-1
This is an idea whose time has not arrived . Perhaps if one has a teeny tiny vehicle then this may work out . First of all , you have to purchase micro-fiber towels per the instructions . Be sure to get lots of them . You are instructed to do one panel at a time - spray , wipe and buff . Supposedly you will save 80 - 120 gallons of water and eliminate toxic runoff ( apparently referring to the soapy water ) . I HAVE NEVER USED ANYWHERE NEAR THAT MUCH WATER TO WASH MY CAR . With eco touch I am left with a whole slew of micro-fiber towels that would end up in a landfill because I do n't know how to recycle dirty towels.I believe that eco touch has a problem with `` truth in advertising '' . I can see using this for minor cleaning such a a deposit left by a bird or an insect meeting its demise on my vehicle . But , to wash the entire car is best done with a bucket , hose , sponge and chamois cloth . Or , take it to a car wash .	-1
I wanted a smaller diameter nut than what I have now but these are really small . I did not install these on my rims I just did n't feel confident that these would keep my wheels on my car . They probably weigh about 1/2 of what I have on my rims now . Too much trouble to send them back , I 'll keep them and show them to my mechanic and get his input on them , for now I feel safer with what Ive had on them for a couple years now .	-1
See Update Below original 4 star review . ( Original : ) Unless you are taking your vehicle to the track , and have a need to spend $ 60-100 for a set of fancy locking lug nuts , these will suffice ! I have used these on several vehicles without a hitch , and they are a great buy for the money . Only reason for rating 4 stars is that there is always a little play in using the lug adapter , which makes torquing the lugs a little bit more a pain . ( Update : ) The last set of these I received had a `` Dud '' lugnut in the batch ... That is , that the threading was either of a different pitch , or not threaded properly . Fortunately I caught it before attempting to forcefully thread the nut on , possibly ruining the stud as well ... When one lug would not rotate by hand onto the stud I tried it on several others without avail . Instead of risking the stripping of a stud , I attempted to thread it on my spare wheel carrier ( suspecting that the threading may have just had a bur on it , ) where it required I would estimate in excess of 30lbft to rotate any bit past 1/3 turn . I am unsure if the quality control has just gone down hill , or whether this was an anomaly , but this could mean bad news for someone who is less experienced with vehicle maintenance , or uses improper procedures such as installing with an impact wrench .	-1
I did not see any difference even after applying for long time . It may work better on older paints ( but I doubt it ) . Does not even remove swirls , I was very attentive and applied for long time - no difference at all . Does nothing.I Do not recommend this one .	-1
I bought this product in removing fine surface scratches from my black 2007 Chevy Cobalt . The paint is still in great condition and only has some minor surface scratches from automatic carwashes.The first time I used Meguiar 's Ultimate Compound I used an orbital buffer . The instructions are quite vague and more or less state that all you have to do is rub the compound in a circular motion in a small area then buff away . So I figured if that was all you really had to do , an orbital buffer would be more than enough.Wrong.While Ultimate Compound is excellent at removing water spots ( and even dead bugs and tar ) it is horrible at removing swirl marks and fine scratches . I can use a simple wax and get the same results as with this `` Ultimate '' compound.The second time around I decided to try the product on my victory red 2001 Chevy Blazer . Years of automatic car washes have really taken their toll on the paint , but not so much that it had lost all of its shine . Instead of the buffer , I used a 100 % cotton terrycloth and some good ol ' elbow grease . Unfortunately I got the same results as before.I can get the same result that this product offers by using Turtle Wax Ice and in a fraction of the time.Do I recommend this product ? NoWill I buy this product again ? Probably not	-1
It was only effect with super fine scratches . With normal fine scratches , the product wo n't make them disappear . I tried to scrub fine scratches for hour but they were still there . Super fine scratches disappeared anyway . The product wo n't harm the clear coat so shiny paint coating was stay .	-1
i tried to wipe it off as in the instructions , and the surface was cool , it left large black circles on hood , did n't go away with regular washing , went away with waterless foamtek only ! ! ! ! !	-1
Regarding the actual product ( for me ) , I still need to find something with a bit more abrasive/coarse-ness in a compound for my specific paint correction on a black two-stage paint . Also , I was n't aware ( until I actually used and tested an area when ) I worked-in the product ( Meguiars M105 mirror-glaze pro Ultra-cut compound ) with my DA PC polisher , that it actually & # 34 ; seemed & # 34 ; to polish to a shine ( w/ 'continued use ) ; I used an ( orange ) # 2 Hex-Logic foam cutting pad ... which at first seemed odd ? ? But it may be because my speed was set at # 6 . In any case , the product did n't do what I expected ( for my needs ) so I stopped and determined I needed a compound with a bit more abrasive-ness and cut ... and although it seemed to remove 75 % ( of my problem ) of the fine swirls marks in my clear-coat ... it still left a hint of very fine/light scratches and swirl marks & # 34 ; still & # 34 ; embeded on the top-coat.Now , regarding delivery ... I was left & # 34 ; hangin ' in the wind & # 34 ; . I was seriously wondering why this ( 1 ) specific ( Amazon ) item that was part of a total of ( 6 ) other ( Amazon ) items ( and ordered at the same time ) was shipped seperately but 2 days ahead ... & # 34 ; BUT & # 34 ; then only to arrive at my mailbox two days later then the rest of the other items ? ! ? ? What was that about ? ? The problem is ... this left me with the delivery of the ( other items ) 5 & # 34 ; velcro backing plate , the 8-pc chem.guys foam hex-pads , meguiars M205 polish , misc microfiber towels , and a pair of shoes ( bday present for nephew ) ... But could n't actually use any of those & # 34 ; task specific & # 34 ; items until I received this item ( the Meguiars M105 ) -hench for ( my reason ) disregarding ( and leaving ) the & # 34 ; unchecked & # 34 ; option to & # 34 ; NOT & # 34 ; ship each item as it became available ! !	-1
I installed this on my Jeep XJ . Installation was straightforward . It made my stock headlights quite a bit brighter . Unfortunately , right after the first 30 minute drive I was standing in my driveway admiring how nice and bright the headlights were when POOF , the low beams just shut off by themselves , never to return . I turned on the high beams and they still worked , for about a minute and then they shut off , too . It 's the relays - pure junk . Good thing I was not out on the highway ! To say I 'm disappointed in this product is a big understatement . Only use it if you have a completely separate set of driving lights that you can switch on when these randomly shut off your lights . This is a real safety issue .	-1
the idea of this is fantastic ! The directions are very plain and not the well laid out . The first step of install is confusing . Maybe this is not the right model for my truck but per Amazon & # 34 ; check if it fits & # 34 ; it is supposed to work . I can not get it to tighten right or even start the install properly . I went to youtube to find a video , i watched and then tried the install again . Still it wont work . I plan on calling them tomorrow to talk to customer service we will see how that goes . If they assist me with installation i will comeback and update my review .	-1
I bought this towel while looking for a cheaper alternative to my Cobra and Chemical Guys drying towels . The search goes on . I have washed this towel countless times and it still leaves blue fibers all over my car . It also is n't all that absorbent .	-1
I actually ordered these after reading a review by a woman who said she uses them to wash the make-up off her face ! I thought these would hold up well , and liked the oval contoured shape for this sort of use . I also thought these were well priced for a package of 6.When they arrived however , they were not the oval ones shown in the picture , and they did not come in a package of 6 . For this reason , I did not give them more than 2 stars . Though I do think they are nice , thick quality , terry covered pads , they are not what as shown in the ad 's picture , and I was very disappointed to find only 4 in the package .	-1
After a considerable wait of several weeks I received my scan tool . I read the instructions ( very brief ) checked for updates ( none available ) and tried the tool on my 2008 4runner.The tool gave me a green emission control system light , no active codes , and a cryptic security system DTC that it could not clear . I unplugged the tool and started the car . No CEL , everything seemed fine UNTIL ... I took it for a drive he next morning and after about 5 minutes the CEL and the VSC malfunction lights illuminated . After returning home I hooked up The scan tool and it had logged 20 malfunction codes ! ( first time in 5 years this vehicle had thrown a code ) I attempted to reset the codes , the scanner said they were erased , and when I rescanned the codes returned . After several attempts I disconnected the tool and drove the car ... The CEL was off but I noticed that several dealer settings ( security system , headlights , seatbelt warning ) had all been removed and needed to be reset . I checked the scan tool one last time and the 20 codes remained , along with a yellow emissions status indicator.Well , for 200 bucks , this was a total bust . Did more harm than good and went back to the seller .	-1
I 'm not sure why every type of code reader is coming down in price but offering software to load on your laptop to store , compare , print , and submit to a group of mechanics to analyze your data.The reason I gave it three starts and thought about two is the fact that this code reader is connecting to your car 's master computer but utilizes the Internet to download updates etc . Yet instead of using an Open System Operating System or creating a Mac Version , which if there was a Mac OS X version , a mechanic would n't have to lug around a laptop but could use an iPad.Plus , I have used Windows and Windows Servers for 26 years and paid quarterly subscriptions for Norton , Symantec , etc . and still Trojan Horses would infect the server . Every dealership has a Windows Server with WiFi so they can connect easily to the site to upload or download data or update software . Why would these idiots at INNOVA pay the cost of using a windows operating system when they could jump to open system code or produce a Mac App . Because i 'm convinced these companies do n't have a clue about computers . They are mechanics who know how to use a laptop . BIG MISTAKE AND I CA N'T WAIT UNTIL THESE CARS THAT ARE MORE AND MORE DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERS TO DO EVERYTHING BUT DRIVE THE CAR AND MONITOR EVERYTHING TO UPLOAD A VIRUS TO A VEHICLE . THEY WILL BE USING THEIR LAPTOP , HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE OVER PRICED SOFTWARE AND ITS JUST A MATTER OF TIME . SIX MONTHS . WINDOWS IS JUNK AND I REFUSE TO OWN ONE . I CREATE A VIRTUAL WINDOWS MACHINE ON MY HARD DRIVE COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM EVERYTHING ELSE BUT EVENTUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP AWARDING THIS COMPANY FIVE STARS , REALLY NEED TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR MONKEY SUIT AND REALIZE A LATE MODEL CAR IS NOTHING BUT A BIG COMPUTER . WHEN SOMEBODY DIES BECAUSE THE MASTER COMPUTER IS INFECTED , INNOVA WO N'T BE AROUND ANYMORE ! !	-1
I have to untie the hooks from the net every single time that I remove it from the seat . It is not rigid like other brands .	-1
The hooks are made of steel wire with plastic tube over the wire . Each hook is supposed to have a rubber-like cap over the end . The caps are there to prevent the bare metal ends from scratching your motorcycle or bicycle . I saw at least one other review where the purchaser super-glued these tips on after losing one . I ordered 2 , and both arrived with at least one tip already missing.There were also more long loose ends flailing about than seemed necessary . Sure , I could have cut those shorter and melted the ends to prevent fraying , but I should not have to.Mine also smelled pretty bad , but I assume that would dissipate pretty quickly.The quality is just not very good .	-1
This unit was dead on arrival . I tried both the lighter and battery connections with the car running . No power of any kind . I read through the manual looking for clues , checked all connections and tried everything I know . Maybe it was just the one that got through inspections while everyone was asleep . I ca n't even recommend if it would power the USB connection . Think I 'll try a local store . The Amazon return policy was great however .	-1
As soon as I plugged it in I heard a `` pop '' . No output . I guess try another inverter and probably another Cobra .	-1
i was excited to receive my Jetseal 109. i waited until the time was right and washed my truck . started applying the Jetseal 109 and found that it was harder to apply than the old timey paste wax . got the hood , windshield , front bumper and mirrors done and called it a day . i do n't know if i 'll get the ambition needed to do the rest of my truck or not . glad i did n't get the gallon . only got a pint . does n't go very far either . later	-1
This is an okay product , but it does leave white marks if you miss a spot taking it off.It should cost less for what it is and that size bottle you get given that you can get virtually the same protection using a good quality synthetic wax sealant in 2 coats such asMeguiar 's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 ( 18-Ounce Liquid ) , for a lot less money . The Meguiar 's wax is a lot easier to take off and does not leave white specs when it dries .	-1
Yeah , it says it but do n't try to tint anything on your car or you will get pulled over , trust me .	-1
After cleaning all the wheels , I applied this to the front wheel of my 2012 Audi S4 . I did not apply to the other front wheel . I drove the car for a week and observed the results . Both front wheels had the same amount of break dust on them . I then washed both front wheels with the same cleaning product . Both required the same level of effort to remove the baked on break dust . I see no value to this product .	-1
Did not make it look like paint was wet i personaly use magualers . I like the wet look from that	-1
This wax seems to shine my black car quite nicely . It goes on easy and also very easy to take off with no powdering or anything.It however does not seem to last very long so I 'm really not sure it 's worth double the cost of a Meguiar 's or Mothers wax.I also do n't like how Chemical Guys has so many different waxes , they must have like 10-15 different waxes . It gets confusing to know what to buy ! I regret this purchase .	-1
I ordered this product after being blown away by its performance on the Chemical Guys ' YouTube channel and the great reviews on Amazon . I have used Silk Shine along side one of Chemical Guys ' dizzying amount of cleaning products and exactly as instructed both on the bottle and in the video , and I have only achieved mediocre results at best . I REALLY want to like Chemical Guys and I have some more of their products on the way to hopefully yield better results , but I 'm somewhat worried that their confusingly large product selection an indicator that results may vary .	-1
Does not work as advertised . Followed the instructions , but was not able to get the headlight lens on my 2009 RV .	-1
I read the directions fully before starting the work , followed them completely , and I ended up with a scratched lens after using the sandpaper . I used plenty of liquid as well in case anyone thinks I put dry sand paper to a dry lens . I would definitely not recommend using this product .	-1
I used this product on our motorhome head lights . The plastic lenes had small scrathes and a mild haze on the left lens.. This is an over priced kit for what it was supose to due . The sanding pads are so small and they did not make through the first lens . The sealer is on a small pad and their is not enough sealer on the pad to cover both of the lenes . So save your self , some money and purchasean individual bottle of lens cleaner , a bottle of lens sealer along with some 1000 and 1500 grit wet sand paper . This way you 'll have enough product to due your lens for several years	-1
ok , i got it , it does NOTwork . my wifes 2005 chrysler had the same problem as all cars , the headlight clear lens was foggy and oxidized . i used this product as per instructions and it did Not remove the scratches and the headlights do Not look any better , save you 're money and go to mcdonalds . i dont know who wrote the good reviews but i can tell you , it does not clear up the lenses as they claim . The headlights do not look new again and i really cant tell Any difference , dont believe me , try it and you will ask for you 're money back just like i did .	-1
I followed the instructions word by word . I took about an hour on each headlight using each scuff pad and lubricating them well . After I was finished I could tell a difference , the headlights looked good but not GREAT . Looking back , I dont think it was worth my time/effort . It may work better for your vehicle , it is not too expensive so I guess it is worth a try . I have heard from numerous people that the mother 's headlight lens restoration kit works well , maybe ill give that a try . Oh and yes I did use the sealant wipe to hopefully protect my hardwork which sadly failed me .	-1
I am not sure what the problem is , but I used toothpaste at first and did n't notice a lot of difference on my 2009 Camry lens covers . So I bought this and I do n't see any difference .	-1
I followed the instructions TO THE LETTER , and my headlights look the same as they did before ! This product did not work at all for me !	-1
My headlights were n't as bad as some and this stuff did n't do much to improve them . I did the optional sandpaper step and the only thing it really did was remove some of the surface roughness and make them smooth . It barely did anything to make them more clear .	-1
I got these for my 2-door Wrangler JK.I have WeatherTech in the front but thought I 'd save a few bucks by getting the Rugged Ridge for behind the seats . They dont settle in their spots well AT ALL . The weather techs fit like a glove up front and these things are nowhere near as good.I also got Rugged Ridge for the cargo compartment and was n't very impressed with the placement of the outlines for the cutout holes . They were n't lined up where they should be.Pay the extra bucks for WeatherTech if you can .	-1
I put it on the first night and the bands ripped out of place . I had to rig it up to get it to stay in place . It bunched in the corners because there was too much material . But it does its job .	-1
I did n't expect much from this cover considering the price , but I was surprised at how cheaply made this cover is . I broke two of the four straps that are used to secure the covers - they just pulled apart from the cover . I do not recommend these covers since the fastening mechanisms are faulty .	-1
I bought this for my 2008 JK jeep wrangler after the valve stem on the stock sensor corroded and developed a leak . Discount tire tried to sell me a deal to replace the old TPMS and stem for $ 60.. Now I wish I would of done it.This sensor after installed shut off the TPMS light before I left the tire dealers parking lot ... & # 34 ; Awesome & # 34 ; I thought , problem solved.Well in the week that has followed the light comes on and off intermitenly with out any real rime or reason . Hot or Cold , Night or Day . I 've had my preasure checked numerous times and it 's alway spot on . Usually it comes on after I just start the car and will go out after a few minutes but yesterday it came on and stayed on all the way to work . When I left the office for lunch it was off.I too live in Minnesota like another reviewer and had concerns about the sensor working correctly in cold winters . If it wont work right in 70+ degree summer / fall it 's not going to get any better . Worst part is I 'm out the installation fees and what do I do ... Buy another one ? I 'm going to the dealer which I should of done the first time . -Lesson learned .	-1
Well , I ordered a few of these to replace some from oddly enough , Meguiars ... . They 're made in China ... OF COURSE . WELL , LONG STORY SHORT , great towels ! ! ! ! ! But the edge material came apart at the first use . We had n't even laundered these yet ... . Just be ready to return em for replacement . They 're glad to help ... As they want you to co e back !	-1
I have to agree with another reviewer that this cloth is almost identical to those you find in Walmart . It is THIN THIN THIN and not at all worth the price . This is a surprise from Mothers as I use a lot of their products and typically their quality is excellent .	-1
Made a mistake , it 's the Detail version I wanted as they are the very best these are just ok.Get the Detail ones by Mothers and use these for petty jobs and the Detail ones for real waxing .	-1
Great while it lasted , but does n't last long at all . Falling apart after a couple months of weekly use . Guess I will try a Microfiber mitt .	-1
I could n't even get my fingers in . I normally wear Large so I ordered XL and ca n't even get my fingers half way in . I have the Raider full motorcycle gloves and they as well as these are a good deal when they fit.I JUST WISH THEY WERE HONEST ABOUT THE SIZING AND QUIT WASTING BUYERS TIME . IT 'S A CRAP SHOOT GETTING A PAIR TO FIT .	-1
I ordered an XL pair of these gloves . However , they barely fit my wife 's hands and she is all of 5'2 & # 34 ; and has small hands.The package and the gloves were clearly labeled XL . Poor quality control at the manufacturing plant somewhere . The quality of the product itself seemed to be adequate but unfortunately I could not even try them on .	-1
I ordered these gloves because it seemed like a good deal for the price . Problem is I ca n't even get them on my hands ! They are too small and I ca n't even return them for a larger pair ( say XL or XXL ) because apparently they only come in large . So I end up keeping them and I still do n't have a warm pair of gloves to use when I want to ride my bike and it is cold . They did seem like a decent glove but I ca n't rate them on use or performance since I ca n't get my hands in them .	-1
Leather tear and stitches coming out on both gloves in the inner-finger areas.Sending them back for refund . Would not recommend you purchasing them .	-1
The instructions preclude using this as a chock when hitching or unhitching so what is the point ? What a waste of money .	-1
While they are what they claim to be , you can go to your nearest hardware store and buy mch longer nails and a few washers for a lot less money .	-1
Bend too easy . Went to Walmart and bought heavy duty tent stakes .	-1
If you have an electric drill or impact this will probably work well for you . I have a craftsman 20v bolt on drill and impact . Fits drill chuck no problem and cranking down landing gear is easy . Cranking it up on the other hand is too much for the drill and the 1/4 drive on impact wo n't fit the shaft on the socket . No one makes an adaptor to fit this shaft so it 's a waste of money especially if you have a 3/4 & # 34 ; socket in your tool box .	-1
Really disappointing ! A waste of money for me ! I have a 28 ' 5'ver and all this damn thing did is put a lot of stress on my rv tire that it was on and never got the other tire off the ground . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! Go back to the old reliable way with a Jack .	-1
I ordered the Trailer aid `` plus '' which is taller than the standard trailer aid . I tried it on my 2007 Forest River 5th wheel , in the driveway , and it would not bring the other wheel off the ground . I added a heavy 2 x 6 to the bottom of it and it now just barely lifts the wheel enough to change . I do n't trust it to be enough in an emergency . When I originally used this it just slid along the concrete and the wheel did n't roll on to it . I wasted my money and it tore itself up enough that I could n't return it .	-1
I bought the digital tire pressure gauge for a truck that takes 80 PSI for its tires . I found on a recent trip that the tire pressure monitors in the tires were providing a very different reading from the Accutire pressure gauge - a difference of 8 PSI . I found a Love 's truck stop where they sold a high quality tire pressure gauge and it confirmed that the tire monitors were accurate and that the Accutire pressure gauge was way off with its readings.Had I continued to rely on the Accutire pressure gauge I would have risked a blowout and certainly would have had uneven tire wear and in either case the end result would have been expensive . I recommend that before trusting an Accutire pressure gauge that you compare it to another quality gauge ( not the ones at the gas stations ) and see if they agree . The truck stop tire gauge is now in the truck and the Accutire pressure gauge is at the local dump .	-1
.A good tire gauge is easy to line up at the correct angle to the valve stem . You can line it up visually before you press it on . You lose very little air while checking the pressure . If the pressure was already correct , you do not have to add back 1-2 PSI that you lost with the gauge.The nose of a good tire gauge is offset at about 45 degrees , so you can use it without difficulty on bicycle tires , or in other special situations.This Michelin MN-4357B is none of the above . The offset is 10 degrees and hard to visualize on this curvy objet d'art . The seal is quite sensitive to mis-alignment . Most people will have a hard time with this . You 'll get a tight seal through trial and error while air leaks out of the tire for a few seconds . It 's quite a hassle with bike tires ... spokes interfere with your grip of the gauge ( see pics ) .The beautiful form-fitting zipper case should be immediately thrown away . Why ? Because it sometimes holds the flashlight button down , draining the batteries while it 's being stored.You can enter your car 's target tire pressure ( front and back ) , and it displays below the pressure reading . Useful if you only have one car . Otherwise , ill conceived.One thing this gauge would be really good for : A design school case study . Beauty and clever features count for nothing when real-world basics are ignored.- - - Alternatives - - -- Accutire MS-4021B Digital Tire Gauge-Viair 90052 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~	-1
Having only used standard , dial-type , mechanical tire pressure gauges for my cars , motorcycles , and bicycles over the years , I was curious to try out this Michelin Digital Tire Pressure Gauge.Likes : > Includes two CR2032 batteries and carrying case. > Built in LED light next to the Schrader ( automotive type ) nozzle. > Programmable front and rear tire pressures . Could be useful for relatives/friends borrowing one 's vehicle.Dislikes : > If the battery is low or drained , tire pressure ca n't be measured. > Cumbersome , barely angled nozzle is difficult to line up perfectly with the tire valve stem . Even more problematic with valves that are close to the wheels/spokes . That means lots of air leakage prior to getting a reading. > Is it really necessary to have the programmable tire pressure feature for our personal vehicles , motorcycles , and bicycles ? How hard is it to memorize a few PSIs ? What if we use the digital gauge on more than one vehicle ? > Does n't have a relief valve to lower tire PSI when pressure is slightly high. > When placed in a moving vehicle 's glove/storage compartment , the hard nylon carrying case may inadvertently press the power button on the side of the gauge and drain the battery.Overall : Tire gauges are critical for maintaining proper pressures , safety , and optimizing MPG for vehicles . Even more so for lower volume , high pressure tires on motorcycles and bicycles . I will continue to use time tested and reliable mechanical tire gauges such asAccugage Dial Tire Gauge With Hose RRA60Xrather than rely on digital tire pressure gauges .	-1
I obtained this product from Vine . As other reviewers have pointed out , the main functionality on this Michelin product leaves a lot to be desired . It is difficult to seat onto the tire valve stem , lacking in this key point of ease of use . The case is also a pain to open since it needs to be unzipped nearly all the way around in order to remove the tire gauge for use . Otherwise , it is decent quality overall make and digital readout.For another vehicle in our household , we have the Accutire MS-4355GB Programmable Tire Gauge , which is a better choice ( although more expensive ) . The Accutire is very easy to seat onto the valve stem , has given consistent performance and held up for the last 9 months .	-1
This looks really great , but looks can be deceiving.The part that actually connects to the tire air valve is flat -- which made it unpredictable for me as to whether I would get it right the first time . And , of course , if it is n't just right , it lets air out of the tire . Half the time , I would hit it just right and it would work great . However , I do n't want to spend a lot of time messing with my tires , so having to mess with just getting the connection to the pressure gauge is annoying at best.Actually , someone who uses it a lot might like it a lot more , since they could figure out how to dependably use it . ( I use a pressure gauge once a month to check my tires . ) This gauge has a really nice shape , good surface feel , and very clear screen . The light would be useful in some dim lighting situations . The case is handy , but not really that impressive or useful . I checked it against a couple of other gauges ( not as cool looking , but dependable ) . All three agreed with each other , so apparently accuracy is not a problem.The programming lets you input the pressure you want for the front and back tires , so you do n't have to keep opening the driver 's door to check . However , since it only does it for one car , it is n't a lot of help if you have more than one car and they have different air pressure requirements.BTW , whether you use this or another gauge , it is well worth the cost . Your tires last longer and are safer to use when they are inflated properly .	-1
I have used this product in ( 3 ) vehicles , ( 2 ) lawn mowers , ( 1 ) grass trimmer , ( 1 ) snowblower and a partridge in a pear tree . I have n't noticed any benefit in using this product whatsoever . For fuel storage , I would recommend STA-BIL 360 .	-1
I have n't had this battery long , and I have n't used it that much , but it 's already leaking ( so much for `` sealed '' ) . Other than that , it does seem to handle charging and discharging well , though I question for how long , given the way its leaking . I do like the terminals and the way they 're color coded ( red and black ) .	-1
Since I like Chemical Guys , I bought the gallon size of this right off the bat . When I got it , I diluted it 2 parts to 1 with water like it says to prevent streaking . When I used this , I continually got black streak marks on my paint and made my car look more dirty then before . Then I tried it without water and it was the same ( I used the chemical guys spray bottle ) . My paint was not hot , and I even sprayed it on a towel and then wiped , and still got bad reside . Not sure if its the wax , but it took me 20 minutes to remove the black crap off with Meguiars Ultimate detailer . ( Brand new dark blue car ) Right after I spray this , it turns black and streaks . It does smell good but that is about it . I 'm really disappointed in Chemical Guys . I ended up returning the jug so I could get my $ 27 bucks back . Thankfully amazon is really good about returns . I honestly hope this is just me or a bad batch , because I hate to give bad reviews to good companies . Overall , I think I will buy the smaller size products from now on to test them first .	-1
Dont buy not worth it to epensive did gave it a try but i had to remove it whith my regular body shine thank you	-1
These neither fit my smallest cabinet in my RV nor do they fit well within their telescoping tube . Kind of wobbly . I am not sure what to do with them at this point , except maybe the trash .	-1
Save your money , these things are worthless . They are very weak and flimsy and do nothing to secure anything . I would not buy again .	-1
Meant to be used with a drill instead of a buffer . It did n't state this in the description and I was hoping for the best . Decent pads for the money . The pads are a little low on quality compared to some other brands . I would have had to pay for the return shipping so I just kept the kit .	-1
Got some black wheels for my 99 Lexus GS400 and wanted to have the weights blend in . These look great . Powder coated for durability and even the adhesive is black.I was stoked to have these but once applied I say the error of my ways . The adhesive is not good at all . The guys at the shop couldnt get these to stay on my wheel through balancing , even after thouroughly cleaning the surface before hand.If the adhesive was good , this would easily be 5 stars . Unfortunately this is not the case here .	-1
These seemed like a nice , cheap way to darken up our RV for sleeping in , and keep out unwanted solar heating . However , we really want and need them most when it 's hottest outside . We 've had 100 degree weather this week . I installed these on the ceiling vents , by simply peeling the backing off some Velcro tabs and sticking it between the mat and the vent box.Unfortunately after the sun had been beating on ours for about an hour , the Velcro glue let go , and the covers fell off . The Velcro stuck to the vent , but it pulled off the shiny chrome covers . It sticks fine when it 's cool , but that defeats the purpose of being a `` sunshield '' . Now I 'm concerned that the glue will take the finish off the ceiling if I pull the Velcro tabs back off.I wanted these to be easily removable . Good idea , but I do n't know how you fix that without screwing them down or something else that will leave permanent , unsightly residue or hardware . ? ? ? Buy the vent shade `` pillow '' style Camco 45192 RV Sunshield Vent Insulator instead . Do n't use the included Velcro tabs , just stuff them up in the vent and they 'll stay .	-1
why sell a product that the buyer has to purchase better velcro to make it stick ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? This is absolutely ridiculous ! It would be an easy fix for the manufacturer to LISTEN to the customer complaints about this product and require better velcro glue .	-1
This the same as the door cover the velcro strips could be better . We bought this and the door cover the strips melt when it gets hot we went and got differents strips and work good ..but they tear easy..	-1
The adhesive to these is HORRIBLE ! ! I use them for room darkening in our RV when camping and I was constantly having to put the back up because the adhesive does not stick well . For room darkening however THEY ARE GREAT !	-1
I have used these in my vents for years on different Rvs and they always stayed in place nice and flush in vent . They really insulate the heat from that vent area and work nice for pillow at a ball game to sit on , not with added plastic insulator they now added.I thought they were great , But they have recently added another section to it and now it sits all crunched up and not very attractive in vent not a good fit at all . It stays in place and I assume will work doing what its intended for but looks terrible like I stuffed an oversized pillow in the vent . I usually dont send products back but this was not worth it , I have a nice motorhome dont need it looking bad from the ceiling vents . Amazon refunded me in full . I love Amazon its my favorite place to shop and do a lot ! Update 6-23-13 ... .I DID FIND IN WALMART THE ORIGINAL DESIGN THAT WORKED GREAT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THIS BUT WITHOUT THE ADDED PLASIC . WALMART HAS THE GREAT FITTING OLD STYLE FOR LIKE 9.00 IN RV SECTION IN AUTOPARTS . I HAVE NOT SEEN AMAZON CARRY THIS OLD STYLE . THE OLDER STYLE FIT AND STAYED GREAT !	-1
I have a 2004 Yellowstone sport RV . This does not fit the inside space of the vent ( the vent crank gets in the way ) . Even when I remove the crank and use the sticky tape that comes with it , it just falls off . A good idea , but a bad design . Do n't know what might make it work properly .	-1
I purchased these water filters to lessen the likelihood of water spots after washing my vehicles as suggested in several online forums . Unfortunately , we have very hard water here in the Northeast and it did not resolve the issue with spotting .	-1
This does n't fit my outside filter for my rv . the filter just kinda rest on it . total waste of money	-1
One of these under my bottom step ai n't getting it , I am going to buy another one and put them on each end , one only keeps moving around . Well made , good quality unit .	-1
I bought two of these to help support the step on my travel trailer . I installed them securely at the rear of the bottom of the step . My wife stepped off on the step from the camper , and the steps collapsed into themselves , and the braces flipped up causing injury to her shins and legs . It could have been much worse had her leg ( s ) fallen between the two steps and the steps collapsing on her , possibly causing her leg to be severed . I am very disappointed in the size of the tops and bottoms . They are only about 4 inches square . These are very flimsily constructed .	-1
Talk about a let-down and a rip off ! ! ! I paid almost $ 15 , for what I thought would be two units ( as the product picture shows ) , only to take delivery of the component and find that you only get ONE OF THEM.Seriously . I could have bought a $ 17 pair of black jack-stands at big-box-car-parts , and done the same thing . I most assuredly would not have spent the equivalent of $ 30 for what would be a pair of screw jack stands ! Save your money , and consider another solution . They are solid , they are ok , they are nothing but screw-head jack stands ... and there 's no 'THEY ' to it , you are buying one unit . *** ADDED DETAIL ***After trying to use this a couple of times , I also have to mention that the lower footer is about 3 x 3-inches , and the upper head of the jack also has a head of about 3 x 3 inches ... this does n't work really well with some steps ... like mine . My steps are steel with a reinforcing ridge in the middle , running laterally across the bottom of the step . As a result , you ca n't 'nest ' the head beneath your step treadplate , it only precariously sits on the edge of the step . As a result , there 's not a lot of 'bracing ' from using this at all . Yes , I could put a piece of pine shelving beneath the step and screw the jack into it ( not good , if you do n't want your steps to rust apart ) ... but you ca n't take that upper plate off , and the screw head is not removable ... so in the end , this is the oddest white-elephant I 've ever bought ... ca n't get it to work whatsoever.I 've got a pair of aluminium spinner jacks for loads up to 1000 pounds that work MUCH better than this thing ... unfortunately , I ca n't even use it to stabilize the rear of the rv ... there is only one of them ... and it is n't rated anywhere near high enough to do something like that with ...	-1
The idea is good , but this is not stable under my step . Each time up or down the step , it moves and there 's no way to hold it in place . I went back to my nailed together stack of 2X8s . It might work in sand though . ~Pegleg~	-1
It is a waste of money for the intended purpose ! Got ripped purchasing this ! It might be a great product for some other purpose but not a Save-A-Step brace ! It is made ok , if I could find another purpose for it .	-1
I tried installing this but found that the stairs on my trailer have a support bar through the middle and there is not a good place to install it . ( I should have read the reviews and would not have even ordered it ! ) I will wait until I get home to my shop and make some modifications so I can use it .	-1
ca n't use this because the step on my camper is close to the ground and the adjustment is n't short enough to work on level ground . maybe it would be great on uneven ground , but what camp ground is that uneven ? how about a shorter one ?	-1
Works somewhat but the clips that hold the brace up broke off . A little quality control would go a long way .	-1
The helmet is a large , however , the unit is running small sizes . It sets too high on my head . I could use a extra-large size	-1
You could find something suitable at many retailers . I thought it would be a heavier . It 's like that stuff you use to keep things from sliding in your droors ! Oh yeah , and it drives me nuts in the wind slapping the roof !	-1
If this kit was of better quality it would be a nice way for one person to bleed brakes . However , this kit is sorely lacking in the quality dept . First , the plastic hose is packed in the box with kinks in it . So even after trying to relax the kinks , they collapse with suction is applied . The adapters are a 'one time ' application . Once I seated the adapter to the first brake bleeder valve ( which worked well ) , it was all over ... The following bleeder valves would n't seat , as the adapter was not pliable enough to re-seat . Do yourself a favor and buy a set of speed bleeders ... and leave this kit alone !	-1
First off , the picture looks like metal-but it 's plastic . This would n't be too bad if the rest of the kit was n't so poor . The suction pump is okay-though tiresome- but the jar is too small , the hosing is chintzy and the fittings leak like crazy . Regardless of how much you pump , you will always see air-even if there is n't any in your brake lines . This can make it very difficult to tell if you 've actually bled the lines or not.Perhaps this would work better for a motorcycle .	-1
It did n't worked so well , a gasket was leeking , They send me a complete rebuilt parts parts fast and free . But still I had to have the purge done at the garage at the end .	-1
The pump seems to work fine . The flaws arise in the leaky reservoir and fittings . The only way for a vacuum pump to really work is to be able to create a seal . This thing leaks not only from the poorly designed reservoir , but from every tube connection point.I ended up going with the Motive pump for my Audi A4 instead . It costs more but its actually usable .	-1
The one I received broke on the first torque adjustment . Went from base to 20 ft. lbs . and it made a grinding sound then locked up . Got it to move backwards , tried again ... no luck . Immediately sent back as defective .	-1
I used them for landing gear support and at the back supports for my 38 ' 5th wheel trailer along with the cap pieces by the same company . Some of the ones under the landing gear cracked immediately when weight was applied . I was shocked . As for the ones in the rear of the trailer , I used four of these with a cap piece . There is simply to much give in them . Not stable at all . I took them out and used concrete blocks . I give them two stars because of the handy bag they come in . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I spray paint a lot of things , cars , bikes , jetskis , plastics , fabrics and stuff around the house . This Prep Spray might work if there is only light grease and certain types of waxes but does not work all the time on all surfaces . I would say it works about 30 % of the time , the rest of the time requires more intense cleaning , scrubbing , sanding or even sandblasting . If the surface you are painting has been waxed or contaminated with oil , this Prep Spray will probably not do the job . I really expected more from a Duplic-Color product meant to clean surfaces before painting .	-1
Works OK but no better than Dawn dish soap or many other spray cleaners that are less expensive . Save your money .	-1
The towels are very nice and soft only problem is that these are more for washing than wiping things . Highly recommend washing them before use . The `` feathers '' of the towel will come off and it gets kinda of annoying to see feathers on my car or flying around me . These do soak up a lot of water and gets the job done but not the towels I was looking for.2 stars because it 's a great buy but if your looking for microfiber towels that dries+washes like I was , stay away from these .	-1
This is the worst piece of crap ever . I was always warned about buying the gimmicks on tv . It did n't do what it stated it would do , I did better cleaning my windows with window cleaner and a regular microfiber cloth . This was a waste of my money and time buying this piece of crap .	-1
This product is a wonderful Idea , and works like a charm . One problem I noticed early was that the head did not attach firmly to the extension handle ( I do not know why the handle is removable , the whole point of this product is to reach hard to get to areas on windshields without straining ) . As a result , the head would make a loud snapping sound from time to time while in use , and would sometimes even fall off . Finally one day while using it , the plastic handle split in two and broke . The results of this product are wonderful , the windows in my car had never been cleaner , but the product is of horrible quality . There are other , more quality , options out there .	-1
While this product does make it easier to get to some of the hard to reach places of the inside of a windshield , the cloth is too thin and overall to small to effectively clean .	-1
Was expecting something a little more substantial . The tool is rather small , and difficult to hold and use with any force to break a windshield . The cutter is useful , but is basically a straight blade held in the plastic two part handle.The entire tool is about the size of a utility knife , and basically constructed like one , only out of thin plastic instead of metal.It is compact , and therefor somewhat useful in an extreme emergency , but I would n't rely on it as my first choice if a larger , sturdier version made by a competitor was handy.Spend the extra money and buy the better one if you are a corner worker or need this for other than a once in a million chance need .	-1
Razor is sharp and can cut thru the seatbelt , however after watching some videos on youtube that showed this fail to break , i decided to head out to the junkyard and find an old window that would n't be missed . Glass may eventually break if struck hard enough in the right spot but i was n't able to break the window and believe me it was n't for lack of trying.Def consider purchashing a more reputable item like the ResQ Me or a knife will a HARDENED carbide tip as this just does n't seem to do the job .	-1
Griots has numerous products for which they really ought to be lauded and recommended.As a professional Auto Detailer ( who has spent , and therefore blown , THOUSANDS of dollars testing products ) , I simply can not do withoutGriot 's Garage 11104 Interior Cleaner - 35 oz. , Griot 's Garage 11040SP Leather Care Spray - 8 oz . ; or ( and especially ! ) theirGriot 's Garage 11173SP Vinyl and Rubber Dressing - 8 oz. , which is -- hands down -- the most superior product on the market for dressing and protecting one 's interior vinyl , rubber and plastic components . ( I have purposefully linked the smallest , lowest cost product offerings for you to test for yourself ) .That being said , Griot 's Undercarriage Spray is ... well , it 's garbage , really . And `` garbage '' is not a word I use lightly as a pro detailer.1 . ) It will , in fact , re-color one 's under-carriage and wheel wells ... for about as long as it takes to drive through a hard rain and all the water left on the road from such a soaking.2 . ) It smells AWFUL of petrochemicals : DO NOT use this product in your garage or any sort of confined space : you WILL get the mother of all headaches.3 . ) Holy Moses , is this stuff EXPENSIVE for what it is and what it does : which is true of a lot of Griot 's stuff . I need not say this to most people , but just in case : buy the PRODUCT , not the hype behind it . Further , trust the reviews of those that are probable to know better.The truth is this : ANY spray tire dressing will work as well ( and likely better ) as Griot 's Under Carriage Spray for reconditioning one 's wheel wells ( which is what most people buy this product for ) .Here 's a free tip : most tire dressings are silicone-based and are therefore very heavy . When squeezing the trigger , give your wrist a fairly quick flick in the direction you are spraying to minimize running of the product.AJBest-Auto-Detail.com	-1
To the extent I used it , this wax produced results that are no better than you can get from many other products . I never did do my whole car with it because , applied according to instructions using the Griot 's random orbital machine , this wax was ridiculously difficult to remove . After some experiments with application technique , I decided there was no point in hassling with it and went back to my Meguiars . To add injury to insult , Best In Show Wax is a non-returnable product . Now I 've got most of a $ 20 bottle sitting uselessly in my basement . This may be my first 1-star review , but at such a price it 's got to be the worst value in car wax I 've ever encountered .	-1
On the plus side , this comes in nice packaging ( does n't include the sprayer ) and smells nice.Unfortunately , it is carnauba-based and does n't last at all . Think maybe one or two car washes or a month max . Of course , there are some paste/liquid carnauba waxes that only last a month , but there are some that will last several months . My point is that there are better polymer-based spray-on or quick-detailer products out there.This can not take the place of a proper wax , but it is convenient in that you can spray it on while drying your car and add a little bit of protection until you can use a proper wax.As far as spray on products , there are better products out there if time is what you 're trying to save . These include a range of products from Ultima Paint Guard Plus ( a wipe-on walk-away paint sealant ) to Finish Kare # 425 ( a spray-on/quick-detailer ) .In the end , it is OK , but then I knock off a star because it has a pretty bad tendency to streak which takes extra effort and towels to buff off .	-1
Not sure this works so great . I just tried using it to remove scads of bugs on the very low grille on the front of my Scion FR-S . I read the simple instructions multiple times just to get it right . But , I have to say that very little junk was removed - some was , but not much . I even tried a rough-surfaced pot scrubber in spots , but that did n't get much off either . I was able to clean up a few very small smudge spots here and there around the vehicle ; that was nice . Overall , I wo n't use it again .	-1
1. make sure your surface is as clean as possible.2 . clean these pads as often as possible while using them ( i use compressed air and a pad brush ) .these pads do NOT like to get dirty and they do not like to overheat . I 've had several pads literally go & # 34 ; poof & # 34 ; on my Griots DA polisher . The center just disintegrates and foam goes everywhere.I 've since switched to lake country pads and have found they are much more durable and more versatile.These are a good beginners pad , but once you figure out how the whole DA polishing thing works , upgrade to better pads .	-1
Does a good job , however , I probably will not buy aging . Smell is nauseating . Does not last too long . Did bring back the black and looked ok . Dirt stuck to well after 1 light application and let dry .	-1
At fist I thought this pad was first rate but the second time I used it the hook and loop lining separated from the pad . I 'm going to try and glue it back on but I 'm not convinced it will work.UPDATE : I used this pad a third time and noticed that the hook and loop piece had shrunk substantially on the back of the pad making the pad much smaller . As mentioned before the hook and loop separated from the pad and I tried to glue it back . It lasted for about 30 min and then I had to throw it away . In my opinion not a good investment at all . I DO NOT recommend this product . I 'm going to try Chemical Guys next .	-1
Initially I was happy with this product . It looked sturdy and looked like its made of high quality foam . I have been pretty happy with the rest of the Griots except for their machine polishes.Yesterday I decided to use this thing for my fenders using the Griots 3 inch random orbital . First 15 mins of usage the hook and loop separated and the pad flew leaving me with a marred paint due to backing plate smacking onto my fender . In comparison I had bought some Harbor Freight pads and after several uses still works great . Thanks Griots for making a 5 pad ruining my car and now its going to cost me a few thousand dollars to fix my paint .	-1
I bought this thinking it was the wash product . Was going to return it but did not . I use it but it does not seem to shine any better than a duster or clean towel .	-1
My result using this was not very good . It tends to leave light dried wax residue streaks that you can not set while drying the car and only notice later . This will promote you to wipe them off , which subsequently can leave more swirls on your car.I think you are better off not using this and just waxing your car normally a little more often .	-1
Someone else here also had the same comments : It 's noisy , very annoyingly so , and skips and bounces , leaving trails of water . A real time waster . Glad to hear it works for some , but did n't for me . Problem might be too much flexibility , too soft , and the `` T '' part of the blade itself . My comparision , Detailer 's Choice : no noise , straight blade , no water trails , a very fast blade .	-1
Sorry , if you ca n't get an original old-stock super-deep California Water blade for ~ $ 30 from someone selling old stock merchandise - just give up and go back to old-fashioned chamois or towels . The blade on this new-style ( not-so ) & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; one is way too stiff and just does NOT work that well.The current style California blades are not as good as the older ones . We have also tried numerous knock-off style silicon wipers but none or them ( either ) have the deep highly flexible blades of the old-style original California water balds.Why California Water blades changed their great original design is beyond our comprehension .	-1
I wanted to like this but all it did was squeak and bounce across the glass and the car surface , leaving the water behind . It was useless .	-1
Yes , it will work but it is really difficult to get it on the fins because it is wide and the other straighteners on the wheel interfere with your ability to get close to the edges . I 've seen some that are straight with one size per rod . A friend purchased that one and it is much more useable . I also found that the cheap plastic is so flimsy that some of the blades are not evenly spaced and this will cause it to press the fins apart unevenly.Will it work ? Yes . Is there a better choice ? Definitely .	-1
i can see how this might work good on big pitch window ac units and the like ... . but I tried to use it on a 22 pitch 5 ton 14 seer modern unit and it is basically useless ... . that tight of a pitch caused real problems with the plastic material successfully mating with the fins and the plastic got damaged right away ... . then on top of that , even when using soapy water or lube to try to ease movement it would n't effectively spread the fins ... . it might be a good product for some uses , but for tight pitch modern large systems ... it 's a waste of money	-1
I have a Check Engine light on , Code P0420 I believe on my Chevy Truck . I tried it but it did n't work . What has happened is my Converter has broken up into Pieces . So nothing you dump into the fuel is going to fix that issue ! Now my problem is that I ca n't buy a Replacement Cat for my 2003 Chevy Silverado with a 5.3L Engine that 's California Legal other then the whole Pipe and both converters from the Dealer . Even though if I was in any other state I could buy a converter for like $ 90 . So I guess I 'll just Pollute for another Year+ until either one gets Certified , or I have to fork out $ 800+.So this stuff wo n't work if your converter is broken up . Your just wasting your money .	-1
I 'm going to call as I see it and it did not work for me at all . I did not think it could really do what it claims to do and I was optimistic hoping it could make a difference but it did not help at all.I used as directed and had no check engine light on , but when I filled up after using this product my check engine light came on on the way home from the station . I was hoping it needed more time to work but it keeps coming back on - this did not help at all - $ 30 wasted	-1
Originally I was satisfied with this purchase because they were decently priced and bright , but already after a short 3 weeks ; one of the bulbs has burnt out . When I installed them I wore gloves and was still careful not to touch the bulbs as best as I could so I do n't think it was caused by an error during installation . Maybe I just received a faulty bulb , but either way I will not be ordering from this brand again and I would n't recommend this product .	-1
This truly is an absolutely abysmal product . The black brush broke within two minutes of very light usage . Before it broke , the bristles kept falling out , making my attempt at detailing redundant as I had to go back and individually remove these bristles , one by one , since they fell out and flew all over the place . On top of that , the bristles seem to be dyed black . I say this because the second they came in contact with a very light detergent , the color transferred to the surface I was working on and was difficult to clean off . Then the entire brush fell apart . See my uploaded photos . The vent tool is worthless . No dirt would stick to it . All it did was smear the dirt around . And then the white brush ... it 's too light to do anything productive with . It 's like trying to detail with someone 's pony tail . It 's just floppy and serves no real purpose.I resorted back to using the free toothbrushes I got from a hotel and q-tips . They are better made and leave a car looking better than this product . Just total garbage .	-1
Not too impressed with this set . Too pricey for what you get.Referring to the picture of this item : Brush on the left : The brush will not really clean your vents well ... unless you were trying to scrub off dried snot or a bug that manage to get in the vent , useless.Brush in the middle : nylon hairs on this brush is a bit stiff and too short , not really sure what you can dust or clean well in you car 's interior.Brush on the right : best and most useful in package as you can dust out all crevices , vents , knobs etc with this brush ... .unfortunately the hairs fell off rather easily on some light dusting.I 'd recommend buying some cheap paint brushes/ art brushes from a dollar store to do the same job	-1
I thought I 'd try these for a few dollars . The first one came apart while I used it on my first truck ! The tires were pretty big and not that smooth , but I expected a little higher quality than that . The second one lasted a couple of vehicles before it also fell apart . I ended up spending a little more money to get one that lasts . I think the glue is pretty weak and should be stronger .	-1
Used a new tire glaze with these applicators . The black color from the sponge bleed onto my hands . Shape and size of the applicators required two swipes to cover the width of the tire . Just poorly designed overall . I would not purchase these again .	-1
I 've been detailing and cleaning my vehicles for the past 15 years . So I 'm rather particular about what I use and how I clean the vehicles . Which is why I used this on a friends vehicle ( with their permission ) who does n't particularly care about how it looks . : ) First of all , you should NEVER use any product like this on a dirty vehicle without washing it first . Otherwise you are simply rubbing dirt directly into the paint and you will have swirl marks . Especially if you have a dark colored vehicle . The vehicle should idealy be washed with pressure washer to remove large/loose dirt ( or reputable touchless wash if not available ) , and then with a wash mit and bucket ( with grit guard ) using car wash soap . If it 's in the kitchen , do n't use it . Car wash soap only please.Once you have a 99 % clean vehicle , you may then proceed to use the Lucky Earth detailing kit . You can use this to clean up any spots you may have missed on the paint , wheels , or even glass if you feel like it . For this , the product got the job done . But then again , so does plain old H2O with a microfiber towel . Perhaps if you do n't have clean water available , this would work . But then again , how did you wash the vehicle in the first place ? Compared to the normal detailing products I have and currently do use such as Meguiars and Zaino ... well , there is no comparison . These products do a far better job as cleaning , adding shine , protection , and even helping cover up swirls.The tire kit provides a matte finish ( ie . not shiny ) . I 'm not really sure if added any protection since it looks and feels the same as it did after it was washed with soap and water . But it did pick up more dirt . Once again , it 's a tire . Water/Towel would do the same thing . We wo n't bother comparing this to anything else.Then you have to consider the cost . This is somewhat pricey for a detailing kit . But I suppose that 's the price you pay for earth-friendly products.Pros : * Earth-friendly . * Very nice towels* Removes water spots like you 've never seen before* Did I mention the soft microfiber towels ? Cons : * Expensive* Potentially costly and harmful washing directions* `` Non-earth friendly '' products do much better.Overall , I like trees too . But the Lucky Earth product only cleans stuff slightly better than water . And not how they claim it should . There is no way you are ditching traditional washing methods for a spray bottle on a dirty vehicle.My suggestion : If you need a detailing kit , buy well known products such as Meguiars and use them on cars only . Not trees . They are definitely car-friendly .	-1
Before using this when bathing my two Miniature Schnauzers , I read the other reviews . I was surprised to see that there were two distinct camps , the & # 34 ; Best Thing Since Sliced Bread & # 34 ; group and the & # 34 ; Worthless & # 34 ; group . I have to say that I vote with the worthless group.First off , what does one compare these two ? Towels roughly the same size would be tea towels and hand towels . O.K. , these are definitely better than tea towels . Hand towels , hard to say , I do n't use hand towels I use old bath towels and there is no comparison , bath towels win every time . Second , the pockets for one 's hands seemed like a good idea but in fact is limiting . The towel material in between the two ends does n't get used unless you are doing a shoeshine-type motion from one end to another which certainly does n't work for my dogs , or any dog with hair , for that matter . Even using them to wipe down a dog 's legs or underbelly is more difficult than with a hand towel.I did n't give them one star because they are n't completely useless and some people may find uses for them . I wo n't be using them again for my dogs nor do I recommend them .	-1
Pretty bad when use with a DA . Mine had a big tear even before I 'm done with my 1st car . According to Meguiars , they do n't recommend this pad with Meguiars DA G110v2	-1
While it stayed together , it made quick work of some paint oxidation ( when combined with meguiar 's running compound and a meguiar 's buffer ) ... but it literally fell apart before I was even half way done with the job . The buffer unit gets hot and melts the glue that holds the velcro to the pad and then the whole thing just starts to disintegrate . I would n't buy this set up again .	-1
Bought this cause of the name ... it does not smell good at all ... I used it once and have not used it again.. maybe its just my preference but I did not like it .	-1
Dont buy this worse smell ever . Now i cant stand the smell in my truck now im stuck . With it	-1
I am a huge Chemical Guys fan . I used and still use their Blacklight Wax and the jetseal 109.I also have their New Car scent ( which I am running low on ) so I decided to try this one out . First , it smells very similar to the New car scent BUT the scent does not last long at all.I literally believe the leather scent stays in the car for a couple of hours and that 's it . The new car scent does n't last long either but it lasts for at least a day , maybe two.While the scent is good , its not worth it because you have to go through so much product .	-1
I bought 2 pairs of these . 1 bulb is DOA . Too much hassle to return so I went ahead and bought another pair.For the price , eh , I ca n't really complain ...	-1
Ugly , heavy , uncomfortable and hot . There is really nothing good to say about this jacket . Save your money and order something else .	-1
Left auto windows streaking had to really wipe on it , I was surprised used other products from griot 's and they were great ! Will not buy again	-1
These are okay except the fact that they have a sewn in soft paper label . There is a tear off perforation to tear the label off , but some bit of paper still remains attached to the towel . So , this is an area you have to be careful of and avoid having it contact your paint , making the towels a bit less useful and nice.Get these instead , better and they are even edgeless : DETAIL MASTER PRO 16 '' x 16 '' Eagle Edgeless Blue Professional Microfiber Detailing Towels ( Pack of 5 )	-1
This pump is very slow ( pumps small amount per shot ) . The hoses kept coming off and I had to purchase a hose clamp to finish my transfer . This product is not for anyone who does not have a lot of time.It does pump tranny grease just fine but with a great deal of effort . My machine took three quarts and it took me more than a half hour to pump that much .	-1
I did not like this product , other users I spoke to liked it . I found it difficult to clip together even when looking in a mirror . I would rate this as a no stars , do not buy .	-1
Latch was very stiff and hard to make the connection when you ca n't see what you are doing ( under your chin ) . Got it misaligned once and could n't unlatch it . Also pinched a bruise on my neck once when my skin got caught between the parts . Removed it an replaced it with the Raider quick disconnect , which works great . Buy the Raider instead of this one . You will be happier .	-1
I will be purchasing another type of Helmet Quick Release after having this Echo Quick Release for a few weeks now.For starters I just don & # 8217 ; t like the design . The metal clip gets lodged in sideways when trying to secure the two ends of the unit together . Then it becomes a two hand and sometimes two man project to get your helmet off . The design is simply too skinny for me to blindly & # 8220 ; Thread the Needle & # 8221 ; if you will and get the clip secured.Sorry , but I do not recommend this product .	-1
The LEDs died on this item but it still charges . I will investigate the warranty and get back here . Purchased thru Amazon fulfilled by HRPWorld.com	-1
DEFECTIVE as others stated . First , the batteries fit very tightly but they fit . Second , hazardous ! ! ! Inserted batteries . Turned switch on and the fan worked - not much air but figure any air movement in a fridge works . HOWEVER , because of the comments that the batteries got hot I put the unit on a cement floor with the switch off . Returned in about 20 minutes and could not hold the batteries . So hot that the outer battery skin was blistering . Do n't know if the plastic could get hot enough to start a fire but the batteries could get hot enough to leak all over your refrigerator . HEED OTHERS ADVICE . Don not buy this item . Of course , Amazon accepted return no questions asked .	-1
First one I ordered came right out of the box with the fan torn off and rattling around in the sealed cage . I could see it was broken before I even opened the package . Bought it from Amazon , so was able to exchange it for another one . Very fast delivery , returns made simple for sure . The next one was just as the other reviews described . Very difficult to install the batteries , but with enough pressure I can install anything . I pushed so hard to get the batteries into the thing that I drove the fan support plate up underneath the fan and had to use a thin screw diver to push it back down . the fan does work though . I guess if the batteries ever die I will need to throw the thing away cause there is no chance that they are coming back out without cracking the housing .	-1
I sprayed this on a car part , without doing any prior cleaning with a disk pad , I have n't noticed anything changed .	-1
Despite the item description , not compatible with 2009 Dodge SUVs which have canbus autolights . The harness did plug right into two different brands of HID kits , but did not stop the flickering at all .	-1
the ends are too large around to fit into the storage area . which means now i have a stinky sewer hose in a garbage bag . not good . this is basic stuff - sewer storage diameter is pretty much standard in all newer rv 's ( less than 15 yrs old ) . so its its not rocket science to make sure the hose and its permanently attached fittings fit into that area .	-1
I purchased this RhinoFlex 5 ' Sewer Hose Extensinon Kit with coupler and it was nothing but a BIG Problem while on my month long trip . I never could get the couplers connected so had to hold them to the end of the hose when dumping my motor home . I ended up not even using the connector to the dump but just feeding my hose down in the hole . I had to do this as the other coupler came lose and had to hold it on the motor home outlet so my waste would n't spill all over the place . Some guy emailed me and told me it took him forty minutes to figure out how to connect the couplers but it was a peace of cake after that . ( I have had it and will not even try to do this ! ) I am thinking of returning it but I threw away the box and it is too much trouble . I do not see how they would sell such a product knowing the couplers are so hard to connect , if in fact , you can connect them .	-1
It works but the fittings wo n't fit inside my 4 & # 34 ; square bumper . The Valterra brand does fit . So there . ~Pegleg~	-1
This Rhino hose ca n't stand UV light . In direct sunlight if you leave one attached to the RV it 's come apart in just a few months . Mine came completely apart in several locations and had to many pin holes to count . The cheap hose I replaced this one with from Walmart has been out in the same light in the same location for over a year and a half and still looks like new while the Rhino was in the dumpsters in one third of that time .	-1
As long as your `` stuff '' flows down hill , this will work fine . I bought this about 4 months ago and have used it quite heavily in that time . Until this weekend it worked great , but I now see it has limitations . The sewer connection I used this weekend was actually slightly higher than the outlet of my travel trailer ( I have a very low-profile trailer ) . As a result , the hose stayed full after I emptied my tanks . The problem was that with the hose constantly full of water the trailer side fittings leaked . It was a fairly steady drip and no matter how tight I tightened the fittings , they still leaked . I am going to put this away as a back-up hose and try theValterra D04-0250 Dominator 15 ' Sewer Hose Kitnext .	-1
We 've set this up 3 times since we left on our trip April 27th . Today , the 3rd time hooking it up , the elbow completely separated from the hose . Now with about 1/2 roll of duct tape holding it on it 's still dripping . Flimsy , there are others out there worth the $ $ $ This is n't !	-1
I had to return this product because it was defective.The scanner failed to mate with my onboard computer on my 2004 Toyota Corolla.I purchased a CANOBD2 CAR READER , which was a perfect mate.I highly recommend the latter . Not that the ELMSCAN 5 COMPACT was a lesser produced product . I had to return it for the reason stated above.ElmScan 5 Compact USB OBD-II Scan Tool & OBDWiz Engine Diagnostic Software ( 423001 )	-1
The Good . the size is perfect , fits in tight spaces because they are only about1.5 & # 34 ; long , the light out put is great for softer accent lighting when bright reading light is not needed and they are at a great price . The bad , they get hot . Almost as hot as the incondecent bulbs . Not someting I would expect from an LED . The Ugly , I will not trust these to be left on unattended because they get so hot . I like to leave a light on in the RV when we are out but on these . I have other LEDs that stay cool and will leave them on . I would not buy these again because of this .	-1
The product description shows the size as 15x15x4 inches which is likely to be the size of the cordset when it is coiled but it tells me nothing as to the length of the cord when it is uncoiled - important information and as the seller is Amazon there is no one to phone or email to request the information .	-1
Well I hope Amazon Returns goes smoothly , because just after I opened the box , I found that I had received a defective unit.The problem is with the rotating lens . In the 12 oclock position , the detente is loose and sloppy . How would you like to film 3 hours of video only to find out that the picture tilted halfway through ? Other people have complained on the contour web site and contour said they will replace the cameras with loose detentes . I assume they will replace them with refurbished/repaired units , so thats why I went right to Amazon returns.A minor second problem is that the software installer uses a program called prcview.exe , which macaffee calls flags as potentially unwanted . I have installed tons of software over the years and none has triggered alerts from macafee antivirus .	-1
Update:08/15/2012Battery door ripped completely off just from normal useUpdate:07/12/2012They said they sent a clip . i never got it . I contacted them again and they resent one which i received in a day or two . After installing it all was good . Took it on vacation and my mom bumped it with the battery door off and it broke again . And more recently the battery door just fell off from the rubber pieces that held it on ... it still latches but is n't leashed.Update:2/29/2012After reinstalling firmware it records again.I contacted them for a warranty claim and they said they are sending me another battery clip . I dont abuse my camcorder and it 's frustrating i 've had this many problems with it.Another problem i noticed is in cold weather the recorder switch does n't lock into place and you dont get much battery life the later was expected.Update : 2/14/2012Camera just bricked it 's self.So there 's a metal ring that attaches the battery holder which at some point came loose and rattled around in the camera . now it does n't record or stay recording ... tried different memory cards charged it nothing ... now the 100+ bucks worth of mounts i have are worthless as is the camera it 's self ... I prefer the contours video over the Go pro but that 's about the only thing ... Low light : it 's pretty good nothing spectacular but with a small image sensor i knew this.After one light drop from about 2 feet onto carpet the battery retainer broke , luckily ( or not ) the battery is thick enough that it cant be removed with out pliers so i 'm not as worried about that.I 've had the camera about 2 months now and while trying to remove it from the suction mount ( panavise portion is good the contour part sucks ) it ripped the back door off . ( yet another overly expensive poorly constructed mount ) The mounts are overly expensive and poorly constructed . It 's not as rugged as i would have hoped either ... I dont by any means beat on it . The worst was a 2 foot drop , i would n't expect it to hold up in a crashIt looks pretty compared to a teletuby go pro but i could n't recommend getting one for more then 100 bucks if you plan on using it alot since i 've already spent a ton on mounts for a camera that 's turning into a paperweight more every day.Oh editing is a nightmare with the file format as welland their software is junk	-1
Purchased these to replace ones from Fit System , Model # 3891 , bought from Amazon in 2012 and they where far worst for viewing obstructions when backing camper into tight spaces . The ones from Fit System are far superior for use in backing campers ; you can see low tree branches , eves of buildings , carport post , etc . These mirrors look better than ones from Fit System and are easier to install the first time but they do n't begin to compare to usefulness of ones from Fit Systems.If you want mirrors that are easy to install and look good buy these ; if you want mirrors that work buy the ones from Fit System . Once you connect the ones from Fit Systems the first time they are a breeze to connect the next time.I highly recommend the ones from Fit Systems # 3891 from Amazon and half the price .	-1
I purchased the Yamaha because of the good reviews and I 'm a Yamaha fan owning a few products like my ATV . I had a Honda EU2000i that was 3 years old and I sold it with a travel trailer but now I felt I should of kept it . First thing I noticed when the Yamaha arrived was it seemed louder then the Honda but I thought I was being to critical . So later we went camping at my favorite spot in the desert and after placing the yamaha 30 feet from trailer where I would put the Honda I noticed the Yamaha was louder . With The Honda I could barely hear it when im in the trailer but the Yamaha was not as quit and I could easily hear it running . I was hoping it would be the same but because it 's louder Im not happy at all so I sold the Yamaha and now looking to get another Honda ... but dang it ... Amazon is out of stock on the Honda ... so Im of to Camping world.I would not recommend this generator if you want the most quietest one ... but if the sound is n't an issue then it 's comparable to the Honda .	-1
I consider myself for the most part half way competent mechanically & # 8211 ; ie , rehabbing houses , working on cars including automatic transmission rebuilt , brakes , replacing timing belts & # 8230 ; With that said , this triangle is pretty cool , well though out in design but really lacking in execution . The plastic where it wraps around the pivot point is just too thin and will break off & # 8211 ; guaranteed , sooner of later . Case in point is the triangle was already broken at the pivot point in the box even before I open it & # 8211 ; perhaps that was a return . The other good one , I had trouble setting it up at first as when you try to snap it together conventionally , it will break . Instead of snapping it together you need to pry it open a little , not to much or it will break too , then align the half round hole with the pin on its coaxial/concentric plane & # 8211 ; its non intuitive . I think it was designed to snap in but they got the form factor slightly off during manufacturing.Imagine during an emergency on the highway in the dark , pouring rain or in freezing storm where you mind , hands and fingers are not that coordinated , do you want to play around with this ? Murphy & # 8217 ; s law , huh ?	-1
Is that thing abrasive ? I am asking because it does not feel like it.I tried to use it on my sunglasses ... It did not do anything.I did read before that it was not meant for that use and to not attempt doing it.I did not care and tried it . It had the same effect of putting moisturizing cream on it ... It has a similar texture ... Nothing changed at all ... It did not do anything ! I would actually have preferred if it had damaged the plastic because at least it would be the proof of some effect .	-1
Nothing wrong with the bulbs , but even at their sale price ( I think it was $ 16 or so ? ) they were a poor value . Not any brighter than the set that was in there ... just the cheapo kragen brand .	-1
Forget the marketing hype of +90 % . That is just some trick of the perverse way they are measuring it . The DOT ( Department of Transportation ) tightly regulates these things to something like +/- 15 % . With that said , these are notably brighter than the stock 9003 bulbs which were 3 years old . Considering the originals were 3 years old , I would believe the output of these bulbs is increased towards the upper range of that 15 % . I also like the color temperature of the light output which is noticeably whiter than normal halogens ( but not quite true HID color ) .What is a terrible disappointment is that these bulbs dramatically alter the beam pattern . Perhaps this is the way that GE plays the numbers games to achieve `` up to 90 % brighter [ in certain areas ] '' . What I found is that the beam pattern went from a nice wide flat pattern to an almost dot pattern . Sure , the area in the bright dot is better lit , but the other areas are worse . In fact , the center dot has a poor cut-off causing extra glare ( forcing you to aim them slightly lower ) . What I see are two bright dots which converge to give you a well-lit spot which is fine for straight-ahead highway use , but for curves or side lanes , it is terrible.In sum , I like the increased light output as well as the color temperature of these bulbs , and the Daily Deal price was nice , but GE compromises the beam pattern to achieve its bogus marketing claims .	-1
I bought these knowing that no regular bulbs are going to look like HID but thought these would be a little bit closer to HID . I saw many great reviews and that these were the top of the line . I installed them in my 2007 Ford Crown Victoria patrol car and saw no difference in brightness or color . On top of that these apparently have a shorter life span than regular bulbs . Fortunately they were on sale for a great price so I do n't feel bad wasting the money .	-1
The bulbs `` were '' great , did n't have the overly blue color many of the high end bulbs do and were noticeably brighter than the bulbs they replaced . However 1 bulb died after less than 3 months ( and no I did not touch the bulbs during installation ) . So in the end I give them an `` A '' for effort but the still get an `` F '' overall .	-1
OK product , did n't fit my grips.. I guess only made for their grips .	-1
In spite of the low cost , the design of this unit 's circuitry is fairly robust -- better than some DIY designs you will find on the web.FTDI usb to serial interface IC ( FT232BL ) , and LM393 dual voltage comparator for dual K line level conversion ( only ) . ( OK ) The main drawback is that the supplied software is useless ( ancient ) , and the instructions are useless ( non-applicable to any recent versions of windows ) . It is also understood that there is no support.Initially installing the USB driver from FTDI web site seemed to work , but did not . Strongly consider using the latest drivers from windows update site , which work properly with VCDS lite and ( of course ) are signed and work well with Windows 7 ( in my base 64 bit version also ) .Also when checking connection using VCDS lite , `` options '' ( per instructions ) , make sure you do this _physically_ _connected_ to car 's OBD port , and _not_ with other serial ports ( which will falsely pass `` test '' in VCDS lite `` options '' pane ) . These are the two most common setup/install problems you may encounter.There is no support for this product or the software you might run with it , so take care to follow the directions precisely . If you do so , you will have a good chance of this working with recent versions of windows and vcds-lite ( or other free/share ware for VW/Audi OBD ) .Where my sample fell short is in proper function ; tested this with multiple computers and known-compatible cars ( that work with other OBD-II readers ) ; it did not ever establish a connection to the car . Software used included the VCDS freeware version , as well as two other open source tools.When checking the connections and soldering under microscope , I found that the OBD connector ( J1962 ) that connects to the car jack was poorly soldered . Otherwise the device appears well put together.Amazon processed a refund properly ; boost review a star given huge value and good fallback if all else fails.BTW purchased the similar , but better-built cable , from ecstuning for about 3x the total cost . Very happy with that bit of hardware .	-1
I bought this thinking it will work with my 1994 Vw golf . The CD that comes with it is useless and outdated and the cable did not serve it 's intended purpose at the end	-1

this is a nice piece of equipment and it is a must have for an RV water system but i found out very quickly that i was switching compressor hoses constantly because this wasnt the same size as my air tools , yeah you can change those nipples out but honestly , just use the valve stem style blow out and you wont have any problem .	-1
I though what a great idea , blow air into lines and clear them so they wont freeze right ? Well I wondered about the low lines or the dips throughout the coach the pex may have in hidden areas if water did n't get totally blow out and accumulate in these areas . Well this past fall I blew the lines good with air and my good air compressor to the right pressure no to over do what the lines can hold and long and a few times.Well with the super cold winter we had I got nervous after a few super cold days in Dec and figured I would pump rv antifreeze through all the lines which I have always done just in case my fears were right . Well it would not pump through all the water lines because the accumulated water left in pex lines were frozen in some areas . I warmed up coach for a few hours and used a few space heaters till lines became unfrozen . Then the water pump finally drew in the antifreeze and I had no leaks and felt good the rest of the winter knowing the lines were protected.A thought also went through my mind when I was pushing compressed air in from my compressor to my water lines thinking how clean is this air that blowing through the air lines and compressor into my fresh water drinking lines ? So the product does what its designed to do convert air to screw in part of water inlet after that I am not sure it gets all the water out . Plus just knowing the rv antifreeze is in all the lines is a safe thing to know your really covered good when you flush it in the spring and have no surprising leaks anywhere from a cracked pex line or connector somewhere	-1
I returned these due to them not working on my trailer it has side skirts on it and it was impossible to use these even turned upside down Sending back and ordering standard wheel chocks .	-1
Looks good on paper but has no effect on the movement of 33 ' travel trailer . I put down the landing gear and have normal movement when someone gets up and moves around . Got a pr of these hoping they 'd alleviate that movement . NO CHANGE WHAT-SO-EVER . These might keep you from rolling away if parked on a steep hill but so will a good set of wheel chocks and i know they 'd cost a lot less . Do n't waste your money buy the wheel chocks ...	-1
Okay , this does appear to be a smooth running machine , BUT , smooth or not , it 's no good if the pads do n't stay on over a `` 3 '' setting.I got this to restore the finish on a white 2005 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor that I bought from the local auction . I actually wrote in and asked Meguiar 's if it could be used with their 105 compound . They said yes and I ordered the machine.Unfortunately , the pads would not stay on at the higher speeds in order to cut through the scratches and there is no way it would cut 1,200 to 1,500 sand lines like they advertise it doing in many of their videos . So , I learned that issue on the trunk , and did the rest of the car with 3,000 and after several applications of 105 at the slower speeds got the car to shine and ready for the 205 polish.I did write in to Meguiar 's regarding the pad issue and they did send me a pad and a new backing plate . Unfortunately , they sent me the 5 '' -6 '' backing plate and NOT the 7 '' plate that this machine is all about , so what 's the point ? Locally , ONLY 8 '' pads are available in all the parts stores , so that 's another issue , your pads must be ordered also.I thought I did all my homework before I ordered this product and looked at videos and reviews all over the place . I guess I did n't pay enough attention because when I received the machine and reviewed specific videos on product use I noticed many of the Meguiar 's training videos show Maguire 's folks using a MAKITA ROTARY tool and a WOOL pad at high speeds ! I think that should have been a CLUE ! Anyway , in my next life I am going to at least go down to the local auto paint supply store and see what they are offering before I buy online . While 3M stuff is not so prevalent in the auto supply stores around here and I have n't seen any `` good '' DA 's with the pressure responsive motors and the speed ranges of the online stuff , I 'm sure they must have a complete set of products that local professionals are using for about the same price ... less the aggravation.I 've used Meguiar 's products since the Blue Coral era in the 70 's and between this DA thing and multiple problems with their failing spray bottles I am moving on to other vendors .	-1
This little unit is a workhorse . It 's basically a dual action grinder motor that has been adapted for use as a buffer . The problem it has is thus ... the way the pad attaches to the buffer is a cheap velcro system . The pads will not stay put ( had to stop frequently to re-center them ) . This would just be annoying , but it gets worse . After an hour of use the unit started to get hot and it conducts this heat down into the buffing pad . The velcro on the pad is held in place with glue ... so when the pad gets hot , the glue lets go and the pad disintegrates while you 're working . This is just plain poor design ... especially for a $ 150 buffer . If they could overcome this , it would be a great unit ... otherwise it 's a waste of money for anyone who is doing serious detailing work .	-1
If I pay for a `` A & E Hand Tools 4450A E-Z Grip Spark Plug Gap Gauge '' I expect to see the red gauge ... instead of a orange , cheaper grade LANG gauge , no pocket clip . Having the pleasure of owning a real `` A & E Hand Tools 4450A E-Z Grip Spark Plug Gap Gauge '' this is nowhere the same item . No where in this listing does it say or substitute , not even a email or nothing saying it would be substituted . I mean if I wanted the cheap LANG I could have stopped by SEARS for five bucks .	-1
At least I obtained Lexol 's Premium Tire Shine Spray through Amazon 's Vine program , because I would have been greatly disappointed had I paid the going price . The main issue is that Stoner , Meguiar , and Mother 's all make superior products , and all of them are readily available at auto supply stores . The spray nozzle on the Lexol product produces an awfully wide spray , which tends to lead to waste and having to clean the overspray off your wheels when used in the wide setting . On the narrow setting , there 's still a fair amount of run-off waste . The biggest problem is that this product is not nearly as shiny as its competitors , nor does it seem to last appreciably longer . If you 're in a pinch , Lexol 's Premium Tire Shine Spray is ok , but if you can find one of the three competitors listed above at a comparable price , then think twice about this product .	-1
This product has silicone which has been proven to degrade tires and dry them out . So while this product will make your tires look shiny , the tires will not last as long if you use this.The manufacturer claim that this product protects your tires is completely false .	-1
Okay , I did n't expect a lot , but I did expect it to inflate an automobile tire . Compressor would come on , but tire would totally deflate while running -- same thing with trying to inflate a bicycle tire ! I learned my final lesson with Slime . This was not my first faulty product from this manufacturer .	-1
Piece of junk . Took forever to inflate a normal car tire and broke after about 2 months . Total waste of money .	-1
I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire . Right on the tread , a few very small holes . Exactly what this product is designed for . I followed the directions to a 'T ' , the Slime & # 34 ; clotted & # 34 ; in the hole and stopped the leak , and then I drove a few miles slowly to get the stuff well distributed in the tire . I measured the pressure over a few hours and it held . The next day , however , I drove to work and when I came back to my car that evening , the tire was flat . Lost pressure faster than when I had the staple in ! It 's been extremely cold here ( Boston in February ) and we 've got a lot of snow , so my guess is that this stuff does n't work too well in those conditions.I know a lot of people seem to have good luck with this , but I figured it would be useful to temper things a bit with the perspective of somebody for whom this product did n't work at all . Most importantly , watch out when using this in very cold weather.One more thing : if you look at the reviews you 'll see that 's it 's pretty much either 5 stars ( worked for people ) or 1 star ( did n't at all ) with not much in between . It appears to work for about 3 out of 4 people , resulting in a pretty high average review ( hence the four star overall rating ) . And that 's assuming the Slime people are uncommonly honest and do n't post false positive reviews.Put another way , THERE IS AT LEAST a 25 % CHANCE THIS PRODUCT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR YOU ! A 25 % chance this will cause you far more trouble than if you 'd just had the tire patched or used a more conventional tire sealnt , and that will make you deeply regret buying this . I 'd actually say that for a product like this a 25 % chance of failure is WAY too high . So , consider the 4/5 star review in that context . 4/5 might be a good rating for a TV , but for a product that is fixing something as important to your safety as a car tire , having a 3:1 ratio of five to one star reviews actually is n't that great .	-1
This jump-starter , air compressor , inverter , is of excellent quality and usefulness . As mentioned in other reviews , it would be nice if they included an AC power cord ; and possibly a DC power/charging cord for the price . This is a fairly large unit and takes up a large amount of room in a trunk or the back of a station wagon/hatchback . It charges fast and has plenty of reserve power to start our motor home or inflate large tires . Great carry handle.UPDATE 19 May 2011 : The user manual was missing . Now I need it to check something . Item itself is pretty user friendly . Tried to download manual on website from manufacturer ( UPGI.com ) but no manuals or documents available from support . None available from Energizer . Tried Google . No one has uploaded manual yet . Finally found support 800 number for UPG Inc. which is also a wholesale/retail sales number . Nice lady answered . She took my name , email , telephone , address , etc . Said she would `` look around '' for one and send it `` somehow '' if she finds one.Apparently , this is a `` marketing arrangement '' where they buy the use of the Energizer name , then import and distribute it.Design pretty good . Sales-marketing good . Support not so good . Technical support essentially non-existant . Downgraded to two stars . Will post another update if I ever get the manual .	-1
This is a handy product i must say . An ALL-IN-ONE ! But the fact still remains that the power inverter does not last to one 's satisfaction . Infact , the power inverter can not fill air into a new tyre . That is only it 's disadvantage ; Power inverter does not last !	-1
Just got through using this applicator pad . Did not like it . Would not absorb the paste wax such that I could not go very far without having to dip back into the can again for more wax . Very wasteful of my time and my wax . My hand cramped while using it . I now realize that I prefer a thinner pad.I see nothing 'premium ' about it , and I have used lots of applicators over the years , including foam , microfiber , and even the little pad I got with my P21s Concours wax . All were better , IMO , than this one . I like Smart Wax products , but this applicator was for me at least , a dud.Of course , your experience , along with your wax , may be different .	-1
This stuff dries way too fast ... stay away unless you have a Buffer Machine - Unimpressed ! Get McGuiars its soo much better .	-1
as most locking gas caps go , it 's a pain to use the things and this cap makes it just a bit more of a pain ... about a month ago , I unlocked the thing to put gas in , since you need the key to even put the thing back on the car I poked the key back into the hole and turned it and began putting it on as usual . It kept locking , causing it to spin freely even though the key was in and turned ... and then it unlocked and stayed that way and I used it for about a week until I got another gas cap . I was afraid it was going to lock and I 'd have to pry the stupid thing off and nothing would ever work on it again ! meh , I 'll find a way to make the door lockable ...	-1
Its listed at water resistant but it is not water resistant.Its raining right now and I can see my motorcycle is covered in water . No protection . Nada.Great fit great looking cover for maybe dust and wind but not for rain.Plan to return and get something with real water resistant cover .	-1
I think this is is a dumb design . You have to put the key in and turn and turn and turn and turn . What it does is unthread on a small diameter bolt , maybe 1\4 '' ? I get the impression that I need to put some silicone on it before using it to keep it from corroding and rusting . It will probably work fine to keep the hitch in the receiver , but not convenient and I doubt these small threads would survive a good pry bar . JMHO	-1
This lock is advertised and labeled as fitting class III and IV hitch receivers . It is also recommended by Amazon to be purchased with the Allen 2 Bike Hitch Carrier . Although this lock is solidly constructed , the 5/8 '' diameter pin is too large to fit either the Allen 2 Bike Hitch Carrier or any class III hitch receiver that I 've ever seen . Amazon was gracious about allowing me to return it for a full refund . I 've replaced it with a lock with a smaller pin that actually does fit a class III hitch receiver . This large , heavy lock was apparently designed for a class IV hitch receiver , not a class III .	-1
This product does not deliver value . It is labeled as 'large ' and having a capacity of 64 liters . I had hoped this tote would live up to its advertising but it did not even come close . I am still wondering what the purpose is for the `` clear '' top panel since a ) it has a dense white grid pattern and b ) it can not be seen through . The carry handles are inconvenient and require one to use two hands as they are placed vertically at the midway point of each side . Very awkward to carry anything , let alone a full load . The frame is not sturdy and you would not be able to put anything on top of this . The non-skid base does not keep the tote in place as claimed . The final nail in the coffin is the price ; I find the $ 50 price tag almost laughable since the item falls so short of its claims . Depending upon your need I would recommend using duffel bags or those plastic molded totes with lids if you need more support . In both cases you will save yourself some hard-earned cash .	-1
I had high hopes for this product since keeping things organized in my trunk is challenging . I have a hatchback and always keep the back seats folded down . I am also not able to fully grasp the concept of `` traveling light '' so there 's always a lot of stuff knocking about.I have an organizer that I really like - it 's made by Rola ( their M.O.V.E . model which comes in various sizes and is sold by Amazon ) . It has moveable dividers , collapsible , and is perfect for keeping grocery bags and the like secure in the trunk . But , it 's low , so tall things can topple out . I had been using an old plastic bin to carry taller items , and thought the Thule bag would be much better.Well , it looks nice , but in terms of actual use , does n't offer any more value than my $ 1.99 plastic bin . The Thule bin has the capability to collapse , but it 's somewhat ackward to do - the metal rods are tough to wedge into place . It 's a two-handed operation . The Rola design is much better/easier.There 's no dividers within the bin , nor are there any pockets on the outside . It 's basically a nylon representation of a box , with a zipper on the top and handles on the side . The base is non-skid , but is not all that grippy . Stopping short caused the bin to slide quite a bit.I wish I could be more positive about this since Thule does make some good products . While this is well-built ( good zipper , nice stiching , and quality nylon material ) it needs to go back to the drawing board -- either add more value to it by adding features such as dividers , pouches , etc . or drop the price by way more than half . As it stands , if you buy this you 're paying an awful lot for something that is functionally equivalent to a plain box .	-1
This is a trapizodial box with a zipper top . There is a wire frame you must push down to get it to stand up . ( Hint : place it on a hard flat surface to get the wire sides to stay in place . ) There is a zipper across the top , handles on the sides and cynch straps on each side to tighten ____ ( ? ) ( I have no idea . ) Mine arrived incorrectly assembled . The cynch straps ran outside the handles and made the handles unusable . I looked at the picture on the box and realized the cynch straps were supposed to go inside the handles . You ca n't unthread the cynch straps , but you can unhook them from the bottom attachment and re-run them.The `` clear '' panel on top is not clear at all . Translucent maybe . No chance you can see what is inside.The `` non-skid '' base is really not very effective at all - especially because the smooth fabric from the sides wraps around the bottom edges.I really do n't understand the purpose of this . A cardbox would do the same thing . In fact , it might do it better . This has a trapizodial shape which is smaller on the bottom than the top . This greatly reduces your ability to put things in the bottom . It also only has a central zipper , so you ca n't even open the whole thing up to put in tall items.There are no internal dividers , and not even any tie down points around the outside to afix it to the floor of your trunk.Essentially , you are buying a fairly ineffective box with a THULE logo on the outside . I , for one , am not at all impressed with this product and do not recommend it . Two stars - not one - because the fabric , zipper and overall assembly are pretty high end .	-1
I thought this would be the perfect organizer of sorts for my husband 's SUV . The size and description seemed perfect . However , unless you plan on loading the organizer/tote inside of the vehicle , it is not very easy to carry or transport . The handles are awkward and the quality of construction just did not seem worth the price . I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that Amazon went overboard with non-Eco friendly packaging for mailing the item -- unnecessary ! The box could have been shipped in it 's original packaging as the item it is not breakable , and the cardboard box it was packed in at the factory was sturdy . Disappointing .	-1
My Hi-Lift with the cast base ( v. the stamped ) does n't fit very well in this . Not sure if I will end up using it .	-1
I could n't see any improvement at all . I sanded , I polished , over and over again . I got nothing . This was a total waste of money .	-1
This is the strangest offering yet by Amazon Vine.The wipers are offered in packs of 1 , and I was not aware you could not order two of the same size . I have a GMC Savana that requires two 22 '' blades . I place the Vine order for one , and then found I could not order another . Obviously , replacing one wiper blade is not going to help . What use is receiving just one ? I can buy another from Amazon for approximately $ 17 , but my Anco wiper refills cost $ 6 and work fine . We are not allowed to return or give away Vine merchandise , so what was this offer good for ?	-1
A review of this wiper blade was entered in the AutoTex 18 '' by mistake.However , the same thing applies to this offering . You can get one blade , but not two that are needed . Vine should consider this before offering items like this.To purchase a second AutoTex wiper blade via Amazon would cost 3 times as much as I spend on wiper blades , and I truly do n't believe the AutoTex blades can wipe rain off my windshields three times faster.Not a good offer for Amazon Vine	-1
I have been addicted to Meguiars Gold Class car wash for years and have never used anything else . It is fantastic and gives a nice shine afterwards as well . The water beads up and it is very easy to dry . It seems as if it is a shampoo and conditioner . I went to the auto parts store and found Meguiar 's `` Ultimate car wash '' on sale for $ 7.99 and thought I would give it a try . I was a bit disappointed . It is a strange yellow color and it is thick and I personally did not care for the smell . It cleaned very well , but it was almost as if the wax was gone after I used it . The car was not slippery anymore , it had am actual layer of water and not beads , so it was harder to dry as well , even with an absorber . I have only used it a couple of times on two different cars and I think that ... I am going to pass it up and go back to the Gold Class ! I may try it once more , but if it produces the same result I am going to toss it out in the trash . No wonder it is on sale . `` Ultimate '' ? I do n't think so .	-1
This is an update to my original review in June 2010 , which was very positive.This IS a nice product , producing copious suds that last , good at cleaning the vehicle . So , nothing new there.However , I always wondered about the claims of the wash containing carnauba and polymers . Since one normally has to buff waxes off the car , just HOW did this product leave these wax type finishes on a car ? Why would n't you have to buff this after using it ? Then it occurred to me . My black car always has a good wax finish - do I NEED to be putting something from a wash in addition to that ? When I wash a car , I hose it down , mix up the sudsy shampoo , wash all areas , squeegie off the water with a silicon blade and finish up by wiping up any remaining droplets/moisture with one of those damp , ChamWow type , high absorbancy felt towels . This worked fine , BUT , with the Meguiar 's , I always had to follow up on the glass with an additional buffing from a bath type towel . If I did n't buff the windows , even though they had been wiped clean of droplets by the ChamWow , they would be very streaked/spotted in the direct sunlight . So , although I did n't see direct streaking of the paint , I have to assume that it had the same issue as the unbuffed windows , given I was n't buffing the car paint itself.I actually had gone to buy a new bottle of the Meguiar 's . Had n't paid much attention to prices , in that I always want a good shampoo . But then I noticed that this product is twice the price of other name brand shampoos such as Black Magic and Rain-X . PLUS , this product calls for 1 oz per GALLON , whereas those others call for 1 oz per BUCKET . So , it 's actually FOUR times the price of the others.So , came back with the Black Magic , which is just a cleaning shampoo . At 1 oz per bucket ( vs. the Maquiar 's 2 ) it foamed very well , but did n't last quite as long . But , long enough to get the job done with foamy soap . I DID notice that the windows were n't streaked and car actually DOES seem to have a better shine - but have to admit , that could be wishful thinking.So , in conclusion , think this product leaves some sort of film on the car , and not a glassy one . There are plenty of options out there at 1/4 the cost , that leave NO film . If you are willing to pay four times the price , suspect you already keep your vehicle waxed , so the dubious benefit of this product containing waxes as protectants , is a waste of money as well as leaving a less that sparkling clean finish on the car .	-1
Price was attractive but very poor quality construction material . I have not use because I am afraid it collapsed under high presion .	-1
garbage product , i spraied it well until the can became empty , i have stuck brake dust just after 3 days of driving , so the commercial is ? ? ? ? ? ? ? .	-1
I like how simple this product is to apply , but noticed that on my machined , and partially painted wheels it dries visible , and requires a lot of elbow grease to rub out completely to a perfect finish . I do n't like to have to overwork any product on my car - not just out of laziness , but the more aggressively you have to rub anything in , risks scratches . I did n't even finish using this product , I just threw what was left away.NB : once it was completely worked in , it does leave the wheels beading - so it works , but there are other products out there that finish & # 34 ; right & # 34 ; first time , without the extra labor required .	-1
The reviews said that this was the best of the air pumps.I ordered it and returned the pump without actually using it.My Black and Decker did not have as good of reviews as this unit had , but I did n't like not having the option of a 120 volt plug.Since I was going to give it as a gift , I wanted to make it as easy to use as possible.The idea of not being able to plug it in to a garage outlet , since you ca n't run the vehicle in a garage , in the time to fill the tires .	-1
I looked at different similar products and decided to pay extra to buy this because I wanted something that would last . Unfortunately this did not.I used it when I first got it and it worked fine . I liked the fact the hose clips on to the inflation valve and the gauge seems accurate.I stored it on my compressor over the winter and went to use it yesterday but could n't . The pressure release button on the side had somehow fallen out of the body , leaving a gaping hole that lets all the compressed air escape . There does not seem to be any way to repair or replace that part so now the whole thing is useless and a total waste of money .	-1
Amazon sent me a previously-returned ARB inflator and , not surprisingly , its hose leaked . It was leaking from where the silver hose connected to the silver body . I returned the ARB and bought a Milton Dual Chuck Tire Inflator With Gauge which uses higher-quality materials and higher-quality construction , though the ARB has a few advantages in design.The ARB has a gauge that 's easier to read than Milton 's . The only problem is that the chuck on the ARB 's air hose does n't rotate like on the Milton , so you may need to clip the ARB 's hose onto the air connector at an angle that makes the ARB 's gauge hard to read.The Milton 's chuck is open on both sides of the tilted silver end which I 've read means you can push the Milton 's hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection . Apparently this is necessary on certain vehicles and equipment . If you do n't need that feature , then the ARB 's clip-on connector is probably more convenient . The clip itself feels a little weak and might break over time , though if it did you could hold it against the air connector.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect.The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you 're inflating but the Milton has no such feature . I do n't think it 's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that 's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway . Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you 've owned the tool for awhile .	-1
After reading the high reviews I was expecting a good inflator.Sadly it is not very good at all . The needle jumps and will often stick at the 60 psi mark . I have to tap the gauge to get it to move . The crimp is not that good and it will leak air when the hose is flexed.I may have been unlucky , or it may be a sign of quality control.I did n't need to use it for several weeks after I bought it , by which time is was too late to return.very disappointed with this .	-1
Broke quickly after first usage and when it did work for a little while the readings were off compared to two other guages I own- a Slime and a craftsman digital so it was definitely defective then it just quit reading after a month of VERY light usage . Unhappy is an understatement and hopefully these folks read these reviews and re-design this product . Quite unhappy .	-1
Yes it does the job , nice size , easily latches on , but what i find truly annoying is how long it takes to reset back to zero ! ! It takes like 10 seconds ! Is that a long time , in the grand scheme of things no . But once you get that initial figure , lets say 33.5 , and ur goal is 32 psi . It can take awhile to get down to that 32 . I bought this for my father in law ... .I have a craftsman tire gauge that zeroes almost instantly and it has a bleeder valve , that lets the air out , and can see the psi ! love it ! ! Guess I was spoiled , as this Tekton gauge annoys me . Luckily I do n't have to use it often . Do n't get me wrong , it is n't junk , but just do not like it .	-1
Greesy , messy , does n't spread evenly and attracts dirt . Using it to shine my tires until its gone because its worthless for anything else .	-1
A could not imagine that factory manufactured item can be so much off . Sizing of the socket too loose even for 7/8 '' and completely unaceptable for 22 mm.As mentioned in other reviews oversized sockets will round the nut surface since the full force will be applied to a very small area of the edges .	-1
Think fly paper when you buy this item . It is very sticky which means it attracts everything . It also sticks a little too well to a dash and gets worst when it is a hot dash . Pulling it up leaves a mark on your dash for a few days . I thought it would be a friction mat , not a highly sticky mat .	-1
The stem is somewhat loose and has a tendency to move in the base . l had wrap electical tape around that area to make it more stable . Therefore I 'm disappoint in this item .	-1
The Walex TOI-61776 Elemonate Grey Water Deodorizer and Cleaner works ok , just ok for a few days and I have to place more in the Gray Water Tank . I wish there was a product on the market that would work alittle longer . But , you have to remember what your dealing with , & # 34 ; A rolling outhouse & # 34 ; ! !	-1
After you purchase this elbow , you are able to read the fine print , and find that it contains lead . I would rather not have lead in the connection to my fresh water system on my motor home , but I have not died yet .	-1
This is a great idea , but the one I received had several pinhole leaks . Not just seepage , but small jets of water from bad casting .	-1
I returned this items because it contained lead in why in this day an age would something with lead in it still be sold ?	-1
Got one of these when I blew out a couple hoses due to high pressure . While it did reduce the pressure , it caused backflow problems that caused hammering pipes . Resolved that , and the regulator stopped working . Turns out if it sits with backpressure on it it starts to stick . I 'm on my second Camco reg and it is now starting to fail . If you use this a lot ( I live in my RV , so it gets constant use ) go for a good reg . If you only use it occasionally this is probably fine .	-1
This is a well made water regulator but it restricts the water flow to much so there is hardly any pressure in the camper . Basically , a waste of money IMHO . Get one with a pressure gauge and that allows you to regulate the actual water pressure .	-1
It just does n't fit very well . Hard to disconnect and had a faulty connection . Typical low quality stuff from you know where . Basically , you get what you paid for . I highly do n't recommend this . Terrible product .	-1
I tought I 'm buying A brand new idem but I gues I was wrong this was priviusly used and it has marks of wearing all over it , it make me sad I fall for such a scam	-1
Got this and just before I took it out of the box returned it.I do n't know what I was thinking when I ordered this . Its a couple of clamps with bolts ... .Now that I 'm looking at it and thinking about it , I just ca n't rationalize $ 50.Went down to Lowes and got 2 clamps , bolts , and wing nuts . Welded the wing nuts to the clamps and have a nice tube mount for the Jeep under $ 10.00On the rock crawler I just welded the 2 bolts directly to the roll cage ... under $ 5.00Only one star . Not because of the quality of the item . It is quality and very well made.I only gave it one star because this item should sell for half the price .	-1
The product I received was different from the photo on-line . Even different from the photo on the product box . I sent it back to be replaced , and I got the same , wrong product . I 'm sure I could have made it work , but I do n't like buying one item , and getting shipped something else , twice .	-1
The adapter does n't establish a connection with the charging system in my BMW . The Tender Jr works well when attached directly to the battery but I ca n't get this convenient cig lighter adapter to work .	-1
I bought this cigarette lighter adapter so I could plug my Deltran trickle charger into my car without having to raise the hood every time . The first time I plugged it in the light on the charger lit up and I thought all was well . Later I noticed the light was out so I checked to see if my lighter socket still worked with my GPS and other devices and it does not . I checked the fuses and it is not a fuse . It ruined the lighter socket . I have not had it fixed yet because the radio surround must be removed to get to it .	-1
I would not buy this scraper/brush to replace my gas station cheapie . The scraper is not so sturdy , and while the brush head can be rotated , it 's actually shorter than my cheapie.Also , it does not extend . Wrong item ? I thought perhaps there was another on my newsletter , and I accidentally ordered it instead of the extendable brush . But there was no other OXO snowbrush , and the item I 'm to review is an extendable brush . But mine is n't . How I struggled trying to extend the grip from the handle , until I realized the way the handle is made it could n't possibly extend ! And sure enough , that white button toward the end of the handle that you can see in the product picture is missing from my snowbrush.A mistake can be forgiven , and I 've given favorable reviews when I 've bought one item and received another - so long as form , fit , and function comply with the product description . This does not.It 's a good thing it has that nice , comfy OXO grip . I need it for the extra time it takes to brush the snow off my car , and it earned this item two stars , rather than one .	-1
The tie-down holes for the rope are in the completely wrong place -- they are mounted near the front mirrors , as opposed to being in the middle of the car . The rope they give is entirely too short , and frustrating -- by the time you reach the hole from underside the car , the hole you initially put the rope through has fell out.The worst part ? The elasticized bottom hem is n't even the whole way around , but only on the front and rear of vehicle . A true , quality car cover would have the elasticized bottom hem everywhere around the car.Definitely regret this purchase .	-1
The idea , while great , is not the greatest in execution because the manufacturer has chosen to only make the tape 3/8 inch wide . When you bend this in half to fit your door edge , it really does n't leave much to work with ... less than 2/16 inch on each side . Add to that the thickness of the door edge and there is even less . It amazes me how companies try to save a few fractions of a penny to increase their bottom line , and leave it to the consumer to fend for themselves , in this case , to install this to look nicely , while not having much to grab onto . I only did about 8 inches of my door edge , where my door would make first contact . It 's clear , so that 's good and my tape is nearly invisible . But good luck trying to tape this down your entire door frame without messing up because it 's not wide enough .	-1
It 's thinner than I had expected . Only time will tell how it would hold up to my abuse.Btw , I used solution from a tinting kit to put it on , and it worked fine . It takes A LOT of time and PATIENCE to get it to stick to the edge ( curve ) of the door sill .	-1
Without getting too technical , this is n't the 507 spec that VW/Skoda/Audi/Seat call for . The M in the name and on the label means it 's for Mercedes . I did n't see that until I ordered it . I will keep it and sell it to a Mercedes owner hopefully . It should be more easy to pick the right oil for cars via Amazon AND via the oil and car companies .	-1
I hate these glass 's , they leak air around foam padding . Do n't like the feel of them at all . I do n't know what else to write in order to leave this comment ... .	-1
I read all the reviews and figured this purchase is a `` no brainer '' - well , I was the exception to the rule , I guess . To be fair - I own a Ford Flex and was sent mats for a Ford F-150 . The mats seem like a nicely made product , but not for my vehicle . Did n't fit at all . Sent em back and paid half the price for mats that were specifically made for the vehicle .	-1
As a hitch pin , this is great . It fit my hitch just fine.If you are using it to secure your hitch for a short period of time , this will be fine.The problem comes if you are one of those people that leaves their hitch on all the time . I do this to prevent people from dinging me in the city , and , being in the city , I need to lock my hitch.The problem is that the lock will seize up with water and road grime , and it will be impossible to remove . This happened to me , and I was prepared to spent hours under my truck with a grinding wheel . As almost an aside , I started with a hack saw , and realized that the pin is very soft . I was able to cut through half the pin in a couple minutes by hand with a dull hack saw . Then , I took a hammer , whacked it one way until it bent , turned the pin around , whacked it the other way , and it broke off.So , good for me that it did n't turn into a curse fest . But ... it also made me realize that the lock will only keep honest people honest . And , now I have to buy a new pin .	-1
I used this product on a myriad of leathers around the house and found that in nearly every case the & # 34 ; Leather Honey & # 34 ; was a disappointment . I bought & # 34 ; Leather Honey & # 34 ; for the purpose of renewing an old pair of leather boots ; after following the instructions and seeing absolutely no difference , I decided to try it on a variety of other leathers with little or no results . Classic snake oil product	-1
In an attempt to keep my new leather dash from ever getting warped again , I looked into this product , given overwhelming number of positive reviews.As the name implies , Leather Honey is a thick , translucent fluid that flows with a consistency not unlike corn syrup.The instructions on the back reads : Leather Honey revitalizes stiff , weathered leatherand softens , protects , and extends the life of newleather . May darken some leather , but originalcolor usually returns over time . Use on all typesof leather except suede.DIRECTIONSNew Leather : Using a paint brush , sponge , orlint-free cloth , cover entire surface area withLeather Honey at room temperature : the warmerthe product , the easier to apply . Allow a minimumof two hours for absorption ( preferably overnight ) and wipe off excess.Used Leather : Clean surface with mild soap andwarm water . Allow to dry . Follow instructions fornew leather . If necessary , apply additional coats.Use only as directed.Not for retail unless authorized.A little goes a long way.So.. with that I left my car to warm up nicely in the sun before applying the product . My car 's interior colors were a mixture of black and light creme leather . I tested the product on a non-conspicuous leather spot behind my seat , and all was safe . It did n't change the color.My first impression was the smell . It does n't smell horrible , but it has a smokey smell to it . Very hard to describe . When applied the smell is very light and not too apparent , but out of the bottle it has a strong burnt+sour chemical smell to it . I get the impression they were trying to simulate the smell of natural treated leather . It will be entirely up to you to decide how compatible this leather is with your product . In case of my car 's interior , I did n't mind it , as I believed the smell would mix right in with that 'new car ' smell . I just would n't call it pleasant.Next up-application . As I applied the Leather Honey onto a clean microfiber cloth , to my surprise it was clear as water , but thick like syrup . Even though my car was nicely warmed up from the sun , the product laid down thickly . There was an immediate tackiness as the towel moved across the surface of the leather . I can see why people say this product is n't oily , because oil is slippery when applied.Still , I will be completely straight with you . Contrary to what other reviewers have stated , the the product IS oily . Very oily , but not in that slippery way . It leaves the leather glistening . Even as I turned the towel to wipe off the excess , the leather was glistening . That may be fine for things like shoes , but for car leather , especially dashboards , it 's not good . As instructed , I left the product on the leather to absorb overnight , and on the following day I went over everything again with a dry towel . Still my leather was left feeling oily , and still glistening . When I took the car out for a drive , the spot where my elbow normally touches the window sill was very hot to the touch . As you may or may not know , oily things heat up very quickly ( Ever microwave something oily , like a croissant ? Yes , it takes only a few seconds ) . Anyway , removing my elbow , it left a dull spot ! I took my dry towel and tried to wipe away the dull spot but it did n't go away . My elbow had pulled the oil right out of the surface of leather . So yes , this product is very oily , and a terrible choice for car leather . I also noticed that the smudges left behind on window glass when my towel rubbed up against it ( unavoidable ) , were not easily wiped away . In fact the only way to get rid of it was to use glass cleaner.Because it is oil based , this product is certainly capable of restoring dry , weathered leather . The downside is that it left my car 's leather oily . I 'm sure my leather loved it but but I did n't . And it leaves a slight tackiness to the leather that I found very unappealing to sit in.Summary : I can see how this product will rock for maintaining shoes and purses , which explains the numerous positive reviews . But it is not at all a good product on leather which your skin touches on a regular basis . Your skin gives and absorbs oil too , and when it touches something treated with leather honey , it will take away some of that oil . Leather Honey is very thick and oily . I laugh now thinking about the recommendation of using a brush in the instructions . That would have been a nightmare to reduce down to an even layer . On one hand if you do n't put enough on , it wo n't do any good for the leather . But if you do , it 's very , very oily and takes many go-overs to get things to an acceptable state . And even after that you 're left with a tacky , unclean feeling leather.I would not at all recommend this leather product for cars or jackets . Sorry , as much as I loved the name and the idea behind Leather Honey , I must warn all car lovers to steer away from this product . I would recommend using Zymol 's Leather Creme Conditioner . It smells better , goes on easy and wipes off without the issues I had with Leather honey . I ended up using it to restore my interior the way it was before I applied Leather Honey . I really hoped Leather Honey was a better product than what I was using , but it was n't -- at least not for what I bought it for.Oh yes , I did mention jacket did n't I ? Yes , I applied leather honey to my jacket at the same time . It was a mistake . It , too , was left feeling slightly tacky . It was an $ 800 Levi 's Made and Craft leather motorcycle-style jacket ( like a baby 's butt , sheepskin soft ) . Anyway I 'm sure with time the tackiness will go away and I 'm left with a healthier leather jacket . I wo n't be doing that that again.Anyway , this has been my honest review of Leather Honey . I hope it was helpful . Thanks for reading ! If you have any additional tips or suggestions for me , on the product or my review , I 'd love to hear it ! Leave me a comment . Thanks again !	-1
Leaves a sticky finish on my sofa , and does not protect against mild dew . I used Meguiar car leather cleaner and conditional , this really cleans my sofa well and does n't leave a oily surface . Meguiar reduce the mild dew problem significantly .	-1
I 'm not sure if it is a factory defect or it is supposed to be like that . When I shook the filter with my hand , I could hear a wobbling noise from the inside . The inside of the filter , I could move it back and ford with my finger . I have used Wix , Mobil 1 , Porulator , KN and none of them I could move a thing inside the filter.Can anyone confirm it is normal before I put it on my car ( this is my first RP filter ) ? I will just toss it away and forget about it if it is a defect ( never again RP filter $ 12 ) ThanksUpdate : I talked to RP customer support and this is his reply . If you have a similar problem , do NOT put this filter on your car : ) have a good dayGood Morning , This does n't sound right . Please reply with the filter part number and your location . We would like to get this filter back for inspection and would happily replace it for you.Thanks for choosing Royal Purple and have a great day !

I bought the full set of these , and in triple quanities due to TV muscle car recommendations , No wonder local auto parts stores dont carry this products , It stained my dash and speedometer plastic , leaves residue in windsheild over spray , .	-1
I ordered 6 of these and it didnt last , used them onmy new dodge ram 1500 and it was disappointing on new Goodyear tires , i went with Duplicolor Tire spray and it last soooo much , longer	-1
I ordered this for a 2008 Honda Civic.This valve will not screw into the oil pan , because the spot where the plug is located is recessed , and the valve ca n't turn in that space .	-1
I can not tell the difference between using this cleaner and using just soap and water . The scrubber brush is nice .	-1
I bought this product to use withGriot 's Garage 11044 Long Lasting Tire Dressing - 16 oz.. While the tire dressing is a fine product , this detail sponge sucks . Every time I use this my hands end up covered in the tire dressing . I have n't found a way to hold this that your hand does n't get fully greased with product.Ordinarily I 'd give such a product 1-star but they say it works for interior dressing as well- maybe it 's better at that . For tire applications spend your money on theEagle One 5010602 Tire Swipes ( 2 per poly Bag ) instead . They work great and can be cut in half to handle low profile tires .	-1
I actually have the wash pads and they are not really effective because they hold so much water that they become heavy and cumbersome to use -- especially on the side and lower parts of your vehicle.Also , they take forever to dry . One time I accidentally put them away in a container when I thought they were dry but the inside was still moist . The next day , they smelled like mold.You could toss these in the dryer but it would take forever to dry . When you leave them out to dry , they take a few days to completely dry before you can put them back in storage.As far as washing ability , I was n't impressed . They do n't lather up properly and I feel like every time I go over the paint , I am moving water around and not enough soap.My favorite car washing sponge is the Zymol sponge . You can get it for like 8 bucks on eBay . It is made from a higher quality sponge material , it is the perfect size , and it just makes car washing so much easier . Microfiber is good for a lot of things but I think a good quality sponge is best for washing . I actually like the sponge better than a sheepskin mitt ( Griot 's used to sell a superior sheepskin mitt which I have and still use . ) I will admit that these micro fiber mitt's/pads look really cool and they feel great when they are dry but once you drop them in the water , they become so heavy that you ca n't efficiently use them . You might feel otherwise but I have a feeling if you use these , you will encounter the same problems I had . IMO a good quality washing sponge/cloth should be lightweight when loaded with water and soap so that when you are washing your vehicle , you are able to produce lather . This wash mitt/pad becomes so heavy when loaded with water that it is not able to effectively do that.I do n't recommend this product to wash your car .	-1
I bought these mitts for the high reviews but I was insanely disappointed . In the first minute I knew I hated them . When I soaked them in the soap and water I pulled out what felt like a set of 10 lb dumbells . My arms were exhausted and just to give them another chance I tried them on another wash ... I threw them in the trash.. I would n't even be okay giving them to a friend because I would n't wan na put them through it .	-1
Since Griots makes you buy this separately I thought it would be a good product . Not so . This sprayer didn ` t make it through half the bottle when the seals broke . The speed shine is a great product , but the sprayer is crap . Save your money and just pour the speed shine in an empty Windex bottle like I had to do .	-1
There 's no fine mist setting on these sprayers . It goes from closed , to a sloppy spray . I apply the majority of my detailing liquids to pads or towels , and a fine spray would really cut down on wasted product . It 's a conspiracy ! : ) Yeah ... . just go to your local hardware store , buy cheap spray bottles and transfer your liquids to those . These sprayers are low quality and sadly I have like 10 of them . Right in the garbage they will go.Not recommended : (	-1
I 've bought five of these over the last 2 years for various bottles of Griot 's products I use and so far four of them have blown their internal seals and now leak fluid all over my hand as I spray . This is after maybe a dozen uses , sometimes less . If these sprayers were included with the products it would n't be so bad , but since Griot 's sells them separately , this is inexcusable . That they call them the `` finest '' sprayer just makes it worse . I 've found the sprayers I can get at my local home improvement store for half the price ( including a bottle ) are superior to this one . I 'll continue to use Griot 's other products , but for sprayers I 'll look elsewhere .	-1
If this is their `` finest '' , I am pleased that I have not experienced their worst . Although Griot 's has some good products , , , ,and some not so good , , , this one is miserable . When using this with Speed Shine , it just lays big goobers of liquid on the car which then runs off everywhere . I have tried several of those that I have , , , I once bought 3 of them , , , and they all failed . I have a friend who details cars and he said that their old sprayers were fine but that he too hates this one , , , and he is a real Griot 's bigot.Check out Chemical Guys for a really good one , , , ,however some of their product too leave much to be desired , but their sprayer is good in the very fine controllable mist that it lays down .	-1
After using this clay I just assumed clay was a pain to use . But after trying a different brand I know better . This clay falls apart while trying to use it ! It also is a very mild clay which is n't a bad thing , but if you want better results , I recommend another brand .	-1
I found this to be too soft - everythin on your hands and nails . as such , it does n't pick up everything either . I had to go over the same surface 2 to 3 times to get glossy smooth finish . Also the yellow color on the clays seems like added paint color . it started coming off of the clay when going over the surface . Not good .	-1
My experience is probably the exception since this unit has been bought by several hundred people and has a 4 star plus rating . Opened the package and lifted out . Thought I had a baby rattle . This is an electrical device . It should n't have loose pieces inside . Think electrical short and blowing up expensive electronics . I did n't even try to plug it in . I 'm not blaming the seller . This is a manufacturer quality control issue . Unit packaging arrived intact .	-1
Not as flexible as I thought it would be . Can be sanded bu if joining two edges together { simple crack as opposed to total separated parts } it was a failure . Plastic bond opened up along crack lie.Wanted to make a plastic tab joining to larger part.After having a 1 inch crack re appear on flat surface doubt this will do .Additional info : Tried to use to attach different plastics togetrher , not effective.This stuff is useless for any , repeat any , bonding of plastics . Ends up like like glazing putty no permanent adhesion and breaks off easily.I ould rate this stuff a zero star if possibe.UGH !	-1
Went on easy enough and dried to a hard material but did not work well on the type composite I was working with which was an old pellet gun stock . It does state may not bond some types of materials and I guess this was one of them .	-1
I bought this as a substitute for a lambswool mitt , but this wash mitt is too large , and it 's very heavy and clumsy when wet . There 's an inner lining that prevents spinning the mitt on your hand to expose the unused side , because this inner lining clings to your hand.Also , the microfiber & # 34 ; fingers & # 34 ; can easilty catch on car trim.I wo n't be using this again to wash my car .	-1
I bought this stuff and it did n't clean anything off my chrome rims . Worthless crap . would n't mind getting my money back for this red bottle of goop .	-1
Not good for cleaning tubs . I believe the description said it would work on tubs/bathrooms . This took a lot of elbow grease to do anything . I ended up using theDico 541-786-21/2 Nyalox Cup Brush 21/2-Inch Blue 240 Grit which worked great .	-1
This pump is not nearly as good as I was lead to believe.It leaks the car wash liquid and microfiber detergent so even after you are done , it continues to drip , making a big mess . Maybe it works better with something thicker , like a wax.I regret my purchase and would have been better off just pouring the liquids out of the container instead .	-1
Well At least Ive never heard that before but I will say it about this product . The jack was unabable to lift my car high enough for the 2 ton jacks reccomended along with this product . So unless you have a dam even driveway get a jack that can lift a little bit higher .	-1
All is good except the outlet hole is too small.It would be perfect if they made the hole bigger .	-1
If there are any areas that you miss and do not rinse before it dries , this soap leaves major water spots . And no , it 's not my water since my water measures just 40-70 PPM on the TDS scale for mineral deposits.These water spots can happen if you are soaping the car in the sun and it is allowed to dry on the car , or if you simply do not wipe down the inside of your door jams well , etc.I 've definitely had better luck with other car wash soaps .	-1
I 'm a big fan of Chemical Guys ' products , but I 'd have to say these applicators are just a waste of money and waste of time to use . The most noticeable problem with this poarticular product are the blue plastic sleeves which hold the foam applicators ( as seen in the product 's picture ) .Almost immediately upon contact with the tire/rubber surface , the foam comes out of the plastic sleeve , and does so repeatedly . I tried applications with several different pieces and it happened over and over with each of them.Color me un-impressed with this product . Do n't waste your money.They look `` nifty '' and `` fancy '' , but they are hardly that . If you want quality Chemical Guys applicators , get the green and black contoured applicators which are also in this section . They are superb.These ? I 'll just mark them down as an abherration .	-1
I am totally UNimpressed.I ride a motorcycle , and as most people who ride , use waterless car/cycle wash products all the time . I have tried many , many different varieties , and most are along the lines of this product , Griot 's Garage 11285 Spray-On Car Wash Kit . They leave much to be desired , leave bugs and road grime , and leaves a less-than shiny end result.That said , the towels are GREAT.The price is 29.99 for one bottle and three towels . This is FAR overpriced.My recommendation -- get the EZ Detailer ! It 's awesome ! It applies evenly , cleans bugs and road grime , and leaves a SHINY bike . You can see it here , but you can get it directly from their website by the case ( that 's what I do ) .EZ WAX 579221 DETAILER Waterless Cleaning Wax 4 PACKI think that if you buy them from the home site , they sometimes send free towels with the order ( cyclical special offer ) .I hope this saves you 30 bucks . LOL	-1
This kit comes with several microfiber cloths , a large jug of interior cleaner , and a pretty sizable bottle of leather care spray which was impressive , but overall , I 'm going to ere on the side of caution with this particular leather kit . It says it wo n't harm factory dyed leather , but after market leather is up for grabs . It does n't state what the ingredients are anywhere on the bottles or packaging , but it clearly has a very strong alcohol and chemical smell to the likes of hospital cleaner . The smell dissipates after about 10 minutes , but I would n't say you have a brand new leather smell afterwards . I have no doubts it will clean leather to within an inch of its lfe , but conditioning leather to a supple softness with moisturiing , not so much.I have not had the horror stories some may have had with it stripping the leather but I believe it 's possible based on the smell . If you choose to try it , definitely make sure you spot test an inconspicuous area first and make sure your area is well ventilated . I think this would work wonders if you 're dealing with a musty or mildewy smell , either way , I would recommend conditioning lotions and not the leather care spray after cleaning . I 've tried several leather cleaners and conditioners from coat and shoes accessories , to Blue Magic , to other name brands , with decent results and nothing that potent in smell . I have to believe something that smells that industrial/alcohol laden ca n't be good for your leather long term .	-1
for this price and quality and the buzz , i expected more . The wiper is really like any other out there , so nothing special about that ( especially if you treat the windows with the Rain-x yourself ) .BUT given its large length , it looses friction toward the tips . you can see that it leaves some water behind.Updated : the wiper is loosing traction and even after cleaning the blade it still does n't `` wipe '' as well as it did the first days . This is bad since i 've only used it a couple of times in the past 3 months of purchase .	-1
Once winter hit and the road salt got on the blades they began causing a LOT of smearing . I would highly recommend Rain-X Latitude but not this .	-1
These wipers are noisy and leave streaks . I could tell they were n't well made right when I took them out of the package . You get what you pay for .	-1
I thought this company was consistant with their product value . Not only did I get plastic hooks ( that I can bend with my fingertips ) .. instead of last year 's metal hooks , I found out they lowered their price 3 bucks 2 weeks after I bought this just recently.Thanks for the lesson !	-1
I purchased this and 1 other cargo net at the same time because I was a little worried of the potential that one of them might be cheap and untrustworthy . I was about to ride 1600 miles on my motorcycle and did n't want to worry about my net breaking . Thank god , because this one is terrible . You 'll notice that there are 2 different nets pictured on this product 's page ; one with thick plastic-looking hooks , and another picture with very thin metal-looking hooks . The net that arrived was the very thin one . The package read `` Bicycle Cargo Net . '' Not what I would consider heavy duty enough to use on my motorcycle ... For $ 2 more you can find cargo nets on Amazon that actually ARE heavy duty.I find myself wondering if the positive reviewers actually received the net with the thicker hooks ? My recommendation ... spend the extra couple dollars and get the better net . Here 's one : B003M694T2	-1
THIS IS NOT YELLOW .IT IS CLEAR & # 60 ; NO USE FOR EXCHANGING BRAKE FLUID IN SYSTEM.I wanted yellow or blue to see exchanged fluid .Not possible with this item.Beware you wil be unable to return this can through Amazon .	-1
I had cloudy , not yellow , headlights on an RX330 . Bought the kit hoping to get good results . Cloudiness of the lenses was partially removed to about 50 % better than it was . I followed steps closely . At the end the plastic lens had more noticeable fine scratches than before ( basically this is a fine sandpaper system ) . It seems the final coat is just an oil based gel that makes the plastic look wet and shiny but I doubt it will last more than a week . Not fully happy with the result , on a whim I got out my Novus kit ( 1,2,3 ) that I bought on Amazon for plastic on my boat and around the home . I gave the lens a good Novus 3 rubbing , then 2 , then the final polish coat Novus 1 . Honestly I think my results were much better than with the rain X kit . Less scratching and seemed more effective . I think the Novus 1,2,3 kit cost around $ 12 but I can not remember as it was a few years ago .	-1
either buy new light covers or deal with having dim lights . This should have a traveling carnival with it . Not worth it , would n't use product even if it was free !	-1
The C.A.R.B spout is difficult to use and nearly worthless . It only is leakproof , in the extended outside position . The spout is not leakproof when stored inside the can and when removed , gas drips everywhere . The V.O.C . 's or volitile organic compounds `` permeate '' through the plastic over time.I tried the camper fuel Primus and MSR bottles . But , they are awfully expensive.Now , I use the empty cans from the Fuel South TruFuel premixed 50:1 product that I use for my 2 cycle string trimmer and lawn blower.TruFuel 50Fuel Pre-Mixed 50:1 - 2 Cycle Fuel - 6 Quart CansThe cans are under $ 6 each after sales tax at either Lowes or Home Depot.They are DOT approved for transporting gasoline . They are tin lined steel , so there is no VOC permeation through their walls.They come with a `` locking '' `` child resistant '' safety cap . Remove the cap , and it pours easily into the motorcycle gas tank . No funnel or C.A.R.B . spout is needed.You do need a funnel to fill them , however.They are one quart each . Carry as many as you need.Best thing is that they are FREE and saves me having to recycle them or to put them in the trash to be placed in a landfill .	-1
Terrible quality . These towels leave behind tons of lint and immediately began to become threadbare . After only a few months and limited use most of these towels are destroyed .	-1
I bought this on the recommendation of reviews I had read on Forest River Owners Group ( FROG ) website , about protecting your campers plumbing when hooked to shore water supply . After attaching it for the first time , it reduced the pressure to such a low level that there was hardly any water coming through the faucet . I had to remove it to get a decent water flow . Perhaps the shore water pressure is already set at the correct pressure , my camper already has a water pressure reducer built in , but the valve proved useless for me . Wasted my money !	-1
It leaked right out of the box - the little hole on the top - someone suggested it was the diaphragm that was protecting our water lines . I find this hard to believe since we have been setup at the same site for several weeks prior to buying this regulator . Amazon did their part and gave me a refund . I am going to email Valterra just to see what they have to say . For the price I had high expectations .	-1
It does a good job of regulating water pressure . I gave it a 2 star rating because the pressure gage quit after about 7 months after I got it . Called Valyerra and explained the problem . They said they would send me a new gage , that was 6 months ago . So I e-mailed them , still no response .	-1
I bought this based on all of the good reviews , and I was quite disappointed when I received the product . The finish seems decent and has good heft to it , but the receiver is entirely too small and it has lots of play in the hitch . Furthermore , where the receiver gets narrow to allow for the d-ring to install , mine was completely off center and uneven . And yes , this is made in China .	-1
So , this hitch/shackle is VERY well constructed , but has a HUGE flaw . The edges of mine are n't rounded over , and it wo n't fit in my receiver ! ! I have a standard hitch receiver , I think made by Reese , which has a rounded-edge square opening , NOT perfectly square . I guess they tried to save costs by just using square bar stock . What a PITA .	-1
Unlike other reviewers I would have to say I have been very disappointed with this product . I have purchased two of them , and one seemed to be okay . The second was more than 5-10 psi off accurate measure . I checked it against the first unit and a completely different manufacturer 's measure . Even the rather crude gauge on my air tank measured more accurately than this gauge . At this price the gauge should be very accurate and reliable . Not the case for me .	-1
I USED 3 CANS OF THIS LOW GRADE JUNK CLEARCOAT AFTER APPLYING THE BASECOAT . IT WAS LIKE GLASS WHEN APPLYING AND FINISHED..2 HRS LATER IT WAS LIKE A SATIN FINISH LOOK..A DULL SHINE..CALLED DUPLICOLOR FOR A REFUND..STILL WAITING..THEY BLOW ! !	-1
i used this product on a fender of a 2004 i knew it would not be a perfect match but thought it would be closer . i probably would have been almost as close looking at the colors of caps on the spray paint in walmart ! this product would be better for use in a less visible i touched up a small area under the door and that is n't bad .	-1
Installed to the parking lights and fender lights . Directions did n't match my vehicle . Seems like the directions were for an older model jeep wrangler . I managed to get the parking light covers on but not the fender signal covers . Need to update your information rugged ridge .	-1
I got these today..and tried to put on car ... Well guess what ... The holes at the attachment points are way too small ... Big surprise . I would guess all these would be a standard size ... So Beware folks , , , this makes them useless for me ...	-1
It is hard to apply films your self . Might be better to let the professional do it . I gave up after while	-1
I was able to program the two remotes I got and went through the process several times . Some of the times the remotes did n't transmit . Once programmed , they take several tries right next to my truck to get them to work . They wo n't work from ten feet away like my factory remote does . Putting in a fresh battery did n't help.While they may work for others , they 're useless for my 2009 F150 . Buy at your own risk .	-1
The moment I took these out of the package and felt how abrasive they were I suspected that they would scratch alloy/clear coated wheels . So , instead of first trying them on my $ 3K , presently installed Lexani 's I tried them on one of my winter-wheel Beyerns . The wheel is clean alright , but Lo and behold , that wheel now has hundreds of micro-fine scratches all over it . The material is just way too abrasive for alloy/clear coated wheels , it literally feels like the scrub brush we use to clean the shower.Anyway , they 're great for cleaning calipers so I 'll use them for that .	-1
My wheels have large openings between the spokes , so I guess I did n't think out my purchase properly when buying this.If you have smaller openings it may suit you , but for me it just does n't cover enough & # 34 ; real estate & # 34 ; for the work I have to do when I use it .	-1
You get what you pay for , and the price on these should be 0 ! Crack from the sun and discolor almost immediately ! Bought a new set by Adco , and the difference is night and day . The Adco products are a bit more money , but worth every penny !	-1
The company deleted my review so I am reposting it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Packaging was cheap and the whole led 's feel cheep and flimsy . 2 out of the 8 didnt even work ( yes i know only one side is positive and i did flip them around ) . Very cheap product ! ! I would honestly only expect to pay about $ 5 for it .	-1
The product came in DOA . flipped the bulb and still did not work after trying many times . I believe it is a contact problem . the plastic fitting was too small in order to make a proper metal to metal contact . For T10 bulbs , I would recommend JTech , where I did not have any problems with their similar LED bulbs . Having said that , dome light bulbs worked fine .	-1
These work well but mine are very BLUE , not white . They look kinda of white in the day light but very blue at night.UPDATE : These started to flicker after about two months of use . JUNK .	-1
Ok so since Ive purchased I had a couple get really hot on me and begin to smell of burning plastic and # 2 which is also important is there not Very Bright . There Yes High Powered but with a cheaper SMD . What a shame , well lesson learned and superbrightleds is the way to go except there alittle pricey but the SMD are Very Bright and wo n't burn .	-1
Upon all the Led light bulbs i 've been buying , this proves to be the most reliable . It has a very strong light penetration and lasts long . Though it breaks easily if not handled properly . Two of mine got broken while trying to insert them in their positions	-1
I 've had a lot of luck with LED auto bulbs off Amazon , these were the exception . I put these in my Ford Ranger and only 1 out of the 4 worked . Had to return for a refund .	-1
Very poorly made , I 'm going to give them 2 days before i request a refund . We 'll wait and see if they last . They were installed in my license plate and barely got them to work . Had to play around with the socket for them to fit . I'm100 % sure if I hit a bump they 'll come loose and turn off .	-1
I found these lights to be not quite as bright as regular 194s whereas there are plenty of 194 LED replacement lights that ARE just as bright . Also , I bought 12 of these ( 3 packs of 4 ) and three of them did not work . 25 % DoA rate is a little too high for my liking . No , I did not contact the company to get my few dollars back ...	-1
If your RV weighs over 250 pounds , these will warp and give way under the weight . I have a lighter fifth wheel and these do n't do anything but buckle under the weight of the trailer and sink right into whatever ground they are on . Even on cement pads , they stink . I went back to using pre-cut hardwood planks and boards and am glad I did . Do n't waste your money on these pieces of junk . Even the storage bag they come in is cheap , flimsy , and tore after one use .	-1
I was really hoping that these would put out some good light , but I found them to provide less light than the originals .	-1
I do not own these , and never will for good reason.Any bulb with a blue tint to it will have significantly lower light output . It 's best just to use regular , clear ones rather than these with a blue tint to the glass .	-1
First of all , there is a slight difference in light output , whiter than normal . But to get that whiter look your gon na have to go to the 5000K diamond vision range which turn out to be illegal here in Australia ( best to check on your local laws ) the beam output length is the same as OEM , and this becomes shorter as you go whiter in light . These lights are pretty much for looks , although whiter light has more clarity , you sacrifice beam length for whiter light intensity . HID however are the opposite.It is true what people have said about the life of these bulbs . THEY HAVE NONE ! Think of your normal OEM bulb , then reduce the life of that bulb by 75 % , that is pretty much all you can expect out of these . Do n't be surprised if they blow after going over bumps in the road . I 've been experimenting with a few bulbs out there , Although Phillips do make very good long life bulbs in the 3300k light offering 120 % longer beam , these whiter bulbs ( 4000k - 6000K ) just do n't last and will end up costing you a fortune in replacements.Osram Bulbs are much more durable from what I have found . still on my first set of OSRAM Nightbreaker Unlimited , Have lasted me 8 months and they do have a 20 % whiter light rating.Lets get serious . If you really crave that white light for your car , research HID xenon kits . I know the white light is cool , but be sensible and kind to your back pocket unless you have cash to burn .	-1
I was extremely careful with installing these bulbs , but upon testing out the bulbs I found out that one of bulb might have been damaged . Upon removing the bulb , I had found out that bulb was coated with weird material . I have installed and removed a large number of bulbs so I do not think it 's related to installation issue.Now , I am stuck with one usable bulb out of two .	-1
These are not HID like , they are not even ID without the HThey are not whiter , not brighter and not even better than stock.DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THESEThe other ratings you read here must have been paid for .Move on and do n't buy these .I just save you 30+ bucks .	-1
... .which is true if I was changing the fog lights . While ordering the high beams the configuration guide suggested these as low beam . Not very good symmetry when obvious I was replacing high beam headlights not my fog lights . Seem well made and great packaging and Amazon was great about taking back .	-1
Do n't waste your money on these bulbs . I installed them in my Grand Prix and saw no improvement , just a dent in my wallet . Do n't fall into the hype like I did .	-1
I was looking forward to brighter vision , especially on some 2-lane blacktop highways that I travel . Really disappointed with these bulbs as they do n't seem any better than the original lights in my '98 Ford F150 . In order to get better vision , I finally installed halogen driving/fog lights , and that solved the problem . I do not recommend these bulbs , not worth the extra money .	-1
My last set of bulbs from Sylvania were brighter than these and lasted 5 months longer . The four month life span i got out of these did dissapoint .	-1
I 'm trying them one more time then THAT 'S IT . We bought these last July now 13 months later one burnt out ? They put out great light at night but having a life of only a year is pathetic , maybe I got a bad one ? because only one burnt out and no it was not from touching the bulb ( when I install ANY auto light I do it with a fresh pair of clean gloves on my hands to prevent skin oil transfer ) I will try them one more time and then move on to a different bulb if they burn out in such a short time again .	-1
These are a great deal to replace stock bulbs , but if you are expecting whiter light do n't bother with these . I installed the Philip bulb in one side to compare with the stock , no difference what so ever . Trust me these are not any whiter color than stock .	-1
Eh . I have a 2005 Acura RSX and these lights look identical to the stock headlights in the car . Would n't recommend these as they do n't seem brighter or anything of the sort . Waste of money in my opinion .	-1
I know these are tricolor , so depending on what angle you are at in front of them , they yellow is too dominant . I have very white LED fog lights and they make these headlights look like yellow fogs . They are bright enough to light up the road , but next time I 'll get a whiter bulb .	-1
I purchased this for my 2003 Silverado 1500 . As recommended , I also purchased the updated thermostat housing , as GM updated it for 04-05 models . Everything went perfect with the installation , until I put the thermostat on . I had the torque wrench set to 15 lbs ( as required ) and the first bolt 's head broke off before even getting to the TQ . spec . I then had to remove the part , go to a local part store and pickup a non-GM part . Sad . When I installed the waterpump this time , I reused the factory bolts . Everything is fine now.Sad that I went threw the effort to by the GM Canadian part ( as opposed to Chinese ) , only to find that they included some cheap bolts made of tin .	-1
