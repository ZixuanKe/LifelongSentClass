These are perfect sized binders for storing an assortment of papers I use for my research . They claim that they hold 200 sheets , but when I put a little less than 200 in one , the binder popped open when I shut it . When you go to load the notebook , simply divide the sheets up and put them on either side of the rings . The sheets aren & # 8217 ; t crammed in there , but are snug.FEATURES : & # 9658 ; Customizable cover and spine simplify binder labeling and personalization & # 9658 ; 1 inch round ring binder holds 200 sheets & # 9658 ; Features our strongest binder covers and extra durable hinge for years of reliable use ; Custom formulated , PVC Free polypro material lasts up to 10x longer than vinyl & # 9658 ; Never-gap rings close tightly to keep papers secure & # 9658 ; Two interior pockets provide additional storageThis is a great size for a notebook and I & # 8217 ; ve already filled up the ones I have . Many of my materials have remained loose and were simply held together with large rubber bands or in large envelopes . These would be perfect for setting up lesson plans , schoolwork , or any odd assorted project anyone has around the house.The pockets on the front , back and spine are perfect to & # 8216 ; customize & # 8217 ; your notebooks . I & # 8217 ; m taking the front identifying sheet of my material and putting it in the front pocket so I can easily see what & # 8217 ; s inside the notebook . I really like these notebooks , and frankly , by the time I headed out to the big box store to purchase them , I & # 8217 ; d be spending a lot more money . A little bit pricey , but you do get what you pay for ... a good , high quality notebook that will last .	1
I bought this to keep my meetings organized . It has really held up so far and I love the purple color .	1
I 've got the 1 1/2 inch version of this binder , and it seems to be slightly better than this one . This has two inner pockets , and the larger version has four , so that 's a point out of the favor of this binder . Also , for some reason , the cover of this binder wo n't lay flush like it 's supposed to ( the other one was fine , though ) . This is n't a deal breaker , but it 's slightly annoying.Also , for a heavy duty item , it does n't really feel all that `` heavy duty '' . In fact , it feels about the same as any other binder you could get . That being said , it 's as good as any other binder you could get , so you ca n't really go wrong with this one.Update : Well , after putting it to the test for school ( I had to put a large loose-leaf textbook into it ) , I 've found that the rings do n't want to stay closed . So , yeah , shatter any perceptions that you had that the rings on this `` Heavy Duty '' binder were any better than any others .	1
This Wilson Jones Heavy Duty View Binder seems pretty durable . I 've only had it a month , so I will report back if it breaks . It seems well made , has the view pockets and packets inside . It 's your basic binder . My only issue was when I was carrying it , the front kept flap kept popping open like there is too much room between the ring and front cover . I did not have very much in it , so as it fills , maybe it will become more stable . I would probably buy this again , if it continues to withstand wear and tear .	1
I 've purchased several types of binders over the last 30 years for important reasons . The Wilson Jones Heavy Duty Binder is one of the best in quality I have ever selected . The construction is strong with a durable hinge , coated in a protective plastic with useful pockets . I 'm always searching for binders for home and office needs . This binder can hold a great deal of material , and will last for a long time . The rings are easy to open-and-close , and notes can be stored in the inner pockets . In addition , the front-and-back has a protective see-through slip-in for labels and additional notes . I 've learned in the past , such good quality will last much longer as it serves the purpose . Highly recommended for home , or office !	1
I use binder to organize my house , business , homeschool , photos and just about anything else I have to keep track of . I need to be able to see the binder on the shelf and not have stuff hidden away in a cabinet.So I use a lot of binders . And I use the binders a lot.This one stands up to daily use and even misuse . The hinge lasts and lasts . If you need to make information accessible long term- this is the best binder for the money .	1
The manufacturer markets this item as a heavy duty binder . But I do n't seem to feel the & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; part . If feels about the same as other binders I got from local Staple store , except the binder seems to have a little heavier card stock in its covers.It 's great that it has clear view covers on the front , the spine and the back also . I can slide in title pages for easy referencing . I notice the jaws of the binder close up neatly without gap . So , I do n't expect loose pages got caught in between.All in all , it 's a qualify binder . Only time can tell if it is heavy duty then .	1
At NNSY , I review , edit and issue administrative directives . For a couple of years , I 've been storing published directives inside Wilson Jones 2 '' Binders that were ordered directly from the company . These binders endure frequent handling better than other brands I 've used because of their knitted , reinforced spines . These spines have a tendency not to crack and split with time and frequent usage . Many of the Wilson Jones Binder 's features ( e.g. , two plastic pockets , never-gap rings and PVC-free covers that can be custom designed using templates from the manufacturer 's website ) are similar to those of other brands . Wilson Jones is more expensive but they are worth it if you desire long-term protection for your valuable paperwork.I was excited to receive the Wilson Jones 1 '' Binder ( Model W63-14-267 ) from the Amazon Vine Program . I immediately began using it to store my Wilson Jones Snapper Folders , [ Wilson Jones Snapper Folder , 8.5 x 11.5 Inches , Assorted Colors ( A7040023 ) ] . These folders contain my user manuals for electronics , cell phone accessories , home and kitchen appliances , and battery-operated toys . The folders have three perforated holes and fit perfectly inside the three-ring binder . Each color of folder represents a different item . For example , all my user manuals for home and kitchen appliances are kept in the red folder . Using the website for Wilson Jones , I easily customized the binder without needing to register ; I do n't have to worry about the company harassing me with e-mails.Joseph B. Hoyos	1
This Heavy Duty Binder is strong and durable , probably much more than needed for a 1 & # 34 ; binder . The rings have an interesting design with a small protusion on one side that feeds into a hold on the other side . This means that even with a little separation , there is no actual gap for paper to come loose . The hinges seem durable as promised and the rings open and close nicely.There are two interior pockets with very little room ( depth ) , but they will probably stretch out enough for a stack of 10-15 pages . The outside also has an opening at the top so you can have a cover ( or spine or back ) inserted that lets you distinguish this otherwise entirely white binder .	1
I usually use white or black binders and find the purple of theWilson Jones Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge , 1-Inch , Purple ( W363-14-267 ) to be attractive , impressive and be easier to notice . The quality of the binder is average and in my experience , it 's not any better than others I 've used throughout the years . It 's actually lighter weight than I was expecting and there is a bit of puckering in the back grommet area . The binder lines up well and otherwise appears to be well made but I think it 's quite expensive for a single binder . Nevertheless , the color ups it a star in my review and I 'm glad to have it for my needed purpose .	1
This is Wilson Jones Heavy Duty ring binder.It 's a very nice purple color with outer sleeves both in the front and back , and 2 pockets inside . It has a 1 year guarantee and billed as lasting 10x longer than vinyl . The hinges opens and closes with a crisp snap . Time will tell how long this will last and I will update this page if it does n't last a year , but for now , it 's a very nice binder at a nice price .	1
I 'm not sure what I would consider `` Heavy Duty '' about this folder ; it seems like any other folder I 've ever had , except that instead of a straight-line hinge at the fold of the covers , it has a wider hinge with a diagonal fish-bone pattern branded down the length of it . I have had other folders come apart at the hinge , so I can see where Wilson Jones is going with this . Only time will tell its durability , but so far , so good.The rings are located on the back page , as opposed to the spine . I like this , as papers do not get bent from the folder closing . The rings have a pin on one face that mates with a hole on the other face to keep pages from finding their ways through a gap.This two-pocket binder , with its custom cover sleeves does seem a bit costly for what it is , but it is a decent quality product . If shopping for more , I would probably opt for this binder if it was on sale . I recommend this for someone who commonly encounters torn hinges on their binders .	1
This is a nice binder , with the rings attached to the back flap , not the spine . The covers have the ability to put a sheet inside and there are inside pockets . The hinge seems strong and unlikely to tear . The rings themselves close nicely .	1
The jaws of this binder meet up neatly and , I think , wo n't have pages getting loose and caught in them . It 's relatively easy to open and close the rings , although it could be easier . The joints do seems strong , and the performance guarantee implies that they 'll do their job . I 'm glad the plastic is PVC-free . There 's a recycling symbol on the paper stuck in the front cover ; I 'm not sure if that means we 're encouraged to recycle the paper , or if it means the binder is made of recycled materials , or what . I 'm betting on the former , but would really be pleased if it were the latter . The binder seems like a product that will continue to do its job for some time .	1
It 's a little difficult to get too worked up about reviewing a binder , but I had a specific use in mind that I thought might help others . I have a humongous collection of piano sheet music ( I 've been a piano teacher for 32 years ) in books with broken bindings as well as a LOT of music that I 've downloaded . I was a looking for a good way to both store and use this music and plan to use binders along with plastic sheet protectors . This binder is perfect for that use in several ways . First , it lays flat , so it will stay open on the piano and allow easy page turns . The other thing is that it has sleeves on front , back , and the binding where you can insert your own covers and labeling where they will be permanent . There are also two pockets on the inside of the binder for miscellaneous notes , etc . I 've used a lot of view binders with my students over the years , and the covers invariably split at the side and eventually fell apart . On this one , the sides are reinforced , so I do n't think that will happen . These binders come in a wide array of colors , I 'll undoubtedly be ordering quite a few more for my sheet music project .	1
I started using the three ring binder 's again when I discovered stacks of the suitable paper in my garage.I have several of them and this is the newest , it 's well built and will be a welcome addition to my office uses.The front and rear of the binder is plastic covered with slots to insert whatever I want to display on the outsides and the inside hasa good plastic rim for me to insert what ever I need to have with me.This is a great thing to have in my office that I can take with me on the go .	1
Over the years I 've made use of countless three-ring binders , and never really gave it much thought - when one worked . Really the only time I would think anyone would give one any attention is when you had to use a bad one . Luckily , this Wilson Jones binder is one of the good ones.Back when I was teaching , I usually had the students in my classes keep a classroom notebook using a 1-inch binder . So over the years I 've seen a lot of them . One of the things that I noticed during that time , is when a binder fails it is going to be for one of two reasons . Either one of the cover hinges is going to break , or the prongs that hold the paper in the binder are going to develop a gap and let the paper slip out . This new design that Wilson Jones had developed seems to address both of those issues . The hinges for the covers are wider than the standard ones , and they have a pattern of welds running the length of the hinge . The effect reminds me of a continuous piano hinge . I 've only used the one binder I was given for about a month now - so I really ca n't say that it 's holding up better than one of the standard design . But I imagine it will . They have also used an interesting design for the point where the two prongs come together to keep the paper in the binder - one prong end has a peg and the other prong has a hole that the peg fits into . When closed the rings feel really solid . Just do n't get a finger in the way when you go to snap the rings closed.I also like how the bar for the rings has been attached to the back cover and not to the spine of the notebook . I think that makes the pages work better when using the notebook and when you go to store it on a shelf . The side pockets on the inside of each cover are handy.If I have any complaint for this binder it might be that the plastic transparent cover feels a bit light-weight for something that is being sold as 'Heavy-Duty ' . I do n't see any issues if the binder is being used in an office situation , but if I were to give a student one of these , that cover would probably be stretched out in no time.I could see myself buying and using these .	1
The binders I have have been using have the ring bracket in the narrow center segment . This one has the rings on the back portion . I 've had trouble in the past with pages catching on one side or the other or where the ring joins . This binder eliminates both of those problems . I like being able to keep my materials flat all the time- definitely when I am making a presentation . I especially like the perfect match of the rings . This is the way a binder should work . In addition it is easy to open and close them which is a problem with many other manufacturers.There is always something at a meeting or seminar that is a handout that I want to take with me . The interior pockets are perfect for doing just that . If I want to provide a title page or photo/art I can slip it into the front clear pocket .	1
What can one say about a binder that is n't obvious ? Well , maybe not much , but this item was just what I needed and served the purpose for which I obtained it . I use a lot of binders for various tasks and projects , and this one fit the bill for a recent house renovation . The clasps are sturdy and held everything I put into it . I like the one-inch size of this , it does n't allow for a huge amount of information to be stored , which is fine with me . Anything that wo n't fit into a one-inch binder should probably be put into a second binder , as I have arthritis in my right hand and ca n't hold heavy books in it . Overall , I can recommend this binder to anyone needing this item in this size .	1
This Wilson Jones round ring binder has sleeves on the front , back , and spine plus pockets inside the covers . The purple color is nice and the edges are soft and do n't slice through skin . The ring binders snap shut precisely and are mounted to the back rather than to the spine , which means the binder lays flat and is easy to use.The only thing I would quibble with is that I would consider this a medium-duty binder at best : the plastic is not particularly heavy , the covers are fairly flexible , and the metal binding mechanism is not particularly sturdy . Still a decent binder for most uses .	1
When I selected this binder I did so because I was in one those moods ( that don & # 8217 ; t last long ) to organize some of the paper receipts that I still keep even though I have one of those & # 34 ; neat & # 34 ; scanners that is supposed to simplify your paper life & # 8230 ; right . All it really means is now I have to control for the hard copies and maintain larger capacity external hard drives . Doesn & # 8217 ; t have anything to do with this binder really , however & # 8230 ; When it arrived , the urge to organize had subsided but I was intrigued by the cover copy showing a pudgy handed person tugging on the seams of the binder seemingly in confirmation of the strongest cover hype . So since I didn & # 8217 ; t actually buy this sucker , I figured what the *** let & # 8217 ; s give it a shot . In fact , let & # 8217 ; s give it a few shots : I tugged on it-impressive.I bent it out of shape- outstanding.I sat on it & # 8211 ; So what , I have a few dimples myself.I stood on it & # 8211 ; Uh , oh . For the record , anyone wishing to repeat this field test , you might want to fill it up with sheets of paper first & # 8230 ; It & # 8217 ; s a good sturdy binder . If you want to be boring and use it for its & # 8217 ; intended purpose , bursting the seams will be the least of your concerns .	1
There are several things I like about this product.1 ) The color ( and the other color choices offered ) a great ! A good variety , really bright and bold.2 ) The `` extra durable hinge '' - it 's too early to say for sure how long it will last , but so far so good . When you look at the hinge ( connecting the spine to the front and back ) it looks almost woven . Very cool . It seems like it will help the binder hold up to frequent openings and closings.3 ) There are pockets in the inside-front as well as a see-through layer above the cover , so you have space for storing papers in a variety of ways.Overall I think it 's pretty much a solid choice for your average school binder .	1
When you 're looking for a sturdy binder to put some documents or other loose papers , this is a nice storage spot to organize them . I felt that once in the binder , they were safe to stay in one spot.It 's not a flimsy binder so is perfect for longer use . Just try not to stack it too full so it can open and close easily .	1
The Wilson Jones Heavy Duty notebook is a simple ring binder style notebook . The notebook 's interior has two slip-in pockets where you can store loose papers . The interior ring binder has three metal claps which is fairly standard for this type of product.The notebook seems sturdy and would be handy for filing away reports or perhaps recipes , if you like to collect and save recipes as a hobby.Recommend.MR	1
As I 've added to my pile of writing projects , binders have been constant companions . Like other companions , some are flaky , while others stick around when things get rough . This binder by Wilson Jones is one of those . The hinge is very durable and will probably one tear if the plastic becomes brittle over the years . I also like the windows , which make it easy to label . The other critical component is the ring system for holding paper in place , and this one is pretty good . It uses a good round tongue-and-groove strategy that should prevent snags , but nothing fancy like the binders with a big confident lever for operation.Overall , a fairly standard binder , but strong enough for heavy use .	1
This is really quite a nice binder . The color is great and the plastic seems really sturdy . The rings are not on the spine , but on the back cover , which I always prefer , but are round , not d-ring which is typical in that construction . It is worth noting that the push tabs that open the rings are classic style , not plastic coated or single handed as many current binders . It does take both hands to open the rings using the traditional small , metal tabs . This is not a big deal to me , but might be an issue for some people into these newer bells and whistles .	1
When my Wilson Jones binder arrived , it had a gash in the clear plastic cover . I called the company and they had me fax over my personal information along with a copy of the invoice . Within a few days , a new one arrived on my doorstep.Although the binder has a 1 year warranty , the plastic cover feels cheap . The pockets are made from the same plastic as the clear cover , which I do n't care for . The rings line up well and are easy to open and close . The binder itself does n't feel as high quality as a heavy duty binder I own made by Avery , but they do honor their warranty with little hassle .	1
The construction of the metal clips and the device itself looks pretty sturdy and polished . The tips have male and female parts which is precise preventing some paper getting caught in between . The flaps and cover look nothing special although it promises to be 10 times stronger than regular binders . I guess only time will tell .	1
I 've had one main binder for a while now that held all my coupons . However I decided that I would make a separate binder for just my food and coupons.This heavy duty binder is perfect and fits my 20 plus pages of coupons no problem . I 'm quite sure that if you were looking at just a main binder this would hold an average couponers entire & # 34 ; collection & # 34 ; .It seems like this beauty will stand up to the years of abuse I intend to give it . Recommended !	1
Love that this is my favorite color ! ! ! This heavy duty binder has a durable hinge . It has double pockets to hold papers , but not too many papers . This binder I will use to try to organize lots of papers I have . This size is good for me in this type of binder .	1
I 've been needing a new three-ring binder and was delighted to see this offered for review in the VINES Program ! It just arrived yesterday and I 've already put it to good use . It is EXACTLY what I needed ! Having it come in my favorite color of purple is a bonus ! ! ! ! Thanks !	1
Wilson Jones has always been one of my favorite brands of binders because I 've consistently found them to be reliable . This one is no exception . It does the job it says it does , with no gapping or any of the other unpleasantries that sometimes come with cheaper binders.What more can you say about a binder , except that it does the job and does it well ? !	1
Wilson Jones provides the necessary features that a person is looking for in a three-ring binder at an affordable price . The item is gate-folded and contains two pockets . Beyond holding and organizing papers in place , three things come to mind when trying to figure out what type of binder should one purchase , one 's favorite color , how strong will the binder hold the materials , and how long will it last . The answers , ten different colors , made with POLYPRO material , tear resistant ( can anyone remember binders made with the underlying cardboard material ? ) cover and durable hinges , and lasts ten times longer than the average binder . This binder contains all of the above and to top that off , it is environmentally friendly and the three-rings are snag-free.Indeed , this is a great binder that keeps papers and other materials in one place .	1
and color ! Most of my other binders-and I have too many to count-are all black . So I decided to use this one for all of my home receipts , bills , etc ... Very strong and firm.Would recommend to anyone !	1
I like my office products to be interesting and not boring . I have a home office now , but even back in the corporate days I wanted & # 34 ; pretty & # 34 ; colors rather than the usual white/black/navy options.This ring binder proves that good quality ring binders do n't need to be boring . I really like the purple color and it is much stronger and better quality than if you looked for a purple ring binders at back-to-school sales . The only possible criticism is that this particular binder does not have the spine and cover pockets that you can fill with title or cover sheets . For me that 's OK because I can make a sticky label for the spine and do n't need a cover sheet.I do note that the Amazon price on the date of this review is considerably higher than what is being charged on other sites so it may pay to comparison shop .	1
I 've got a ton of three ring binders around my house ( I use them for everything from storing receipts , to planning , and recipes ) . I 've liked this binder . It feels pretty durable to me and I have n't had any issues with it opening or closing securely . I like that it has the see through sleeve on the front/back/spine . It makes it convenient to slip in a label or printed cover so that I can easily identify it on the shelf . It gets the job done . : - )	1
This is a nice binder . I like the color and it works fine but it does not look like a heavy duty binder to me but it is made of polypropylene.The binder has two inner pockets . It has a see through plastic cover on the front and back so you put a paper inside the plastic and label the binder.The rings work fine . I can easily put paper in and remove it from the binder.The cover and description says this has polypropylene . I looked up polypropylene up on the web and it is a thermoplastic polymer that one site described as rugged.This does not look like a heavy duty binder because of its size and look but I have not tried to tear it or test it out . The information on the web indicates Polypropylene is a strong material so I guess this can be heavy duty without looking heavy duty . This is a nice binder that works well .	1
I 'll be honest : the best test of durability is time , and I 've only been using this binder for a few months . That said , it is noticeably sturdier and tougher than any other basic binder I 've used in the past . I like to keep a lot of page protectors and research documents in my binders , and most ca n't keep up for more than six months or so . I 'm optimistic that this one will last much longer ! I 'll probably be back for more as I replace the inferior ones on my shelf now , as those ones fall apart .	1
Yes ! If you use a binder ( s ) a lot , in all likelihood you know where I 'm about to go with this.If you are looking to buy one that you know will take a bit of abuse or reuse , but are pondering the possibility of getting by on the cheap , please read on ! With the super cheap ones , besides the rings never snapping well , one of the big problems is corner tear where you put the inserts in.I 've even used ones that tore with the first use.The clear covering is a sturdy gauge on these , and it is reinforced well . Well worth the investment .	1
I am an Office person . I write a lot and save a lot . Having a good binder to use is a Godsend because I can quickly find what I need . I have used many believe me , so I was happy to receive this one . First off it is definitely sturdy , and that is a good thing . It holds a lot , it says up to 220 pages , but I have n't gotten there yet . Opening and closing the rings is no problem at all and I like the pockets . It also comes in many different colors , which is nice . I find I can remember what is in what in my binders by remembering the color of them . Hey , every little thing helps when your in a hurry , right ? All in all this is a very good product at a great price . I recommend it .	1
I like to use binders like this to store recipes I have printed out and placed in plastic sleeves . That means the binder sits on the shelf most of the time except when I take it down to pull out a recipe . For that level of use , this binder is just fine . I have no idea how well it would hold up if you were carrying it around in your backpack or briefcase on a regular basis.The materials the binder is made from are lightweight and therefore appear to be flimsy , but the promotional material says the polypropylene cover is nearly impossible to tear . So only time will tell . It comes with a one-year warranty , so they must believe in their product . Right now I 'm giving it the benefit of the doubt . It does seem a bit overpriced for what you 're getting , but if it turns out to be as durable as they claim , maybe it 's worth it .	1
This feels at first to be a bit flimsy but the materials have proved to be strong . The ring design works to hold the papers in . The pockets are see through and sturdy . This is a very nice product . I recommend it . My 12 year old middle school daughter has been using it for a few weeks and likes it ... that is probably the best test .	1
This binder not only has clear view covers on the front and spine , but on the back as well , so you can give it whatever kind of look you want . Even though I do n't usually store papers in the covers , there 's no reason why they ca n't be , and the addition of a back cover increases the utility of the binder.Binders can split along the edges , but what usually goes first are the hinges . It 's the number one reason why I have to pitch a binder . The hinges on this binder seem sturdier than the norm , but only time will tell if it lives up to the manufacturer 's claim of durability.The ring binder opens and closes with a definite snap , not wimpy like some binders I 've had , and the two sides come together spot on with no gap where papers can get caught . The rings can be closed either by hand or with the the opening mechanism . Geez , I like the way that sounds . Snap ! Snap ! Snap ! I use different color binders for different purposes , so I really like that this binder comes in so many different colors as it 's difficult to find anything more than the usual white , black , and blue , especially when it 's not `` back to school '' season.Note that this is a round ring binder . For someone like me who does n't like D ring binders , this is just the ticket.I like this binder , if not for anything else but that it comes in so many colors . The next time I need a binder I will definitely be looking at the Wilson Jones heavy duty binders .	1
I think this binder is pretty nice . I 'd certainly say it 's above average.The `` Never Gap Rings '' are really nice , I ca n't tell you how many times I 've gone through my kids binders and papers have been coming out of one ring or another . Although the hinge is a lot better than many on the market , I do n't see a huge difference between the hinge here , that 's advertised as being `` Extra Durable '' , and some of the higher quality brands that are out there on the market.I have this particular Binder in the 1 '' White option . Sometimes you just need a nice basic color like White or Black and these are nice options but I also have other Wilson Jones Heavy Duty Binders in some of the other colors and they are very nice , bright and bold . I think these nice bold colors are very appealing for school aged kids . They just look nicer than the basic Black or White binders.The claim is that these Polypro Binders last up to 10X longer . I would n't bet on that . The quality on this binder definitely above average but there are other comparable binders out there as well . Time will tell but I 'd be surprised if these lasted any longer than some of those other comparable binders out there . Maybe 10X longer than the cheapest/lowest quality binder that you can find.I would recommend this binder , especially the bright , bold colors that may be more appealing to children but I would n't expect an overly high quality binder , just above average .	1
This Wilson Jones Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder is built to last . It has a heavier card stock in its covers than one usually finds in such binders , and the vinyl is thicker as well . The mechanism for controlling the opening and closing of the rings works smoothly and accurately , with the ends of the open ring meeting squarely as they should ; one end has a small divot that fits into a punt on the end of the joining piece of ring . There is , of course , extra protection of the contents from the transparent pockets on the outside of the binder , including the one on its spine . It appears that the most vulnerable parts of the binder are the transparent vinyl pockets inside the front and back covers . The binder has two overlapping pockets inside each cover , and , given the amount of material placed in each , there could be stretching and sagging there . On the whole , this binder should withstand a heavy semester load fairly well . However , the transparent outside lining of the binder , intended to hold papers , is easily slit -- mine arrived with a cut on its surface , so it is not nearly as durable as the binder cover itself .	1
My kids need these 1 & # 34 ; binders every year and they do vary in quality . This one has reinforced edges and the outside full sized clear pockets as well has interior half pockets . There is even a tiny pocket behind the rings that a pen might fit into . The ring mechanism is smooth and easy to operate .	1
First , this is a decent binder . The hinge is easy to use and seems stable enough . The plastic seems tough and sturdy , and I appreciate that there is a clear cover and spine for me to slip in covers . The rings inside are circular , not D-shaped , which some people prefer . There is no plastic guard to keep the first pages flat and safe , like you find in some binders.Of the info given on the cover , I read the fine print : the plastic lasts 10x longer ... than the same company 's Basic cover , not that of any competitor . The 1-year Warranty means that IF you save the original proof of purchase and you call the company within a year of purchase , they will send you a new binder . NOT give you your money back . So save that receipt !	1
These mechanical pencils have been so fun for my family and I. I throw a couple in my bag and do n't have to worry about the led breaking while we 're out.Now do n't expect your standard skinny , little mechanical pencil . This one larger , easier for little hands to hold . It 's triangular , which has been quite comfortable . The eraser is actually a good and substantial one . The led has a larger diameter than any other mechanical pencil I 've ever used . I like that this pencil is sturdy -- I do n't feel like it 's going to snap in my hand like the tiny ones , and it 's great for kids.My kids and I have all had a fine time using these ; however , when I gave one to my five-year-old nephew to use , he managed to break off the back in a matter of seconds . If this happens , then you ca n't push the led up or down . Luckily , we found all the parts and were able to fix it.I searched on Amazon and found lead refills that fit these pencils . I think you remove the eraser and slide them through the back . I think these pencils are awesome , and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because I ca n't find eraser refills . It would be great if they sold a pack of both lead and eraser refills . In order to keep wanting to use the pencil , you 'll need an eraser.My children and I all enjoy using these , so I 'm glad they came as a colorful 8-pack .	1
I have been a fan of mechanical pencils for as long as I can remember . I typically use pencils with a .7mm or .5mm lead . The leads on these Paper Mate pencils are approximately twice as thick . They do n't break easily ; however , the trade off is that they do n't write quite as crisply either.The pencils work well . I have n't experienced any failures . And they 're inexpensive enough that it would n't be a big concern to lose one.In terms of style and design , they 're engineered to look like typical pencils . The plastic barrel is fine to hold and seems sturdy . The eraser is much larger than the typical mechanical pencil eraser.Overall , these are decent mechanical pencils if you want to have spare pencils around to jot down notes . I do n't like them for writing much more than that , but your mileage may vary .	1
My boys ( 6 and 9 ) were excited to get and use these pencils . They are sturdy , solid , and kids like they way they look . I 've used one as well , and have to say the lead is a lot more sturdy than the .7 or .9 mm led of other mechanical pencils . If the price stays low , I 'd highly recommend these pencils for kids .	1
These pencils fit my hand well and wrote just as well as a standard # 2/HB pencil would write . All of that , in a mechanical package with lead that never needs sharpening . What 's not to like : ) The attached eraser is better than nothing , but as I normally use a Staedtler eraser , I was not bothered by its lackluster quality .	1
Paper Mate 8 Colored Barrel Mechanical Pencils . My daughter uses these mechanical pencils in school . She is satisfied with them . She seems to go through them pretty fast . Paper Mate is a long-time trusted brand . The pencils write the right way ( the lead is perfect ) .Highly recommended if you or your child have a need for mechanical pencils . 8 pencil value pack .	1
My wife liked that these pencils worked without breaking the lead and the eraser was strong . My kids liked the colors and shape . From this families perspective these are winners .	1
I use a lot of mechanical pencils since I have them in nearly every room . Whenever I spot a new style in the store , I usually buy a package . Well , this Papermate is the best I 've yet to encounter . The triangular shape makes it easy to hold and use ... plus it wo n't roll of the desk or table . For some reason , most of the mechanical pencils , regardless of the cost , have worthless erasers ! Unfortunately , these Papermate pencils are no exception . The eraser does not erase well . Otherwise , this is a nice pencil .	1
My 10 year old son used these pencils and they worked really well for him . The lead is sturdy and thus worked well without frequent breaking . The lead gives a strong yet smooth graphite line . The barrel was thicker that the general mechanical pencils and were easier and more comfortable for his grip . We also liked the bright colors .	1
While the pencils are mechanically sound and effective , I was led to believe the lead was colored and was disappointed to realize all the pencils were black lead . The design and construction of the pencils make them comfortable to use and the erasers are equally effective . We gave them to our two Grandsons to use and they enjoyed using them-a very high compliment . A very great pencil to use , just wish the lead colors matched the barrel colors . bogie	1
These pencils are great . I always hated the tiny eraser at the end of mechanical pencils , these pencils give you a nice big one . The barrel of the pencil is bigger and there are not groves . The lead is a little bigger and so there are less breaks . I have a tendency to press hard while writing and they would break all the time , now I have to replace them less . Fun colors too !	1
The design of these pencils is unique in my experience . They are shaped like real pencils , with a triangular ( rather than hexagonal ) surface around the pencil , and a large real pencil style eraser on the end . They are definitely comfortable to hold and use.I withhold a star because the eraser in use is pretty ineffective . It is hard and dry , does n't clear the written lead well , and leaves a trail of color as you use it .	1
these mechanical pencils worked like they say they would . The eraser does not smudge and the mechanical portion of the pencil worked great as well . I liked them . Other than that what else is there to say ? The bright colors are nice but that kind of a trivial matter .	1
there are several advantages to these pencils which might make them worth your while . probably the biggest is that they are just a very cool looking pencil ! the next big thing is that the shape of it fits well in your hand , much better than a usual pencil . thirdly , this is a number 2 pencil so you can use them on standardized forms . there are two downsides . i use an ipad , iPhone and MacBook for virtually all of my writing . so i do n't really need cuter versions of pencils at six bucks a package . if i use a pencil once or twice a week , it is a lot . secondly , i am also an artist but these do not appeal to me as art tools . i need something with a lot more heft and boldness to adopt it as an art tool . i may just give them to my husband and keep one pencil for myself . he scratches out numberls quite a bit so he might use these more .	1
These are pretty neat pencils , perfect for younger children because of the thickness of the barrel . I enjoy using them , too , though . They feel really nice and hefty in my hand and write very smoothly , and I love the colors . The lead is # 2 , and they 're made of heavy duty plastic so they do n't feel flimsy and they are n't going to break easily . They are refillable as far as the lead goes , but sadly the erasers are not . Well worth the price , I highly recommend these for your upcoming back to school purchase ... or your `` just because they 're really cool looking and feeling purchase '' !	1
PAPER MATE MATES serve as a great substitute for the standard `` No.2 '' pencils required for test taking.These mechanical pencils are designed to look like the usual wood pencil , even down to the traditional metal band holding the eraser . The barrels of these pencils are fat and triangular for a comfortable and sure grip , but not too big for elementary school-aged kids . The 1.3mm lead is thick , sturdy and provides a pronounced , dark mark ... perfect for standardized test requirements . Each pencil in the 8-pack has a different colored barrel.I found these perfect for kids in that they eliminate the need for sharpeners and the inevitable shavings they generate . Not to mention : no more dangerous sharp tips to worry about .	1
As I was browsing reviews , I saw many about kids loving these pencils . Well , I 'm an adult , and I love them too ! I do n't like writing with regular pencils ; I do n't like how they get dull so quickly . I 'd have to sharpen them every minute to keep them pointy and crisp ( I 'm Type A ... comes with the personality I guess ) . I 've always used mechanical because they always stay sharp and have a very precise point . These pencils are neat because they are a cross between the regular pencil and the mechanical.The body of the pencil is triangular-shaped , which makes for a good grip . I have always held my pencil `` wrong , '' and this shape/the wideness of the pencil actually makes the hold more comfortable for me . The lead is 1.3mm , which is THICK . That 's one thing that makes it more pencil-like . The lead does n't break as easily as the stuff in `` regular '' mechanical pencils . The eraser works well and does not smudge . It 's a large eraser , so I know that it will last for quite some time.Also , the pencil is clearly marked as # 2 . I 'm a teacher and when students have state exams , they need a # 2 pencil . Regular mechanical pencils are rarely marked what number lead they have , so I give them a good ol ' pencil just to be safe . From a teacher 's perspective , it 's nice that the pencil is stamped with this # 2 mark.Overall , a fun , functional product . I would recommend these pencils for kids and adults alike !	1
I am a bit of a pencil freak ; always have been . I have pencils stashed all over the house but in particular in area I do my reading and writing . I am also quite absent minded and am constantly misplacing the things . I simply can not own enough pencils.I must say that even though there are a couple of down sides to this mechanical pencil , overall I am delighted with them . Like a child , I tend to break leads quite frequently and the extra thickness of the leads in this pencil cuts down on that particular problem significantly . The lead advance system on this pencil is easy to use and quite smooth . The pencil is very sturdy and the triangular shape makes it easy to hold . This is a real advantage for children and for folks like myself and my wife who are troubled just a bit with arthritis ... they are very comfortable to hold and quite maneuverable.As far as I am concerned , and this is for the most part personal preference , the eraser is quite hard . Since I never make an error I have little use for an eraser ( hmmm , right ) , but I can see where a little one could quite well rub a hole through their paper . ( When I was a kid I was plagued with this problem ) . There is also no replacement eraser which is probably not that big a deal since the erasers should last quite some time as hard as they are.I also note that the replacement leads are a bit pricy for this pencil . For me this is semi-important but I doubt it will be for the wee ones in school since they will quite likely loose the thing before the lead runs out . ( In my last teaching job I harvested , on the average , six to ten pencils a day from the floors of the halls each day.All in all I like these pencils and the price here on Amazon is right ... you get your coinage worth.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I 've never used mechanical pencils before . I do n't tend to use pencils as much as in the past . I do use them at my office . Even on some regular wood pencils the erasers cause black marks or do n't erase well . These do n't . You push on the top of the eraser to load the graphite . The graphite in them is fine which makes it easy to read especially if someone 's writing is difficult to read . The barrel of the pencils is average size . They are comfortable to hold . I like all the different colored barrels . I have n't had to refill them yet . I wish they had included some refills in the package .	1
Paper mate mechanical pencils are very good . The shape ( triangular ) took some getting use to but once past that they are a very good quality pencil . I also like that the leads are thicker as they are much less prone to break.They are comfortable in your hand and i like the larger eraser . The colors are bright and crisp.I do n't know what else to say except I like them .	1
What can you say about economical mechanical pencils . They work . They feel like a pencil in your hand . They write . And , if you loose one , it 's not like loosing a Cross mechanical pencil.. you move on without any remorse . Good for the price .	1
I have been searching for break-resistant mechanical pencils for my kids . Even the 0.9 mm leads for the mechanical pencils break ! So , I am thrilled with these 1.3 mm pencils . Their leads do NOT break ! Also , the triangle barrel is ergonomic and easy to hold for small hands . I also love that they look like regular pencils and are refillable as well . The only nit is that the lead is quite pricey ... about $ 3 for 8 leads .	1
I do a lot of writing and often-times need a break from writing . I tried the new Paper Mate Mechanical Pencil and found it to work great ! I especially like the smooth write of the pen , low cost , and the pens feel . In fact , I will probably switch over to this model now . This pen is inexpensive and should last a long time . Try it , I think you will like it !	1
My husband has always preferred to use mechanical pencils , and when our kids started school they often wanted to use one of dad 's pencils . However , they clearly were n't intended for little kids . The tiny erasers never lasted long enough , and the thin graphite always broke when they tried to write . Also , it was too difficult for them to learn to replace the graphite . I tried these because they seem to be tailor-made for kids . The triangular , rather fat shape of the barrel of the pencil is easy to grip and hold . The erasers are the size of a standard wood pencil or maybe a little larger , and they are of good quality , erasing cleanly . The fatter graphite , while not flowing as smoothly as an adult might want their pencil to do , is much less likely to break when a child is writing . The graphite is also # 2 so it is suitable for use on standardized tests where the kids have to fill in the little ovals . I think I will still prefer a wooden pencil that I can sharpen to a fine point , because the thicker graphite on these pencils tend toward a blunt tip , but I think these mechanical pencils are especially suitable for elementary or middle school aged kids who want to write with a mechanical pencil .	1
The paper mate mechanical pencils work great . No problem with the lead or the eraser on the pencils . In a world full of environmental worries and concerns I guess this is a reason for this type of pencil ( less trees used ? ) . It is a good product and I will give it 4 stars . The pencils seem durable so far . Lead for the pencils once the lead is used up ? There is another issue . Still , good pencils for school kids who wo n't spend time sharpening pencils constantly in a classroom setting . Four stars . Not quite five stars , but four solid stars .	1
Using these is so much easier than constantly sharpening broken pencils . The humongous eraser is a big hit with my son , too , though it 'll be a drag when the eraser is gone , because they do n't seem to be refillable.The lead is VERY sturdy compared to other mechanical pencils . He had been using a 9 mm pencil with a 2B ( softer ) lead , because that 's what I prefer , but he 's only 8 and he has n't really learned how to be gentle with a pencil , so this 1.3 mm pencil with an HB lead is perfect for his needs . And I do n't mind borrowing one on occasion .	1
My daughter absolutely loves these pencils . She says that the thin mechanical pencils always make her fingers hurt , but the fatter pencil gives her more to hold on to.She really loves how strong the lead is . it does not break as easily as other lead and the erasers do n't tear the paper when erasing.This is a great pencil for the price and your mechanical pencil lover will enjoy these !	1
These mechanical pencils look more like markers or pens than mechanical pencils , and the array of colors make them more fun to own than the traditional boring mechanical pencils.Pros:1 . The thicker lead is almost unbreakable . I am accustomed to snapping off leads regularly on the traditional thin lead mechanical pencils , and I could not get one of these to break ! 1a ) Great for kids ( or anyone ) who bears down hard on their pencils2 . The thick lead allows you to keep rotating the pencil to maintain a sharp edge at the end of the lead2 . Good quality smudge-proof eraser3 . Sturdy triangular shaped barrel is comfortable to grip4 . The pencil is nicely balanced5 . Pretty rainbow of colors in this 8-pack ; the pencil will be easy to find among your papers on the desk or deep in the bowels of the backpack , briefcase or purse.6 . Price of ~ $ 1/each is very attractive7 . The lead flows easily onto the page without having to apply much pressure8 . The fat lead makes filling in the bubbles on standardized tests fasterCons:1 . The eraser is rather small and probably wo n't last as long as the pencil ( and no replacements are included ) 2 . The solid color of the barrel means that you wo n't be able to determine if the lead is almost used up3 . The barrel does not include a spare lead , so you ca n't just click a new one into place ; although it does appear to be easy to drop a new one into the barrel.Observations:1 . The thick lead does n't work well with the tiny boxes in crossword puzzles in the newspaper2 . It does n't have a pocket clip ( not a con for me but might be for others ) In summary , it 's a very nice sturdy multi-purpose pencil at a good price . Those who are very particular about their skinny leads and erasers and pocket clip might not be convinced to give it a try , but I 'm getting good use out of my new Paper Mates ! I have included several close-up images to demonstrate the features of the pencil .	1
I use mechanical pencils a lot because I 'm a puzzle nut -- especially Sudoku . I 'm always on the look-out for a really good pencil to work with . I 've been using various styles of Paper Mate pencils for many years now and the knock against them was usually that the .7 mm lead was `` sharp '' and would punch through the very inexpensive paper used in puzzle books and magazines . The ones I was using were also one-use since there was no way to refill them . Along came these triangular shaped refillable pencils with 1.3 mm size # 2 lead so I simply had to try them.The size of the barrel is comfortable in my hand . I do n't have any issues with that shape even though it did take a little usage time to stop feeling the triangle versus round sensation . It is larger than the round pencils so I can see how children , especially younger children , would find them easy to hold and use . I was afraid that the thicker lead would make it impossible for me to use the pencil in very small or tight puzzle configurations , but that turned out ( much to my surprise ) to not be a problem . I have not deliberately tried to break the lead , but it feels quite sturdy . For some unknown reason I was surprised to find that the eraser is triangular also . Because of that shape it has sharpish edges on it , not totally comfortable to use ; first because of the shape and second because the eraser is rather hard . I did find that it erases well after I got used to using it . When you push down on the eraser you advance the lead and when you pull the eraser up and off the pencil you find the compartment where you can insert a stick of new lead.I 've been looking around the Amazon site and find that this style ( l.7 mm , # 2 lead ) pencil comes in other packaging and styles . Some are solid yellow and some are sets which include fewer pencils , but extra lead and several extra erasers . I have not yet found packages with only erasers and that might be a problem with children who will fuss with the eraser , remove it , and promptly lose it . I have decided that I 'm going to buy more of these pencils though . I have a daughter who teaches second grade and so I find myself volunteering as a proctor when her school takes the annual achievement tests . I think these pencils would solve a whole lot of the problems her young students have with their pencils during the test taking time . This will be one heck of a `` bubble '' filling pencil .	1
I have bought/used mechanical pencils for more than 25 years now . I always loved that you never had to sharpen them but always hated the super thin & very breakable lead . That has now come to an end ! These pencils write the way a regular wooden pencil writes ! They have a good strong lead that feels right , looks great , NEVER EVER BREAKS , never needs sharpened , lasts practically forever , and erases easily when needed ! Why on earth had these not been invented sooner ? ! I have been so happy using these for everything I do ( diary , study notes , crossword puzzles , grocery lists , you name it ! ) and they just work so perfectly . The eraser on them is awesome too . It 's strong and erases better than anything I ever used before ! The lead clicks out in perfect increments , the pencils feel so comfortable in my hand while writing , and they even have flat sides so they do n't roll off the table ! I have zero complaints about them . I have waited my whole life to find a pencil like this . ( I am a writer so this is critically important to me ! ) If ever you need a pencil for anything , this is the one to get ! I will never go back to the flimsy lead type again . I can not recommend these highly enough ! Try them and see for yourself ! : )	1
You must use these pencils for a while before you make up your mind . My initial thought upon just looking at them were that they were a little clunky looking ; however , upon using them for a while , the shape , size and form of them are really well thought out . The pencil lead gets better once you 've used them for a while . The first few writings were a bit thick because of the chopped off lead . The lead is thick and it makes that cut off top even more prominent because of it . I actually tilted the pencil to the side and did a rubbing to make the tip have a bit of a point . That little extra step made writing much nicer.If you have a heavy hand when writing , which my husband is , you will be gleeful when you realize that you can not easily break this lead like most other leads.The only improvement I can recommend is that the pencil eraser be made of a different material . It does n't erase well enough for me . It appears more to blend the lead into the paper than actually erase it . This could be because the lead is so much thicker and more lead is actually deposited onto the paper . Maybe one of the white erasers would do a better job.Overall , a very nice mechanical pencil .	1
I draw a lot and am always looking for a better pencil . These are great to hold . The triangular shape makes them easy to grip . They have a large eraser , that is pretty hard and does n't work great . The lead in them is pretty thick as well and I think these would be good for students or test taking , but not so great for drawing .	1
I use a lot of pencils and hate sharpening pencils , do n't even own a pencils sharpener , so I generally buy mechanical ones though I prefer the feel of good old wooden pencils . I work a lot of crossword puzzles , word games , and Sudoku puzzles and have pencils all over the house.I LOVE the 1.3mm lead used in this Paper Mate Mates Pencil . I have always hated the thin , rigid , brittle lead in most mechanical pencils , but it seemed a necessary trade off . This Paper Mate with provided lead is more like writing with a # 2 wooden pencil and it just feels great . I have not yet checked locally for the availability of replacement lead though I see it is available here on Amazon atPaper Mate Mates 1.3mm Mechanical Pencil Lead Refills ( 1868816 ) . The lead is the best part of the Paper Mate Mates pencils.The eraser is nice too though . I use LOTS of eraser when working Sudokus and probably need to learn a better method that does n't need so much erasing . But these erasers are perfect for that use , soft , no smudging , and erase all the way ; but not refillable . They do seem to last a long while though.Less important are the colors of these pencils , but still I do love them just because there bright and cheerful.The advertised selling point that caught my eye about the Paper Mate Mates was that these pencils were said to be good for replacing wood pencils and had a nice feel to them . I totally disagree with that promotion . I dislike the feel of these pencils a great deal and they are proving extremely difficult for me to get used to . I do n't mind too much the smoothness , but the fatness and triangular shape are most uncomfortable and frustrating and in no way resemble any wooden pencils I have used.Also , the Paper Mates 1.3mm pencils are a bit more expensive than most of the mechanical pencils I purchase since mainly I am not doing anything professional with my pencils , just having fun . Among the varied mechanical pencils I buy , I often purchaseZebra Cadoozles Mechanical Pencil , 0.7mm , Assorted , 10 Pack ( 51211 ) . Not a lot of bells and whistles , more like throw-aways that you can take anywhere and if you leave it or lose it , it is a sort of 'oh well ' type experience . But at 29 cents each versus the $ 1.19 each price tag of the Paper Mate Mates they make sense for my use . I also use a lot ofWrite Dudes Grip Mechanical Pencils , 0.7mm Leads , 24 Assorted Color Grips ( 2741 ) , and at less than 50 cents each they come with extra lead . Of course , you can innoculate yourself with the lead it is so sharp , but trades offs must sometimes me made.In the end , deciding to continue with the varity I generally use versus changing to the Paper Mate Mates exclusively it will be a trade off between price and uncomfortable feel versus great lead and very good erasers . I ca n't say which will win out , but price more than likely.That said for myself , if you do n't mind the feel of these Paper Mate Mates Mechanical Pencils and they are n't too much for your budget , the lead is a great quality and after all 'writing ' is what a pencil is mainly about , and too the erasers are great , and unfortunately most of us do often make mistakes . It wo n't be a mistake though , if you use mechanical pencils , to try this one out and see if it fits your hand .	1
I like the Paper Mate Mates mechanical pencils . First , I would like to say that I am a fan of the price . Unlike my more expensive mechanicals , I am willing to share them or set them down without fear they would walk away ( a form of sharing ) . The colorful barrels are easy to hold for any age . They fit well in the spiral bindings of my calendar or my notebooks . They are sturdy and do not feel cheap . My first experience , I felt the lead point was too thick ; as it is used as a # 2 . After writing with the pencil , it proves to be a good writing instrument - just flows well across the paper and no broken leads.I am sharing with my family ; )	1
These are the best mechanical pencils ever . They are a little thicker than the average mechanical pencil you buy . They have a triangular shape that makes them easy to grip . They have an eraser that is about 3 times larger than the average and they have 1.3 mm lead , the size of a # 2 pencil . I love them for Su Doku . My daughter loves them for graphing quilt patterns . My granddaughter loves them for math and for drawing . Everyone that sees mine wants it . I will definitely stock up on these !	1
These pencils are fat and a little uncomfortable ... but I like that they have a good long eraser and the lead does not break easily like most mechanical pencils . I will buy these for my children in the future as they last much longer when the lead does not break every few minutes .	1
When I received these refillable mechanical pencils , I did not expect them to be a good as they are . Perhaps , it was because I was so used to the smaller 0.5mm pencils in school , but these ones obviously have thicker `` lead '' ( Graphite ) at 1.3mm . There is no fear of breaking , even with 3-4 clicks showing.The rounded triangular shape feels just right between your fingertips and allows for a bit of maneuverability without sharp edges poking into you.The `` lead '' writes very smoothly , almost like using a gel pen . Like the packaging says , these are `` Great for standardized tests '' , as they are a # 2 pencil.The design of them conceals the fact that they are mechanical , as they look just like a normal plain yellow one would , just with 8 different colors to choose from . They even have nice thick eraser tops.Without putting these items through a torture test of some kind , they have exceeded my expectations and deserves 5 Stars !	1
We homeschool and were lucky enough to test these pencils out . All in all we like them and would purchase them for future . I have a 6th grade girl and 2nd grade boy . Things important to the boy are color of pencil and cool clicking ability . My 2nd grader did manage to break his first pencil within the first 30 minutes . Although I do n't blame the product , I blame an over enthused 2nd grade boy who was being a little too rambunctious and not listening . Favorite green pencil ruined and he moved onto the red . He 's had that one for about two weeks now and no breakage ( lesson learned maybe ? ) . My 6th grader has not had any problems with her pencils . While we use them for our school work , in subjects like Math ; she likes to draw and she says she really thinks these are good for drawing . Her only complaint is that it does n't have a soft grip at the end . The things I like about the pencils is the marks are very easy to erase , they are colorful , they are mechanical ( no annoying pencil sharpening when I 'm working with someone ) and they look cute with their wooden pencil look to them . We like and will purchase them when the time comes to replace this stock .	1
The pencil itself is nice . It has a slight triangular shape and writes well but the erasers are terrible . They come off easily and I ca n't find replacements for them anywhere on amazon.If the erasers were better and replacements were easy to find , I 'd give this pencil high marks -- especially for kids since the shape is nice and the lead is sturdy . Until then , I 'd steer clear unless you want to purchase new pencils every time the eraser runs out .	1
I have always loved mechanical pens and pencils that look like actual wooden pencils . So when I saw Paper Mate had these out they were an auto buy.The colors are as bright and fun as the photo suggests . The pencils also have a nice weight and heft to them -- slightly thicker than a typical # 2 pencil . The pencils are also slightly triangular for easy holding . The only downside is that the big eraser is also triangular which means you 'd have to find special refills for them ( which might be a reason for me to avoid using the eraser as it also serves as a `` cap '' on the top of the pencil to keep lead inside ) .The pencils are easy to use with a click function to dispense lead . The 1.3mm variety is also nice and thick ( which again might be a refill issue if you have a stockpile from other pencils ) which seems to suggest a sturdier/less breakable lead.I really like the pencils and at 7.99 for an 8 pack it seems like a good buy besides . Not sure how easy refills will be to find but at about a dollar a pop the original pencils should last for a fair bit of time .	1
The thicker lead helps with breakage . Really hard to break with normal use . They write nice and feel good in the hand . the colors are also pleasant to the eye . The eraser works well also . Probably a good choice for younger kids who are prone to write with more pressure and cause lead breakage . Good pencils .	1
Not sure what it is about mechanical pencils these days , but tween boys seem to be fixated on them . Our youngest and his friends all use them and beg for the latest model . So I got him this set through Vine and he loves it . In particular , he said that the thickness was more comfortable than in other models .	1
Sturdy , well-made , work cleanly and efficiently . The colors are bright , and they make homework fun for the hesitant child ! A pleasure to use .	1
I do a lot of writing by hand , and I love my mechanical pencils ; there 's nothing that makes my skin crawl like the feeling of dull pencil lead scraping over paper . From my perspective , these pencils are pretty good . I have a pretty light touch , so breaking the lead has never been a problem for me , but these were fine to write with . I appreciate the triangle design ; it really does stop the pencil from rolling away without changing the way that it feels in my hand very much.I knocked off one star because I would have liked to see an eraser that was either also mechanical , or was easier to replace . I also am worried about whether I 'll be able to find lead refills in the right size . I know these pencils are supposed to be disposable , but I would rather keep refilling the disposable pencils than toss them out and buy more.So that 's me . Then the three artists who live with me got their hands on them , and now they wo n't give them back.From an artist 's perspective : These pencils are amazing . The larger tip means that it 's easier to shape and control what kind of surface you 're drawing with , and it allows for putting pressure on the paper for darker lines without snapping.All in all , for someone who writes by hand a lot and has a light touch , they 're nice but nothing to write home about . If you 're someone who presses on the paper more and has a lot of trouble with breaking the lead on standard mechanical pencils , you probably wo n't have to worry about breaking so much . The lead is really thick . Finally , if you 're an artist , definitely give them a try .	1
I have severe carpal tunnel and write with a very heavy hand . These leads are really sturdy and do not break on me . The erasers are also firm and sturdy . I also like that the barrels are triangular , which makes it easier to hold . My only gripe is that I would like it to have a larger barrel with a cushion grip . Other than that , I really like these . My regular mechanical pencil is a Dr . Grip with 0.5 mm Uni nano dia leads . I still prefer that one , but this is a close second .	1
I like the pencils . I really like the 1.3mm wide leads , easier to see the writing , do n't break as easily . The lead is advanced by pushing on the eraser , leads inserted by pulling out the eraser . The triangle shape makes it easier to hold than an equivalent round barrel.However I personally find the Pentel Fiesta 1.3mm pencils more comfortable to hold ( they have ribs ) .The eraser on this Papermate does n't completely remove the pencil marks . I find the one on the Fiesta to eraser more thoroughly.These would be great for kids . They look a little too toy-like in my opinion for business use .	1
I like the colors of the pencils . All leads are black , however . It took me a while to figure out how to get the lead out , so to speak . You must click down on the eraser and then press gently down on the lead to get it in writing position . I was hoping for a rubbery , non-slip grip . The plastic can be a bit slick , especially if you have sweaty hands.But if none of this matters , these can be fun writing implements . I 'm glad they have erasers attached .	1
No one ever accused me of having perfect penmanship . I always aspired to it , but being a left-hander who was taught to write in such a way that my hand curls around my writing , smudging it before the ink dries , it simply never happened . Even pencil writing is smeared beyond belief which is quite annoying even at my advanced age . It seems I still hear Miss Carson 's admonition to write neatly in my brain . So , I am a pencil junkie . I try every new pencil and pen that I come across . Love new pens and pencils -- have zillions of them spread from one end of my house to the other . And , so when I found the Paper Mate Mates Mechanical Pencils on Amazon , I was willing to give them a shot . First , they are as fat as a first grade pencil -- they certainly takes some getting used to there ! The barrel , however is triangular in shape and rests easily in the hand in spite of its girth . Would be a plus to those with arthritic hands . The 1.3mm lead is a bit thicker than I care for , leaning more toward the .5 or .7 ordinarily , but for taking notes , scrawling grocery lists and that sort of writing , it is fine . If you use a stylus much on a tablet or your phone , then you will be right at home with the thicker line . The crowning glory , literally , of these pencils though is the eraser -- it resides on top as it does on every pencil , but it is LONG and it is hearty . There is a lot of eraser there . The lead , of course advances when you push down briskly on the eraser , but it requires enough force that it does n't advance the lead when you do n't want it to happen . I like the muted colors ; I like the pencils.Paper Mate Mates 1.3mm Mechanical Pencils , 5 Yellow Barrel Mechanical Pencils ( 1862167 )	1
I rarely use pencils for writing . I use them more for drawing or doodling . When I need to sketch out a schematic or get bored and draw a picture . These pencils follow the design where you make a writing implement triangular so it fits in the crook of your fingers well , and it has good length . But I think the best thing is this 1.3 mm thick lead . I use .5 for detail and .7 was nice for fill until this size came along and it does well holding up to pressure . I have yet to break one by pressing too hard . The `` smudge resistant '' eraser feels like an old ( as in aged ) pink eraser felt . Kind of scratchy , but it does just fine erasing and it does not leave smudges . The problem is , the eraser is triangular as well , with a triangular peg that inserts in a hole the plastic holder . You are not going to replace it with anything other than one made specifically for this pencil . I tried to put the pencil topper erasers on it but they broke trying to get them on , so it is either shell out or use a gummy .	1
My grandkids , 7 and 8 years old , are using these for school . The thicker lead works great against breakage . The eraser is not very effective , but the kids use the individual erasers anyway . They like the colors , and they seem to hold them well with the triangular shaped barrels .	1
When I say brilliant , I 'm not talking about the pretty colors these mechanical pencils come in . I mean it is an absolutely brilliant idea to make the plastic case , you hold while writing , three-sided . My first thought while testing out the pencil was , `` why on earth are n't all writing implements designed this way ? '' It 's so much easier to write with than a round pen or pencil.Other than that they come in pretty colors , so everyone can have their own . The eraser does erase the lead on plain white paper . It did n't do a great job on the back of the cardboard the pencils came in though.If you do n't currently like mechanical pencils , the design of these just might change your mind .	1
These pencils come in an array of pleasing colors and a shape that is easy to hold . The 1.3mm lead is much sturdier than thinner ones . It is refillable , which makes it environmentally friendly . I can find refill leads for it , but not replacement erasers , which is why I am giving it 4 stars .	1
In trying out these pencils , I found that due to the larger barrel size , it was harder to hold than most pencils . The fact that the lead is 1.3 ( ie : thicker than most ) does it make it easier to use since it is n't as prone to breakage ( especially useful with kids who use a lot more pressure ) . The eraser seems to work just fine . All in all , I would give these to my kids to use but for me , I 'll stick with the smaller lead and barrel size	1
I like Paper Mate 's 1.3 mm Mechanical Pencils , but I had to take some time to get used to them . I seldom use wooden pencils , as I hate having to sharpen them every time they dull . I have always favored .07 mm lead , but become aggravated because the lead is easily broken . When I found out that Paper Mate had come up to a solution for my problem , I was stoked.With the Paper Mate 1.3 mm pencils , you get the best of both worlds . Mechanical pencils that never need sharpening with lead thick enough that you can apply pressure , without fearing breakage . These pencils are thicker than most mechanical pencils , so I had to acclimate myself to the size and figure out how best to hold them . The erasers are decent -- not the best -- but they do n't leave smudges or messes.These pencils are great for elementary and middle school students , who typically break mechanical lead very easily . As an adult , I like these pencils , but I would love them if they were more slender .	1
As a semi-educator I use and go through many pencils and pens , so in a way I 'm an expert on the subject . These Paper Mate Mates are really nice pencils . Why ? Because they are larger in diameter then every other mechanical pencil I own and therefore more comfortable to hold . The three-sided edges are rounded , the weight is nice ( not too light and not too heavy ) , the mechanics work well and the eraser is effective . Plus you can reload them . The lead is not the thin size that snaps off every time it comes in contact with paper . Personally I do n't care about what color a pencil is but the kids like them.Highly recommended as an every day pencil .	1
The triangular-barreled Paper Mate 1.3mm lead mechanical pencils are brightly colored with # 2 lead . The plastic barrel seems a little flimsy , and the pencils only come with only one lead each . The colors are bright , and the lead thickness is nice . I usually write with a 9mm lead to avoid breakage , and this 1.3mm seemed like it would be sturdy . Unfortunately , I also like a darker lead than the # 2 ( I usually use B or 2B if I can get it ) , and the price on the darker lead in this size is much more . It is good to have a refillable pencil , and the triangle barrel ( smoothed ) means the pencils are not as likely to roll off a desk . Also , they are a bit shorter than a standard pencil , so I would say this product is better for kids than adults . For the intended audience and school use , these look to be quite good pencils .	1
I like almost everything about this Paper Mate `` Mates '' mechanical pencil . It is a nice weight , comes in great colors , is a sturdy plastic design and has a nice wide triangular shape ( similar to the Dixon Ticonderoga Triangular wooden pencils ) . Plus , they write well and the thick 1.3 mm lead does not break easily . A simple push down on the top will dispense the lead , like most mechanical ones do . The lead is refillable by removing the eraser and slipping in a new one into the chamber.The only thing I do not like about this pencil is that the base of the eraser has the same triangular shape as the pencil . There were no refills in the pack , nor were there any available for purchase that I could find . Once the eraser is done you will have to use a separate one ... .or switch off to the next pencil in the pack . This is my overall complaint with mechanical pencils . Hopefully , they will start selling the refills because I really think I will be using these .	1

Its great that laser printers are getting cheaper so the average SOHO person can justify replacing those old inkjet multi function devices with a more cost efficient laser version . I love the fact that it also does duplex printing . printing on both sides saves so much paper.Like some others have stated it does n't duplex scan or fax , but I have n't seen that feature on anything meant for the SOHO environment or that is in this price range.Have n't had much time to play with any of the other features so I will update that after I play with them .	1
This is a great printer , I tested all aspects of it and it worked wonders.Keeping in mind that I 'm using it for home and not at an actual work space , I liked the multifunction ability and how well it responded , copies are clear and scanner works fast . The one thing that I noticed and did n't like so much is that the toners are super expensive ! I 'm not sure how long a toner lasts but I hope it lasts a long time , otherwise , I'l be paying the cost of the printer in three toners.I recommend this printer for anyone with a small business and willing to pay some big $ $ for the toners .	1
This printer is larger than most multifunction printers , but size does not necessarily indicate a plethora features . It seems to have fewer features than the other Samsung printer that I got earlier this year . I mainly got this printer because I had that smaller Samsung SL-M2875 FW , which I like . This printer ( the SL-M3370FD ) does not have the wireless printing feature , which is a little disappointing & # 8211 ; but that my is fault for not catching that when reading the description , so I did not take off any stars for that . The cost of the high-yield toner cartridge for this printer is pricey when you look at it , but since it is rated at 5,000 pages , it breaks down to roughly 2 cent a sheet , and the thought of only purchasing one toner cartridge per box of paper does not seem that bad to me . Setup was pretty easy on Windows 7 . All-in-all , I would recommend the printer if you are using it on a small wired home network ( CAT5 cables ) or a single computer with USB .	1
I do a lot of printing at home , so even though this has a large footprint , I found this printer to be highly efficient at getting even large jobs done . While I do a good bit of color printing , I found this machine to be perfect for the straight black and white jobs . I then use my inkjet for the color print jobs.We did have a few connectivity issues with connecting to the network at times even with the ethernet wired to the router . ( This particular model does NOT have wireless capability which is a shame . ) They do offer another model with this feature.It 's a fast workhorse which means large jobs are done quickly . The duplex mode works well , and the images are crisp and clear . Having a large paper capacity meant that I did n't have to continually refill with paper during bigger jobs which I appreciated.We had periodic issues with the scan feature as it did not always want to scan to pc or email . When it worked , it was fast and easy . The copy and scan features are both fast as is the warm-up period for the scanner . ( I remember the older laser printers that seemed to take forever to warm up . ) It 's important to note that you can not do duplex scanning/copying.I did not use the fax feature as I do n't have a home phone line , so I ca n't comment on how well that works.Overall , it 's a solid machine with a few glitches .	1
I see a lot of negative reviews on this product and at first it confused me . I can only guess that many if these reviews had earlier versions of the print software or drivers . The dates on these negative reviews seem to be Summer 2013 or before . My experience has been positive . The setup was trouble free . Print was easy from Windows 7 and IOS . Network setup was easy although not nearly as speedy for features as direct USB connect . As a printer this is a 5 . Excellent output quality and speed . The scanner seems a bit more clugey and I give it more of a 3 . The fax I tested but do n't plan on using . Seems to work fine . The printer management tools for a device of this class are very robust . I would say the MFD is well worth the money .	1
I 've used a number of laser printers over the years , and this one is one of the best for a couple reasons. -- - It 's Quiet -- -Compared to other laser printers , this one is so extremely quiet . It 's amazing . One of our older laser printers sounded like an airplane was about to take off when it prepped to print.It 's almost unbelievable how quiet this one is.The fan does n't have to run forever after each print either . It prints , and it 's done. -- - It 's Fast -- -You could almost say super fast . The pages come out really fast without the fan having to turn on or the printer warming up for an eternity like we 've seen with other other/previous laser printers. -- - Install was easy on a Mac -- -Plug it in , and the drivers download.Drawbacks -- - It 's Big -- -The paper tray is small , but the housing for the print cartridge is huge . That 's why this printer is so tall.This guy is n't going to fit well under a shelf , it needs a lot of space.Also , the scanner portion is really large as well.The whole thing is just big and bulky.Being so big , you 'd think that the paper tray could hold more paper , but it 's just the same size as other smaller laser printers . They could have also set the paper tray to hold letter paper rather than an envelope . You have to adjust the tray sides and the back to get it to fit standard letter paper. -- - Poor Image Quality -- -So good in other aspects , why do images print so poorly ? It 's like it 's got poor dpi or gray scale handling . Unfortunate because it 's otherwise a great printer.Text printing is okay but not great . Notice that when you print large text , the text is not completely black , you can see small dots . It 's not on Eco mode , so it 's weird that it prints that way.It also jammed when it got down to one sheet in the tray . Not a big deal , but still.The drawbacks distract from an otherwise good printer .	1
About a year ago I got anEpson WorkForce WF-7520 Wireless All-in-One Wide-Format Color Inkjet Printer , Scanner , Copier , Fax ( C11CB58201 ) that has been quite the best fax machine and inkjet printer I have ever owned . Now it 's time for a new laser printer and I jumped at the chance to try out this Samsung.It 's not wireless which is rather disappointing , but I was able to connect it to my wireless router viaTRENDnet Powerline 200 AV Nano Adapter Kit , TPL-308E2K . One unit plugs into the router and into an electric socket . The other unit I plugged into my printer and into a wall socket ( one issue is you have to plug directly into the socket to get a good connection so no surge protectors ) . However , once the printer was connected to my office network I could see it from every computer on the network and install the software on all of the computers.First , the printer . It weighs a ton . Luckily it came very well packed -- not even the UPS guy dropping it so hard it made the floor shake caused any problems . It was also easily assembled and the software installed without problems . The printing is crisp and clean looking . Although just black and white , that was exactly what I wanted . I was very happy with speed and print quality.The only thing that I thought was less than great was the multifunction software . I was pleased to see that this software would allow the printer to be a central FAX . I 'm totally spoiled by the ability to FAX from any desktop in the office . Saves on paper and time . Except I spent hours trying to get the FAX function to work . I 've been spoiled by the Epson software . The Samsung software lacks some of the features I find very useful on the Epson so I 've keep the Epson as the central FAX even though it eats up expensive ink jet toner when printing out FAX acknowledgement pages . Also the Epson will save incoming FAXs to my hard drive so I can print out only what I want . Although I have had the Samsung for a month I have n't got this function to work on it.So , I give it a good solid B overall.Printer -- A without a doubt.Copier -- AScanner -- BFAX & software -- CI 'll update if I finally manage to get the software totally figured out or there is an update .	1
... and organized with this one-stop binder . It 's big ( 2 inch ring capacity ) . It has lots of inner storage space for pens , markers , pencils , note cards/i.d . 's , etc You can invest in some decent dividers ( I 'm favoring Wilson-Jones View Tabs these days ) and you 're ready for class , or the office , or a meeting with your off-site client.It looks and feels sturdy , and there 's a handle on the spine so you can carry it like an attache case.I do n't know how this would hold up in the hands of an active high-schooler , but I think it would have to be kicked up and down the gym a few times before showing signs of wear.There are hundreds of uses for this Zipper Binder , and I 'm sure you 'll find the perfect job for this at your house .	1
Besides of a good binder for students , this is also useful for small business owners , or anybody who needs to keep a large amount of documents organized and handy . What I like the most of this binder is the six pockets expanding file , with tabs that can be customized to our needs.I also like the design of it , it looks nice and its practical at the same time . I do n't keep a planner anymore , but I do like to have a checklist of what I 'm doing everyday of the week . Indeed , I have a checklist for everything in order to stay on track with my busy life.Stocking filler paper to take notes is easy , and the internal zipper pocket can hold most small Tablets , or gadgets in it . The handle makes it look as a modern briefcase and depending of one 's line of work , it 's looks good enough to carry around to meetings and interviews .	1
Fairly durable by today 's standards . Expect it to last for one school year of regular usage . It has plenty of room and a carrying handle . Both of which are highly necessary for my Jr.High daughter . There are a couple of inside pockets but unfortunately none on the outside . It 's not the best binder we 've had but it 's still pretty good .	1
Great binder in a unisex color . It easily fits all of my daughter 's sheets and the portion with the folder access is exactly what she has been needing all through the school year . She is also able to carry her pencil case in the zipper pocket.My one gripe and loss of star is the fact that it is n't a D-ring . I can not review the durability or longevity because it has only been a month as of now . I did previously purchase another trapper keeper from this company and it did collapse at the six month mark.Recommend for any individual that needs a lot of storage and needs to keep it contained within a zippered environment . I do suggest to the company to lower the cost , especially since these binders are usually used by youth aged students and definitely fall apart .	1
Great binder ! The attached file holders allows for easy storage of loose papers . The kid ( s ) come home with loose papers without holes frequently . I like that we can just put them in a file and go . Sturdy . should last all school year .	1
If it can stand up to my son and being smashed into his overcrowded knapsack then it can withstand anything . I 've seen my son go through binders in days . This one looks brand new after a good few hard weeks of use . It 's well made . When something is well made and looks good and is made to last there is not much to write . Long reviews are needed for minutia and problems . As of yet I see none with this binder . If anything should change I will be back with an addition . For now this binder is great .	1
I found this item to be well made and offers a good value , it looks kind of professional on top of that .	1
I have a kid who is always losing their papers from their 3 ring binders . I 'm not sure why , but I think it comes down to the way he is putting the papers into the binders , and they fall out at some point . This binder is great because it has the normal 3 ring system but also has a zipper to keep any lose paperwork stored inside safely . there is also a nice built in pouch to hold pencils and other accessories . Overall , this is a really nice binder that will last the entire school year and maybe longer . It 's a bit more expensive than a traditional binder , but the added convenience of not losing paperwork more than makes up for it in my opinion , especially if you have a child that is prone to keeping a sloppy binder with loose paperwork hanging out .	1
I have not used this binder for long , but I am more than pleased with its performance . With separate plastic dividers , I can put loose papers and receipts in , keeping my personal and business papers close at hand but not mixed together . The case withstood the torrential downpours of the past days . While I had a raincoat on , the binder took several unprotected trips from the car to shelters . The outside got wet , but not the inside.So what do I carry in the binder ? I have loose papers and a 1 '' thick file folder plus a small pad of paper and a Shutterfly hard cover photo book in the dividers which I can access from just unzipping the divider compartment or by the main zippered compartment . I hold that tight together with the velcro strap included . In the zippered pouch ( which the strap attaches to ) , I have pens , highlighters and a small tape measure . There is a pocket on that where one can store a cell phone , but I put a snack bar there . The binder holds a full size notebook which I can use while in the binder.The handle is tight to the hand , just enough room to pick up without much gap . I have n't decided whether that is good or bad yet.I can see lots of uses with this binder when traveling on public transportation . I could add my iPad or iPad mini and a magazine.I do not like carrying a briefcase even though shoulder straps are easier than carry handles . Briefcases get cluttered up with non-essentials . This binder is lightweight and perfect for my minimalist needs as a business person.I recommend it for business , school , or for someone who needs more than a binder to store and transport things . My wife now wants one for her genealogy where she stores scraps of papers , photos , articles as well as her own work .	1
I intended to use this as a school binder for one of my kids but when it arrived it was much thicker than I expected . It might work for a college student , but my lower grade kids have to fit a different binder for each subject in their pack and this takes up the same room as three or four others . I am using it to store my tax documents and it 's perfect for that . Because it zips all the way around I can put loose documents , notes , etc in sleeves and not worry about losing anything . Much easier than an accordion binder with multiple pockets for reorganizing .	1
I originally ordered this binder for my sixth grader . When it arrived , I immediately commandeered it thinking this is PERFECT for the kid 's medical records ! First the front part of the portfolio has a zippered filing section with five filing pockets - great for five kids . And it ZIPS - nothing falling out on staircases ! ! Next is a very generous 2 & # 34 ; wide three hole binder section with another zippered pouch - for pencils , rulers , markers and a cell phone pouch atop of that . VERY cool ! One bag in for the doctor - I can stash my credit cards and everything else in there as well as my wallet.The whole binder zips up - safe and secure . Lots of room for notes , a couple of loose leaf spiral books and my calendar , too.There is a carry handle on the outside spine.EVERY last detail has been thought through . Unlike many binders of this type - this one feels very well constructed . The fabric is durable , the binder is durable , the zippers are strong . I see this lasting until the kids do n't need a pediatrician any longer.The only downside - it 's kind of ugly . lol - I prefer fancier designs - lighter colors . This is good old diagonal zebra in silver and black . Very manly ! ! : - ) My husband will NOT be ashamed to schlep this item in to the Doctors , ER , etc ... Other than that - and I wo n't ding any stars for a less than pleasing look with all this performance - five stars !	1
I put this to work to hold material for a committee I 'm on . I filled it to the brim and have carried it to several meetings . I like the file folder in front that is accessible from two sides , and it 's holding up to being carried and zipped and unzipped many times .	1
I received this product for free in exchange for giving an honest , unbiased evaluation.This is like an office on wheels . It 's holds quite a few different things , pockets for papers , pens etc.. plus there is a separate area for files . That in itself is a big asset for me . I was looking for something that is self containing that I could take to meetings or when on the go . I like the carrying handle , which is extremely practical.Another excellent feature is that you can access the file area separately from the inside binder area which contains binder paper and the various inside pockets . There are two zippers , and the using the one first zipper from the cover , you can go directly to the folder section.Then only thing that I am not sure of , is will it last for a good amount of time . The file folders are made of a thin plastic and since that is a major feature for me , I am hoping that with gentlle use and not overstuffing them , I will be able to use and appreciate this binder for quite sometime.It 's not the most expensive looking binder from the outside , but that is a minor issue , if it holds up , I will be a very happy camper .	1
I use notebooks for some of my work , but find them to be cumbersome and too basic ( not enough pockets ) , but this solved these issues and then some . There are multitudes of these types of products , but I found this one to be extremely handy . Kudos to good design as this notebook actually will open and lie flat . Others I 've used in the past only lie flat after its been broken in and softened from use . I like the design too , kind of contemporary and cool .	1
I work with high school students and see what the kids all carry around in their backpacks , and what a mess it can be . Disorganization is a real problem for many of them . However , the solution has to be super quick and easy for it to be effective . This is why I was interested in checking out this binder with files.In some ways it makes the mark : -Papers will not fall out and be lost or destroyed if they are placed in the internal folders and the binder is zipped.-This will hold a huge amount of loose leaf binder paper or work stuffed into the files as it is pretty big.-For the super-organized student , it keeps everything separated by tabbed folders , as well as having an internal pocket for smaller items so they can be accessed once opened to retrieve work.Unfortunately , a couple of these & # 34 ; pros & # 34 ; are also & # 34 ; cons & # 34 ; : -Unless a student is somewhat prepared to organize their work , they will likely just stuff the papers into the binder without bothering with the file folders , which may or may not result in any improvement over stuffing a backpack.-Because it is so large , it will barely fit into many backpacks along with much else . ( It does have a carrying handle , but I would be hard pressed to imagine any high schooler utilizing that to carry it ) .-The internal mesh pocket is okay for holding pens , pencils and small items , but would have been more effective on the outside of the binder so that you do n't have to unzip the entire thing to grab something quickly.Now , for a business person , I think it might work differently . The black and gray pattern is fairly understated but probably not professional enough to act as a briefcase replacement . But to run to a meeting or keep organized on the road , or to bring some work home , it would probably be great.Bottom line : for those who thrive on organization , this might be the ticket . But for those who like to streamline , it might not quite fit the bill .	1
Less bulky than other zipper binders.It has multiple compartments and a handle for carrying.I think this will hold up for the needs of my rising 5th grader . 2 inches should be plenty for her age/grade/assignments.It can fit in her back pack easily along with the other items she carriers to and from school daily .	1
Looks sturdy , but it seems so thick and big ! My son begins high school in a few months and a 2 inch binder was recommended . I did n't realize that 2 inches is rather large ! It will be interesting to see how this binder holds up , as my son can be rather tough on his school supplies . It will also be interesting to see if he actually uses and will need such a large binder ! I love that it has a zipper and love the file organization . Looking forward to seeing how it holds up !	1
My 10 year old daughter loves to haul everything in a binder , especially if she can put as much of her desk in it as possible . This holds papers , folder , gel pens , pencils , highlighters , knick knacks , and other assorted junk . It zippers easily but may not fit in all backpacks since it is larger . It is nicely organized and has two ways to open and access the contents .	1
My 13 year old does n't get tons of homework , but he likes to keep everything organized that he does get , and this does the job . The coolest thing is that you can access the accordion folder from either inside of the binder OR outside of it making it easy to access anything you put in it . We 've used it for a few months now and it 's been working beautifully and the outside handle has held up great as well ! !	1
My daughter uses this binder for school and it makes a lot of difference compared to carrying around those regular cardboard binders where the contents are spilling out . There are several excellent features here that make this Five-Star binder truly a good quality binder for school : - there is a six-pocket expanding plastic file to hold notes , worksheets , tests/term papers , etc.These pockets can be accessed from the outside of the binder ( separate zipper ) or from the inside.- the binder contains a large A4 sized zippered compartment on the inside that acts as a catch all for storing various papers and stationery.-there 's a pocket with a flap that is secured with a velcro clasp ( this can be used to store a cell phone and/or pens/pencils.-it comes with a handle for easy carrying.My family owns several products from Mead and we have been pleased with most of them . This binder is sturdy-looking but I assume as with everything else , it needs to be used with care as I do n't think it will hold up to rough use .	1
My high school son likes this binder . It looks nice and holds all the stuff he needs . I like how it has the according section so he can get organized . It looks really sturdy .	1
My son 's school does n't let them carry backpacks or bags throughout the day ( only to and from school . ) He is sort of a packrat and carries a lot of papers and pencils around in folders , binders similar to this , or those accordion files . He seems to prefer these zipper ones since he can keep other small items ( ipod , erasers , etc . ) inside without worrying about dropping them.This one is very nice . The seams are nice and strong . I also like the separate compartments to keep the other items from just being thrown in the binder . I like that it holds a lot , mainly because he sometimes uses 3-hole pocket folders . They keep separate classes ' items organized and eliminate the need for all the papers to be punched . But those folders can take up a lot of room . It would have been nice to have a few included with this.Overall he likes it very much . It is sturdy and hold a lot of his stuff . The zipper helps to make sure stuff does n't fall out . Plus it is attractive and design/color is appropriate for an older student .	1
The Five Star Zipper Binder Plus is certainly sturdy and well designed , but is in organization features that this binder really shines . There are not one but two different compartments containing file organizers , moreover , each file organizer contains 5 file transparent file separators for a total of ten different places to store your items for school . Each file organizer can be securely fastened separately from everything else so you do n't have to worry about your files falling out if you accidentally drop the binder while the main compartment is open . There is also a large internal pen and pencil holder and an internal compartment for storing a cell phone but which is big enough to store a scientific calculator also . Of course there is also a spacious two inch ring binder in the main compartment also . All in all , I would say this is a pretty cool binder , I only wish they had had these when I was at school !	1
There is a lot to like about this binder . It has a very convenient carrying handle . It has a all-the-way-around zipper to keep the contents secure from falling out or blowing away . There are six accordion style storage compartments . It has a large three-ring binder for loose-leaf paper . The two things I found to be lacking were that the back of the binder was very flimsy ( a sturdier backing would have been far more convenient as a brace when taking notes on the looseleaf paper ) , and the three-ring binder had an 0-clip rather than a D-clip . A D-clip is easier for storing a decent amount of loose-leaf paper . But to me , the positive aspects outweigh the negative and make this a very good binder to use .	1
This binder is a massively impressive binder , not one of the cheaply made ones that falls apart when it gets more than 50 pieces of paper in it . My kids like the compartment with tabs and dividers , and the sturdy outside pouch will fit a laptop or tablet snugly .	1
This binder is extremely roomy . I use it for my coupons and it has more than enough room for all of my coupons . It can fit up to 880 sheets ! Although I have n't had this binder for long ( only a few months ) , it seems to be extremely durable . I like the pocket on the inside left side of the binder where I can put my spare coupons . It would be nice if there was another pocket in the inside right side of the binder for extra storage . Overall , this is a great binder that I believe will last me for a while	1
This binder works for students or in a casual business environment . It 's well made , has nice neutral looks and works well . This one has a file folder which I think makes it more useful for a coupon clipping Mom , or at the office - rather for students . It 's large enough that this one folder will most likely meet all the needs of a middle schooler . There is plenty of room to organize several subjects .	1
This Five Star Zipper Binder is very neat . The right side holes several sheets of paper having the three hole punch in the paper . You an easily insert 100 pages and still have room for more ( the mfg says 800 sheets ) . . Just to the left of the three ring binder is a Velcro section that can be opened from this section or from the other zipper in the front . There are six expanding pockets in this section . Really very neat and accessible . Inside is a Velcro pencil or pen holder and there is also a zipper section where notes , etc . can be stored and become very secure.This entire folder is a little large as it measurers 13 by 12 1/8 inches and will actually become a little heavy to carry if you insert to capacity the number of sheets it will hold . There is a nice cloth handle on the side that you can use to carry . This case carriers a two year guarantee.Now my personal opinion . I think it is a little too large however some students might really like this as it can easily be & # 8221 ; stuffed & # 8221 ; with lots of materials and thus far appears to be rugged enough to absorb lots of abuse . Therefore I would recommend it for students however fir business purposes I probably would look for something a little smaller and lighter in weight .	1
This has all the features of a much more expensive product . The expanding files are strong and there is plenty of room for anything you need to put in them . Of course , it also allows for different subjects or reports to be separated.The design is unique as you can open the files or the binder independently . It is sturdy , has a nice appearance and a sturdy handle is just another plus.The zippers are heavy and work well .	1
This has a zip open file with clear dividers with tabs in it . the main compartment unzips and there are various pockets on one inside wall for pens and such . there is another zip open pouch on the inside that has more clear dividers with tabs built in . I like the color and handle and it seems to be good quality . also , nice big rings .	1
This is a binder . It does what all binders do : it binds . When it comes to selecting a binder , there are only a couple of things to consider . The first is whether it 's big enough . The second is if it 's durable . And finally the price . There are secondary factors such as color . This one is a good choice in all categories . I use it for work .	1
This is a great binder . Well constructed with ample room inside . The file folder section is accessible from the outside or inside if you have binder open , . The file folder section is roomy enough for my wife 's iPad with the flip cover on it . It makes nice little mini brief case . The handle is a little awkward , but not bad . The interior has pockets that can be used for a small cell phone and other miscellaneous items .	1
This is a great binder which includes two main sections : an accordion file section and a three-ring binder section . There is also an accordion section in the binder half . Additionally , there is a large zippered pocket that could be used for pencils and things , or a tablet . There is another pocket for a phone.The binder is roomy and made of material that could withstand the elements . Perhaps $ 19 may be a little on the expensive side , but this is definitely something that would be useful to a variety of ages .	1
This is a great system to use for keeping track of an ongoing project -- it has a thick 3-ring binder side that zips closed , and it also has two sections with accordion-style folder pockets for filing away papers . I really like this for keeping everything all in one place . It makes tracking the necessary paperwork for the project very simple -- no more stacks of regular binders and file folders to keep together.This would also make a great coupon binder system . The 3-ring side would work for baseball sleeves , and the file areas could hold store ads in one section and whole coupon inserts in the other . I used to use the binder coupon method myself , and I would have purchased this item for that purpose had I seen it back then ! So far it appears durable . We have not carried it outside of the house yet , but it appears that it will hold up to quite a bit of wear and tear . The zipper seems solid and the material is sturdy.Disclaimer : I received this product for free via the Amazon Vine program in exchange for posting my honest review . I always give my true opinions regardless of the source of the product .	1
This is a hard-core binder . If you have a traveling project and want to be able to keep absolutely everything in one place , organized and together , this is your guy . I will most likely use this over and over for theatre directing projects - script in the rings , related papers in the included 6 pocket file . A few handy pockets for pencils , highlighters , flash drives , CDs etc . For that purpose it is perfect . It even has a carry handle so that it can be a self-sufficient little office . And I have no doubt it will last through several projects.But it is too much for a student in my opinion . It would get too heavy to carry around it if contained everything it is capable of containing and it does n't even fit in a standard student backpack . I tried it in my daughter 's Hanna Anderson backpack ( a decent size , but not giant ) and it wo n't even zip when it is empty.. it 's too tall and wide .	1
This is a `` portmanteau '' product -- a binder ( with a 2 '' ring that holds 500+ 15 # sheets ) , a six-section file , and a storage area for pens and miscellaneous junk . If you 're the sort ( as I am ) who refuses to leave anything at home , this would be a good bet.In case you 're wondering ... there does n't seem to be room for even a small computer . It 's likely to be marred by the rings.Construction seems sturdy , and there 's a one-year guarantee.Recommended .	1
This is a standard two-inch binder with a zipper closure . The inside wall is semi-rigid plastic , so it 's relatively sturdy . It has a sturdy handle ( nylon with a slightly padded grip ) sewn into the exterior spine of the binder . It has two inside pockets . One is large mesh with a zipper closure for misc supplies and the other has a velcro flap closure for graphing calculators . The backing for those pockets has a velcro flap . When you open that flap , you find a six-section file . This file is accessible from the inside or outside of the folder . The outside access is through a second zipper closure . It feels pretty sturdy overall .	1
This is a very roomy binder , with pockets that can separate and hold a lot of different papers for different classes or projects . The zipper is good quality and unlikely to break easily . It 's clear that a fair amount of thought went into creating this binder and the manufacturer has used quality materials in its making because it has held up quite well . The cloth covering also has a nice feel to it .	1
This is perfect for my son 's high school requirements.Some of its features include : - It has 5 built-in dividers in one section . They have tabs with blank labels already in place.- There is a good-sized zippered pocket as well.- It 's dimensions are : 12 in . x 14 in . x 4in . thick.It 's light but so far is tough enough to stand up to my son 's daily beat downs of his school materials ! Great value for the price . Hoping it will last at least 2 years .	1
This is the perfect binder for someone who has to carry a lot with him or her . The 3 rings will accomodate a lot of paper and then the extra compartment will handle loose stuff . It does n't look quite as sharp as something with a leather finish , but the stripes keep it from looking like a CD wallet . I would not hesitate to use this in a professional setting .	1
Though I 'm many lifetimes away from being a student , I 'm always in the market for a great organizational tool . This thing may just be the best thing ever ! It 's big . The binder has 2 '' rings , which means it can comfortably organize documents with page protectors , three ring pouches , workbooks , or anything else you need to keep handy . There are slots and sleeves galore , places for files and folders , cards and small electronics.The exterior is a businesslike heavy duty fabric . I imagine it will last well beyond the year ACCO Brands says it will . It 's almost as tough as a briefcase , and you could probably use this instead of one . The only negative is that it 'll get pretty heavy when packed . That 's OK ; just use the reinforced handle for carrying.This would make a great gift for someone in outside sales , education , or any other occupation that requires easy access to lots of paper records , forms , or manuals . And for students , of course .	1
Traveling to computer classes in a mall to work on projects requires much organization . The 2 '' ring binder portion easily stores several printed software manuals which are useful for immediate reference and post-it notes . The 3 '' X 7 '' inside pocket is perfect for my hard drive , and the 7 '' X 11 `` mesh ( visible ) pocket can store numerous useful items such as pens , post-it notes , markers , and thumb drives . The file pockets store my printed records of online support issues and related contact information , receipts , and printed notes and projects as well as a small snack and water bottle . The zippers glide smoothly and the handle is an added bonus.I may order another of these binders for transporting family medical records . It is nice to have hard copies when asked questions at a medical office or hospital . A book or a Kindle would fit nicely in one of those file pockets .	1
Very good product ! ! Multiple pockets and holders for pens and pencils . Large pocket to & # 34 ; shove it all & # 34 ; into ( you know when you just need to shovesomething fast but securely.And the large ring holders in the back.You can put this into a backpack . Or carry it alone.There 's even a carry handle on the side ! The zippers are rugged.Zipper holders are metal.Made of a thick plastic that looks like it will not crack or break ( I 've not had it a full season yet ) butit looks like it can take a daily beating.Very nice ! !	1
When you & # 8217 ; ve got to lug around a lot of stuff , this Five Star 2-inch Zipper Binder is a veritable hand-held moving van.The exterior pocket hides an expanding file , and comes with 6 write-on tabs . It is also large enough to accommodate US standard-size file folders . This section can also be pulled through an opening for access from inside the binder . ( But please see the negative associated with this feature below . ) The interior consists of a fixed-in-place ring binder mechanism that can open with one hand , but requires two to close . A semi-stiff inner sleeve holds two compartments . One is an 11.75-inch deep mesh zippered pocket that can hold loose items such as markers and notepads . With an opening of 7.75 inches , it is too narrow to hold 8.5x11-inch papers . The other pocket has a Velcro tabbed enclosure that is 3.125 inches wide , and can hold items up to about 8.25 inches long . Some small items might slip right out of it.A few issues keep this roomy binder from being a perfect 5-star item . The exterior expanding file pocket is designed for access from both inside and outside . But this is awkward in practice from inside the binder ; it & # 8217 ; s a tight squeeze to pull the files through the opening . The interior mesh pocket is too deep to easily access loose items that congregate at the bottom . The back interior of the binder is a missed storage opportunity . Finally , the handle is so tight that large hands might have difficulty getting fingers under it.Still , worth a try . Great for corralling and protecting projects on the go .	1
While I am not a student nor do I have a job , I find this zipper binder very useful . I have some volunteer positions that produce some paperwork from agendas to committee reports . I like that I can access the files from the inside or the outside . I can stick books , notebooks and my computer tablet all in the middle and be ready to go to meetings . It has a nice handle so I can carry it like a briefcase . it seems to be well constructed and the zipper works well .	1
Wow , this a basically a portable office . 6 slot/5 divider file , accessible either from the outside or from inside the notebook , large ring binder that claims to hold 380 sheets of 15 lb . paper , a large zipper pouch just smaller that letter paper size , and a smaller pouch.It weighs 1 lb . 11 oz on my scale.The carry handle on the spine is a great idea.The inside of the notebook is that sturdy but slightly flexible plastic that they often make notebooks out of . The zippers are nylon.The cloth feels sturdy and I would expect it to last pretty well .	1
Wow , this is a great set-up . You can now carry your documents in folders , your notes in a 3 ring binder and your writing instruments all in one piece . The only caveat is that this is MUCH larger than a typical binder so be sure to check its measurements before buying it .	1
There are two main compartments : ( 1 ) The first compartment is without rings which is very useful to store documents , and receipts . ( 2 ) The second compartment has rings so the paper must be punched with three standard holes.Interestingly , there is a & # 8220 ; connecting door & # 8221 ; between the compartments and the & # 8220 ; door handle & # 8221 ; is a Velcro strap . A customer posted a clear photo of the compartments and the door.It can be improved by having two zippers instead of one .	1
My middle schooler carries way too much stuff in his binder every year , and used to go through a binder each semester . They 'd just fall apart . We started buying the Mead 5-star binders and they definitely last a lot longer . So when this one became available through Vine , I grabbed it for next year . His current Mead binder has lasted through the entire school year ( we have 4 weeks left ) and I am expecting this one to be just as durable.This 2 '' binder has a nice feature in its 6-pocket expanding file , which can be accessed from both inside and outside the binder . This is great for when the teacher hands out papers at the end of class and for papers the students need to remember to show mom and dad at home . They can put their papers into the divided files without having to open the entire notebook . From the inside , this section is accessible behind a velcro tab.On the inside cover is a large zippered pocket , which I did n't notice the first time I opened it because it blends into the background . But it is a mesh , see-through pocket that will hold plenty of school supplies . There 's also a velcro-tabbed pocket that would hold a smart phone or calculator.The 2 '' rings are round and have a capacity of 880 sheets . The only thing missing is a folder pocket for loose sheets in the back of the notebook , but with the front expanding files , you can slip any loose pages in there.For the money , it 's a great value . It would be nice if it had a zippered pocket on the outside for quick access to a needed pen , pencil or eraser , and that 's really its only flaw . Otherwise , it 's stylish , will hold everything your student needs , and it should last a full school year , if not more .	1
The first thing you notice about this is its strikingly attractive black and gray colors with a nice fabric finish . The next thing you notice ( and my favorite feature ! ) is it has a carrying handle . That is really nice since this is a great substitute for a small attach & eacute ; case . Since this looks professional , it is even more suitable as such a substitute . One unique feature is a multi-compartment file ( with six compartments ) , which is accessible from both the smaller zippered compartment and from the main compartment . The main compartment also has a large zippered pocket and a smaller Velcro closed compartment for pens and such . As I said , the main compartment also has a Velcro closure that accesses the other small compartment with the multi-compartment file . The ring mechanism has a stiff spring and works well ( always open and close the rings with the lever tabs , never pulling or pushing the rings directly ; that avoids bending the mechanism , causing the rings to separate ) . This comes in a few colors , both costing the same .	1
The Five Star 2-Inch Zipper Binder and Multi-Access File with Handle is made for the busy student ! Be it Middle School , High School or college , or even for a project or job that requires this variety of paperwork , this binder can hold so much and may be the right one ! Two sets of tabbed , divided files , sturdy ring binder , pen pockets , zipper , velcro tabs ... so many compartments , all secure inside and with a carrying handle . I just have to think how much I would have enjoyed one of these when I was in school long ago .	1
The front of this binder has a zippered section with 5 plastic divider sections for loose papers . The main zippered section has three-rings , a pencil pocket , a phone pocket and a velcro fastener that opens the divider section on the front.The fact that you can open the divider section from the front of the binder and inside the binder is not a plus to me . You 'll need to decide which direction you want the papers to go , so you will only see the front of the papers from either the front zippered area , or from inside the binder . It would have made more sense to make it one way or the other.The inside feels like a heavy-duty cardboard , or a thin plastic , it 's hard to tell . The outside is cloth with thin padding . It fits letter sized paper.There is a handle on the side so it can be carried like a case . I 'm not sure that 's really practical . This is a more masculine binder , so I ca n't see any guys carrying their binder like purse.This sturdy case will last the school year .	1
This 2 inch capacity zipper binder has an interior , 6-pocket expanding file on the inside with 5 tabs with blank labels . ( We call them accordion files at work . ) Although we prefer placing it inside a backpack , it comes with a nice carrying handle which is a nice touch . Check the interior of your backpack though if you intend to carry it inside because this is a large zipper binder . ( 13 1/4 inches by 12 1/8 ) . There is no interior pocket on the inside of the back cover in case you are used to having that from a 2 inch capacity standard binder.Priced below $ 20 , this product is very comparable to similar products I have seen in my local office supply at closer to $ 30 . All in all , this is a good product at a fair price .	1
This is a good product . The file folder is internal , but it is easily accessible from either the inside , or the outside , of the zipper binder.I have only one suggestion that would have allowed for me to give this product 5 stars instead of 4 . I do not like the wide open space inside the binder 's & # 34 ; mesh & # 34 ; internal pocket . If this pocket had a place for pens & pencils , flash drives , and various other small , school related items , it would be a darn near perfect product.My Swiss-gear backpack utilizes a similar sized space with a much more organized set of available pockets , pen holders and even little compartments with Velcro closure for flash drives . This small section within my backpack is the same size as the mesh compartment on the Five Star 2-inch zipper binder , Swiss gear just did a better job with the various storage compartments.The Five Star Binder is well made . I like the color and the pattern on the front . The binder , itself , is not heavy at all and that is a big bonus for me.You might want to consider a small Grid-It organizer to place inside of the mesh pocket to keep your stuff organized , but this will add a little weight to the Binder .	1
This is probably the nicest moving box I have ever seen . I strongly recommend it to those of you who are in the market for a medium sized moving box . You can write your name on it with a : felt tip marker . You can even describe the contents on the box on the outside if you so desire . I do n't think you 'll be disappointed . Order this moving box before they are all gone . Nice one..highly recommended .	1
No where near as large as it appears in the picture , so make sure you check the dimensions to ensure you are getting the size you need . The actual box is descent and arrives flat , so you 'll have to fold them into shape . The price is actually really good considering that you are getting twenty boxes , and the label printed on the side is handy for clearing marking what 's in each box . Overall , this is a good buy .	1
Not much to say except that this box is constructed well , and held up well in a move of some old books to storage.~ae~	1
These are nice quality boxes . They work for both moving items or just storing your things . There is a section on the side where you can write in the list of items you 're storing inside of them , which is handy whether you 're moving or storing things in them ! Tapes holds well to them and they are a nice size for putting all kinds of things in them.Obviously filling a box this large with books or paperwork will make it next to impossible to lift , but they 're great for putting most other household items inside . The only thing I would change about them is including some optional handles on them . A box this size can be a bit awkward to lift without something to grip onto . Some boxes come with a perforate handle hole with the cardboard still inside it . So you can pop the cardboard out if you want to use the handles , or leave it in if you do n't want any openings on the box . Adding optional handle openings would make these great boxes even better .	1
This is a nicely sized box , ideal for storage or moving . It is not heavy duty and is best of storing and/or transporting light to medium weight items . Although there is a chart imprinted on the side the features are limited . You must use tape to close and reinforce the bottom . It is a basic box with no handles but is serviceable and of nice quality . Recommended .	1
This medium box is perfect for looser linens and larger items that are n't completely dense ( or super heavy ) . I would n't want to fill this bad boy up with heavy books and move it without taking care ( as I do with almost any box ) . it starts to get too heavy and not only be hard to move ... but I believe structurally unsound unless it was put on a wheeled cart and dropped off precisely where it would be unpacked .	1
This is a generous size box and easy to put together . I really like the added feature of the room locator information with details of what 's in the box . Who does n't have a taped up box in their garage that you wonder what 's in it ? ? This is convenient and worth every penny . Recommended !	1
What can you say ? It 's a box . The ones I got I think were intended for dishes and other glassware , so they 're a bit thicker . Which is fine . A box is a box and when you 've moved 7 times in 13 years like I have , it 's a good idea to keep spare boxes around for when it 's time to bug out . Granted you can go down to your local Home Depot or Lowe 's home improvement center to find this same box for less than two bucks , so I 'm not sure how much of a deal this is.That is all .	1
I got a chance to test this box out during a move and I can say that it lived up to all the functionality that you could expect from a box . It is not a premium box by any means but decent quality , perhaps a little less rugged than would be ideal . For me it ended up holding clothes . The box is big enough that if you were to put books or dishes into it , it would end up pretty heavy , and I do n't know that the cardboard is substantial enough for heavy loads . Also with books it would have pushed the limits of most people 's backs.We did fill out the room information on the side , although for most boxes we used we got away with just a quick kitchen or bedroom scrawled on the side which was fine . But it was a nice touch.Summary : The price is good for the amount of boxes that come in a bundle , but due to size they were limited to certain lighter , packable things . But for things like clothes , it worked great for me .	1
I got these for storage , and an eventual move . The great thing about them is they are not too expensive and they are fairly sturdy . But I would only recommend them for light stuff - clothing and light kitchen stuff.Anything heavier , I would use hard side totes .	1
These were easy to assemble . They are the perfect size ( medium ) for moving without being to heavy and bulky for me to carry ... I am an older single woman , healthy but not a powerhouse . I move VERY frequently , so I know my boxes.The check off boxes were nice . They 're easy to write on . This is a reasonable price . It is also extremely convenient to have them delivered to your door rather than go pay twice as much at a bigbox store or 3 times as much at a Uhaul store .	1
I moved a few times while in the military and this cardboard box ( which came delivered in a cardboard box ) reminded me of the many boxes I had for clothing or linen . The cardboard is medium grade -- not too thick and not too thin -- and because of the height one ca n't fit heavy items in this box . Other reviewers complained this box was not meant for box . No kidding ! Boxes designed to carry books are usually no more than 2'x2'x2 ' and this box certainly does n't fit that description . Use secure tape to fasten the bottom and this would be one standard , sturdy box .	1
At about $ 1.50 each this is a good deal if you are moving . Most people ask others for boxes when moving from now on I 'm just buying them these . The printed on label is also nice and clear and helpful for organising .	1
I 've moved many things many times at many locations . The number of boxes needed always exceed original estimates . Good quality boxes are quite expensive . These boxes are n't top quality or near it , but they 're big and cheap . They 're ideal for lightweight but big things .	1
Paying money for moving boxes has always seemed unnecessary and wasteful , but that 's just me . Then recently I helped a friend move who did just that and I have to say that because it was so organized we got it done quickly and it was very easy to sort . The size of these boxes are perfect for so many household items and a package of 20 which is how they are sold is nice . So while I may not be the target buyer for these boxes , I can definitely see how they can be worth their weight in gold when moving to the right buyer .	1
These boxes measure 18 inches by 18 inches by 16 inches and they are about the average size for moving . They come in a pack of 20 boxes and it 's really a very reasonable price per box . They are very strong and sturdy and can take a beating when packaged and taped correctly . I really like the printed section on the side where you select which room the contents belong to and you can even list the contents on the box . This would come in handy right after moving because I know it 's often days before you have unpacked everything . This way you can see what is in each box without opening it . That way when you are looking for certain items you can find them relatively easy .	1
This medium sized cardboard box is easy to assemble , sturdy , and versatile . Just fold the flaps together and secure with a sturdy packaging tape . Medium size can hold a wide variety of items but the strength of the box bottom is highly dependent on the strength of the tape used . For heavier items , I 'd use duct tape . Convenient room selector printed on the outside ; check off the appropriate room and label the contents for easy organization . These boxes are affordably priced . Consumers on a limited budget could ask for free , discarded cardboard boxes from friendly local businesses .	1
I like to have boxes on hand , especially for things I no longer want in the house or seasonal items that need to be tucked away . At 18 1/8 x 18 x 16 '' these boxes are n't huge , but just the right size to handle and move easily . The larger ones can be quite bulky and unless you have something in them that is lightweight , they can be problematic.FEATURES : & # 9658 ; Sold in bundles of 20 & # 9658 ; 18x18x16 Medium Moving Boxes With Room Indicator & # 9658 ; Ideal for Books , DVD 's , Blu-Rays , VHS tapes , CD 's , Records , & # 9658 ; Kitchen Goods , Bathroom Goods , Small Appliances , and tools & # 9658 ; Strong 32 ECT Construction with 40-60 % Recycled MaterialsThe price is actually quite reasonable for the quality and number of boxes you 're getting . Many times I 've headed off to Costco to select a few , but they are n't specifically made for storage , but rather for transporting items . I like the fact that there 's a room labeler to provide a bit of consistency for labeling . Instead of everyone labeling in odd spots , it 's easy to know where to look . The boxes are solid , the price is right , and they are shipped right to your door . Ca n't get any better than that.SCOTCH SHIPPING/PACKING TAPES : Scotch Long Lasting Moving & Storage Packaging TapeScotch Heavy Duty Shipping Packaging TapeScotch Sure Start Shipping Packaging TapeScotch Lightweight Shipping Packaging TapeSCOTCH TAPE DISPENSER : Scotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser	1
When you 're a college student -- and even afterwards -- you go to the local liquor store or grocery store to get boxes for moving . Yeah , they often do n't have a lid or closure on the top , but they 're the right price.When you 're -- ahem -- older -- you invest in the adult version of boxes , and this is an excellent one . It 's sturdy and has a check off box for which room something will go into , along with info about what the box contains . You can do this with a wine box , but it 's not as pristine looking or easy to see.I recommend this box for professionals and people who are moving a lot of stuff .	1
I ordered this item from the Vine program because I find myself in the fun situation of trying to complete a move . ( I did not , however , expect to only receive one box from the program . ) It is a medium-duty box , so you would not want to pack anything too heavy in it , such as car batteries or hard-cover books , even tho the size is appropriate for both of those items . I think Amazon 's price is appropriate for 20 boxes of this size/quality .	1
Getting quality boxes might be something that is overlooked for a move , but it can make your move that much less painless.These boxes are of good quality , of a good size ( not too big , not too small ) , and have room/item area right on the side to mark them .	1
These are good quality cardboard boxes for moving or storage . The 18 x 18 x 16 nearly cubic dimensions optimize storing multiple boxes in a given space and make them easier to carry . The boxes have printed labels so you can describe he contents . The ECT ( edge crush test ) rating is 32 pounds per square inch . It seems most boxes for electronics have sturdier cardboard . There are no handles and the bottom and tops need to be taped . An easily opened and closed lid would have been beneficial . These boxes are not high quality , but if the price is less than others , they may be OK for your needs .	1
This moving box comes in packages of 20 . I only received one for review , but I used it in two recent back-to-back moves . The box is sturdy enough to comfortably fill with light and medium-weight items . However , the box will not work for books , nor will it work for heavy kitchen appliances ( think mixer stands and things with heavy bases ) or pots and pans . The box held up for two moves and looks like it can handle a couple more , so the durability is there . The top cardboard flaps of the box are also fused together in a couple spots . This helps you keep the box open when putting contents in there the first time . Just note that you will have to cut or rip those fused areas in order to close the box and tape it up ( I 'd suggest cutting it , as one side that I ripped also partially ripped a flap ) .One thing I did n't like about the box was the labeling grid . It 's great that there is a `` mini-form '' for you to fill out on the side of the box so that you know what room it comes from and what the contents are , but why not put that mini-form on all sides of the box ? As anyone who moves a lot knows , it really helps to have boxes clearly labeled on all sides.Overall , this is a standard , medium-sized moving box that will get the job done . It 's nice to have a pack of twenty , because it makes stacking the boxes in a moving truck a lot easier . So if you get a competitive price , then I highly recommend them .	1
Initially I thought , 'who would buy a box ? '' but then again , I 'm a product of my parents who believed banana boxes were the answer to most questions in life . But seriously , these are a very nice size ... easy to pop into place or break down again for storage when not in use . Strong enough to carry a substantial load or be re-used . All in all , a solid , easy to use , re-usable box !	1
I 've moved across country and was shocked at how expensive moving supplies were . I thought the moving company alone would be the major cost , but I was wrong . Comparatively , these boxes are about average . They cost roughly the same as if getting them through a warehouse store . The box is sturdy , but probably would n't be used for multiple moves . They are generally a great size for everything . I used these boxes for dishes , bathroom supplies , books , and DVDs without any problems . Currently , they are sitting in a storage unit and I feel secure that they will not fall apart .	1
This 3 cubic foot , 18 1/8 x 18 x 16 inch box is a solid execution of the standard medium moving box . I find this size of box the most helpful in general for moving . While dense objects like books and dishes will require a small box , a medium box can be used for everything from carefully wrapped glasses to clothing to toys . On one side there is a large box with space to check off which room your are relocating the contents to and plenty of room for writing a variety of other descriptive notes by hand .	1
I received this box to review as part of the vine program . The box was shipped inside another box , it is very sturdy and built well . It has quick location boxes to allow you to check where the box goes when moving . Overall good quality .	1
I do quite a bit of shipping so I 'm very familiar with cardboard boxes . This cardboard box is of good quality . The sides are all done squarely and evenly and fit well together . They come flat packed and all you need to do is to fold it out and tape with sealing or packing tape . You can move usual household items with this no problem .	1
It 's just a box ... right ? From past experience , we often make mistakes with moving boxes . Getting the discards from grocery stores and such often result in damage upon arrival , and even for storage , they can be a disaster.TheseThe Packaging Wholesalers 3 Cubic Feet 18-1/8 x 18 x 16 Inches Medium Moving Box with 32 ECT Room Locator Check-Off Box ( BS181816MMB ) are good for short or long term storage .

A better choice would be theThe Packaging Wholesalers 1.5 Cubic Feet 16-3/8 x 12 5/8 x 12 5/8 Small Moving Box with 32 ECT Room Locator Check-Off Box ( BS161212SMB ) , as books and magazines can be far heavier than one might think . This size also stacks well if your books need to be in storage for awhile.11/28/2013	1
This lot of boxes provides a decent bargain for spacious , single-ply boxes . These are nothing fancy , but they do hold up well for boxed items , stuffed animals , bedding and other lightweight bulk . The convenient room locator check boxes save writing , where a quick check will make it easy to plan the order of loading and unloading . The quality is quite satisfactory for the price .	1
Not apparent from the listing ( at least immediately ) is that each order equals 20 boxes . The boxes are of reasonable quality , but are fairly thin and lightweight . These are good general purpose boxes for moving , but I would n't expect a good result if filling one completely with hardcover books . The exterior has a check off room locator grid , but - let 's be honest - nobody is going to use that . Everyone just scribbles on the box with marker .	1
Decent moving boxes are so predictably same-y that it & # 8217 ; s a tough assignment to try to compare this product from The Packaging Wholesalers to Uhaul , or any other quality brand out there . I hasten to stress & # 8220 ; quality & # 8221 ; & # 8211 ; there are a lot of so-so moving boxes out there , and if you are going to settle for these you might as well haunt your local warehouse store or whichever retailers out there that do still give out boxes for the asking & # 8211 ; though not many do , these days.The box in question here is medium strong , sufficient for its overall size , though not premium quality for stacking in long term storage . The requisite little joins between the two pairs of flaps at the top of the box are there ; these keep the flaps from collapsing down while you are trying to pack the box . And there & # 8217 ; s a grid full of boxes to check on the side , to show where you want the box to go in your new residence.It & # 8217 ; s a reasonable price for a bundle of 20 , and if you don & # 8217 ; t & # 8217 ; have a truck to haul a bunch of boxes home , delivery to your door with free shipping from Amazon is a real godsend . ( Says the agnostic . )	1
Nice strong moving boxes- I just completed a short term move and these boxes were awesome- I was able to take down and will use for my next cross country move in a few months- They are in great shape , even being banged around a bit- They are quite expensive if I had to purchase , but you get what you pay for . Very good quality	1
These are really ideal size moving boxes , and the & # 34 ; check off & # 34 ; room identification is a real plus ( also , it 's clear and bold ) . However , you do have to assemble them yourself ( of course ! ) and they do not come with tape or adhesive . It would have been nice to have had some strong adhesive on the boxes already or some other type of reinforcement including .	1
I loaded up the box with books and could fit plenty inside . It is sturdy and I could label which room the box was to be put in an and was easy to put together .	1
These are medium-duty moving boxes , well-made but without any special features or frills other than the pre-printed labelling area ( which is not really needed in my opinion ) and partially-recycled fiber content & # 8212 ; which is a big plus.I have tried other moving boxes which did n't need tape to assemble or close and which had comfortable handholds , which are useful features when moving . On the other hand , these will seal out dust to protect the contents for storage and are less expensive . Both fill a need.Tip : Check the dimensions before ordering ; these boxes come in different sizes and the size may not match the photograph .	1
If you 're moving or need to store a lot of stuff , do n't do what I usually do ... make a trip to the local liquor store to get as many wine boxes as I can fit in my car , or the grocery store for banana boxes . That never really works out so well.When you can buy a good quantity of storage/moving boxes for a reasonable price why go through the hassle of the alternative I 've described ? These are packed 20 to a box and are medium sized ( 18 1/8 x 18 x 16 '' ) corrugated cardboard boxes capable of holding up to 65lbs . They are not self sealing boxes though so you do need to also have a supply of packaging tape to seal them securely.I ca n't really say there is any negatives to this box . It works and I particularly like that the top flaps stay open while you pack the box because there are very small cardboard connections between the flaps that hold them open until you 're ready to close it up at which time you simply and easily tear the strip to allow you to close the flaps .	1
The box measures 18 1/8 x 18 x 16 although it looks much larger in the photo on the product page . So , it might be wise to double check the measurements rather than rely on the picture of what appears to be a very short woman holding the box . I do a lot of shipping , and the cardboard density of this box is medium to heavy weight in density . It is very sturdy.Given the size , it will be awkward to handle if filled with heavy items , so it probably would be best to use with nothing that will weigh over twenty or so pounds once the box is fully packed . High quality product .	1
The cardboard is strong and the cuts are clean and precise . I did n't need the Room Locator feature because I used mine for shipping a large item . Speaking of large , take a look at the model holding the empty box . She could probably fit inside the box . I 'm pointing this out because as moving boxes go this is on the big side which means when filled it 's going to be heavy.My advice is to get this box for clothing and other light items but also get some smaller boxes for heavy items like books.BTW : As a Vine reviewer , I only got one box and I used mine to ship a giant steel lobster pot !	1
This is a medium sized box with a label so you can write out what you 've put inside the box . There are no handles , which means you should not fill this up with anything too heavy because it will be hard to lift . But otherwise it 's just a box , nothing really fancy about it , perfect for moving and can probably stand up to a few moves if you do n't abuse it too much .	1
Great box for moving or storing stuff in the garage . I also have to say will also be a great box for shipping heavy items , because this box does not tear easily . This box sets up immediately and folds completely flat . Overall great boxes .	1
This is a basic box-good , sturdy cardboard . It 's easy to label b/c it has a nice graphic on the side to write in . It holds basic household items-IE DVDs , games , linens , etc . If you want to pack heavier items-dishes , books , etc . than this is NOT the box for that ! It folds flat nicely for use again . Overall , it 's a decent moving box , but not for those heavy household items !	1
A box is a box is a box -- however when packing not all boxes are equal.This is a great box for bedding or medium weight items ( like bulky kitchen items ) Due to it 's size not ideal for books or very heavy items .	1
Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program ( What 's this ? ) This is a basic moving box with medium strength and medium thickness . It is simple and easy to assemble except you need to cut a portion of the top flaps to fold them down . The boxes are printed on the front for easy labeling . You can check the rooms where the box should go to - very helpful when hiring a moving company . There is also a portion to write the contents , very handy when you try to find an item during the move and needs it right away . There is no cutout on the sides to make a handles . Otherwise , it is a good box at a competitive price.If you look at the picture ( at the time this review was posted ) with the superstrong lady , that is not how this box looks like . The dimension indicated is more accurate right though - it is more of a square box and not a rectangular tall box .	1
This is a nice pack of solid boxes - good for moving or storage . You 'll need some sturdy tape to assemble , but once done they hold a great deal of items . I 'm in the process of getting ready for a move and I love the room check-off on the box . It 's much neater than my usual anywhere scrawl with a permanent marker.They are n't as sturdy as some of the boxes I 've used , so I did n't use this for my heavier items - I used it for clothes and my daughters far too copious amount of toys and stuffies . They are also nicely sized - perfect for carrying.All in all , this is a good value pack of boxes !	1
There 's not much to stay about moving boxes unless something is wrong . These are good basic moving boxes and they are well priced . Less expensive than if you buy through the moving company . Some people mention the lack of handles , but I have moved a dozen times , and there are never handles on moving boxes . You want the box to be solid so it does n't get stuff in it during the move .	1
I just finished painting my office and had to clear the room out so I used this product to help me through the mess . Great-sturdy and firm-not cheap box material.Would use again !	1
This is basically a moving box with a moving label already printed on the box . The big advantage is you have a preprinted label on the box so it won & # 8217 ; t come off and it gives you plenty of space to list what the box contains . The only negative is if you plan on moving again soon the label can & # 8217 ; t be removed and replaced with a new one since it is printed on the box.One part of the label allows you to list the room in which the objects belong . Eleven room possibilities are listed and there is space to write two more room names . The other portion of the label allows for a name , order number , the contents of the box , special instructions and the packers initials . It also has a spot for an inventory tag . There is plenty of room to write on the label and it is easy to see.I noticed on the bottom of the box the marking & # 8220 ; Gross WT LT 65 LBS. & # 8221 ; I don & # 8217 ; t know if that means that is the weight limit for the box but I thought I would mention it since that is important if it is the weight limit . The product dimensions are listed under technical details above.The only drawback to this is that the label can only be used once since it is on the box . On the other hand if you want to reuse the box you can write the information on a different part of the box .	1
Most of our moving and storage boxes have come from moving companies from each of our frequent relocations . We always save them to help other people move and to store things in the garage and attic . These boxes are very similar to the ones that the big name van lines and moving companies use . It is the same 3 cubic feet size that they use for clothes and lighter items like that . You can use it for books , as long as you tape it really well and are willing to lift a very heavy box.This is a good quality , strong moving box , at a very good price for a bundle of 20 . We recommend them for your next move or for long-term storage .	1
There 's not a whole lot to say about this box . It works for storing things . It is fairly sturdy , but it is large so it 's best for storing light-weight items like clothes . Works great ! I like the checklist on the side . Instead of writing out what room the box belongs in , all you have to do is put a check next to the words already printed on the box .	1
This is a good box . It 's not nearly as large as the one in the product image , so read the measurements carefully if you order them . The box is sturdy and it 's a good size for what I needed it for . I like the label that lets me check off contents , making it a lot easier to keep track of where things are .	1
This box is a good size for carrying , especially if it is filled with light to medium weight items . The cardboard feels a bit lighter than some I have used so I would not use this box for heavy items such as books or dinnerware.The room identification printed on the side is convenient , but if you move a lot and you want to use the box for a different room it might get a bit confusing as to which room it goes into . I just use a black marker and plain stick on labels when I move with information as to what 's inside the box and where it goes . Easy enough to reuse the box with new labels on top of the old ones ! It used to be easy to get clean cardboard boxes from a grocery or drug store , but now they keep them for recycling and the option would be to go to one of the large cross country truck rental places to buy boxes . I think these boxes are a great alternative to doing that because you get more for your money considering the price of the rental company boxes keeps going up .	1
I like the size of these boxes . They come in hand for moving or just plain storing many different types of things such as clothes , linens , toys , stuffed animals , media material , games and much more . I love the fact that they come in bundles of 20 because we all know a few boxes never seem to be enough . 20 is a good amount for this size.I find them to be pretty sturdy . I would n't pack too terribly much weight in them . I would n't put books , glasses or anything of that weight into them . Not sure I 'd trust them for that heavy of stuff.The & # 34 ; Room Indicator & # 34 ; box is nice but how hard is it to simply pick up a permanent marker and just write on a normal box where it goes or whatever else you would like noted on the outside of the box ? I think these boxes are a nice size and they 're pretty durable . I 'd recommend them for moving or storage .	1
These are good boxes for both moving and storage . They say they are perfect for CD 's , books , DVD 's , Blu-Rays , VHS tapes , and records . The box is really not strong enough to be filled with books . It is sturdy , but not that sturdy.The size is good for objects that are not heavy weight , unless you put them on the bottom and lighter weight objects on top . This is a nice size box for medium to light weight objects.I 've found this to be a perfect size to store some of the toys that my grandchildren have outgrown or grown tired of . It seals well with packing or duct tape .	1
I have found that the compatible ink cartridges work just as well as the manufacturer 's brand . I was very nervous at first about purchasing non-manufacturer inks , but no more , I will continue to do so .	1
Bought these but they are backups and ca n't say much about them . They look fine . The price seemed right . Go Steelers .	1
Purchased from OCProducts and fulfilled by Amazon . Excellent price here on Amazon . These cartridges came filled completely which is clearly visible since they are made of a clear plastic . Not like the half filled OEM catridges . The ink seems to be just like what the OEM Cannon ones print like .	1
These cartridges worked great in my MX922 and were considerably less expensive than the Canon cartridges . I would recommend them to anyone who is tired of paying the outrageous prices charged by the printer manufacturers .	1
I have a Canon Pixma MX 922 printer , and these ink cartridges are completely compatible with it , serving as a replacement for PGI-250 , and CLI-251XL series Canon ink cartridges . You get two sets of the standard five cartridges ( large black , small black , cyan , magenta , and yellow colored inks ) for about $ 27 , which is a substantial savings over buying Canon cartridges . Unfortunately , in what seems to be a continuing trend , these ink cartridges are physically smaller than the ones for previous Pixma printers , like theiP4600 , which means they contain less ink.Printer manufacturers look to make their money selling replacement ink cartridges , which typically sell at premium prices . Two sets of Canon 's replacement ink cartridges cost about $ 122 , which is more than I paid for my printer ! So it 's fortunate for consumers , that generic ink cartridges are available . My MX 922 uses a lot of ink , so my savings will be substantial with this product.When Canon added a chip to reduce the sale of generic cartridges , the manufacturers of generics were able to adapt , and still provide Pixma owners with a cheaper option . Unfortunately , the price of generics also seems to be trending upwards , but they still remain a much more economical option than Canon 's very expensive cartridges .	1
A great basic wall organizer . It has nice gussets to allow you to put in several folders or papers in each pocket . Stitching at corners is strong and does n't feel like it will tear ( like so many wall pockets end up doing ) . The price feels just right for the product . I do n't use it in a class , I use it to organize folders for work ... and it serves it 's purpose well.The only gripe was the extreme odor that came with it , that plastic smell that takes a while to disappear . Ick !	1
When I opened the package , I searched high and low for the `` hangers '' . There are none ! A slight setback since I envisioned hanging this on the back of a door ( like my shoe bag ) . Oh , well , I 'll still put it on the back of a door as planned . I can get a couple of the clothing hooks from the dollar store ... the kind that hooks over the top of the door . I 'm ok with that ! I can see how a mother would find this perfect for a child . For me ? I 'm 79 now and have plans to use it for temporary storage of insurance papers and such that come in the mail . Once the papers have been organized , I can file them in the normal place . I will also use it to store stationery items and small tools . This is something that can be used throughout your home . One will not be enough ! This is very strurdy and you need not fear that it 'll wear out . I 'm really pleased with this storage bag ! It 's a handy place to keep cds and dvds also !	1
While I can see that this would be ideal for a classroom or office , it 's also equally as handy to have around the home.The grommets allow the storage unit to hold up well and be easily mounted on a wall . But they also allow the unit to be made with fabric and still hold up well -- this is key for the piece looking very attractive.The pockets are clear so that you can easily tell what 's inside and they are large enough to hold a full piece of paper folded in half , as far as width goes.This is great for mail because you can label it many different ways -- you can label by immediate bills , ones in the future , or by family member , or by business and personal bills , etc ... But need it for the office or classroom and your needs will be different and yet the core needs are the same -- it looks good and it is made well and it 's easier to see at a glance what 's in each pocket , making it great for kids and adults alike.You could even organize homework and class needs ... its uses are ongoing .	1
This organizer is wonderful ! The unit is made of a thick , durable material , and the 3 holes at the top are reinforced with metal rings . So it will definitely stay put where you want it to be ! The pockets expand pretty far , and there are clear areas where you can slide in labels . The unit does NOT come with tags to use as labels ; you will have to cut up index cards or paper to size.From the picture , the pocket size is a little misleading . I thought they were larger ... I did n't really look at dimensions , so it 's my own fault and not something to rate the product down for . So just realize that something like a binder would NOT fit in the pockets . Novels , supplies ( small scissors , etc ) would be great , though . In my classroom , I use it for very small objects ( flash drives ) , which fit wonderfully ! Great product- a must for any person needing organization- not just teachers !	1
It 's a little smaller than I thought it would be but it has turned out to be a great organizer for my craft sales . I make small craft projects and sometimes have to work on several at one time . This wall organizer is great for storing unfinished projects while I work on others . It would also be great to store kids toys , crayons/markers , baby supplies , craft supplies , etc .	1
I love this storage product ! It looks nice and so far seems quite sturdy . I deducted a star because I expected the labels to be included from the way the product is pictured , but they are not . Not a huge deal , but enough that I could n't bring myself to give this 5 stars.I 'm thinking very seriously of purchasing additional ones . Because I got this with the plan to use it much like it is pictured here ... pencils , pens , colored pencils , markers , permanent markers , crayons ... But once I got it , it seemed perfect for the bedroom of my youngest two , where it can hold hair ties , spare change , crayons , etc . And then , it would be amazing for the bedroom of my big boys , where it could hold their merit badge cards for scouts , neckerchief slides , pens , glasses , wallets , who knows what else.Very versatile product and it looks nice . Just wish I did n't have to cut out my own labels .	1
I 'm using this in my half-bath where I put on my makeup and do my hair . I ran out of room for all my cosmetics and hair-care products and was contemplating using a shoe bag for my stuff.This actually works out much better for this use since the pockets are not as deep as a shoe bag , they hold my products in a way that makes them easier to identify.It fits in a fairly small space nicely too . The ultra vibrant blue color is a little off-putting in my bathroom , but I can live with it since it does such an admirable job of storing all my stuff !	1
With 9 small see-through mesh pockets , this wall storage spread is perfect for my kid 's room - I 've always had so much trouble getting him organized , and this proves to be a fabulous way of putting away all the small things he 's got in his room , from small LEGO creations to pencils to coins , etc.The pockets are small and shallow , so do n't expect to put books in these . Also , the product does not come with nails or hooks so you have to find and install those on your own . Also , it does not come with labels - the packaging is a little ambiguous on that but no , you have to create your own labels . But these are just totally minor issues.The product is solidly made and easy to use ( once you remember its limitations ) . Each pocket has a clear plastic label compartment . It 's flexible and light . I plan to buy a few more of these , and even use one of them to store away my computer cables like USB cables and HDMI cables and earphones . Even good for camera batteries . Very versatile .	1
Easy to install , very sturdy and can hold a surprising amount of smaller items . I installed this into my daughters bedroom . It was a perfect option for our little artist . She is able to keep all of her coloring , painting , gluing and cutting accouterments within arms reach of her easel . Also it has helped us keep her room cleaner than we had it before with the various boxes and cases we had her other stuff in.Pros : + Easy to install+ Easy to set up+ Holds a good deal of items+ SturdyCons : - None really . We really love this wall storage solution	1
Bright , sturdy and easy to mount , these wall storage pockets are very handy indeed . There is a pocket for a label on each gusseted pocket and good strong grommets to hang it by . This setup can tuck away a great deal of clutter .	1
Good quality construction , helpful organization aide for the class . Not sure this would be as helpful with the very youngest of students , but it 's great for older classrooms that have class sets of 'tools ' . Of course if you have a class sized north of 20 you might run into some space issues if you need to stock one of everything.I might considering having 4 of these in my class some day so kids can be responsible for them by groups .	1
The Mead Class Supplies Storage wall has nine pockets for storage . Mine is now being used for my office for various supplies , notecards , etc ... The pockets are approximately 4.5 x 7 inches each ( 12 pockets total ) . It is well built so it should last for a long time . This will work nicely in a classroom , offices or for the kids ' room .	1
This wall storage organizer is exactly as it appears . The pockets are fairly small so do n't plan on putting anything large in it , but is great for storing and organizing small objects . I am putting this up in my crafting closet to organize crafting supplies and it works perfectly for this . I would recommend it for the storage of any small items .	1
This wall storage pouch system is a good size and each ( 9 ) pouch can hold a good amount of small items.The pouches are clear and have a window to slide in labels . The size unfolded is good , it fits behind doors etc..The grommets are nice , protecting the mounting holes from stretching or tearing.This is pretty useful for storing and separating arts and craft items or nuts and bolts etc..****Jim	1
Storage is easy , organization is hard - at least in our house . We 've been using this at the house to help organize materials for a DI ( Destination Imagination ) Group . There are 9 pockets - wide enough to fit a pen , but not quite wide enough for an unsharpened pencil ( they fit on the diagonal ) . The label slots on each pocket make it easy to add large , legible labels for each kid or item . I think the picture is a little off on scale - the scale is correct for the items placed in them , but not so much for the girl whose relative size seems to make the pockets look quite large .	1
This Mead organizer is for the most part high quality and very functional . There was some stray ends in the stitching , but nothing that effected the product . One can use this for various functions , such as having a pouch for each individual student or perhaps different subjects . Overall I really liked this product , but I deducted one star because it failed to include labels that would properly fit the pouches . Thus , one must cut out their own labels - which is not a huge deal , but it would look more professional if it came with pre-cut labels that fit the product like the other Mead product I reviewed did . Still , a great help for the classroom !	1
This Wall Scheduler is a very simple idea : You hang it up , and it has 10 slots to place mini-dry-erase boards . You can of course edit whatever you want , whether it 's daily , weekly , etc. , but you can also reorder the boards as needed , without the need to erase and rewrite things . Again : it 's very simple , nothing Earth-shattering , but quite useful . Teachers will also like that you can easily take it down and fold it up to take with you at the end of the school-year.It should be noted that it only comes with the teal scheduler and the dry-erase slats -- it does not come with hooks to hang it up with or with any markers . Those you 'll have to supply for yourself .	1
My nine year old daughter enjoys this product . She loves to play `` teacher '' in her room at night before bed , and this teacher 's wall organizer is perfect as part of that play for her . She can list the activities her `` class '' will engage in for a day , and use dry erase markers so she can start over again the next day . Also , on a Saturday our whole family can use the organizer to schedule our day of activities and chores . It 's a handy product , it 's inexpensive , and it 's versatile . Recommended .	1
Mead Classroom Wall Scheduler , Teal ( 72334 ) . . .This vinyl-and-plastic wall scheduler is n't the prettiest thing ever , but it 's functional and durable , with a single row of ten large-ish slots , with accompanying cards that can be written on and reused to help plan daily schedules or steps in a project , etc . Having the cards be dry erase is a nice touch ( though be careful not to smudge them while slipping them in ... ) Aesthetically , I 'd say this is better suited for the school environment -- we could n't find a place in our home where it did n't stand out like a sre thumb -- but in a classroom this would fit in just fine .	1
This organizer has dry erase rectangular cards which slip into clear plastic pockets all in a vertical arrangement on a flat vinyl holder with two large grommets on top to hang it with.It is designed to schedule a school day . For example , the top sleeve could have a card that says 8:30am Class Announcements , 9:30am Math , etc . Obviously , you could use this in an almost infinite variety of ways . We actually used it at home to schedule some television viewing so everyone would know whose turn it was to watch what they wanted . I am thinking of converting it to a weekly scheduler to plan game nights and other activities so everyone in the family will know what is coming up.The erasable cards are large enough to be able to see what is written from a distance and there are ten pockets which makes it adaptable to uses other than just a daily or weekly scheduler . It also has a larger clear pocket at the bottom to store extra cards and dry erase pens . This scheduler might not work for everyone or for every purpose but it is versatile and doesn & # 8217 ; t take up too much wall space and it seems useful for classroom or home purposes .	1
A teacher favorite . I love the construction and design . I see this model in many of the classrooms I visit for my preservice training , so I know it 's reliable class organizational aide .	1
This is a wall scheduler with 10 slots for memos , assignments , etc..I am using mine in my office for reminder notes and schedules . The clear plastic slots for each are not designed to hold anything too heavy ( just an FYI ) . It comes with cards to be put in the slots ( if needed ) to help organize your life a little more .	1
I just got the Mead Classroom Wall Scheduler , so I can use it in my classroom to post our daily schedule . I 'm very happy with it as it 's a bright color and it has 10 pockets . The heavy duty grommets allow you to hang it easily and I especially like the dry erase cards that allow you to reuse the cards . The fabric is very durable , so I can see this lasting a long time .	1
Gave it to my wife , a Teacher , and she liked it ! Took a while to get this up in a classroom , but my wife likes the color scheme , the ease of application , and generally found of the product . She found the customization features , no pre-labeling , to be very appealing . Ca n't beat the price !	1
There is nothing like this that I have found . I like that you can change things because we all know that things change . It is so frustrating when you have a schedule up and something changes . I 'm not entirely sure how long this will hold up since I have n't had it long , but it 's not like you are going to be actually manipulating it like a binder or something . I like that this is something you can change from year to year . You could use any kind of card stock to replace slots even if you ran out of the ones provided . Yes , you can set up a schedule with similar cards that are changeable , but that takes up precious bulletin board space .	1
This product is labeled as a classroom wall scheduler , but works great at home too . My daughter wanted help in figuring out a solution to communicate a schedule to her young children . We picked this product because it was easy to use , easy to swap out the cards , and by focusing on one day at a time there was little confusion about what the plan for the day was . The organizer comes with 10 flexible strips of paper that are treated with something to make them dry-erase capable . Rather than use the dry erase , we found it was easier just to use permanent marker to write on them . One downside was that only 10 strips were included , but you can cut normal-sized ( 8 1/2 & # 34 ; x 11 & # 34 ; ) paper into three strips and use those . Card stock was our paper of choice but laminated regular paper would have worked great too . We made a bunch of strips that had different morning and afternoon activities and then filled the slots every day . One day might have these strips is use : brush teeth , pack snack , library book , practice piano , swim lesson , etc ) . Then the next day might see practice piano swapped out for piano lesson , and see a card indicating there was homework to do that day . It is very easy for kids and adults to remove the strips to change them or put away the ones that have been completed . It a is hard to describe , but the cards rest in an open pocket so they can be easily lifted out instead of needing to thread them into a narrow sleeve . There is even a pouch on the bottom of the organizer to store extra strips or strips you are not using that day . Overall , I am very pleased with this purchase . I wish came in neutral colors . The teal color is bright .	1
When I first opened this I thought that it would be really heavy duty and perfect for something I use all the time . You have to pop the bottom latch to open the rings , and they open with a loud & # 34 ; pop. & # 34 ; After two or three uses , I noticed that my pages kept catching when I tried to turn them . The middle ring did n't fit together right , and I have to jiggle it to make it fit right , so that I can turn the pages easily . It is n't long before I have to jiggle around the middle ring again . I 've actually had better luck with the moderately priced ones at Wal-Mart . I was disappointed in this .	-1
This a one touch binder , meaning you press one lever and it opens . It does open very easily and maybe too easily . It seems likely to pop open . I know this is billed as an ultra duty binder ( whatever that is supposed to mean ) but I do n't find it particularly stout . They bill it as having their strongest cover . Mine came damaged on the spine -- the plastic covering is very thin and torn at the corner . To be honest for the price $ 18 , retail , less from Amazon , I do not find this binder worth the price . It would n't even hold up for school work .	-1
The issue with a gimmick is that it had better work , or else you 're going to end up with a very frustrated user . I have this in the 1 inch and 2 inch size , so that I know it 's not user error . Even it if IS user error , that 's bad design . But it 's not.The & # 34 ; one touch & # 34 ; opening dealie does n't work . When the gimmick that 's supposed to make the product makes the product outright unusable , the whole thing is an utter waste . For the price , I 'm even more furious . The material feels really cheap and flimsy . Seeing as how I ca n't even get the thing to work , I ca n't give it any points at all .	-1
This binder has a little integrity in its construction . It does not have nearly the number of bubbles and dents in it that the 1 inch binder does . It does have a clear pocket on the outside so you can drop a sheet of paper in . However , the folders inside are positively useless . While they may hold a couple of pages to start out with , they are not strong enough to have any lasting effect.This binder has the easy to open hinge on the bottom . I also like how rings are shaped to let pages stay flat.I 'm not sure what they mean by 5 year guarantee . I do n't think it is very likely that someone would go to the trouble to return one to the manufacturer . I personally , would just throw it out when it became compromised . It 's super easy to go to staples and get a six-pack of better binders for the price of this one .	-1
My binder I bought at the beginning of fall semester last year was beginning to look rather old ( and I was tired of seeing it ) , so I thought I 'd give this one a try . The size is the same , the pockets are the same , and the one-touch opening is about the same , but the quality is certainly not ! This binder has 4 see-through pockets : 2 in the front and 2 in the back which make organization easy . The `` single-touch '' mechanism is simple to use and much nicer than the old ones that require both hands and are loud to open and close . I also liked the `` baby blue '' color as it is n't too common for a binder.Unfortunately , the strength seems over-exaggerated by the manufacturer . Whether the binder covers will hold up for `` years of reliable use '' is yet to be seen , though I have high doubts . The covers bend easily -- something I discovered the first time I pulled it from my backpack . I have never had a binder with such bendable covers ! The coating might last a long time , but the actual binder covers feel far to flimsy to even last a semester ! Maybe that was the manufacturer 's intention , however it gives the binder a cheap and fragile feel . I also noticed pages do n't turn as smoothly and get held up on the top ring , though there is no noticeable gap.Due to the disappointing construction of this binder , I have switched back to my old binder for now ( Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 1.5-Inch One Touch EZD Ring , Navy Blue ( 79805 ) ) . Even though I am tired of seeing it and it looks a little beat up , the reliability is very good . This Wilson Jones one I will use for old notes and online classes , but I need a `` real '' binder to actually take to school and back -- one that can stand up to the beatings of everyday college life . I only give this one two stars because of its flimsy covers and overall feel .	-1
I picked up this binder because it was a heavy duty binder and needed one to store several hundred pages of notes and tests for a class that I teach . Overall the binder seems to be well constructed , the rings are sturdy , and the outside of the binder seems to be in good condition.However , this binder broke within a week of use . The plastic tab at the bottom of the binder that is used to open and close the rings broke after a week of use . Once that was broken it was impossible to open and close the rings of the binder ( basically making it useless ) . I had to pry open the rings to remove all of the pages from the binder . The rest of the binder seems to be made very well , however the plastic tab at the bottom is extremely flimsy , and if this part goes the entire binder is basically useless .	-1
This is a nicely made binder . The view pockets , front , back , spine and on the inside of the covers as well , are nicely done . Five stars for the construction and design of this binder . Why only 2 stars in the headline ? It 's way over priced . The exact same binder selling at another on-line nationwide office supply chain ( with local brick & mortar stores as well ) sells for $ 8.99 .	-1
Note : Outer Dimensions are 11 and 6.5/16 inches wide by 11 and 5/8 inches high with rounded cornersAre you a fanatic about binders and the myriad of crafty inserts designed for them ? Unfortunately , not all inserts can fit in or be fully protected by every binder . Such is the case with the 2-inch Wilson Ultra-Duty D-Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge.But first , how good is the binder itself ? The good : The Single Touch trigger mechanism works extremely well for hands which are arthritic , nerve-damaged , or simply not very strong . The D-lock ring is indeed quite sturdy and the Never-Gap rings do just what they imply by having the bottom ring actually fit inside the top ring.The very bad : Both covers are only `` sort of '' sturdy . With little effort , they can be flexed to the point of permanently rippling the white material that covers the base . Just a bit more effort and I could bend the cover back to touch itself . The very corners are only marginally rigid . With NO effort , the plastic covering tore away from the front seam the very first time I tugged on it . The same thing happened with the inside plastic pockets.As for how this binder handles inserts , I look for near-perfection when evaluating the binder/insert unity . Specifically , does the binder fully accommodate ANY insert , protecting it along all of its outside edges , including top and bottom corners ? Will it protect divider tabs ? Will all of these points hold true regardless of where the insert is placed - i.e . first , last , anywhere in between ? The placement of the ring , the curvature of the ring , rounded cover edges , and the depth of the binder can make inserts fit well in some locations but not in others.Here 's how this binder handles some of my favorite inserts : Avery Poly-vu and Heavy Duty Vinyl Sheet Protectors : full coverage from this 2-inch binderCascade Insertable Ring Book Indexes with Plastic Tabs : full coverage from this 2-inch binderAvery Write-on Dividers with Erasable Tabs : full coverage from this 2-inch binderAvery Advantages Clear Binder Pockets ( # 75243 ) : full coverage from this 2-inch binderAvery Advantages Big Tab Pocket Insertable Dividers ( # 11903 ) : Tabs stick out by 3/8 inch but pocket is fully protectedClear pocket ( unnamed ) : Outer long edge sticks out by 1/16 inch , corners not protected by rounded cover 's corners.Better Office Products expandable pocket with Velcro closure : corners stick out / not protected by rounded cover 's corners ; long edge not protected if placed in last position against back coverFinal Word : Despite the nifty gapless rings and the easy trigger mechanism and because of the bendable covers , tearable plastic coverings , and inability to protect all inserts , I can not recommend this 2-inch white Wilson Ultra-Duty D-Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge . Who wants to pay a premium for a binder that can break in just a few seconds ? My favorite binder these days is the Avery Dennison Heavy Duty View Reference line of binders - a bit sturdier and can handle any insert I 've ever purchased .	-1
I 'm not impressed with the durability of this binder nor the price . It is supposed to be `` Ultra-Duty , '' one step above `` Heavy-Duty , '' but it is apparently so fragile that the view-film arrived damaged . It appears that the binder took a hit at the bottom end which lightly crushed the cardboard inside and crinkled the polypro material , but it cracked the clear plastic about `` up on the front and `` up on the edge . The packing in the box from Amazon appeared to protect the binder and there was no damage to the box , so I figure this was shipped already damaged . Yes , I could return it and Amazon would replace it for free , but my point here is that this damage puts into question just how well this binder would hold up under long-term or heavy use.Since I am a Vine reviewer I decided to put the product to the test . I discovered that their `` Polypro '' material is not all that strong and the hinges are no better ; in fact , they are a bit weaker than the rest of the cover , due to the perforations . When I put it under stress ( as shown in the picture included with the binder ) , the hinge area quickly tore , followed by a significant portion of the cover.Bottom line : I have owned better binders for lower cost from Avery . I can not recommend this binder .	-1
My binder has n't broken yet , but I would not use it for anything resembling & # 34 ; heavy duty. & # 34 ; The plastic does not feel high grade , and the covers bend easily . The & # 34 ; one touch & # 34 ; opening is more of a pain than a help .	-1
My daughter specifically asked for a pink binder this year for school so I immediately opted for the chance to review this item . It 's a great color , although we 've had some durability issues with this binder in the past . Her constant repetition of taking the binder in and out of her backpack causes the edges to wear down very quickly . I do like the ease of how the open and close mechanism of the ring system works . Seems very smooth . Only time will tell if we continue to have the edge wear issues we 've had in the past .	-1
1 inch binder with 1 year guarantee : This binder has a little more integrity in its construction than some of its counterparts . It does not have nearly the number of bubbles and dents in it that the 1 inch binder does . However , the slots inside are positively useless . While they may hold a couple of pages to start out with , they are not strong enough to have any lasting effect.This binder does not have the easier to open hinge that some of the Wilson Jones binders do and this one is very difficult to open.I 'm not sure what they mean by a 1 year guarantee . I do n't think it is very likely that someone would go to the trouble to return one to the manufacturer . I personally , would just throw it out when it became compromised .	-1
I received this binder today and was not impressed . It is a pretty color but the cover has wrinkles and it is flimsy compared to what I expected . I do n't think this binder is any better than the $ 1 one I got at the store . I do n't recommend wasting your money or time ordering it online when you can get the same thing , probably better at the store . It does n't have a clear sleeve on the front for a photo which I did n't expect but you can get a better one that does . This was just a disappointment for me .	-1
I think the only quality here is the actual rings . The problem with them is that that open and close like bear traps . If a child gets there finger caught in the rings ( or an adult ) it 's going to hurt ! ... .and since it is very hard to open and close , one might try to pull it apart by the rings ( a dangerous , but easier alternative ) . Unfortunately , I do n't think it will last very long . The leftpocket pulled apart as I tried to put in 4 pages into it . It looks like it is just melted into the binder cover . The cover is a regular cover , like any other binder . The plastic cover was kinked and dented , inspite of the box being in perfect position . This is certainly NOT a heavy duty cover . The covers are probably 1/16 inch thick , or rather , thin . There is better and cheaper out there .	-1
I would not call this binder any more heavy duty than the ones I bought recently at a warehouse store for about a fourth the price ( they only come in white , to be fair , but they have clear pockets on the front so they can be identified ) .This binder is ok and has the snag free design ( the rings have a little protrusion and dimple so that papers do not snag when you turn the pages ) . But the rings snap together with a force that is a bit scary , and are hard to pry open . The two `` pockets '' are so tight that you can barely put a couple pages in them . The vinyl covering arrived already dented from the rings . I expected something different from a heavy duty binder .	-1
I think $ 4.99 is expensive for a 1 inch binder . This kind of binder would normally sell for $ 2.79 or less . There is nothing special about this binder other than the attractive purple color . This binder includes two pockets as well as a plastic cover and back where you can insert your own cover and back sheet if you 'd like.The label on the binder reads : `` Guarantee 1 year ; never gap ; lasts 10x Longer ; 2 pockets ; extra durable hinge ; heavy duty ; holds 200 sheets . '' I can tell you that with no paper in it , there is a noticeable gap between the top and back of the binder so I question its durability.I gave this two stars because I like the color , the rings open and close easily either through pulling them apart or using the clasp at either end , and it has two pockets . Having said that , I believe it 's overpriced and that it may not be as durable given the fact that it does n't fully close so that the top and bottom meet .	-1
Basically , a three ring binder is cardboard stock covered in plastic , with hinges so that it bends where it is supposed to . There is also a metal portion with rings , so that you can put your papers in the binder.Where the rubber meets the road is in the quality of the materials used to make the binder , and sadly , this binder is woefully lacking . The cardboard is so thin that the binder is flimsy and the plastic covering the cardboard is also so thin that it cracks and tears easily.If this were a five dollar binder , that would not be so bad . But at ten dollars , this product is not worth the price .	-1
This is a lightweight binder with a thin covering of plastic over medium weight cardboard . The rings are sturdy and open and close easily , but overall quality of construction is lacking in several areas.- The plastic laminate over the cardboard is bubbling up in a few places - it appears it was not applied correctly.- The binder will not close properly - the rings are mounted about a quarter inch too close to the spine so that when closed the top and bottom edges of the binder do not line up.- The clear plastic over-sleeve is not smooth and has a slightly warped appearance.In an inexpensive binder ( the price was just over nine dollars at the time of my order ) I would n't be so critical , but at this price I expect a better constructed product .	-1
Wilson Jones makes some extravagant claims about this absurdly overpriced ring binder , but it looks and feels like one that you might find in your local dollar store . Its metal ring unit is well-designed and constructed , and manufactured elsewhere , but otherwise this binder looks cheap and flimsy . Of course I 'd really have to use one for a year or so to provide a fair assessment of its durability , but my gut tells me that this is a substandard product , and my gut is n't usually wrong . The amazon price for one binder is $ 9.43 , and the 4-pack is $ 19.97 ... even for around five bucks , I 'd be wary of this product and would choose an Avery binder instead , as I have used those for many years and know them to be quite durable . Buy this at your own risk !	-1
I have no idea if it was damaged in storage , or damaged in shipment ( shipped alone in a box ) , but this binder arrived in less than ideal condition . One sleeve was warped , and the clear cover was separating from the top of the spine . However it happened , it seems to me to be an indication that it 's not that tough , and wo n't hold up to wear . I would n't buy this brand again online , only in person so that I could evaluate its condition first .	-1
This is a very basic multifunction machine with duplex printing for the network . The machine has no Wi-Fi and connects to your network or router only through ethernet cable but if you have W-Fi router , then you can print from your devices over W-Fi . After downloading Samsung Mobile Print app from Google Play store , you can even print from the Android devices . I am not sure whether or how it prints from iOS devices . This printer is big and hefty.Duplex is only for printing ; not scanning , copying or faxing . Setup is easy and on Mac OS , you do not even have to install Samsung software for printing , it automatically recognizes and installs the software . But for scanning , and using advanced fax functions and address-book , you need to install Samsung software and Easy Print Manager.Online support page is good and you can download drivers and manuals . From the ip address of the printer , web page will show you the basic settings and the toner level . Print quality is average . As of now , the cost of printing per page is roughly 1.9 cents a page.Print speed is fast but otherwise no unique or redeeming features in this Samsung Multifunction beg a recommended buy . It is bulky , relatively expensive , duplex is only for printing , printing from iOS devices is questionable , and printing cost per page is not that economical . In the past , I had Samsung printers where they stopped manufacturing the toner , so basically bricking your printer.BOTTOMLINE : In same range , I thinkBrother Printer DCP7065DN Monochrome Laser Multi-Function Copieris is much better alternative network duplex laser multifunction with better print quality and Brother software , less cost and as of now the cost of printing per page 1.65 cents .	-1
This is a disappointing printer.First let me say , I am a huge laser printer fan . So many of us have been conned into buying inkjet printers . They are slow and very expensive ... The ink clogs , runs out , and costs more than liquid gold . The only benefit is color printing which I find very rarely useful . Meanwhile , laser printers are available that are fast , robust , and very inexpensive . I have been using a Brother printer that cost under 100 dollars for years . The 2000 sheet toner cartridges ( non oem which are great ) cost under 20 dollars . It does n't compare to this in that it does n't have a scanner or fax ... but it does have networking ! ! There are many lasers with all the features of this and more that are less expensive.In summary:1 . It has a very large footprint . I am not sure what justifies this . There are many less expensive laser printers available that are as robust and as or more functional that take up considerably less space . For an office , this may be fine but for home , I need something more compact.2 . The description says 'Built in Network & Duplex '' This is wrong and misleading . First , there is no built in network . It will do air print from a tablet/phone or from google cloud but only through a connected router . There is no networking module . I spent a long time trying to get the networking hooked up before I realized this . This is really inexcusable . Much less expensive laser printers , including by samsung have a wireless module . As far as duplex , there is duplex printing but not scanning . [ A note about lasers and wireless . Most wireless ink jets allow you to send directly from computer to printer wirelessly . Most lasers only allow you to send from router to the printer . This is n't a problem if you have a router ... but for my daughter in her dorm room without a router , it was an issue . There is usually a workaround but it is n't pretty . All that is moot for this printer because there is no networking , even from the router except for AirPrint and google cloud print.3 . The toner cartridges are very expensive . Still much less than inkjet . Only OEM cartridges are available and they are about 2x as much as the brother oem cartridge ... and much more expensive than the non OEM ones . It is possible that non OEM cartridges will come out as this printer ages.4 . As big as this is , it wo n't take an entire ream of paper.. only 50 sheets . Can understand that ! 5 . Print quality is excellent , but no better than less expensive laser printers . You can push an eco button to save electricity and toner . Scanner is excellent ... as are the other features . However , I just ca n't see spending so much for a printer that offers less than so many inexpensive printers which are available .	-1
This is like a portable office - with a section for files , huge three ring binder ( 2 inches ! ) , all sorts of places to put things and a handle to carry it like a brief case.I get what they 're trying to do here , but it 's SO cumbersome and clunky that unless you 're working without an office ( or a very busy student ? ) , this binder does n't make sense for someone who has a place to put things.Plus , the velcro/nylon compartments are really clumsy.Again - great for a student but not realistic for a businessperson trying to make a professional impression .	-1
I chose this item as I had a specific moving task in mind and thought this product would be perfect . I did not know that the offering was for one box . Purchasers get a pack of 20 but I can only review the one box I was sent.I can see how these boxes would be great for professional movers with dollies and lifts . The front edges of the boxes are marked for lining up and you can easily label the side for contents . If I was moving with a flatbed and was n't having to carry this box more than to a pallet it would be handy . The cubic shape is great for stacking as long as the contents are light . There is no way anything heavy could be stacked in these boxes as the cardboard is lightweight and would not sustain much weight.For the home packer and mover , I find this box awkward to carry . The woman in the photo could only carry this box in that manner if the box was empty or had maybe a pillow in it . The box is inadequate for books , furnishings or even heavy clothing . I filled it with lightweight mohair and angora yarns and it was fine for that . There are no handles or hand cut outs . You need to tape the box for structural integrity.The box from Amazon that this box came in was a far more substantial container that this one . I would not opt for this product for my packing needs unless I was moving my entire yarn stash . Purchase with care and understanding of the product limitations .	-1
I received this moving box , enclosed within another box for shipping . Upon opening it , a dead insect fell out of the moving box . Needless to say , I did n't use the box . It immediately went into the outside trash , because I was nervous that there might be insect eggs inside . As such , I can not really comment on the functionality of the moving box . For the price of these moving boxes , I would expect them to be insect free .	-1
I ca n't seem to find any real use for this product . First of all , the `` pockets '' are tiny and serve no other purpose than holding the dry erase cards . It would have been nice if each `` pocket '' would have been capable of holding supplies applicable to the task . Even the mesh pocket is anything but generous for storage . The product photo highlights the grommets and shows the scheduler hanging from two Command hooks . But ... beware ... no hooks are included . You need need to buy them separately . For the $ 10 price tag , I definitely expected the scheduler to include the hooks . I am also uncertain why Mead chose teal for the color scheme of their classroom organizers . The color does n't really coordinate with anything . The Mead Classroom Wall Scheduler is not at all what I expected . I have n't found any incredibly useful purpose for the product , and I believe it to be grossly overpriced .	-1
I needed this ! I was excited when it arrived ... and then the `` paper '' covering the bottom of it fell off before I even used it - or ran over it with my car.Why are things so cheaply made and assembled these days ? I have this under my desk and am using it , but it would have been nicer if it had n't fallen apart.Meh .	-1
I 'm puzzled by why this was included in the Vine options . It is about as basic as can be and in no way a weekly planning desk organizer . It 's just a place to store odds and ends of paper . The color is ugly . The appearance of the item is utilitarian . You can find far more appealing equivalents in Staples of Office Depot for a few dollars and this one stands out on my desk only as by far the least attractive piece on it.The `` weekly '' and `` organizer '' element is just some stick-on labels . There 's nothing interesting in terms of form or function -- a plain and basic design and minimal features .	-1
I thought this product was similar to colored duct tape or packing tape . It 's regular scotch tape that is colored and/or patterned . It 's nice if you are taping something like a letter or card , but to decorate with is not really all that great . Its like putting scotch tape over your stuff .	-1
Our 9 year old daughter has been doing a lot of crafts with decorated Duck Brand duct tape recently . She thought that this would augment her collection and be useful on those types of projects . She was very disappointed in this tape 's performance . The only thing that she thought it would work for is to decorate paper . Do n't plan to build anything with it , like you can with duct tape . This is what she had to say : I did not like this product because it was see through and did not rip ( you had to cut it . ) However , this tape is perfect for decorating non-decorated paper . Overall I did not like this tape .	-1
I got this to use in a closet , to give a little extra shoe space . I have to say , I 'm a bit disappointed in it.The pieces are made from thick sturdy plastic , but the sides/legs wobble and fall off . You have to hold the one side/leg in while putting in the other leg . Do n't try to pick it up and move it once you got the legs in because a leg will fall off.It is pretty useless standing alone without support on both sides . I tried and it just toppled over , sigh ... . I suppose in a locker it would be ok since it could n't move but for anything else it 's a dude . I may just tape or glue the sides in so its sturdy enough to use.For the price , I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
There is a locker room in my office building . They are half lockers and I am currently using two I order to house all my workout equipment . The Five Star Stackable Locker Shelf seemed like the perfect solution to allow me to condense into a single locker.Where I went wrong was assuming lockers are all a standard width or the shelf would adjust -- neither is true . So , please measure the width of the intended locker before purchasing this shelf . If the shelf and locker are not exactly the right size the shelf is useless . If the locker is even a half inch smaller , it does n't fit in . If it is a half inch larger , the shelf is n't stable . You see the top does n't lock on to the legs , so they slant and fall out from under the shelf if the sides of the locker are n't there to support them . Good idea . Bad design .	-1
I like the design and concept of this product , but the magnets wo n't stay on . They all popped off the first time I used it . I have them aligned now , but I do n't want to disturb it . If they can minimize that design flaw , I think they will have a handy product .	-1
I was all ready to like this . It seemed useful and well built . The neoprene is well attached and the seams seem well done . I put it on my fridge to give it a try and I stuck a few things in there . The magnets held well and it did n't slid down with the weight . The magnets are strong , well too strong . I pulled it out to put it somewhere else and the magnets popped off and stayed attached to the fridge . So , yeah , this is broken . Broke during its first use . They need to build this better or use stronger glue .	-1
Headline says it all . This unit while well made , has a very limited usefulness.The upsides : Magnet are strong enough and the storage pocket is well made.The downsides : WHY ? At almost $ 12 it 's over priced for a pen holder and small cell phone . Not only that , who stores the cell phones or calculators on a refrigerator and in a locker . These are about the only metal surfaces most folks have access to .	-1
UPDATE : the third time I removed this from my refrigerator , one of the magnets detached . Thus , I removed a star ... not as durable as I thought.First , this is a small item . For some reason , I erroneously thought it would hold 8 1/2 x 11 '' pieces of paper . No deducted stars for this , but just be aware this is designed to hold ( according to the picture on the product ) one smart phone and two pens/pencils in a school locker.Pros : magnets are strong ( four , one in each corner ) . Magnets also have some kind of clear , non-scratch coating on them . Neoprene is soft and smooth . Stitching is firm . Seems very well constructed . Has a firm back and does not easily bend.Cons : here 's my thing . When you 're at your locker ... where would you want to put your phone ? Your pocket , your purse , your backpack . Right ? Why would you ever take it out and slide it into a holder on your locker door ? Makes no sense . If you want to do this , however , it works great . The left side 's utility is limited , because the pocket is stitched in half ( to make it smaller for writing instruments ) . But who would buy a storage item at this price to hold several pens ? And what other items are small enough to store in two such small spaces ? In sum , there is nothing wrong with this holder . And nothing really useful , either , for the price .	-1
I received this at no charge in exchange for an honest review , written here : I wanted to use this for my girls in their secret hiding place . They like to play & # 34 ; school & # 34 ; and wanted to put up posters and pieces of paper on it . I gave them tacks and let them try , not thinking that it would n't work . I mean , it 's a corkboard , right ? Wrong . It 's a flimsy piece of cork attached to a & # 34 ; wood & # 34 ; border , and the back looks like cardboard . It is thinner than any corkboard I have seen , and all the different sized tacks I had them use all went right through to the back . I thought that was short sighted of the company . At least make it thick enough to hold tacks pushed all the way through .	-1
The cork on this board is exceptionally thin and flimsy . If you push a standard sized push pin into it anywhere near the middle , it will push all the way through and put a hole in wall behind it ( I tested this behind a door because I could tell it was going to be a problem as soon as I unwrapped it , and sure enough ... hole in my wall ) .I can not possibly recommend this board .	-1
In about a month from now the back-to-school ads will appear . There will be a make shift room with a handsome cork bulletin board hung next to a perfectly arranged desk . Maybe a pennant casually draped over the board to show some school spirit . You know THAT ad ? This would be the perfect cork board for the photo shoot.This corkboard is very nice-looking , but sadly , that & # 8217 ; s the only good thing I can say about it . This thing is so thin that pushing standard thumbtacks into it will not only go completely through the board , but into the wall behind it as well . My now perforated wall aside , the composition of this board is horrendous . In only a few months it & # 8217 ; s been used between me and my brothers to the point where chunks of cork are falling out of the board . As my bro found out , taping anything to the board is not a good idea , as the cork peels right off with the tape . Also , that & # 8220 ; oak & # 8221 ; frame is really plastic , and the only other material reinforcing this thing is cardboard . Dropping this from extremely low heights is a sure way to bust that framing too . This is an okay corkboard to use once in a while , but I just can & # 8217 ; t say confidently that it can hold it & # 8217 ; s own under regular and continuous usage .	-1
This is quite a large cork board so make sure you measure your space before ordering this . The faux wood frame is not of high quality as I see many cracks on the surface already .	-1
This cork board is extremely thin . When you put a normal-sized pushpin into it , it goes completely through the cork and out the back . If the pushpins are pushed in as far as they will go , they make holes in the wall behind it !	-1
Compared to other cork boards it appeared to be a very good bargain based on price and the Prime shippingoption . Upon arrival the optimism faded when opening and inspecting this cork board.It is the thinnest cork board I have seen or owned . A normal push pin will go completely through the thin cork and backing.If you do n't plan on moving it it will offer a framed covered spot over your damaged wall but I would suggest you spend anadditional $ 20 or so dollars and get a quality cork board .	-1
The purpose of a cork board is to be able to stick push pins into it and protect the wall . I ca n't use standard thumb tacks on this without damaging my wall every single time . I might as well not use the product and put the pins directly into my wall . Other than the thickness of the board , the product seems well made and sturdy .	-1
This is a very lightweight and bendable calendar . In order to write on it , you have to put it on a solid surface . If it is picked up by the edge , the black plastic edging comes away.The squares on the calendar are very small , too small to be useful in writing notes or more than one appointment.Within an hour of putting dates on the calendar , one of the children rubbed out an errant mark and it turned into a sludge mark , a mark that will not come out with erasers or white board sprayer and soft cloth . It is smudged . It is possible to write over this mark and to then erase the mark . But the second Monday of the top month is forever smudged .	-1
The Quartet Chalkboard , 14x14 , does not work well . I like chalk boards . Chalk is easy to carry around in my shop apron and if I leave it there for a year it is still good because it does n't dry out like a dry board marker - and chalk is cheap . I bought a box of chalk a few years ago and I am still using it . Unless I drop it on the floor the box of chalk sticks will last for many years . I use an old wash cloth to erase the markings.The problem is this chalk board is n't rough enough and the chalk does n't write well because it slides over the surface . It is nothing like the chalk boards of old . After I used this for several days , during which it seemed to write OK although not great , it began to write less well . Erasing it seems to have removed the slight amount of roughness that was there when it was new.AD2	-1
While I admit I bear responsibility for thinking the 8.5 x 11 applied to the actual writing surface , the pictures reallllly make it look like its larger . And I think you would be hard pressed to get writing like they show on the pictures onto it without some sort of stencils and spray on chalk . The things that really erks me is the 'classic chalkboard surface ' I suppose a lawyer could argue about the term classic , but this is not slate like you used in school . This is sprayed plastic . I realize its cheap , but I would go up a size or up a price bracket so you do n't deal with the frustration I did .	-1
It certainly was n't love at first sight when I took this chalkboard out of the box , and from there it only got worse . Now slight affection would be too strong an emotion to express how I feel about it . I have gotten chalkboards from the dollar store , and was much happier with them . This one is kind of cheesy , probably appropriate for the price , and lacks one of the most important things a chalkboard should have , besides a good writing surface : there is not ledge for the chalk . I like the size , but not the look , and am not impressed at all with the writing surface . It seems like I will have to refresh it with chalkboard paint , which is not worth the effort since I can turn something I like into a chalkboard ( e.g. , a picture frame ) and not have to deal something I find unattractive . This is definitely one for the grands to play with , as long as it lasts .	-1
It 's particle board with chalkboard paint . That 's fine . That 's most chalkboards these days . But the frame is & # 34 ; wood grain & # 34 ; , like it was meant to be compatible in '70s era finished basement with dark wood paneling . Not pretty . And it 's very lightweight . Paint or otherwise cover the trim if you 're crafty , that 's my recommendation . As a chalkboard , though , you can write on it . A good size for posting quick notes or a menu for a special evening .	-1
The writing surface small , cheap and the frame is over-sized and cheap . After using the chalkboard I found that after a few uses this board looks dirty and smudged and it is not as smooth as a traditional chalkboard surface . It might work for a sign in your home for decor but I do n't see it standing up to lots of use .	-1
Let 's get something clear from the start -- this is NOT a classic chalkboard . If you read the description and think & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; means the type of surface you find on school chalkboards , you will be severely disappointed . This appears to be a laminate surface with a & # 34 ; grainy & # 34 ; writing surface , and is NOT the smooth writing surface of a real chalkboard . The & # 34 ; wood & # 34 ; is wood laminate , and the entire design is pretty cheap . After repeated use , the chalk tends to adhere to the board and it never seems to have a & # 34 ; fresh & # 34 ; look after several uses . And the chalk dust goes everywhere , including the attaching itself to the wooden part of the frame , making everything a dusty mess . Save your money and buy a better built product with a real chalkboard surface . Oh , and if you do decide buy this board , be sure to buy some chalk too -- this one does n't come with any in the package .	-1
The design is very nice , however , is very small . Would love this product if it was larger . Very well made and very attractive to the eye . Would highly recommend for someone looking for a small chalkboard to use as a grocery list but not large enough to put much more on the board .	-1
While this chalkboard is cute and looks nice , it is far to small of a writing surface to be of any practical use . The frame is very wide which leaves you with far less than the 8.5 x 11 space . I was planning on using it for a slate for my daughter to practice her math , but it is n't big enough .	-1
I ordered this set in December . I should have looked more closely but the 2 cyan blue cartridges and 1 yellow have broken plastic tabs thus you ca n't use the cartridge at all . What a waste . I need a blue cartridge and now I have to go out and buy some . Unfortunately the return date expired 1/31/14 . So 30 % of the cartridges are useless . Thanks .	-1
I 've never been quite this glum to give a 2 star review . I love using this scanner , when it works . I want PiQx to have a huge , out-of-control success with this product , and send dozens more manufacturers scrambling to get their own versions to market . ( You 'll find comparable ones offered on the product 's page here , but they are mostly classroom/video oriented , and none can aspire to quite what the Xcanex is positioned to do in terms of document handling , format conversion , image quality , etc . -- not at this price . ) But I ca n't - yet - recommend this product to someone who needs consistently dependable results , or truly speedy scans ( there are other process streamlining features that compensate , I must hasten to add - more on that , below ) , or a not-so-steep learning curve.For business card and flat page scanning , I will say this little scanner is without peer . Practically anything strictly in 2D is going to come out cropped , lighting adjusted , and ready for OCR , conversion to PDF , or any number of graphics formats . Did I say `` ready '' ? Actually , you can save to PDF format or to an OCR converted format , without intermediary steps . ( Oh sure , if you OCR convert heavily italicized , stylized , or just plain tiny text , you might end up with un-decipherable gobbledygook , but that 's a limitation pretty universal to OCR readers , last I checked . ) For scanning books , magazines , and other things that bend their way into hard to read text or bizarre images with traditional or `` wand '' scanners , PiQx has come up with software that they call `` Flatpage '' . Its purpose : To `` unbend '' or `` un-skew '' curved and tilted page images and faithfully recreate the look of a truly flat page , without having to cut pages away from the book spine , for one example.That 's a great idea . However , it 's not working out so well for me , at this writing . I 'm referencing here the original public release of Flatpage , which was made available on the PiQx website on 10/04/2013 . Sometimes it works beautifully in automatic or semi-automatic mode . Sometimes it weirdly distorts the page in question . And occasionally , it does n't seem to do anything at all.Other issues:1 ) The Xcanex can compensate for the glare off of a glossy page , however it does so by means of tilting the scanner stand ( or laptop screen ) to a particular angle . Together with other variables involved in adjusting the scanner 's height , angle , etc. , this can be a hugely frustrating experience . Time will tell if it becomes less so with practice , but that 's what early experience with the scanner and it 's manual has yielded , for me . In addition , images `` snapped '' using the glossy setting are often dark or `` underexposed '' - not an insurmountable problem for anyone who owns a half decent image editing program , but I do believe that the gorgeous images shown on Xcanex 's own site are the product of ideal , vs. real world conditions , and may not be representative of your results , yada yada.I would love to post some of my own images here by way of example , and urge Amazon or Xcanex , as applicable , to facilitate same . ( Note that `` Share your own customer images '' is shown beneath the main product image for many , if not most of Amazon 's offerings . ) 2 ) The Xcanex is a resources hog . Yes , the bar is always being raised on processing power in computers , but the minimum specs given for systems installing this software are a little , um ... optimistic ? I was unable to do much with this software on my aging desktop - in fact I had anticipated as much , and getting this scanner was the push I needed to force some much-needed upgrades for my 2.4 GHz Quad Core system : I invested in some memory ( going from 3 GB to 8 ) , upgraded from a 32 bit to a 64 bit O.S. , changed out the old HD for SSD ... short of getting a new CPU and motherboard , I 'm not sure what else I could have done to accommodate PiQx 's hardware recommendations . All I can say is that I can have a dozen programs open on the desktop and be humming along happily - even when one of them is something piggy like CorelDraw - but if I activate the Xcanex , I need to bring the load on system resources WAY down , pronto . The Xcanex spikes CPU utilization to 100 % at or around the start of every scan , and it does n't cope well with having more than 8 or 10 images `` alive '' in the thumbnail panel.Oh , and you know how PiQx touts that you can scan more images while the last image `` snapped '' is still processing ? Not necessarily . For me , second only to Flatpage , forcing the Xcanex to multitask that way is the leading cause of major image distortion.3 ) The Xcanex is pretty ergonomic for a laptop ( works well in terms of portability and mobile space limitations ) , but for a desktop ... I tried putting it on a side table . You ca n't hold a book open at the same time you are trying to watch your adjustments on a screen way over to your right or left , oh , and run the keyboard at the same time . What 's a bit kludgy with a laptop is just ridiculous over the more spread-out desktop geometry . My solution is to position the Xcanex on its ( included ) desktop stand between my two monitors and shove the keyboard off to the side when it 's time to start scanning . Obviously this might not work for more space-limited desks , but I think that the convenience of the unit is somewhat lost , at least for a desktop environment , if you have to move and replace the whole scanner/pad assembly on a regular basis.4 ) The software is unintuitive . I 've given somewhere between 25 and 35 hours , so far , to testing the scanner in everyday use , consulting the manual as I go . I still do n't think I know the half of how to get the best image out of this thing . There are a fair number of variables , menu and icon graphics are not particularly helpful , and the interface seems to be very much written for a windows/ '' touch '' environment . Great if you 're using it on a tablet , not so much if your screen is n't touch or - gasp ! - you have n't yet acclimated to the idiosyncrasies of Win8 or IDevice environments . ( I 'm kind of good , there , but it 's still fairly kludgy software for me . ) At 90+ pages , the manual is useful I suppose as a start-to-finish read , not so much as a `` quick start '' reference . And really , how many of us devour manuals from cover to cover ? I strongly recommend users of this scanner reference the tutorial videos on the Xcanex website.I ca n't speak to the video features of this product because I really do n't video conference.Now after all that complaining , I still have to say that I love the potential that is abundantly evident in the Xcanex . It is no exaggeration to say that I have been waiting for this kind of scanner for *years* . Flatbeds are not particularly kind to books and magazines , sheet fed scanners ca n't accommodate them at all ( short of cutting the pages from the binding ) , and wand scanners like theWolverine PASS200 Handheld Portable Documents , Books and Photo Scannerare just plain disappointing in practical use . If PiQx can get the financial backing they apparently still seek - check their Facebook page and you 'll see that they are indeed looking - I think that the next generation of PiQx scanners , or maybe the one after that , will be A-Ma-Zing . That said , if you do n't have an urgent need for this kind of specialized scanner for research or what have you , I 'd say wait a few years.However , if you do have that need , or just a serious appetite for the latest and greatest , you 'll find plenty of value in PiQx Xcanex . I find I 'm using mine daily , and finally starting to make some small progress towards `` paperless '' in my own home office.Negative 3 stars for charging a fair chunk of change for a cumbersome , unintuitive interface , testy hardware ergonomics , and software that appears to be buggy or just not suited to less than ideal user situations . Five stars for innovation , potential and for the amazing things that the Xcanex CAN do , once you 've learned to work around the various `` hiccups '' .	-1
This multifunction printer came very well wrapped . Secure in every definition . Unpacking the printer took longer than setting it up . This was a very good sign , then ... Cons : Very minimal directions , if you can interpret the drawings you are ahead of the game.Paper tray is very flimsy , and if you pull too hard you are thrown across the room . The only thing that really works with this tray , is in-air flight.This printer is very finicky , it wants only HP paper or it clogs , spews and has a fit.Finally I got the paper to unclog and one piece of paper made it through the printer to scan.. However , the scanner was not satisfied and wanted another piece of paper . Good luck with that , I only have the energy to print once a week with this thing . I needed a vacation after all this aggravation.The printer is formatted to these words : no paper or paper jammed . I tried it in Spanish and the same phrases occurred.Pros : CD is very good , setting up of printer after you figured out the directionless directions .Wifi was easy to set up , CD program very fast and efficient.That is the end of anything positive.This printer sounds like it is going to fall apart if you ever get it to print.HP has delivered on the first part.Attractive packaging.CD works well.HP needs to work on the printing and jamming thingy . I purchased this printer to print , so far I have jammed paper . Not much call for jammed paper . I am sending all my jammed paper in the box back to HP.Not Recommended Unless You Have A Thing For Jammed Paper . prisrob 06-03-14	-1
What I like : -According to the company , these are made with Polypro , which is `` PVC Free and recyclable '' -clear view covers allow you to put a cover paper ( and also along the spine ) -two inside pocketsWhat I did n't like : -only one binder was shipped ; I was expecting a 4 pack-not as `` Heavy Duty '' as I expected ; -my binder looked dusty and used ; had a few marks that looked like it had already been used-cover feels fine , but the hinges look and feel weak-raised ring set has a 1/8 '' gap ; makes the binder rings not look sturdy if filled with paper-I was only able to get 170 pages into the rings ( not the 200 as advertised ) ; I have other 1 inch binders that can hold 200 pages-front cover was bent in the middle , raising the two corners up when closedObviously , there are lots of QC issues with these binders . It may be time for Wilson Jones Co. to evaluate their control/quality assurance plan and create a corrective action plan . Overall , I 've seen better regular/standard 1 '' binders that I would rather purchase , such as theAvery Economy Binder . For heavy duty use I can recommend theAvery Heavy-Duty binderor theAvery Nonstick Heavy-Duty . I 'm not partial to Avery , but I have yet to be disappointed with Avery binders.2-star rating ... and I 'm being generous .	-1
I buy lots of view binders each year . The brand I usually get is Avery and they are much better . The plastic covering the cardboard is shockinly thin . You hold it in your hands and you seem to just be looking at it waiting for it do fall apart at any second . The seams new are already failing , and it would take nothing to tear off the front and back from the spine .	-1
If you are looking for a standard white binder this is an okay choice , however , if you want something to last more than a semester in the standard kids backpack , look on . This is a pretty flimsy piece of work . It is nice that you can insert pages into the cover and spine but not an extraordinary feature.Overall I am underwhelmed and think the claim that this binder is & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; is really unbelievable.Not Recommended .	-1
Look , the other reviews that claim this binder ( I only received one from Amazon Vine ) is not & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; are certainly correct . And it 's true that there 's no indication on the product anywhere , that say it 's a Wilson Jones binder . The rings and mechanism for opening and closing this binder are fine , though the ring size itself is only one inch.Also , the reviews that say the plastic sleeves are thin and vulnerable to tearing/breaking , are correct . I ca n't imagine even using these sleeves for storing documents or anything else . This is an average binder at best , and not worth the price ...	-1
These binders are billed as the manufacturer 's `` strongest ever . '' If that 's the case , I 'll have to remind myself to look elsewhere for notebooks . The one that I got arrived with a completely torn rear outer cover ( the rip is about 8 '' across ) and the cover itself was warped and curved . Even the most generic of binders that I find at Staples ( or even the Dollar Tree ) is better quality.Because of the torn rear cover , no insert can be placed in this notebook and since I index the contents of my binders using inserts placed in the outer covering , this one is essentially useless ( unless I want to patch it up with shipping tape -- lovely ) .I 'm a writer , I live in an ocean of office supplies and organizing tools like binders . I think the company that shipped this needs to order some of their own supplies and see the junk that they are shipping to customers . Zero stars .	-1
I wouldn & # 8217 ; t call this a heavy duty binder , especially at this price point . This arrived with the spine already weakened and the binder rings making marks on the binder surface . The binder rings are round ( rather than D-shaped ) which generally limit the number of pages kept inside the binder . It also seems that repeated opening and closing of the rings will not last , especially with heavy use & # 8212 ; seems just as & # 8220 ; heavy duty & # 8221 ; as low end binders I & # 8217 ; ve worked with even though they are marked as & # 8220 ; SNAG FREE & # 8221 ; . The fasteners on my rings in fact already have some rust on them & # 8212 ; even when just owning the binder for a few weeks and being nowhere near water ! The plastic pocket inserts do seem tear/rip resistant , which is a plus . Other than that , you & # 8217 ; ll need to find something more durable for heavy use & # 8212 ; perhaps a binder with more of a plastic cover and thicker rings . I recommend you look elsewhere .	-1
So this just happened to arrive the same day as our office order from staples - which included several generic staples brand binders for our clinic . Having both at the same time in brand new condition allowed me to compare - and what I decided was that there is not only NOTHING identifiably heavy duty about these binders , but also that these will most likely not last as long as the generic binders we bought.The plastic covering has air under it , implying it will rip sooner than later , the clear covering where you slip the cover under - is also too loose . Sadly this is a very generic binder that I would not pay any more for than the ones you could just pick up at the dollar store .	-1
Despite Wilson Jones ' claims regarding their durability and longevity , these ring binders seem cheap and flimsy to me . Even for the reduced price you 'd pay by getting a 4-pack , I believe there are better choices . The actual ring unit seems well-designed and sturdy , so it 's unfortunate that these & # 34 ; Heavy Duty & # 34 ; binders seem so inadequate overall . I ca n't recommend this overpriced product .	-1
My wife needed four heavy duty binders for her graduate class so I asked Vine to send me one from the monthly newsletter . Let me just say that this is the one time that I received one unit ( instead of the four described ) and was happy not to get the other three.I was so surprised by the lack of quality that would allow the company to describe it as `` Heavy Duty '' that I went to Walmart and bought an Avery Dennison Heavy Duty binder and compared the two . The price was the same and the Avery Dennison unit was superior in every way : stronger construction , `` one touch '' rings , four interior pockets , and much larger rings and binder size to hold up to 540 sheets of paper.But sometimes a company will stand behind their product by having a good warranty to to offer you some protection . . So I emailed Wilson Jones customer service ten days ago and asked what their `` One Year Performance Guarantee '' really meant . As of today I am still waiting for their answer . Not good ! February 3 : I received an email from customer service explaining their warranty . If it develops a problem , has not been used improperly , is within the one year warranty , and you supply a proof of purchase , they will send you a new unit . Better late than never .	-1
Wo n't print SVG files borderlessly . Will not print borderless for all paper types and will automatically crop your image so forget about 'exactly what you see is what you get ' printing.I had a canon that broke while I was working with SVG vector files- I needed it borderless since I was making templates for things and needed it to be exact measurements- no scaling up or stretching to fit . I contacted Brother and they sent me their basic tutorial on their borderless prints trying to help but nothing worked . They said it may just not be capable of some file extensions ... the thing is it worked ( sort of ) but it would n't work for a borderless print with exact measurements . It was always cropping and leaving a border on the SVG 's . I tried PNG and it seemed to stop it all but I need to print in SVG so that did n't help me.The thing seems to be a nightmare where exact measurements are involved . Not sure if other models work or not but as this was my first try with brother I 'm not too happy.That all aside- When going to return the item because it essentially lied about the machine being able to borderless print the vendor had some additional instructions for mailing it back- one which was paying the shipping on your own and the other , which I found to be a total crock , pay a 20 % fee for restocking the item . Together all of that totals to half of what I paid for the thing ... so a 50 % loss . I guess I 'll be giving it to someone and spending the 50 bucks I would use to return it towards another printer.On a good note it seems to print nicely . Just beware if you are looking to borderless print as a standard use .	-1
I bought two of these . The one I bought for a friend . Perfect . This one . JUNK . Absolutely no technical support to speak of . Weeks later , waiting for them to call me so they can & # 34 ; Troubleshoot. & # 34 ; Nothing to troubleshoot . Bought two printers . One works . One is junk . Just replace it or repair . Still waiting ... .tap tap tap .	-1
*** Updated 11/30/2013 ***My unit is now completely dead . I ca n't even get a test page to print from the touchscreen on the printer . I my strong recommendation is to pass on this unit . It was flaky to begin with , but the short lifespan is a deal breaker . I deducted one star from 3 to 2 on my review . *** Updated 11/30/2013 ***Background : I have been dissatisfied with the Epson multifunction printers that I have had in the past , and I decided to give this one from Brother a try . I only have need for print , copy , and scan functions ; therefore , this review will not cover the fax ( we no longer have a landline to use it ) .Setup : The Quick Start Guide is very easy to follow , and the protective tape comes off with no issues either . I was able to connect to my hidden wireless network using the touchscreen on the printer . On the software side , the CD-ROM guides you through the process . I chose to do a custom install so that it would not install the unnecessary fax utilities . It gives you the option of registering your printer during software installation . You will need to write down the serial number located on the back of the device . After you do this , all that is left is the standard Windows reboot.Print : The installation process gives you the option of setting the Brother as your default printer , which I did . It comes up in PowerPoint , Word , and other print dialogs as expected . This is where the compromises at this price point start to show up . Black and white documents looked good , but users accustomed to laser printer quality will find the quality lacking . Text is readable , but I noticed a lack of sharpness - especially with colored text . On the plus side , the printing speed is noticeably faster than the Epson models I 've used.Copy : Single copies made directly on the glass are spot on accurate in their position , and black and white performs well . Color copies were disappointing . Solid blocks of color ( as you would see in charts and graphs ) are washed out compared to the original . In addition , copies from the auto-feeder are slightly off in positioning from the original , but not enough to be a concern . There was no difference in solid color quality from either method.Scan : Scanning performance mirrors copying almost identically ; however , the sharpness is somewhat decreased . Black and white scans for business documents will come through with more than sufficient quality.Other : This model comes with support for NFC ( near field communication ) , and I was able to print a picture from my Sony Xperia Z Tablet . It was a 4x6 photo , and printing was much slower than for documents . Quality of the print was good . Picture quality is actually quite a bit better than documents.Conclusion : This color multifunction printer from Brother does a lot at its price point . It is best a black and white documents and pictures , while color performance is only average . The NFC feature is nice , but this will appeal to a narrow user base .

The headline pretty much says it all . This thing developed a crack within hours of my putting it down on the floor . It also refuses to remain in place . I 'm not entirely clear which side is supposed to be down , but I tried both and neither side really stays in place . To make it worse , the `` lip '' mentioned in the title does n't seem to exist.Ultimately , I can not recommend this . It seems overpriced for what you get , and , as I said , no lip , too slippery and it cracked .	-1
This is a quite small chair mat , but it might work in a traditional office setup with a desk and not a lot of room to move the chair . The bigger problem is that ( despite being shipped flat ) the mat would n't stay put on the floor . It kept sliding around on the wood floor . Figured maybe I had it upside down , the other side was no better . Could n't find a lip of any sort on the mat . I 'm going to say `` meh '' to the whole item .	-1
I 'm always willing to try the ecologically responsible way of doing things , especially when it costs about the same as not going the recycling path . In this case , I had to recycle this cartridge after one attempt at printing . It left ink peeling off in two strips down the center of the page . I switched it out for a new HP cartridge and I 'm back to quality printing . I have never had good luck with recycled inkjet cartridges , either . Generally , they do not print well or at all , and the last one I tried was n't even recognized by the printer ( Canon ) . I like the idea of `` remanufactured '' ink and toner cartridges , but if companies can not make it work , they should not inflict their substandard products on the buying public .	-1
I was so disappointed with this laminator . I read the simple instructions and tried to laminate a business card , then two 8x10 papers and every time the items got stuck . The business card finally worked on the cold setting-although a little bit bent . The heated setting was even worse . Both papers got stuck and when trying to release the jam by hitting the reverse button , the papers crinkled in the machine . So frustrating when the instructions say that the papers will filter through automatically . I 'll try calling customer service and update review soon .	-1
The Black and Decker Flash Pro XL looks to be trying to occupy a niche between the needs of power users and value/portability-minded lighter users , and is failing both kinds of users in certain key areas.If you genuinely need a heavy duty laminator , it needs to be reliable , period , end of sentence . Integrated corner punches , blazing ( relative ) speed , and the rest are minor considerations compared to that one , and other users are right : I ca n't see how I would get a sheet out if ( when ? ) the unit jams , if the sheet ca n't always be expelled by selecting `` reverse '' . Why no release function , as with my older Fellowes Cosmic 125 ? ( More on that model below . ) If B & D ; does n't get ahead of that issue , I would say they did not think this model through.However : so far , under light usage , it is working reliably . In fact , I mistakenly laminated a 5 mil sheet at the 3 mil setting and the only difference in terms of the lamination quality was a bit of opaque hazing on the edges of the laminated sheet . There is power here , and you really do want to heed the warning to let the laminator cool off completely before putting it away - though the bottom stays cool enough to be no threat to normal work surfaces below ( that I can see ) , it does retain heat for quite some time after use . ( Still warm , for me , 1 hour after turning off the 3 mil heat setting . ) At 13+ pounds , it 's very heavy , relative to it 's size . There are some fragile bits on the bottom ( not integral to the usability or structural integrity of the unit ) - one of these chipped off , for me , during shipping.Light users might want to go with a lighter unit . The FlashPro XL is touted as portable , but really it wants to live and stay put somewhere . It 's awkward at best to carry around , with a thin and fragile exit tray that folds ( but does n't lock ) under the unit , in storage . The carrying `` handle '' is actually a recessed area that would be unwise to use as any kind of handle for the unit , in my opinion . I cradle the Flash Pro like the big old brick that it is to get it from hither and yon.Personally , I love myFellowes Cosmic 125 Laminator ( 5216001 ) , which is now a few years old . ( Since supplanted by the newerFellowes Cosmic 2 125 Personal Laminator , 12.5-Inch ( 5726301 ) . ) No , it wo n't take sheets greater than 8 inches wide , where the Flash Pro XL takes up to 12 '' on the short side . Yes , it takes about 5 minutes for the Cosmic to heat up for 3 mil processing , vs. about 1 minute for the Flash Pro XL . Yes , it takes close to a minute for the Cosmic to laminate one sheet vs. less than 15 seconds with the Flash Pro XL . But at 8 pounds with a genuinely functional handle , it 's a whole lot easy-breezier for me to take out and to put away , and unless I have all my sheets loaded , stacked , and ready to go , I do n't much need that speed boost . ( I 'm busy getting the next piece of paper squared up inside the laminating sheet . ) Ultimately , I 'd say that if you do need the speed , larger size capacity , and fast processing power , you might want to look around some more . Too bad , because something this solid overall should be the standard for mid-range laminating units .	-1
I too am having frequent jamming issues with this laminator . So disappointing ! It is very heavy and large . It seems like it would be sturdy and heavy-duty , but it started jamming on me after only a few test pages . I 'm not sure if I 'm doing something wrong , but seeing so many similar reviews makes me think it must be the device .	-1
I really want to love this heavy duty laminator ! We opened the box and were surprised to feel just how heavy it was ! We were pleasantly surprised to find the item came with 5 laminating pouches so that we could get started right away . Easy to operate ! 1-2-3 the first project slide threw like a charm and I have to tell you , we were pleased ! It was not flimsy at all ! Now for the second project - ummm total paper jam and it would not reverse itself . We put the `` cleaning '' paper in to see if that would help and that too was eaten . It is apparent that it got stuck on the roller . A quick call to customer service and they will `` swing by to pick it up '' , but they do n't know when or how . They just know they are creating a ticket for it . So , I guess I will update my review when I have more information . I think the one important thing to share is that this particular model does not have a `` release '' button in the event of a jam . If it gets jammed , there is a reverse button , but if it gets wrapped around the roller bar , there is n't much you can do about it.UPDATE : It looks like my negative review will have to remain . I have heard nothing back from Black & Decker . Customer Service has not followed through and issued a call tag for return on this item . It seems to me that customer service should be a priority on a $ 150 item . I have since gone and purchased the Swingline GBC Inspire Laminator ( retail is $ 49.99 , but paid less here at Amazon ) and am very pleased with it !	-1
I admit it . This is my FIRST laminator . Wanted one for over 30 years . I had no idea they were this heavy and was paranoid to find my mailman dropped this over the top of my 7 foot security gate ! But I opened it , laminated 3 pages of old USMC Mementos without any problems at all . I wish I could have had this all those years ago when my treasures were still in pristine shape . Not that I long to remember war , but I do long to keep awards and precious photos in a way to showcase and preserve them.On the 4th item , disaster struck . It jammed , reverse did n't work and now I have a useless mess and a useless machine . Much worse however ( to me ) is the lost USMC Citations lost in this machine ... ..I will try to get those replaced with duplicates but dealing with the government on something like this does n't seem like a probable success story . I am giving this 2 stars when all it deserves is 1 . Reason for this is 2 fold . First , I have to allow for the possibility that my mail carrier damaged it dropping it over my tall gate . The second reason is I am a rookie and maybe I did something wrong ? I may never know but I know I lost a LOT trying to preserve precious items ... ..But to be fair , I am unsure if the machine was damaged or if I am at fault so this is the most fair I can be.I also want to thank another reviewer for the tip on theFellowes Cosmic 2 125 Personal Laminator , 12.5-Inch ( 5726301 ) . Now that I have begun this task , I will buy this other Fellows model and try to get the job finished . I will try a LOT of meaningless test runs next time however since I am now so paranoid of losing valuable old treasures ... .I actually almost wish I just had never seen this available on Vine in the first place since what I have lost may just turn out to be irreplaceable .	-1
This is a great little kit but the price is outrageous . I got it through Vine and sent to my daughter in college ; she loves it because it 's a small set of things that will help her with studying , highlighting , and flagging text for reference , speeches , etc . It 's not worth $ 13.88	-1
I received this product for review from the Amazon Vine program . I thought there would be a lot more to this product based on the picture and price . When the box came in the mail it was so small I could n't remember ordering anything that size . I was very surprised to find out it was the Vine post-it kit . I think they could have put in twice as many products and still made a tidy profit . The post-its and stickers that were included were a nice assortment and high quality , there just were n't very many of them . If I was a student I would use up a whole box on a single book.What I usually do for note tags in books I ca n't mark up with writing is to buy bulk size packages of post-it type note pads and just cut them into strips . It works just as well more expensive book marker type post-its for a fraction of the cost .	-1
Worst of the worst . I ca n't get past printing a test page that I did n't ask for or want to print to begin with .	-1
I have a MAC and loaded software with no problem . Your are required to waste ink by printing a test , scanning the test and then printing it again . After the test I wanted to print with & # 34 ; Plain Paper , Best & # 34 ; but it was possum slow so I switched to & # 34 ; Plain Paper , Fast & # 34 ; several times but it would print only & # 34 ; Plain Paper , Best & # 34 ; which is not what I wanted . I kept trying to change the setting but the end result was & # 34 ; Plain Paper , Best & # 34 ; which is very slow ( more than 25 seconds per page ) . If you are wondering , I did check the setting several times before printing . HP sucks ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Was sent this to use and review and it did not come with a manual but we think we figured it out and were pleased with how the set up works , then it didn'tPositive side is the design is clean and crisp.Why would n't something come with a manual ? Top companies include a manual and clear instructions . Alas , we thought it was working but was n't . Disappointed .	-1
The stylus part of this pen is the best part . I 've found that it works very well and I do n't have any trouble using it . The pen , on the other hand ? Yeah , that 's the frustrating part of of the stylus pen . I find that the ink just does n't want to work very well . I had trouble getting the ink to come out when I first started using it and had to scribble quite a bit for it to work . Then the ink just never flows smoothly . I tried writing with it but it was very sporadic , where it would work fine one second and then fade the next . Very frustrating.So I 'm happy with one part of the pen but not with the other .	-1
What can you say about a pen ... ? It 's a gel pen , so that 's cool . I like gel pens . It writes smoothly ... that 's nice . As for the stylus ... I have a few devices that have touchscreens , and I generally just use my finger , and that works fine . When the devices were new , I went and bought a few styluses , and never used them , so even though I tried to use THIS stylus , it never really took . I suppose that , if you have really large hands and fingers , a stylus could be a big help . That 's up to you to decide . My main thing is this : This is a pen that costs almost twelve bucks . That 's just insane . I have a few really nice , high-end pens ( They were all gifts . ) , and while they 're all very nice , they generally run out of ink fairly quickly . Then you have to replace the ink . IT 'S A PEN . I ca n't be bothered . You can get comparable gel pens for much less , use your finger instead of a stylus , and pocket the cash you saved .	-1
When I first opened this package I was n't quite sure how to activate the pen . I thought that the clip was there just to put on clothing . I also thought that you would press down on the top of the pen to use it . I do n't care for the feel of the pen and the way that it writes . The ink does n't seem to glide onto the paper smoothly . I have to apply pressure while writing and the style is too fine for my liking . The stylus works ok .	-1
This thing eats ink like it was baby formula . I used this twice to print out a paper for school , and now half the ink in the cartridge is GONE !	-1
First , save your $ $ ! I have had nothing but problems with this printer.1 . It 's S-L-O-W and very loud when it prints . I can hear it from the second floor of my house -- the printer is on the 1st floor.2 . It constantly has paper jams3 . I frequently have to reprint because it frequently will use double sheets of paper ( see # 2 ) 4 . I have to use the reinstall disk on a permanent basis because the printer will automatically disconnect itself from the FIOS internet connection . This is where the printer fails most often ... as in several times per week.5 . Switching to a legal size paper requires 5 minutes of your time for set up EACH time you need to print something on legal.6 . The support section of the website should really list all the reason of WHY YOU ARE N'T GOING TO GET ANY !	-1
As a graduate student whose printer failed , I grabbed this as a reasonably priced alternative to finish my studies . It 's a lot noisier than the last one I had ( which was a Panasonic ) , and it goes through ink quickly . I 've had to replace ink a few times in as many months . Granted , I 'm printing quite a bit of schoolwork , but I 'm regretting not getting a laser at this point . I would n't buy this again .	-1
This Epson Workforce DS 510 scanner is in the same class as the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500 , so I compared It to my S1500 scanner . Unlike the S1500 , this scanner is TWAIN compliant.Setting up the Epson Workforce DS 510 scanner was as simple as sitting up any wired printer . Unpack the scanner , plug it into an outlet , install the software , and plug the USB cable into the computer.Included with the scanner , Vine reviewers also received a Reviewers Tip Sheet , a five page document explaining the features of the scanner and software , as well as setup directions . This was far more helpful than the QuickStart pamphlet that was included with the scanner that normal customer would receive . I would like to see Epson includes this with all scanners.The scanner itself has a nice heft to it and feels like a solid product . The document guides are easy to grasp and slide smoothly . Like the Fujitsu scanner , you need to open the top for inserting a document . The document catch tray slides out of the bottom of the scanner and optionally has a flip up piece to help control longer documents . Though you do n't need the catch tray open to scan a document , I recommend you do so to control pages coming out of the scanner . No , you probably ca n't catch them fast enough.For my first scan I scanned the previously mentioned Reviewers Tip Sheet . I inserted the pages upside down and backwards and pressed the little blue button . The scan speed is on par with the Fujitsu . The result , however , were not . Although this is a two-sided scanner it only scanned the first side of each of the pages . After flailing around for a while I discovered that the problem was not with the scanner , but with the software . Although you can set your preference for the scan button through the Control Panel , that does n't really seem to do anything as the software does what it wants anyways.The Epson scanner seems to be a bit more forgiving than the Fujitsu when feeding documents that are slightly wrinkled or may have a bent corner on the top of the document . There is also a slide selector on the scanner to allow you to scan folded documents , envelopes , etc . This is something the Fujitsu scanner does not have.ScanningAs with the Fujitsu , you put your documents in upside down and backwards . When you push the blue button nothing happens at first , then the software up starts , and then it scans . By contrast , the Fujitsu scans and then open the software when it 's done scanning . I prefer this method.Optional Carrier SheetBoth the Reviewer 's Guidelines and the manual make reference to using an optional carrier sheet for documents that otherwise you would be unable to scan . There is no mention on where to obtain a carrier sheet in either of these documents , nor is there any reference to it on this scanner 's product page on Epson 's website.Epson Scan SoftwareThe scanner utilizes the Epson Scan software . Though the manual for the DS 510 seems to indicate the scanner will automatically scan to a double-sided , that is not the case . It should be set to double-sided by default , not single sided . It does n't save your settings and YOU HAVE TO CHANGE IT EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU SCAN A DOCUMENT ! ! ! Document Capture Pro SoftwareBy default , the Document Capture Pro software installs itself when you install the scanner . Even though it 's a two-sided scanner software is set up by default to scan single-sided at 200 dpi . Realistically , 200 dpi is too low a resolution . The default should be 300 . The Fujitsu software is set up for two-sided scan , ignoring blank pages , so a single-sided scan still only shows up as one sheet . The Epson software should have been set up that way by default as well.TWAIN CompliantThe one saving grace of this scanner is that it is TWAIN compliant and therefore I can scan directly from PaperPort , bypassing the Document Capture Pro software entirely . This is my preferred method of capturing documents . However , you still have to tell it `` two-sided '' every single time you run the program.Bottom LineFrom a hardware standpoint this is a very good scanner . It 's compact so it does n't take up a lot of desk space like a flatbed does . Scan speeds are fast and two-sided color scanning is a big advantage . However , the software is so user unfriendly it 's just not worth the hassle .	-1
What I like this scanner is that it is fast , it duplexes and it produces nice clean images.What I do n't like about the scanner is that it is not wireless and requires a USB connection to operate . We are now in a wireless world and many top scanners are not only wireless , they have apps which send the product directly to an iPad or Droid tablet.The duplexing software does not eliminate blank pages . This is a software fix , but it should have been addressed before release . Finally , the 15 sheet paper feeder is undersized . Fifty sheets is the tolerable minimum these days..In 2009 I would have raved about this scanner . As we near 2014 , I am underwhelmed .	-1
Bottom line : Good hardware , terrible software . The result is a scanner that 's okay for Windows users , roughly on par with the Fujitsu iX500 , depending on intended use . For Mac users , it 's a disaster , and should be avoided until and unless Epson addresses the software issues.The details : I tested this scanner in three different environments : Windows XP , Windows 7 , and Mac OS X 10.9.1 ( `` Mavericks '' ) . First , the good news : On Windows , the scanner functioned pretty much as advertised . Although installing the software for the first time was a slow process ( taking over 20 minutes -- why ? ? ) , once the install completed , there were no errors or other issues to speak of . The one-touch scan button worked as you would expect right from the start . Scanning directly to Google Drive worked without a fuss , as did creating a searchable PDF . Scanning speed was good , and quality was also good . There was only a small delay for additional processing when creating a searchable PDF.The biggest drawback is the software . For both Windows and Mac , there are actually three separate programs to control the scanner : Epson Scan Settings , Epson Scan , and Document Capture Pro . The Epson Scan Settings app is n't really an application -- it has very limited functions , and can be mostly ignored by the user . The other two applications , however , are full-fledged scanning programs , each with its own settings and functions , many of which overlap . Knowing which app to use and where to configure settings can be a challenge.That 's unfortunate , because the default settings are probably not the best for most users . For example , the option to `` skip blank pages '' is turned off by default . That means you 'll get a blank page in your PDF file for the back of any single-sided sheet you scan , until you find and change this setting.But if the software is bad on Windows ( and it is ) , it 's even worse on the Mac . On Windows , the applications look and feel like they were written 8 years ago . On the Mac , the software literally looks like something from 1998 . And I do mean literally : the style and appearance matches the Mac OS from 1998 , complete with rudimentary black-and-white wristwatch icon to indicate when the program is busy . Worse , it 's prone to crashing often , and some features are n't offered or do n't work with OS X 10.9.From the very beginning , the experience of setting up the scanner on Mac OS X was plagued with crashes and errors . After installing the software , the Epson Software Update application automatically opened to check for updates . Software Update reported that there were no updates to the Epson software available , so I quit the updater and tried to open Epson Scan Settings to set my preferences . The result was an error message : `` Can not find necessary files . Please re-install the software . '' Next , I tried to open the Epson Scan application . The application simply crashed ( `` EPSON Scan quit unexpectedly '' ) . Reopening resulted in the same error.Resolving these issues required several rounds of updates using the Epson Software Updater . Each time I ran Epson Software Update , a new update was found that had n't been listed previously . Even after repeated updates , reinstalls , and troubleshooting , some key functions simply failed to work , or were n't available . The one-touch scanning button , for example , never worked with the Document Capture software . It worksedwith the Epson Scan app , but not Document Capture . The ability to create a searchable PDF simply is n't offered in the Mac version of Epson 's software , either.In summary , this scanner is serviceable in a Windows environment , and works largely as advertised by the manufacturer . It 's roughly equivalent to the similar model from Fujitsu , with the added advantage of TWAIN drivers for those who need such a thing . It 's also slightly less expensive at current prices.In a Mac OS X environment , however , this scanner is a dog . A better alternative for Mac users would be the Fujitsu ScanSnap , which offers a much better software user experience , a smoother installation , and the ability to create text-searchable PDFs when scanning.For both Windows and Mac users , the Epson does n't offer much reason to purchase it over other , similar scanners . If you do n't need the TWAIN driver that the Epson offers , or do n't plan to purchase the additional network interface Epson offers as an optional add-on , you wo n't be missing anything by picking up a Fujitsu ScanSnap instead .	-1
Looking to replace my tired Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500M ( on my Mac ) I thought I 'd give the Epson a try . While the scanning is fast , easy and clear , the software falls way short . I wo n't rehash all the other software reviews here , suffice to say the software is bad . The software issues are enough for me to go back to Fujitsu and buy the iX500 . For an additional ninety bucks or so , it 's well worth the additional cost . I just do n't see any advantage in the Epson , again on the Mac . In the words of Sheldon Cooper & # 34 ; In a world that already includes the Big Boy , why would I settle for something like a Big Boy & # 34 ; I believe that applies here , go with the ScanSnap for Mac applications . Windows users may have better luck .	-1
I really wanted to like this desktop scanner . It has double-sided , color , multi-sheet feed and ability to output to many different destinations and formats . While all of these features are exactly what I need , unfortunately , the Epson software is just terrible . The UI is terrible , the features are hard to understand , there are like 4 different pop-ups that come up when I scan just 1 page.There is only 1 & # 34 ; scan & # 34 ; button on the scanner itself , which is mapped to a single settings profile . So , unless you do exactly the same thing every time you scan , you 're going to have to use the software ( not the scanner hardware button ) to initiate your scan . The biggest thing that changes for me when scanning is whether the document is single or double sided . There should really be a button on the scanner that controls this , or an auto-detection in the software . But alas , each settings profile is hard-coded to either single sided or double sided.So , while the feature list does look impressive and comprehensive , unfortunately , actually using this scanner takes 2-3 times longer per scan than other similarly-sized and priced scanners I have used .	-1
This is a nice compact scanner and it scans both sides of pages . Plenty of app type options for scanning control methods . But , it 's not making true images for me . I 've experimented with trying to feed the pages slightly differently , but keep getting crooked images with blacked out segments . Seems like the mechanism that pulls the page through does n't present the paper to the image capture area smoothly . I contacted the company 's tech support - they told me to try recalibrating , which I did and that did not help . Passed that on to tech support and never heard back . Maybe they know it 's expected ? Anyway , I ca n't recommend this scanner based on my experience with it and with the company .	-1
The scanner looks cool , and has two cool stands and document return . That is about all good things I can tell about it.The scanner is not plug and play at all.The software for it is browser-based . You need to register first and then install their software , and then use one of the services ( like dropbox or google drive ) so the software sends scans to the service.You can use the scanner to save scans to your computer , but there is no way to specify folder where you want to send it . And no , it is not in your documents folder . I had really hard time finding the folder.It also only scans in pdf , and can not scan pages longer then legal size , which means you can not scan your receipts.You can not change the email you used to register the scanner . And you have to verify the email before it lets you install the software.When I tried to scan 14 page document , it would only show me ( tiny ) preview for the first , second and fifth page , and when I tried to send it to that hard to find folder , it said there was an error and it can not be saved . I found it did save the pdf in the folder , but some pages were distorted ( as if the document did n't feed smoothly ) , and some had been cut in half lengh wise.There is autocrop function , and it thinks that dark blue background with white text is not something you want to be included in your images . Fortunately , you can disable this function.I also tried to access the scanner through windows control panel , and then could choose the file destination and file format . Do not forget to uncheck `` prefeed '' ( go to scan properties - > advanced ) This whole experience was so frustrating , especially compared to my other scannerBrother DS-820W Wireless Document Scannerthat worked right out of the box , could scan long receipts and let me save files as I wish .	-1
Umm , I 'd rather use my iPhone or iPad to take photos of documents - they come out much clearer and are easier to distribute via e-mail , Cloud , test message , etc.I travel every week for work and have hundreds of receipts to deal with . I thought SimpleScan would be a nifty thing to have around . Here are my thoughts after using it for a few weeks : - what separates SimpleScan from other portable scanners it its ability to upload documents to the Cloud and work with apps like DropBox , Evernote , etc.- I do like that it can be positioned vertically to conserve desk space- it is light at 1lb , but still adds bulk to my laptop bag - I already carry an iPhone and iPad and do n't see this SimpleScan as being that essential that it 's worth carrying around too- the software and general use of the scanner is very cumbersome . It has been down more than it has worked and I 've wasted a ton of time trying to troubleshoot it.- the scan quality is really what seals the deal against this scanner for me - it 's TERRIBLE . I got distorted documents , missing characters , and the list goes on . It 's not even good enough to scan receipts , much less important documents.It 's not the most expensive portable scanner out there but given it 's faults , I would n't even pay $ 20 for it . SimpleScan has a lot of work to do before this scanner is ready for prime time .	-1
Very expensive and small cartridges , neverbuy epson again ! Hp is cool ! ! ! Check ink prices before you buy . And you will save money such way .	-1
After being generally unimpressed with the quality of this printer on normal paper ( there are visible offsets from one print stripe to the next , though the color is well done ) I tried it with glossy photo paper . Hello , antiquing ! The ink pools and separates on both HP and Kodak premium glossy paper ( both of which are rated for inkjet printers ) and is notably wet when it emerges from the printer , and for several minutes afterwards . Though it was a new printer , I tried head cleaning and nozzle checks to no avail . In my opinion , there are btter printers for the price point and this model should be avoided . A commentor to this review pointed out that Epson paper could avoid the issue with the photo paper . My Canon printer works fine with this photo paper , and personally I do not like having to be locked in to a particular brand of photo paper . If buying a particular brand paper does not bother you , it could improve the print quality for photos . I still do not think that the printer does a great job and it is relatively pricey for a desktop printer . We also own this printer and prefer it to the Epson for regular and photo printing.Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner , Copier and Fax	-1
I want to like this printer , it 's got all the fancy bells and whistles that get your attention ... but that 's what they are there for , to get our attention and take it away from all the issues . I 've had 3 different Epson printers recently , a Epson WorkForce WF-M1030 which I hate and plan to donate and a large format WorkForce WF-7510 which I actually like but that 's probably just because it 's my only large format and I use it mainly for printing scrapbook paper ( ie it does n't have to be wonderful , I 'm not using it as a photo printer etc ) . I was hopeful this one could become my go to printer for documents , crafting , and photos ... I 've never had a printer with this many ink cartridges before and ( wrongly ) assumed that would mean clearer images and better colors.Other reviewers have gone into details regarding the substandard photo printing , and I experienced the same thing ... trying different papers ( even Epson branded ) did n't make much difference , colors were n't as expected and the images were as crisp and clear as using my old standby Canon printer . I do like the dedicated photo paper tray , but again if the photos are n't great it 's not that useful . My biggest gripe is that I normally keep a couple different types of paper loaded in my printers , 4x6 photo ( if it 's a printer with a dedicated tray ) , inexpensive general purpose , and a heavier higher quality paper for craft use . My canon I can load all these in w/o issue using the back tray and built in lower trays but this Epson only allows you to load one page at a time in the rear tray , and not only that but you must hit a button on the printer each time you do to tell it to load that paper ... so much or wireless , I have to be right next to the printer and babysit it in order to print on my paper . That right there is a total deal breaker for me . It 's also CRAZY slow at printing in color . The only thing that worked well and as expected was set up and wireless printing , even having to go online so I could get it loaded to my macbook everything was fast and it printed wirelessly on the first try . I honestly ca n't think of anyone to recommend this printer to . The extra ink carts do n't equate to better prints , just more money . The gimmicky features of it opening/closing itself just take extra time and are annoying and the inability to load paper in the rear tray w/o having it be one sheet at a time is horrible . Stay clear .	-1
I had a bit of difficulty setting this printer up . Other wireless printers have been easier . The controls work well enough but for some reason it kept saying there was something left in the printer where I unpacked it . There was n't . I checked , checked , ran the install over and over and it kept happening . I turned it off , and back on , and it still happened . Finally I turned it off in frustration . After I let it sit for a while , then it worked with no problems . ( I never did clean anything out of it , it was just reporting wrong . ) If you DO buy this printer , and run into that issue , try turning it off for a few minutes , then try it again from the start.This printer is nice and boxy , and I do like that . I love that you can sit things on top of it because the top is flat . For a wide format printer , it 's not very big . My huband designs homes , and so the blueprints require 11x17 . I 've certainly paid more for a wide format printer - this IS a good price on one . We had no problems printing blueprints done with VisionRez.However , I do suggest that other printers are better for printing blueprints . I am not sure , but this printer seems like it is designed to handle 11x17 more for other purposes , because the 11x17 has a feed in the back , and the trays do n't handle it . We 'd rather have a tray that holds the paper so you can print multiple pages in a design set more easily.For regular home use , if you are printing your own photos , you might like this printer . My own purposes usually are blueprints , documents , and lots of coupons . The ink is WAY too expensive for these purposes - a refill set is around 50.00 ! Even the off brands are over 25.00 ! Also , for avid coupon printers , there 's just not enough capability to the trays to hold paper ! I MUCH prefer the workforce 645 which holds a whole ream- there is NOTHING more frustrating than missing a good coupon because your printer ran out of paper and by the time you got more in , either the coupon was 'sold out ' or some funky java printer would not let you retry your print.This printer is very fast , and it comes boxed very securely . I 've reviewed a lot of printers , and have owned many more than that , and this packaging was great - it was very tight and secure . I had NO issues with that.The scanner and copier work fine - it does have slots for SD , MSDuo , and CF cards . It also has a USB slot.I do not like all the fancy moving parts on this printer . While it is nice not to have your papers all in the floor because you forgot to pull the catcher out , having it automated and motorized , to me , is just another thing that can tear up.The tractor pulls the paper ok , but there 's a second tray for smaller photo paper above the main tray . IF that thing gets pushed in to far , the printer display will say the printer has no paper in it , and take it 's own sweet time doing it . There 's some little arrows and if you have those lined up , it will work fine . If that tray gets pushed back though , and you do n't realize this , it can be VERY frustrating.It does print CDs and seems to be a printer more for people looking to print photos and do art type projects . The prints are very clear and Epson ink is well known for being awesome for this purpose . It 's just not a workhorse . I suppose before buying this printer , just think carefully about your intended use . IT MIGHT be the printer for you , but for me it is too expensive and not well suited to my kind of heavy , daily use .	-1
Yes..this one . I usually LOVE Epsons but this one should be returned ... if I could . It prints fine but there is so much wrong with the printer.First it 's picky at software compatibility . It prints fine with Word but heaven forbid you want to print with Print Shop . You wo n't get anything to print.Next , you ... .can ... .only ... .print ... one ... 11x17 ... .sheet ... .at ... ..a ... .time . That kills it for me . When I print 11x17 , I print more than one at a time . I would & # 34 ; think & # 34 ; most people would ! It even STOPS you if you have more than one sheet at a time . ( Pay attention to this one unless you do n't care about 11x17 printing but then why are you even considering this printer ? ) Finally , and this one baffles me , the scan area is only 8.5x11 . Now why would you create a printer that prints 11x17 paper and limit the scan area to such a small dimension ? Yes , set up was easy and footprint is small but the three reasons above made me wonder why Epson put this machine out . If you 're looking for an 11x17 printer I 'd look elsewhere . This is n't a very good one .	-1
If you really want to print your own photos this will do it . Hands down - incredible pictures . The small learning curve is to make sure you have the right settings for quality and type of paper . Once you get that you wo n't be able to tell the difference between photo store prints and those made with this printer.Update : Printer head clogged after the second set of ink , since it was after 30 days I called Epson and they immediately sent out a new one . Now , the reason for 1 Stars : The new one came and I sent the old one back with the delivery driver . The new one was `` refurbished , '' not new ( I was told it was an unused return when I called for the replacement ) . It also did not have a power cord which I had sent back to Epson with the old printer . Have spoken with 2 customer service reps ( who will NOT escalate my call to next level support ) how both say they have to `` research whether I am entitled to a cord . I even offered to pay for it but they would not do that without `` research . '' What good is a product no matter how nice if it is not backed up by the manufacturer . Worst customer service ever .	-1
Do n't waste your money.It is totally junk.Customer service told me it was a problem with my computer so he did not have to hep me anymore .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER ! We got this printer a couple of months ago . It has a really cheap plastic feel . It is a really crazy set up where you have to close the exit drawer to load paper . The paper drawer just slides on the desk . It is all very awkward . It printed OK so I was wiling to put up with the craziness and cheap feel , but then the complimentary ink ran out . Well it has been nothing but trouble since that time . Yes , we have bought genuine Epson ink and we can not get it to print color stuff . It is all streaked and weird looking . We have cleaned the print heads . ( Be prepared to use up about 1/6 of the ink cartridge to do that chore . ) We have aligned the print heads . We have done these things multiple times . We went and bought a new pack of all the colors including the two black cartridges and went through it all again and still it does not print correctly . This thing is a piece of junk and we have wasted over $ 200 including the ink . Just DO N'T buy this printer .	-1
I just received the printer today . I did make a copy when set up was completed & the quality of text is excellent . However , setup took several hours & proved to be the longest & most difficult of any of the previous seven I have done . Inserting ink cartridges was easy . But , the touchscreen is extra sensitive & wrong numbers or letters came up . This printer could n't locate my home Wi-Fi for a wireless set up . Then , after 30 minutes it mysteriously appeared . There are two paper trays . The small special size one came out but I could n't locate the regular one . I finally found it all the way back inside the printer . Then I could n't figure out how to put the paper in the tray . It was n't like any other tray I 've seen ; there was a plastic piece directly sticking way up in the center . I finally realized I had to press it down & move it all the way to the top . Also , when I finished setup & wanted to make a copy I placed my paper under the thinnest , cheapest plastic cover I ever saw . I placed the paper I wanted to copy to the far left , where I have always done so on any all in one printer or copy machine . Well , it did n't print correctly . I finally figured out that on this printer your paper goes to the extreme right of the glass . All of these difficulties are why I only gave two stars . All previous printer setups went much quicker & that includes an Epson 645 Workforce . I will update my review as time passes & I use the printer more to let everyone know how it preforms ; and if the difficult setup was worth it .	-1
First , the good:1 ) Driver support for Windows 8 and OS X Mavericks is outstanding . Everything installs as it should , and there 's no loss of functionality across platforms.2 ) The printer 's size is comparative to other multifunction printers without document feeders.3 ) Well , it did n't commit suicide , which is more than I can say for this printer 's brother , theEpson XP-800 -- easily the worst printer I 've ever owned , spanning nearly fifty printers since 1988.Which flows in to the bad : After four ( yes , that 's right , they had to replace it four times ) replacements in about six months on the XP-800 , I swore I 'd never endure another 45-minute support call just to let another Epson printer darken my doorway again.Well , never say `` never '' , I guess . After some time , I thought the XP-800 was just a fluke , and Epson had surely made some improvements . Maybe even enough improvements to restore my faded memories of my beloved Stylus 740 from the late 90's.To my horror , the XP-610 is basically that godawful XP-800 , without the document feeder.As with the XP-800 , this printer slams ink like a frat boy at happy hour , and the print quality does n't have the classic Epson look that used to command a premium.Do n't consider this printer . Grab another $ 10 and get theCanon Pixma MG4220 .	-1
Obviously there are all sorts of printers out there , a huge choice . But this is the one I wanted . Why ? Easy . It is smaller and lighter than most but lacks nothing . It is fitting into what little space I could free up and is easy to pack up and take with me when I need a flat screen scanner to copy family photographs . Which I do . The other kinds of scanners that are more portable simply will not work as the wand ones do n't provide adequate reproduction for photos and I ca n't send precious old photos that are in the possession of a worried relative through the sheet-fed ones . So this is about the least weighty , bulky and most portable - and able - scanner combo I can find.It is true that this machine is willing to do every print chore I need , including photos , and do it well . It is willing to operate wirelessly if need be . It is willing to do copying chores that otherwise cost me a trip to one of the copy shops . And as I said , it scans in the optimum manner.Several not-so-little negative notes here : The software disabled my computer 's firewall despite being denied permission to do so . When I restarted my computer , a program identified as `` LTCM Client '' had been installed in addition to the Epson items . I immediately uninstalled it and want to put this information out for all.And THEN . I had to call Epson 's Customer Support . Twice . That is because the directions were not at all clear and I have not recently set up a printer . The two males I spoke with , whose English was heavily accented and not easy to understand , were very polite but the second one asked for the serial number and then informed me that the machine that I had just received was `` over a year old and out of warranty '' . I see that another reviewer reports the same . I think if this is a corporate policy , to dissuade customers from making good when they receive defective machines , we should `` out '' them . Anyone else ? 4/14/2014 update : Found out the hard way why I will never buy nor recommend Epson . I had just started a time-sensitive print job ( I do n't print much ) when suddenly the levels of ink remaining flashed on the computer screen - like a warning . This was accompanied by a blatant reference to the Epson website to purchase more . Now let me make it clear that the graph showed that I did have ink left in the lowest cartridge - black , of course - yet the software shut off the print job right there in the middle , refused to complete . This appears to be designed to make you panic and buy their overpriced cartridges , which will obviously take several days to arrive . Twenty-three dollars for the regular black cartridge and nineteen each for the other four . If I went down to the local office supply store , the black would be the same and a multi-pack sixty-seven dollars and forty-nine cents . You can see that the cost of the ink approaches the cost of the printer . Ridiculous . And I had printed so very little since installing the printer ! ! Apparently there 's very little ink in each cartridge . Something really wrong here , folks.I had to spend my precious time and money going to the local library to print after making a phone call to determine how to deal with the lack of printed material I needed for this time-sensitive project . Now I wo n't know until I have the printer back up , whether I have successfully cancelled the no-longer-needed print order . Plus I wo n't be able to copy the needed papers because the blasted thing wo n't work until the ink gets here . Blatant manipulative , disgusting policy plus a real PITA . If you like this kind of treatment , go ahead and buy an Epson .	-1
The XP-610 is a decent printer but the reason I gave it one star is because of the Epson software . I told the Printer installation that I did not want a Toolbar . It installed it anyway and set a bypass to the computer 's firewall . This toolbar software would then surreptitiously communicate with Epson or the Toolbar company on things you do unrelated to the Printer that you installed.The Printer installation also installed Epson Customer Participation software that will gather additional information . There was no request as to whether I wanted this also.I take exception to any software that attempts to communicate with a company behind my back and without my knowledge or permission.How did I find this ? My firewall notifies me of any unrecognized attempt to communicate with my network or the internet . I can then allow or block the request . In addition it saves which software program it was . This allowed me to see what specific program made the attempt and then delete that program.In the end , I deleted the Epson printer from my wireless network and uninstalled all the associated programs . But to remove it required uninstalling 7 separate programs . I tried using this printer with the direct USB connection and the Epson software still tried to go out to internet surreptitiously . At the time when this attempt was made , I had already disconnected the printer from this computer 's USB port.Wireless printing is convenient but it appears that some companies are taking advantage of the fact that to get a wireless printer to work , you have to allow it to communicate through your firewall . That means the printer ( software ) has access to your computer and the internet.Printer features and quality are good but it appears to have some glitches . I tried cancelling a print and the printer just sat there forever `` cancelling '' until I shut off the printer . The supplied documentation is sparse.I have had HP , Brother , Canon and Epson printers before , right now I have a Brother MFC-J870DW Printer and I prefer it over the Epson XP-610 . It is easier to use , never glitches and print quality is excellent.The other problem with the Epson is that if you choose Epson ink , the regular cartridges will cost you $ 75 while the XL cartridges will cost $ 99 .	-1
The xp series is the most unreliable trouble prone printers I have ever experienced . The ink system is the problem . Clogs , requires numerous clean cycles which waste a lot of ink and sometimes will not resolve the problem . DO NOT buy one of the XP models !	-1
So lets be clear here , epson has perfected the art of making a cheap good looking printer that will fall apart at the first sign of trouble . This is my third epson printer in 3 years.My first two printers , an Epson WP-4530 , and this printers predecessor , the XP-600 , both died exactly the same way . After about a year of very minor duty ( perhaps no more than 500 pages each ) , each printer jammed , stripped its gears and died . In both cases I had expensive ink tanks that i was n't able to use . I called epson to see about fixing my expensive , supposedly business class WP-4530 , their suggestion ? Have it fixed by a third party at $ 135/hr , or they offered me a discount code to buy a new printer . The WP-4530 is theoretically rated for a duty cycle of 20,000 pages each.Hope springs eternal though right ? I scaled back my print ambitions and got an XP-600 and once again , after a year and no more than 500 pages it jammed , stripped its gears , and was dead . Coincidence ? Me thinks not . I know the days of the tank HP 4m printer that runs off 200,000 pages before needing major maintenance are gone but still , GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER EPSON . These printers are AWFUL.Listen here , you 're not saving any money buying a cheap printer BECAUSE YOU 'RE GOING TO BE REPLACING IT EVERY YEAR . I ca n't tell you how many Epson ink cartridges I 've thrown out because the printer they were for broke.Do yourself a favor , spend a more and buy a better ( probably non-Epson ) printer . If you do decide to buy this printer , be aware it will work well for a year and then you 're cooked .	-1
Purchased the previous version , XP_800 , last year from Amazon . After about six months it stopped printing black and a new cartridge did not resolve the problem . Epson sent a refurbished replacement . Needed a printer so made an emergency purchase at the local Staples of the XP-810 . After about three months it will no longer print black even with new cartridges . These were my first two Epson printers and am very frustrated that both printers developed the same problem so early and disappointed that the 810 is no better than the 800 it replaced . The replacement cartridges are genuine Epson and no generic or refilled have been used in either . Checked on the internet and this seems to be a widespread problem with these printers . I regret having purchased them.Contacted support and after completing a series of maintenance procedures without resolving the problem they are sending a refurbished replacement which is projected to arrive in five to seven business days.The maintenance procedures consume a considerable amount of ink . The ink used in the maintenance and testing cost about half the price of the printer . Can not comprehend how Consumer Reports tested these and did not encounter these problems . Gives me reservations about relying on Consumer Reports testing and recommendations .	-1
I do a lot of letter writing to family and friends with fountain pens for the personal touch . This pen is very difficult to hold because it is slippery and you ca n't grip it well . Much better are the five star Lamy pens with the contoured grip for fingers and thumb .	-1
I was excited to get this pen , being a big fan of fountain pens generally , and classy , attractive ones in particular . But the problem is , I ca n't yet figure out how to get the ink cartridge installed into the pen in such a way that the ink flows correctly . And it came with no instructions . You can call this review unhelpful if you like , but to me the most important aspect of any product is its usefulness , and knowing now how difficult it is to make this item useful to me , I would not purchase it , no matter how well it might work once I am able to set it up properly . It 's the same reason I do n't buy stuff from Ikea . I like things to work right out of the box . If I wanted something difficult to assemble , I would have gotten a jigsaw puzzle .	-1
If I were to spend $ 15+ on a pen , it would have to be pretty spectacular . So when I ordered this Pilot MR Animal Collection Rollerball Pen from the Vine program , I expected to be mighty impressed . Upon receipt , the packaging indicated I might very well be . Double boxed with a magnetic-close flap , the pen arrives in a bed of satin . The oohing and aahing sadly ended there.Once removed from the casing , the pen feels like cheap plastic as opposed the weighty metal I anticipated . Yes , the python accent is a nice touch but it is very small . Other than that , this Pilot MR rollerball pen looks and feels exactly like the ones you might receive free through the mail as a promotional item . The cap is frustrating as well and always seems to be coming detached from the bottom of the pen when I & # 8217 ; m using it . Alas , the writing quality is nothing to write home about either . It & # 8217 ; s okay , but as is typical with most rollerballs it is not as smooth and fluid as I , a frequent writer , would like.Bottom line : Unless this one goes down dramatically in price , don & # 8217 ; t waste your money .	-1
The Pilot MR Animal , I am reviewing the 'Python ' accented version , is a capped pen . I 've never run across a quality pen with a removable cap . All the capped pens I 've used in the past have been basic bargain pens.I worry that the cap could become lost . Closed the cap clicks tightly to the body but when placed on the end so you can write ( or worse , left on the counter or desktop ) it is n't all that secure.The pen is handsome as pens go . The silver matte finish of the body does n't pick up fingerprints and has a nice smooth feel . Unfortunately the python skin accent looks like it was printed with an old dot-matrix printer . It does n't look much like real snake skin . It 's just blotches and patterns of black ink on a dark copper band that 's about 5/8 's of an inch wide.The pen writes well . It feels smooth and the ink flows nicely with no skipping or blotching . This was advertised as having a fine point but it writes a little thicker than what I expect from a fine point pen . It 's closer to medium than fine.My biggest problem with the Pilot MR capped pen is the edge of the body where the cap stops is sharp and when I hold the pen ( I 'm a lefty if that makes a difference to anyone ) the edge digs into my fingers and is uncomfortable.I 'm not really impressed by the pen . To be honest , it 's just a pen and not all that special . The snakeskin print accent is done badly and to me detracts from the look . Had it been a plain copper or brass accent I think it would have been far more appealing .	-1
This is a really attractive pen -- looks like the picture . The snakeskin design of the trim is original , ,\ and the pen feels fine in my hand , not too heavy . The box is nice -- would be good for a gift . But I 'm sorry to report that the pen I got skips . To give an example -- I just wrote the word `` big . '' and a part of the tail of the `` g '' is missing . Now I tend to write quickly and do n't press hard . But with a number of different brands of pen I can buy for one dollar I have no problem . I mean , I never have this problem . With this pen I have to really concentrate to keep a steady pressure in order to write without skipping . I have used the pen enough that if the problem were going to go away it would have by now . Alas , it has not . So I 'm going back to my cheap BIC which is n't pretty but does not skip ! Maybe I just got I bad one ? Would hope so , because this pen really is so lovely to look at .	-1
It 's like a flashback to 1995 . The software install was horrible , multiple systems could n't recognize it without doing a lot of manual configuration . Has network connection but only plug , no Wi-Fi ( hello , we 're going into 2014 ) . Unit gets very hot in multi page output and puts out quite a stinky smell . Paper magazine is very strangely configured . Scanner is slow . Page feeder ca n't hold many docs . No fax capability so not really an all in one . Setup interface is archaic and requires you to study the manual for basic things.Overall , this is a junker that 's not going to see any more action in my home setup . My dell color printer ( see my other reviews ) blows this thing away by a mile . It 's like someone found a cache of these in a warehouse from yesteryear and now wants to clear them out .	-1
After three hours on hold with various levels of Ricoh tech support I was told that there is no Mac driver for this printer . None . And none forthcoming . So I ca n't report on how it works . This is a WIndows ONLY printer/scanner/copier.Very disappointing . Nothing on the Amazon description noted that it was Windows only .	-1
Though I 've owned a number of all-in-one printers in the past , my experience with this Ricoh Aficio SP 204SN Wireless Monochrome Multifunction Laser Printer has been the most frustrating.It arrived at my door in pieces that I could not configure . Though the directions give detailed drawings of the front , the back assembly of these pieces is lacking . I eventually learned through through another source that they are actually covers for two different sizes of paper . After that , I could only properly install one of them . Even after several attempts , I never was able to install the other.After a lot of wasted time trying to set this copier up , imagine my disappointment to find the software to print is not even compatible with my computer 's operating system ( Mac OSX ) ... *Update : Since my initial review , the product description has changed to include : ( windows only ) . Thank you !	-1
The product title is now updated stating that it 's Windows only.The previous title was `` Ricoh Aficio SP 204SN Wireless Monochrome Multifunction Laser Printer with Color Photo Scanner and Copier '' It was after a lot of searching on their website to try to get the driver to find out that it does not work with Mac.Glad the title says so now , but laser printers are often used in office environments which usually have Macs and PCs.For the price , you can find a printer that is compatible with Windows and Mac and not have to worry about the issue if someone in your office has a mac , if you get a mac , or if a guest needs to print and they have a mac.The other quirk is that the paper loading tray is n't set to the standard letter paper size . You have to adjust , actually extend the tray to fit letter paper .	-1
I really do n't like this item . I was expecting so much more . Look below for a MUCH better option.First of all is the plastic `` stand '' part at the bottom . It does n't fold-up . So it 's totally incorrect when it says `` Compact and collapsible for convenient portability and storage '' . This is not an item you would want to slip into your pants pocket , because the plastic `` stand '' does not fold-up . Why they did n't make that part fold-up is beyond me.Cheap . . . This item is cheap . It should n't cost more than two bucks , especially as it 's made in China , but it costs WAY more than that . It should have been totally made of plastic . Why it 's part metal is beyond me . Perhaps it was cheaper to make it that way , but if so , it 's certainly not reflected in the cost.Here 's what I recommend . . .If you 're looking for a cell phone holder , or iPod holder.. . Perhaps give this one a try . . .ikross Black Universal Portable Collapsible Desk Stand holder For Smartphones , MP3 Players , iPhoneIf you have an iPad or other tablet , then you would be well advised to have something with protection , which also acts as a stand . Some even come with a keyboard . I like the ones that Belkin makes , but there are other nice ones out there as well . They make different ones for different tablets , but here 's one for the iPad : Belkin Keyboard Folio Case with Keyboard and Retina Display for Apple iPad 2 : 2nd , 3rd , and 4th Generation ( Black )	-1
My family uses a similar dry-erase board on our fridge for miscellaneous notes/lists/art work . The Quartet version is much bigger than the one we already had , so we were kind of excited to give it a try . My kids especially enjoy drawing on them.The magnets that come with the Quartet board do n't come attached and require you to place them on the board using 3M adhesives that are included . The problem is , they only included 3 magnets . I decided to place one in each of the upper corners and the last one in the middle of the bottom edge . This might have worked OK if the magnets were stronger , but it feels pretty weak and I 'm afraid I 'll knock the whole board off the fridge . Part of the problem is that the board does n't sit very flush to the surface because the 3M adhesives are rather thick . There 's a sizable gap between the writing surface and the metal surface of the refrigerator.Another issue I have with the board is that it does n't erase very easily , at least not with the eraser that came with the board ( on the pen ) . We 'll give it some more time to see if it grows on us , but for the time being , I would n't recommend this dry-erase board .	-1
This is the second one of these I tried out and it 's as cheap as the other . The back is cardboard and adds to the over all poor quality.The magnets do n't work that great , and they keep sliding down the fridge . I altered the back a little bit and attached it to my daughters door for chores and such.If your looking for a magnetic dry erase board there are other better options .	-1
I am not a computer genius however I am not an idiot either . straight out of the box this thing is a pain in the butt . The printer I have is not showing up on the info needed . I have tried with USB and LAN cords nothing ! I went online and can only find info for the UK and Australia so it seems there is no help for USA buyers ... After 2.5hrs I am giving up , this thing is getting put in the basement storage . Seems i got the wrong set up disk . i still cant find the software online , even on their own website . So frustrated I have spent 4 hrs on this thing now ... .finally found on their site to download software and low and behold my computer got infected and I have now spent 7hrs on this ... . trying to fix it . This is going in the trash , no way would I allow it to take up space in my home . To get help from their customer service line you must provide a credit card before you may get a person.. what kind of scam is this ? ? After spending hours on it , then hours trying to fix my computer I called their customer service line and got a person without entering a credit card and got everything resolved however they wanted to back door my computer which also freaked me out . Not an easy process but with the tech guy in my computer this morning for over an hour we ( he ) got it installed . still not worth all the trouble ! ! POS ! 0 stars ! ! Not worth the headache at all ! !	-1
I did n't find the setup as terrible as others here , but it certainly was n't intuitive . It prints okay , but I 've had other small printers with better output . All that being said , the poor reviews and the mark down in price concern me ( perhaps unfairly ) that this is a printer destined to be discontinued sooner than later , and I 'm worried I will be saddled with something that could be expensive to re-feed in terms of toner.Regardless , it does one thing -- prints black and white -- and there are smaller , better printers that do that . When all you want is a convenience printer , desktop or home office or college student , this is just too big for that . I 've seen others suggest a little Brother 2270 ( I think I had a 2070 at one point ) and I preferred the little wireless Brother to this .	-1
Not many products make me angry but I just spent half a day , 100 sheets of wasted paper and repeated searches of the internet only to discover that this product is NOT Mac compatible . It is astonishing when Apple is the number one consumer electronics company in the world and used in a large number of homes , home offices and colleges and universities , that a company would put out a printer which can not be made to work with Mac . Even more annoying , there is no warning of this on the box or the Amazon product page , so one could easily order it and have it not function . Stupid and thoughtless.In addition the instructions shipped with the printer come on a dozen little brochures , all incomprehensible and printed in ten languages jumbled on top of each other . Literally impossible to understand . Who has time for this ? Ricoh appears to be clueless how to provide ease of use to customers . Pathetic morons . There are not many products from major manufacturers which have more One Star reviews than any other , a clear indication of a very poorly managed corporation.Note added later : After much investigation and Apple Support discussions , I finally found third party shareware called Gutenprint which does allow the printer to connect to Mac , but only via USB - wireless still does not work.It seems even Amazon reviewers who use PC have equally bad experiences . Skip this printer . The Brother 2270 is a more reliable choice and the refills for it more widely available , and its output looks cleaner than this Ricoh .	-1
This is positively the worst excuse of a printer I 've ever come across . I would love to tell you all about the print speed and quality , the paper handling capabilities , the sounds it makes when it operates and all that other fine stuff buyers of printers are interested in . Unfortunately , I can & # 8217 ; t , because after spending one and a half hours messing with this thing , I never succeeded in successfully getting the printer to operate.I suppose when I opened the literature packet and pulled out eleven sheets of paper written in fifteen different languages , I should have realized I was in trouble . ( Thank God I & # 8217 ; m an English speaker though , as the English instructions were always first . God help the Estonians or Finnish or any other country with their language buried seventh or eighth in the list . ) I tried to follow the & # 8220 ; quick & # 8221 ; instructions and in doing so , I succeeded in getting everything plugged in and ready to go . From there , it & # 8217 ; s pick your poison of what kind of physical setup you want to do , then try to follow the sheet for that particular kind of setup . I decided to choose whatever was first on the CD , and that was the relatively simple and straightforward USB . Click . Nothing . Click . Nothing . Connect the printer with the USB cable , click . Nothing . Okay . Run an Ethernet cable and choose & # 8220 ; network & # 8221 ; . Click . Dialog box . ( Hallelujah ! ) Computer starts doing something , then an error message : & # 8220 ; Print job already in progress. & # 8221 ; I wish.I messed with a couple of other things , restarted the computer , anything I could think of . Nothing worked . I got the & # 8220 ; Print Job & # 8221 ; error message a few more times before I packed it all up and put it away . At work , we have about thirty printers of at least four different makes , including complicated bar code printers , dedicated label printers , and of course typical office and home network printers ( mostly Brother , a few Epsons ) . I can & # 8217 ; t recall ever having spent more than twenty or thirty minutes setting up a printer , and of course , at the end of setup , they would all print . This is the first time I 've ever spent so long for absolutely no results . This thing is going to sit in my attic until Vine rules allow me to dispose of it . That & # 8217 ; s it . Stay away from this printer .	-1
I 've setup and installed many players over the years . Canon , Epson , Minolta , Brother and HP . Photo printers , networked , wireless , wide format copiers/plotters , and large office printers/copiers . With the exception of my old Minolta color network printer ( over 10 years old ) , most were relatively painless and were up and running within 5-10 minutes of plugging it in . This Ricoh printer is far from user friendly -- my Win7 system was unable to successfully install via USB , ethernet , or wifi . I tried getting the latest drivers from Ricoh 's site , but those did n't work either . As of this review , the last update of the driver ( PCL6 ) was version 1.0 , released on 7/4/2013 . If the driver gets updated , and I 'm ever in the mood for a headache , I 'll try installing this paperweight again.Advice -- Try a Canon , HP , or Epson printer . I rarely ever have issues with those brands , and setup tends to be a breeze .	-1
This printer simply will not work with any of my Macs . Based on the cost of a refill cartridge ( and the aggressive 75 % reduction in this printer 's cost ) , I 'm guessing that this product was intended to be a very low-cost way to hook a few gullible souls into an absurdly priced toner ecosystem ( which , in fairness , is what most printers are designed to do , but at least with other printers , there 's an attempt to provide quality and reliability as incentives to stick with the ecosystem ) . Awful .	-1
It 's pretty obvious when just glancing at the various reviews that there are set up as well as general connection issues with this printer . We tend to use printers pretty hard and seem to end up with a new one about every year to 18 months , so we 've experienced a lot of different printers . I 'm not sure what happened with the manufacturer , but the quality control , localization and software definitely has serious issues.Like many other folks , I had trouble with this right out of the box . My laptop does n't have a cd/dvd drive , but usually I can download the software online and all works well . Not so with this . You can download the driver , but for whatever reason it did n't work ( I have windows 8 ) . So , I then dug out my old dusty external dvd/cd drive and tried installing from that and still continued problems . It did not connect with my wifi nor with ethernet . I do n't use USB , as my house is ethernet wired plus wifi , so I never use USB ( esp . as the printer is in a different room than where we usually use/work on our computers.At this point I essentially gave up , like many of the other reviewers . A good product should be user friendly and work right out of the box . If not , it should offer a pretty basic fix . This was a fail all around . At this point I 've given it to a friend who was more willing to muck around with in in hopes of having himself a free new printer.There are many good printers out there and no reason to waste your time with this one . There 's a reason the price is lower than a cheapie ink-jet , and you 'd be smarter to go with the cheapie ink-jet if you 're not willing to go higher on your purchase price.Summary : Avoid , poor quality , serious set up and connection problems .	-1
I bought this because I was n't about to spend $ 150 for a black and white laser printer that I use only occasionally . However after an hour of trying to get my Toshiba laptop ( running Windows 8.1 ) to recognize this printer I gave up . Maybe it 's a Toshiba issue , maybe it 's a Windows 8.1 issue , maybe it 's a Ricoh issue . I do n't know but it does n't really matter . Back to Amazon it went !	-1
Perhaps it 's just my computer , but this printer is a disaster . I have both XP and Windows 8 on two separate computers and it was a royal pain to get it to set up . First , the wireless was n't working ( granted , we have a somewhat complicated wireless system ) . Not only that , but anything else wireless in our house was totally messed up when this printer was trying to access the wireless network . I know , you are now saying , & # 34 ; well , it 's not the printers fault. & # 34 ; Well , maybe so , but I 've installed many , many wireless items in my house and not one of them had an issue like this ! So since the wireless was being a pain , we used the USB to get it set up , but it WOULD NOT INSTALL or work ! ! Looking closer at the notes on the disc , the software and driver was for a different printer than this one ! So they sent the wrong software with it.So unfortunately I ca n't review how the printer actually works because I spent over 3 hours trying to get the stupid thing to install with the wrong software . What a mess !	-1
I was genuinely surprised to learn that a printer being manufactured in 2014 does not support Mac or Airplay . It did n't help that this failing was n't clearly disclosed in the product description . Perhaps Ricoh is still living in the 90 's , believing that businesses only use Windows . Whatever the reason , it is inexcusable in the very competitive market at this price point and capability . It does n't help that it is -also- hard to set up with difficult and frustrating menus and junk instructions . Sure , you could jack around with it to get it running in a Mac environment or somesuch , but what 's the point ? Even if you only have Windows/Microsoft computers and devices today , why limit what you can run or a guest can run in the future .	-1
First off the instructions were useless . I am not a computer expert in all things tech so I had a friend who was with me to make sure I got it up and running . It took him a while to get it hooked up which he said is not a good thing . So we finally get this piece of junk hooked up to my Dell desktop and tried to print various documents etc..and the paper kept getting jammed in there for some reason . The few things we got printed were very poor quality . Considering it only does one function which is print ( not scan , fax etc ... ) the price is way to high.Skip and buy and All In one printer !	-1
The fact that this printer is discounted so heavily should be a warning . When I first opened up the box and felt how light the parts were , I realized that it was fairly cheaply made . Even some of the lower end printers like the Dell 1110 that I use at work feel more substantial than the plastic used to make up the Ricoh Aficio . Even though I have 25 years setting up printers , it took me awhile to set everything up and get it working , because Windows 7 would not recognize it as a plug and play device . I finally got everything working after manually installing drivers that I downloaded off the Internet . It seemed to be working okay , but several times I received problems with the printer apparently not receiving the print instructions from my computer . Jobs would show up in my print queue , but never go to the printer . No error messages on the printer either . Attempting to cancel the job from the button on the printer had no effect . I finally uninstalled it .	-1
I 'd love to review this printer , but I ca n't get it connected via wireless or by USB . We 've had problems with our wireless connecting to our wireless at home , so we tried it at our office too , but it was a no-go . So then we tried it via a USB connection and that was a disaster . We 've reviewed several printers for Amazon Vine so I do n't think we did anything wrong in the set-up . Looking at other reviews , I do n't want to risk downloading software from the website since they said they got a virus out of it . My advice would be to stay away from this model . There has to be an easier and safer way to get black and white prints .	-1
I thought this printer would be excellent addition to my home office- I 'm in grad school and so was drawn to the ability to scan , copy , fax and laser print all in one , and wirelessly to boot ! The scanning and copying work OK , and it connects to my wireless network seamlessly.Sadly though , this printer does n't work with my Mac . I thought I was simply missing the drivers since the product description never mentions this limitation , but when I emailed Ricoh customer service , I received the following reply : & # 34 ; This model does not support Post Script Print Language that Apple requires . There are no drivers available for the Mac OS . Thank you for choosing Ricoh . & # 34 ; I am truly disappointed- I would never have ordered this heavy , bulky printer if I had known it would not work with my Mac . The product description really needs to be updated to mention this limitation .	-1
Well as a monochrome multifuntional printer , it does the job okay enough.My biggest beef is that this contraption is big and heavy ! As home printer I really can not recommend it ( as a cheaper full color is prefered ) , this is more suited in business office .	-1
I like that this printer can put out lots of black and white copies fairly quickly . I like the idea of printing from a wireless connection . I like the concept of one replacement part ( a toner/ink cartridge ) . But ... The English directions are hidden amidst a hose of other languages.The directions are n't exactly clear when they are in English.It took an inordinate amount of time to set up the wireless connection.When I did connect via a wireless connection I only printed a few documents before there was an error.I looked desperately for a wire to connect to my lap-top but there was n't one ( that would have made things so much easier ! ) It was n't able to print a document from my smart phone via the wireless networkIt wo n't print in color.So now it sits in the corner and I use it to make black and white copies . I still pay about $ 20 for print cartridges for my cheap printer that will do everything this one seems incapable of ( or will cost me more in time & frustration to learn ) than it will save me in toner .	-1
Added May 16 , 2014 : Glad to see they changed the description from color to monochrome . I will note that I stopped using this as it is lousy . Hard to find toner . Apparently , nobody likes this for a variety of reasons.So I now see the full value of a USB port and a memory card slot ( which this has neither . I have downgraded it to 2 stars , as my Epson Workforce 7510 is hands down a better machine in every way except text printing . I leave the original review below . I just do not see the value here , and my level of frustration has increased since setting it up . I wonder if color would have made a difference ? ? Probably not.Zero stars for the description , but this is clearly an error and should be noted . I can only hope that Amazon changes its description . With that said , it is a decent all-in-one office printer . Keep in mind that the stats for this say that it comes with an ink cartridge that is rated for 1000 pages and a standard cartridge is rated at 3500 pages . Images are sharp and crisp ( but not like my Epson Workforce ) . Paper size is up to 8.5x14 inches . Printing is fast , and start up takes about 30 seconds when you first turn it on . This is one heavy printer ( 38.6 pounds ) folks , so make sure you have a good sturdy place for it . It also has a medium to largish foot print , not as large as the old Brother we had in my office , but larger than my Epson Workforce that I have at home ... ..It is about the size of an older HP laserjet ( but does so much more ) . It holds 250 sheets in the main tray , which is plenty for us . Power consumption is 800w , HOWEVER , this is an energy star printed and the stats say that it is energy star rated at 4.7w ! That is great and will not be sucking energy all the time . It wakes up quickly enough , and you can set the time for how long before it sleeps.As for color , this does scan color , but it does NOT print color . Only black and white . Photographs do not print well on photo paper and if you just place one piece of photo paper over the regular paper it will pull up a sheet of plain paper with it and ruin the print , picking it up slightly after . If a printer can give me great B & W ; prints these days , it should be used as an anchor ... .if it was n't for the other qualities , I would say , `` printer overboard ! '' It does scan well and relatively quickly . Again , I am comparing it to our old Brother . Faxes are sharp and much nicer and crisper than our old one , and the ability to do different things at the same time is really great . I do wish the ink cartridge would yield more , but you can not argue with the text printing quality.Set up from the CD was very fast , and requires no real technical ability at all.The only downside is that it is a little pricey and while it is a laser printer , the print quality , being very good , is not much better than my Epson Workforce , and that is full color , and prints awesome color up to 13x19 ! It also does not have a USB port . Still , for the office , I am satisfied with this printer ... .though I wish it was in color . Amazon , please change the description . If you are using this strictly for office needs and no images , great , but if not , look at the Epson Workforce .	-1
Every girl dreams of having a personalized , bling-covered stapler ! I am no exception , and was all excitement when I got this in the mail . I tore it open right away , to look at the contents . The stapler was a small , sturdy , plastic Swingline about half the size of a full-size stapler . The bling came on a small , clear plastic sheet and in four colors , purple , pink , blue , and white , arranged in order of color and size . There were three sizes , small , medium , and large . The gems were stuck onto the plastic sheet in rows , and each row had one , long , sticky piece of adhesive backing underneath . With 200 gems , I could do almost any design on my stapler.Eagerly , I tried to peel off a gem . It came , but the backing didn & # 8217 ; t. It just left the backing behind . I tried to scrape its portion of the backing off of the plastic , and after much tugging , it jumped free of the rest of the backing & # 8230 ; pulling the next gem & # 8217 ; s backing with it . The only way to get off a gem with its backing is to pull up the whole row and carefully cut a gem and it & # 8217 ; s backing off of the strip with some razor sharp , extra thin scissors . Which I didn & # 8217 ; t have . So I simply took off the gems and their backing separately and then stuck them together again when sticking them to the stapler . When I would pull a piece of backing off of the strip , it would get stretched slightly . When I then stick it onto the stapler with its gem , it leaves a small amount of sticky exposed . When I tried moving a gem to a new spot ( first removing the gem , then scraping up the backing , then placing them down in a new spot ) it left a horrible gooey spot behind , which even rubbing alcohol could not remove.After a frustrating hour , I finally had my stapler decorated with a white Batman logo and my name . And , of course , plenty of gooey adhesive sticking out from under the gems . I picked it up and turned it over in my hands to admire my work , and then set it down on the table again . But , oh horrors ! Several of the gems were gone from the stapler ! ( Leaving their adhesive behind , of course . ) The little gems were now scattered on the table under the area where I had turned it over in my hands . Refusing to give up hope , I carefully stuck the gems back onto their designated spots and left the stapler alone for a few hours , hoping the adhesive backing would & # 8220 ; set & # 8221 ; . Then I gently placed it in an area of my backpack where books would not be constantly rubbing it , so that I could use it to staple my papers at school.A few days later at school , I took out my stapler to use it , and felt it firmly stick itself to my hand as soon as I touched it . Oh no . I carefully peeled it off of my hand and saw the problem . More than half of the gems had fallen off , leaving the sticky backing behind ! The remnants of my batman logo was unrecognizable , unlike my name which stood out in a sticky glory of lint.I still haven & # 8217 ; t had the heart to peel off the rest of my hard work and try to scrub off the goo , but I have used the sticky stapler in private so that nobody would see the gross goop . It actually works pretty well , which in contrast with the performance of the gems is almost funny . Would I recommend this product ? If you intend to throw out the gems and only use the stapler , yes . But as the whole point of the product is the gems , then I & # 8217 ; d probably tell anyone else to forget it . I & # 8217 ; m having a hard time understanding the other reviewers , who seem to have not had the same problem as me .	-1
This model does not do what is called duplex scanning , or both sides of one page . If not now there will be a time soon when you wish you could scan both sides of a page , picture , map , or note believe me . I use the duplex all the time for scans with my other scanners . I could not recommend the earlier versions of Brother scanners as they just were n't quite there yet in terms of quality of scans and quality of build.If you like this form factor , this thing is tiny , then get the DS-920DW that does duplex for about twenty bucks more.The included software is the best ever made for a scanner ... .wait for it ... NOTT . But you will get by.For serious scanning and not just on the road stuff go for the ADS models like the 1000 and 1500 that are much faster , have document feeders so you do n't have to spoon feed each page in trying to keep it straight ; 1000 has a 20 page and the ADS 2000 and 3000 have 50 page feeders . Its fun watching those machines eat your pages effortlessly.This scanner kind of feels like a toy , but for saving space they ca n't be beat . If you have to space and the budget get the better scanner now instead of later after you bought this one . At the very least get the model up from this .	-1
I am a lover of office supplies . I probably have a thousand pens here in my house . In fact I have been known to stop off at an office supply store and purchase even more pens that I might be attracted to , I have severe arthritis in my hands that also factors in to my choice of writing implements.I am not impressed by these . There is nothing partiruclarly speial about them , nothing wrong with them either . They just are typical writing pens not unlike a Bic pen with a luittle more glitz .	-1
I really liked this printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges.When I need to buy a printer I look at the prices of the cartridges , and the ones for this printer were very cheap . However , I soon discovered that the greedy dirt bags at Epson have gone to VERY great lengths to make sure you ca n't use the inexpensive after-market cartridges and can only use their way overpriced genuine Epson ones . I found on Amazon a pack of aftermarket ones that cost $ 14 for 4 black and two each of the other colors , but the printer wo n't & # 34 ; recognize & # 34 ; these even though it has the same cartridge number . So instead of getting 10 aftermarket cartridges you can buy one genuine Epson cartridge for the same price . Talk about gouging ! I wish I had known this before I bought it . Maybe other brands are like this also , but I will never will get anything with the Epson name again .	-1
I have patiently been waiting for years to replace my six year old photo printer which does not work under Windows 7 or 8 . Based on the Amazon reviews ( which are looking mighty suspicious about now ) , I bought this . It is not as wonderful as the reviews would suggest.Fuzzy images.I tried printing several images of different varieties -- animals , landscape , family photos . In each photo print , the images were fuzzier than the original digital image . The original digital images are all over 6 MP . That 's pretty large , so a print should be crisp . There are only two settings on this printer . They are `` Text and Image '' and `` Best Image '' . I tried both and on Ultra Premium Photo Paper from Epson . With new ink cartridges and extremely expensive photo paper custom made by the same company , I would expect much better quality than these photo prints.No image software included.There is no photo image software included . That 's important with photo printers if you want to print different sizes or different photos on the same sheet of 8.5 x 11 photo paper and as expensive as the ultra premium photo paper is you want to utilize the entire page . I have two software packages from HP photosmart and neither worked with this printer . So I had to print full size photos which would not have been my choice.Ink.After four 8.5 x 11 photo prints , one third of the blue ink was gone , one fourth of the pink , and one fifth of the black and yellow . That 's a lot of ink wasted.The quality of photo printers in the marketplace has declined considerably over the past five years . I 'm hesitant to keep this because between the ink and paper each page costs around $ 3 to print and that 's a lot considering the poor quality . I 'm also hesitant to return it because it looks like everything is made in China now and anything better is unlikely to come along anytime soon.Amazon reviews have become highly unreliable . This was a mother 's day gift and it was such a huge disappointment . If you look at the reviews you will find the same dozen or so keep getting resubmitted every three months . Although Amazon takes returns there 's always a hassle when it 's electronics and I do n't feel like being hassled anymore . I wo n't be buying electronics at Amazon anymore . The reviews are bogus and the products are always craptastic .	-1
I bought this one as quick as I could I needed it right away .. Never read the reviews and got the item here 's what 's wrong with this horrible printer:1 . Says it connects to wifi after hours of trying and reading directions and calling support and online support this printer would NOT connect to my wifi2 . After following the instructions to a T I then went to print a test page and I could hear the wheels turning and the ribbon moving and the ink cartridges moving but it spit out a blank paper once again call Epson support they had me take the thing apart and redo exactly what I did the first time still no luck3 . After spending hours on support I just got off my butt went to walmart and spent $ 2 more for an HP printer and had absolutely no problems.. Getting ready to make a claim soon very disappointed only plus side was that the scanner worked but hey it might copy but u ca n't print those copies ! !	-1
If you only need to print one or two times , then by all means grab this cheapy printer . If not , and your printer needs are more , then please by a quality product . I was iffy anyway , considering the price before purchasing this . But having some good history in th past with the Epson brand , I asked myself & # 34 ; how can i go wrong ? & # 34 ; Right ? I mean this is Epson afterall.Epson should be ashamed of itself . This thing is cheaply mass produced with cheap parts . It makes too much noise , is persistant with nozzle clogs and errors and sucks ink up like crazy . Let it sit unused for a few days , and youbwill be required the use the headcleaning function before use . That will eat all your ink , and then it will tell you you need to do it again.The wifi is crap . It takes so long to print wirelessly . And no it is not my connection . I have other printers that print on wifi almost instantly.I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
Yeah this is not a very good product . It is cheaply made and mine was so warped that one corner is n't touching the fridge.You do have the option of adhesive back or magnets , and the magnets are strong enough that the three in contact with the fridge do hold it up , but let the door slam and it falls.It does have a large writing area and comes with two magnetic & # 34 ; buttons & # 34 ; to hold notes , lists or other paper items to the board . But overall , I would say pay more and get a better one than this one .	-1
I wanted to use this whiteboard on our refrigerator , but it failed beyond the conceptual level . The magnets supplied are not strong enough to hold the board in place . Further , the design requires that you consume the permanent mount tabs to affix the magnets to the board . Thus , it is not possible to have a fallback plan of mounting it to the wall . I do not recommend this product at all .	-1
Made from super cheap materials . It is a very basic white board . It comes with four adhesive mounting pads , and four flat magnets you then stick to the pads . But the magnets I received weren & # 8217 ; t even strong enough to keep the board attached to a basic steel cabinet . So now I need more adhesive mounts to make the white board useful at all . Also the board comes with two smaller magnets you attach notes and a small dry erase marker . Normally I wouldn & # 8217 ; t speak so bad about such a product , but this just screams cheap . I would avoid it and look for another brand . If you however have a question about the item , feel free to leave a question below and I will try to answer it .	-1
I am not certain how much of a dry-erase board one should expect to get for twelve dollars , but this Quartet model comes with a thin white writing surface backed with cardboard and stapled into a plastic frame of about the same consistency of the edge clips on plastic report covers . The white writing surface gets dented easily -- I could press lines in it with a thumbnail with little effort -- and the magnets provided to mount the item in place permitted it to slide a couple of inches before catching ; the board requires repositioning from time to time as a result . The provided pen fits on a brittle transparent plastic clip ; the pen itself has a tip about the width of a modest-size felt-tip pen , and its ink smells like diluted nail polish ; the cap on the pen has a small eraser on it . The two magnets provided to stick items to the board 's surface have pretty rainbow colors and weak power . I first gave this item three stars , but reading my own description of it has led to my demoting it to two stars . Definitely not recommended .	-1
When I hear that something has a silver frame , I think to myself that it will be shiny and , well , silver . Instead , I got a vaguely glittery , very cheapo looking gray plastic that is so obviously plastic and not even attempting to look like metal that the whole presentation just looks very low quality.That said , the actual function is great . The dry erase side of the board is magnetic , while the Cork side is not . The self stick pads that are included for easy hanging worked just fine , and since I own my own home I am not concerned about whether or not they will leave sticky stuff on the wall . I can always paint over that little section if they do . I appreciated the cute little striped magnets and the dry erase marker that were included with the set.However , overall though I like the size and the fact that this is a combination board , I am really unimpressed with the low level of quality here . The frame just looks so low-quality that it really makes my whole room look a little cheap , and I think I will be upgrading to something very similar but with a nicer frame as soon as possible .	-1
Totally not impressed by this product . In an effort to make installation easy ( 3M stickily foam pads instead of actually attaching to the wall ) the frame is made of gray plastic instead of metal . So the product is super light , but also super cheap looking . Also , not helped by the fact that it was damaged during shipment and has a crease down the white board side . The corners are angled and I 'm not sure if this is on purpose or a manufacturing flaw but again , it adds to the cheap look and feel . SKIP ! !	-1
The frame , white board surface and cork surface are thin and flimsy . Most of the thickness of the frame is taken up by a piece of cardboard behind the whiteboard and cork ! Hanging it is done with sticky tape at the 4 corners . This tape , as others have noted , will destroy your drywall should you decide to move the unit . My wife realized this before she affixed it to a wall , by trying to reorient the tape strip that was a bit crooked on the unit ( it has rectangular areas for the tape on the back ) . She struggled to remove it from the unit , and wisely decided against affixing it to the wall with the tape strips.Like others , our marker came dried out .	-1
It is only 7 1/2 '' long , not 8 1/2 '' and not 9 '' ! What ? Twenty-seven people reviewed this before me and no one else noticed ? Really ? ! ? Magnet is powerful enough to stay put , and I like the width of the pad . It also has a stretch band at the bottom to keep the pages from flying . But that is not saying much , is it ? It 's an average product that claim that it is longer than it really is . ( I notified Amazon of the mistake in length , and they updated the product page to say 9 '' . Yikes ! You ca n't win for losing it seems ! ) There is a LOT of wasted space : Once I write something down on a `` To Do '' list , my brain really does not need a header to tell me that it is something `` To Do '' , `` To Remember '' , or `` To Buy '' . The wide ruled lines also waste space . The pink binding is extra-long , too.So , out of 7 1/2 '' in length , only 5 1/4 '' is usable : Only 14 lines per page ( not counting the last , half-line ) ; 75 pages , plus a cardboard backing . Hopefully , this will come down in price and give us more value . You can do the math with the numbers I 've given you here . But at the moment I 'm posting this review , this product costs 8.7 cents per page and that is ridiculous.Do yourself a favor and keep looking : There are plenty other To Do lists out there from which to choose !	-1
The Quartet Magnetic Notepad is described as being 3 x 9-Inches , Pink ( 48121-PK ) . The package describes the pad as being 3 in x 8.5 in . In actuality , it measures around 3 inches x 7.5 inches , which includes a top bound section encased in lightweight glossy pink card stock , rendering each sheet a mere 6.5 inches in total length . Comprised of three perforated sections in each sheet , I 'd recommend ignoring the To Do ... , To Remember ... , and To Buy ... headings and writing your notes starting at the bottom of each page , so that you can tear off each third of the sheet as you 've filled it or need to reference the information . The sheets are a very light grey and each third has a mere five lines for your notes . Since I am not a heavy writer , I ignore the lines and end up with more on a page . The paper quality is mediocre and the binding on the pad I received is wrinkled at the top of the sheets , so the pages are not flat especially when the pad is affixed to the refrigerator or my metal front door . Unfortunately , the elastic on my pad also snapped after only a few days and the pad being used only a handful of times . The two flat magnets attached to the rear of my pad measure under 1 3/4 inches each and they are as wide as is the pad ( 3 inches ) . The product was manufactured in China for ACCO Brands which is located in Booneville , MS , and the packaging offers a phone number and website for returns on the products . They offer a replacement or repair within 60 days of purchase with proof of purchase . That earns an additional star from this reviewer bringing it from a one to a two . I can not recommend this notepad at all .	-1
The good:1 ) I like that this pad has magnets that will hold it firmly to the refrigerator plus an elastic band to hold the bottom of the paper in place when you open and close the refrigerator door.2 ) I like that the & # 8220 ; To Buy & # 8221 ; heading is at the bottom of the list . This way you can rip off ( along the perforated line ) the & # 8220 ; To Buy & # 8221 ; list and leave the & # 8220 ; To Do & # 8221 ; list at the top.The Bad:1 ) This is only 7.5 inches long ( rather than the stated 9 inches ) . Of the actual 7.5 inches , there is a lot of wasted space . The pink binding ( that crosses the top of the pad ) takes up a full inch of the available space . It looks like there is a staple that holds all of the pages together ( it sits under the pink binding ) and the staple is inch from the top . So why does the pink binding need to take up so much real-estate on this notepad ? 2 ) The three headings ( & # 8220 ; To Do & # 8221 ; , & # 8220 ; To Remember & # 8221 ; , and & # 8220 ; To Buy & # 8221 ; ) are again too wide - taking up too much space on the page . Also , the lines are too far apart - giving you only 14 lines to actually write on - of which , only 4 are for shopping . Tell me , who & # 8217 ; s shopping list is confined to only 4 items ? I think that the & # 8220 ; To do & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; To remember & # 8221 ; headings are really the same thing , so they should have been combined so the page is divided only in half . Plus they should have reduce the size of everything so that there is at least 10 lines for both categories.3 ) No attached pencil or a means to attach a pencil comes with this . If the pad was designed without magnets , then it would be placed at your desk or somewhere where there is a pen or pencil . But being that it has magnets , it is obviously designed to be placed at the refrigerator . Who has writing instruments in the kitchen ? Not me . So I think this should have some way to attach a pencil , otherwise IMHO , I think most people wont take the time to go find a pencil just so they can add to their list.4 ) The currently listed $ 6.52 seems a bit steep for a simple notepad with magnets . Maybe a $ 1.50 or $ 2.00 would be more reasonable price.Final analysis : I think it was a good try , but it falls short of being functional or cost-effective .	-1
I have a magnetic pencil holder that I picked up at an office supply store . That magnet is STRONG and keeps the pen holder in place even though the holder is made of metal mesh which is much heavier than plastic.The magnet on the ACCO brand pen cup is weak and slides easily even when empty . This is definitely not something I would go out and purchase .	-1
I was hoping to clear space on my desktop with this little magnetic pencil holder . I have a metal surface on the wall right in front of my desk that would be perfect for it . The cup is disappointing in actual usage for the following reasons:1 ) The height of the cup is too short to securely hold pens , much less traditional pencils which are a little longer when they are new . It feels like unless I pack it full ( so all the pens/pencils will stand up next to each other , and thereby sort of hold each other in ) they could flop out more easily . The whole thing needs another inch or two of height.2 ) The magnet is nowhere near strong enough . If I just brush this accidentally with my hand , the whole thing comes down and my pens/pencils are all over my desk . If it does n't come down , it tips , and because it is so shallow , stuff spills anyway , even if the whole holder does n't come down . The backing on this does n't appear to be anything more strong than the cheapie promotional magnets people put their business cards on . Fill it full of pens and it 's even less likely to stay in place.Disappointing . Would love to find something like this with better design .	-1
While a great and convenient idea , this particular product is poorly designed . The cup itself is rather large , but the magnet seems too weak to hold that many items.The cup is just cheap plastic and is far too shallow for proper organization . Pens stick out at angles due to the lack of support , leading to an ugly , unorganized cluster of writing utensils . The cup is rather hideous as well -- I really did n't expect it to be fabulous , but I did n't expect it to look so cheap.It holds pens/pencils as the name suggests , just not very neatly -- you are not going to get organization like the simulated product pictures .	-1
This is a very low-quality item . It is cheaply made , the magnet was crooked on the back of the cup , and it is not a very strong magnet . If there are more than two pens in the cup , it slides . And it is useless for sticking paper to the magnetic surface.I would not buy one of these .	-1
The board I received had a crease in the dry-erase portion before I even took it out of the box . I do like the idea of having a corkboard portion to tack paper notes to . Frame seems pretty cheap , the magnetic strips work ok for hanging this up . The marker is n't anything to write home about either . Unless you 're just bent on getting this specific one , I 'd pick up something at a local store that I could put my hands on and check out first .	-1
This erases well and my daughter is happy with it in her playroom , but it 's cheaply made . We have had it for only a few weeks and the cheap plastic frame has broken and the part that holds the marker busted . The cork is extremely thin . The magnets are very cute , though .	-1
I am really disappointed in the lack of quality of this product . Basically it is a piece of cardboard with a very thin magnetic layer between the cardboard & the dry erase board . The side strip with the cork is a super thin layer of cork over cardboard . It arrived with two permanent dents in the top of the board where the magnets were . You also have to assemble the magnets to the back so that you can attach it to your refrigerator or other magnetic surface . There is a small sheet with 4 magnets that you kind of snap/pull apart . There is also 3M double sided foam tape . You peel off one side & attach the magnet to the foam tape . Peel off the other side & stick the magnet to one corner of the combination board . Repeat this step for the next 3 corners.The frame around the board is thin cheap plastic that does n't look good or line up well . As pictured , at the top is a little clear clip to secure the dry erase pen . The first time I tried to remove the pen from the board after putting the board on the refrigerator , I started to pull the entire board off the refrigerator ! The magnets are so weak that the slightest bump moves the board . I had some little pieces of note papers I wanted to attach to the board via magnets . I attempted to add 2 magnets similar in size to the ones that come with the board . The weight of the additional magnets made the board slide down the refrigerator.So now in order to use the board I keep the pen on top of the refrigerator ( forget trying to snap it back into the clip , you 'll take the whole board down ) , very very carefully write on the board , very very carefully erase what info . listed is no longer needed . I sometimes use one magnet to attach one small piece of paper ( grocery list type paper ) .I was originally going to give this 1 star I was so disgusted when it arrived . But now that I 've been using it a while , I upped it to 2 stars . I do n't like it , but I use it . It works for the most part . The pen & the magnets are the nicest parts of the whole ensemble . It is easy to erase info . thanks to the little sponge on top of the pen lid . If you are just using it as I am , to keep track of items needed at the grocery store , it will work if you are careful . If you want to post all sorts of notes & reminders , add magnets , push pins & the like , it will probably end up on the floor before you are done.Bottom line , I do n't recommend it . If I saw it in the store , I would not buy it . It 's made in China junk .	-1
First off , I love the magnets . They 're great . But my love for this product ends there . It could not be made any more cheaply . The cork strips off with hardly any use from tacks and the green frame does n't even aline properly from one side to another . I am far from impressed with this board and would n't look toward ACCO again for dry erase boards .	-1
This reminds me of something one might see on a dorm room door . The fame is plastic and its not even one piece .	-1
I thought of using it as a to-do list for my daughter to help her to organize better , hmm , I would like to use it , but I cant use it ... the magnets are not powerful enough , the board is flimsy and cheap built.It is serving the purpose right now , but would not recommend buying it .	-1
I had an awesome mail pouch that we collected receipts in . I tore it and was looking for a new one . I needed a pouch because we get receipts of all sizes.I am not even sure why this is being called a pouch . The sides are completely open . It is more like a rigid file folder . The magnet was fine until I put a couple things in it . Now it is slidey . And it is unusable for collecting random bits of paper because they fall out .	-1
So they call this thing an organizer . However , it 's only one single compartment , so I do n't see how much organizing you can really do with it . It 's not that big , and is open on the sides , though the magnet on the back is large enough to hold the thing firmly in place , so as long as it 's straight when you slap it onto your fridge , you 'll eliminate any danger of papers falling out should the pouch be jostled.There 's really not much to say here . I suppose it 's better than leaving open mail lying around on a countertop , but as the basis of an organizational system for your mail , it 's pretty useless .	-1
I received this item free through Amazon Vine in order to review it . It has a really strong magnet on the back of the organizer , which holds it securely in place when placed on the fridge door . My problem with the product is that there are no sides to hold in the mail , or coupons , or whatever you have placed in the storage pouch . If you are not careful , the mail or coupons fall out the sides of the organizer . I solved the problem by wrapping a large rubber band around the bottom so the stuff I place in the pouch , wo n't fall out the sides and onto the floor . I am glad I got this product free , because I would be really disappointed if I had paid for such a poorly designed product .	-1
I made a mistake . Somehow I missed that the actual board is silver . The marker that came with it is nearly impossible to see on this board but when I used it on a white board it was nice and clear . I ordered some quartet enduraglide markers and they show up better than the supplied marker , but still not with the level of contrast I was hoping for . It is totally my fault for not noticing this board is completely silver in color , but for those who actually want a silver board be forewarned that having a board this color makes it more difficult to see what you write because the contrast between the board and the color is just not there and you will need to use a thicker marker , in black to see what you write.The two magnets will hold small pieces of paper okay but they are n't that strong . the board came with 4 3M double sided stick pads , which held it firmly in place when I installed it to the side of a bookcase by my office desk.Overall , I wish I would have paid better attention and ordered a white board , not a silver board , but I have no complaints about the quality of the board .	-1
The back of this is cardboard , and makes the overall product feel cheap . The magnets work ok but are not that strong so it slides down the fridge.I changed the back a little and mounted this on my sons door as an ever changing chore chart and how much each chore is worth.Overall there are better quality erase boards out there so just make sure this is the one you want before you buy it .	-1
This cork board is inexpensive and you get what you pay for . The frame is not really 'silver ' , more like plastic painted grey . The plastic frame is n't even decent quality for being plastic.On the plus side ? This cork board weighs next to nothing . If you do n't have a secure place to hang it , no fear ! If it falls off the wall , it probably wo n't do too much damage . It may even float to the floor if there is a bit of a draft ! This could make a good cork board if you needed something portable ? It is pretty good sized ( 2 ft x 1 1/2-ish feet ) but it is really lightweight so I would say highly portable . Caution ! I think this could fold/bend pretty easily.Downsides ? This is not an aesthetically pleasing bulletin board ( if there is such a thing ) - mostly because the frame is so glaringly cheap . Another problem ? If you put anything slightly weighty on it , you may have problems with it staying on the wall as you will also be hanging it from the ultra aforementioned cheap-o frame.All in all ? If you do n't care what it looks like or if it will stay on the wall , this may be the perfect bargain for you . If you want something that lasts and will hang decently on the wall ( and not going winging down into the crack behind your desk every time a door closes anywhere on the block ) , you can probably hold out for a far superior item for a couple dollars more .	-1
The cork part is fine ... ..and that is it . The outside is framed in plastic and the 3m double sided stickies are very sticky . It will pull the paint right off the wall if you try and reposition it . It is flimsy . I have other cork boards that are surrounded by a wood frame and they are much sturdier . Cheap quality .	-1
If you 're looking for a cork board that can be hung and on which you can mount a lot of things , this is not the cork board for you.If you 're looking for a lightweight corkboard that is portable and that you wo n't be mounting ( temporarily or permanently ) , this might work for you.For your consideration : Pros : & # 62 ; Lightweight and small in size , so very portableCons & # 62 ; Very cheap looking plastic frame with obvious seams . Gray toned color , not the & # 8220 ; silver & # 8221 ; as in description. & # 62 ; Flimsy if you & # 8217 ; re trying to use it to hold anything but sheets of paper or photos . Can & # 8217 ; t hold all that much & # 62 ; Limited options for mounting . ( You can & # 8217 ; t hang . Board comes with permanent sticky pads that may not adhere to some surfaces or not stay on for long ; could cause damage to surface when removing ( or trying to remove ) . & # 62 ; description says it comes with magnets . No magnets nor would they work as the frame is cheap plastic. & # 62 ; Cork is too thin for push-pins that are more than standard length . ( Many popular ones have longer pins that would pierce thru this board. ) & # 62 ; Price . Would be cheaper to get that lightweight foam board because it could more easily be mounted or hung and it also allows you to use push pins of any size and can hold post-it notes , which this board can not . Plus foam board can be bought in oversized pieces that can be cut down or in various other sizes and can even be & # 34 ; doubled & # 34 ; if you want to attach heavy items.Simply NOT a good value .	-1
I 've been wanting a bulletin board for the wall behind my home office desk chair for quite awhile . The pictures in the room all have slender , vertical black metal frames so , when offered this vertical cork bulletin board with a black frame , I went for it.This frame is plastic and instead of meeting unobtrusively in the corners , the pieces meet about an inch away from the corners , with seams that are very noticeable ; also , the vertical and horizontal pieces are of different widths . I could probably live with that . But a bulletin board that must be affixed to the wall with `` permanent self-stick pads '' that other reviewers here note would pull the paint off the wall along with it were I to move or remove it ? That I wo n't do.I 'm giving some thought to taking this to a framer who might be able to salvage the cork and put it in a slender black metal frame with a backing that wo n't pull the paint off the wall . If that works , and does n't cost a whole lot , I 'll come back here and add a third star .	-1
All cork boards aren & # 8217 ; t created equal . This one is definitely not a superior board ; in fact , flimsy is the word that best describes it . You can & # 8217 ; t use it to hang jewelry on because the board can & # 8217 ; t support the weight as the push pins are minimally supported by the thin cork . You can & # 8217 ; t use it to secure multiple pages such as policies for the office . However , you could use it to secure single page memos and such . The trick is to hang things that aren & # 8217 ; t weighty . My recommendation is to skip this one for one with better grade of cork and more substantial frame ( this one is plastic ) . Yeah & # 8220 ; you get what you pay for & # 8221 ; but there should be more pride in the production of a product that carries your name . I say shame on the manufacturers of this product .	-1
This is really too small to be used for anything more than a major event , and the fact that it starts on Monday is weird and makes it hard to read at a glance . I & # 8217 ; m constantly getting confused on dates because it & # 8217 ; s the ONLY calendar in use in the states that starts on Monday and so looking at it I & # 8217 ; m always thinking that I & # 8217 ; m a date late for everything . It does fit rather comfortably on my fridge , so for that the size is great , but there really isn & # 8217 ; t room in the squares , and rewriting the dates every month as well as remembering the date structure is a pain . The fact that I use a different calendar as well says it all .	-1
My ex has a work schedule that is very & # 34 ; nontraditional & # 34 ; and unpredictable to say the least . Since we coordinate who has our boys with his work schedule , every month , I need to take his work calendar and put it on MY calendar so that we can plan & # 34 ; the changing of the guard & # 34 ; .I figured this calendar would be good for this as well since it is n't my Outlook calendar and the boys can see it as well.But the problem I have with it is that the whole premise of this calendar is that it should be a & # 34 ; universal calendar & # 34 ; -- except that it sets up the days for you and you ca n't change them.Most calendars I have seen ( including my Outlook calendar and all 3 of my work time entry systems ) are set up as Sunday to Saturday . This is setup as Monday to Sunday and while that may seem like a little thing , when you are used to seeing calendar in one format , it is confusing and annoying to view a different format.This company also does a terrible job with their magnets . I use the magnets for this board so that I can put it on and off my fridge . The problem , however , is that the magnets are too weak to hold the calendar on the fridge without placing something underneath it to keep the board from sliding down to the ground.I had another dry-erase board by this company which had the same company but after supporting it with other magnets on the bottom , the magnets did & # 34 ; take hold & # 34 ; . However , when I took the board down to write on it , the magnets would not stick to the fridge AT ALL so that was basically a throw-away proposition.You DO have the option to mount it permanently using double-sided sticky tape but who wants to have to rewrite all the days of the monthly calendar and then add in all your appointments while standing next to the fridge.It is a great concept . The execution and quality , however , leave a lot to be desired . [ NCJVR ]	-1
Like others have stated , how this `` international '' Calendar starts on a Monday really makes it confusing.They really did n't think it through or bother for this month of March . For this month , March , with 31 days , since it started on a Saturday and in the first row only takes 2 spaces , it would require a 6th row to fit the 31st on there -- this is NOT possible ! You might think not being able to fit one day during the year is n't going to kill you , but come on ... is n't the whole point of having this is to be organized ? ! That 's poor design.I got the one with the purple framing and I think that part makes it look tacky and cheap ; I would have liked it to be all same silver frame or no borders for a really clean look.Pros : - Cheap price- Hang notes with the included magnetsCons : - Calendar starts on a Monday - this can be really confusing for most of us living in America.- Horrible horrible cheap marker - I have this one and the `` Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board Tile , 14 x 14 Inches , Frameless , Silver Surface '' and both markers stop working after writing just a few things ( I do like the eraser on the tip , though ) - You really ca n't write much on there because the space is small , you definitely need a fine tip pen marker - just small notes.The production description boldly states `` 100 % Satisfaction Guaranteed '' but I 'm definitely not 100 % satisfied ... will they send me a lifetime supply of useable markers so I can actually still write on this board ? : P	-1
While this calendar is a fair size for the price ( really , $ 7 ai n't bad ) , there are two things which really dock this calendar down a few stars . The adhesives it comes with for the magnet backings are 3M , but are not powerful enough to hold the calendar on the fridge . It slides down on its own , so I 've managed to keep it in place by buttressing other magnets underneath . Thankfully , it does n't fall completely off the fridge.It 's nice that it comes with additional magnets , but , since the calendar is quite tiny as it is , there 's really no space to put the magnets on if you 're going to write all over the calendar , so we 've moved them off.We use this board primarily for meal planning , and my wife and I constantly have to rewrite our plans once we 've started them because we forget that the week starts on a Monday in this calendar . It may not seem like a big deal at first , but considering almost every calendar we use starts with Sunday it becomes quite the nuisance after a while . I have no idea why this company decided to start it on a Monday.So , because this calendar can be stuck onto a regular wall , it 's not bad on that part , but like most families we got this dry-erase board to use on the fridge . We still use it daily , but there are far better options , even if they do cost a bit more . The fact that this slides down the fridge and starts the week on a Monday seriously flaw this otherwise budget-friendly planner .	-1
The board is 11x14 . The enclosed marker has a tip like a regular sharpie marker which makes pretty bold lines for a calendar this small . This combination would be useful for someone that needs to write only 1-3 words per day on the calendar . It is not a good choice for our family needs.We ended up buying these pensExpo Click Retractable Low Odor Fine Tip Dry Erase Markers , 6 Fashion Color Markers ( 1751667 ) and this calendarBoard Dudes 16 x 20 Inches Aluminum Framed Magnetic Dry-Erase Calendar , Includes 1 Marker and 2 Magnets ( 16540 ) Thanks for reading .

The board feels very cheap -- cardboard back and plastic frame but the worst part is that it wo n't stay on the wall . We use the adhesive strips and it keeps falling off . Very , very unhappy with this product .	-1
I was looking forward to having a small dry erase board hang on my office wall . The surface of this board worked fine . However , it did n't stick to the wall with the supplies provided .	-1
Since Amazon groups the reviews of the different sizes together , I will sum up the two that I received.I planned to replace the old dry-erase board on my refrigerator with the 8.5x11 one of these , but was extremely disappointed . Four pieces of 3M adhesive are included along with four thin magnets -- you can use just the adhesive alone to hang the board , or you can attach the magnets and hang it using them.Unfortunately , the magnets are not strong enough to actually hold the board . This reason I wanted this was , as I said , to replace the extremely worn dry-erase board on my refrigerator . We 've had other dry-erase boards on the fridge and never had this problem.On top of the magnetic problem , it feels cheap overall . The marker is tiny , though at least it does have an eraser . However , the first time I wrote something on the board it did not complete erase without scrubbing it with a tissue . I think the spots where the marker remained were where the magnets were attached when packaged , so maybe in time that will go away ( though it is seriously poor package planning ) .The only positive is it is more magnetic than other dry-erase boards I 've had , but it is useless to me since I can not hang it on my fridge and it is just absolute junk . Bottom line is , find another dry-erase board -- this one is n't worth the money ( not even the current $ 5.62 price ) .I also got the larger dry-erase board but did not attempt to use the magnets with that one . However , it feels just as cheap as the smaller one . I highly doubt the magnets included would hold that one either , but I attached it to a door so I was unable to test it . So far the adhesive is holding it firmly in place .	-1
I love these boards . I hang them everywhere . This one is on my refrigerator . I was disappointed a bit in the color . It is more of a dull green than the bright green shown . The writing surface also moves around quite a bit in the frame and the magnets were tightly glued to the surface and were hard to remove . It also left behind a very sticky residue that does not wash off with soap and water . Goo Gone was used and now that area is not as shiny as the rest . Also the marker was completely dried out .	-1
This is n't our first Quartet Magnetic Dry Erase board . We used to have one on the fridge when our twins were born to keep track of feedings as well as to keep a running list of needs . It had a few issues , the biggest one being that the included magnets just simply were n't strong enough to keep it up . We used other magnets to & # 34 ; prop & # 34 ; it in position , but after a few slides and falls , we ended up having to get rid of it.This new Quartet Magnetic Dry erase board has all of the same issues . The build quality is n't great ( plastic frame on a cardboard backing ) , the included marker is basically throwaway quality and the magnets still do n't have the strength to keep it in position . In fact , we 're using the included circle/posting magnets underneath the board in an attempt to again keep it & # 34 ; propped & # 34 ; into position.The board itself is fine , and the frame is n't unsightly , but I 'm afraid that after a few more slides and falls , it too will be destined for the trashcan .	-1
I applied the four magnets to the double side foam spacers ( which have tape on one side to secure to back of dry erase board ) and put one magnet on each of the four sides of the board . I thought this would be a great thing to put on the top freezer door or side of the refrig for a shopping list or notes . To my great surprise the weight of the dry erase board , was enough to make it slide down the face of the refrigerator door or side . The only way I have found to stop this is to put the top magnets at the very top of the door , and put another magnet below the dry erase board to keep it from sliding down the door . The four magnets supplied , are not strong enough to secure the board to the refrigerator . The refrigerator is about 4 years old , and is full size Whirlpool with a black textured finish . Perhaps it might not slide down if the finish was completely smooth ? Most refrigerators today are made with a textured finish . Not recommended for use on refrigerator . Sure it would work okay if secured in another way to a wall or cabin door etc . The plastic frame around the dry erase board looks cheap . Made in China .	-1
I really wanted to like this Dry Erase Board but so many things were wrong with it that I could n't . First , I tried sticking it to my wall next to the front door with the double sided tape so that my husband , kids and I could leave messages for eachother . It fell off the wall repeatedly . So , I decided to use the magnets to hold it to my metal door . It slid down the door . Tried it on the fridge , and it slid there too . Once I got it to finally stay where I wanted it , using a special double sided tape my husband brought from work , the marker started falling off . Lastly , the marker started drying out within a week of using it and yes , we did put the cap on it every time so we had to buy a set of markers and leave them in a cup next to the board . The only thing that worked well with the whole thing was that the board erased easily .	-1
If you are just looking for a cheap quality binder than this is the binder for you . This binder was a disappointment from the moment I opened the box . When I took it out it was a little dirty- which surprised me since it was new . After further inspection I can definitely say that this binder is definitely NOT something I would recommend for a student who has to carry it in a backpack as it 's cheap quality and construction will cause it to deteriorate rapidly . The pockets on the inside wall of each side of the binder will tear within a couple of uses . The open/close mechanism for the rings do n't seem very sturdy and nor do the rings seems well attached to the binder itself .	-1
This binder feels and looks cheap - the customizable panels gap , the white vinyl has interior bubbles . The binder clip opens very smoothly with one hand operation . The hinges are extremely flexible and flip around easily . Good choice for a shop floor or to keep things filed , but not ideal for school supplies or customer presentations .	-1
Pros : Clear cover and spine for Insertion of your customized title page , back cover sheet.4 Pockets Two pockets on the inside of each cover provide ample storage for loose sheets.bigger.Special trigger for quick easy opening works opens quick..Cons : round rings less storage than d ringsSpecial trigger that is supposed to be easy open , unfortunately does not close easy . As it is only 1 trigger instead of one on each end , it is difficult to apply pressure to get it to close.I prefer the d ring binders .	-1
My teenager was headed off to an Instructor training workshop and he had lots of loose cards , small books , and papers on the table . It seemed like the perfect opportunity to test this binder . He is 19 and was out of town for a week , carrying this in his backpack , nothing unusual.The binder 's cover fell apart first . He said it did not get that much use because he only put the title page in the front and some loose things he needed to be able to refer to in the back . The rest of it just seemed to go downhill from there . All of his pages and booklets were pretty much loose in his backpack when he came to my office to get a new binder.He was very clear that his Mead 5 Star products would have held up to the week .	-1
Unless I recieved a factory second product to review , this binder is substandard.From the outside , it looks fine , although the spine is somewhat 'sloppy'.On opening , there is a basic 3 ring setting that works well , and double pockets on the front and back inside covers.The plastic is bubbled on both inside covers . Perhaps that is a manufacturing error , some factory in China messed up , right ? Wrong . 'Assembled in the USA ' embossed on one of the pockets.Hey , mistakes happen.I put a piece of paper in a pocket . Big mistake . I have fingernails but well manicured , not claws . Even so , the plastic covering , not even the pocket itself , dented from my nail.I 've used other Wilson Jones products , most are quite good.One issue alone would n't make me hate this . All of them together mean you should skip this particular product..	-1
This is a small plastic notebook with round rings . One of the major problems with it , is that the round rings catch the papers at the end and tear the holes . The cover itself does not seem very strong.This seems suitable for organizing some papers that you might want to keep together , but not for a notebook you would use frequently.The price at this time is much higher than my local office supply store sells it for . I also will add that I miss the canvas covered notebooks that seemed to last for years - some of which I am still using .	-1
I am a binder addict . I have them everywhere and use them to organize everything . Usually Wilson Jones is a good brand.When the hinge was formed on this binder either the heat was too hot or it was left too long . So instead of just melting the hinge in , it melted through . So this binder has perforations all down the hinge . Given all the holes , this is not going to last very long.The cover also has a number of bubbles in the vinyl .	-1
This is a larger plastic 3 ring binder . It is not quite as heavy a quality and more expensive than ones I can purchase from our local office supply store . The round rings are especially troublesome in the larger size notebooks . The pages tend to get caught at the end under the rings . A better choice would be the D shaped rings.This does have a clear pocket at the front to slip in a title page or whatever art work you wish . I still really prefer my canvas notebooks which did not stick to my skin , were sturdier and are still in use after 10 years .	-1
This binder is flimsy and has a very cheap feel and look to it . I am not impressed at all and do not have hopes of lasting long when it is taken in and out of my child 's backpack .	-1
This is a cheap , flimsy binder . I was not at all impressed when I took it out of the box . The material is rigid enough , and the rings seem sturdy , but the whole thing `` flops '' about . It is covered both front and back with a clear cover , that you can slip artwork or other things into to make it look more personal . Nice in theory , but it is very thin and mine came with a small tear in it . I know from past experience with this kind of design that the plastic will be torn and dirty in no time flat , just by taking it in and out of a backpack.Not recommended .	-1
When I removed this from the box , I instantly noticed that the front looked strange . It took me a second to realize the clear plastic on the front was ripped at the seam by about three inches ( which is why it was flopping over ) . I do not know if this happened in transport or when packing , but it does not bode well for the folder overall . If it tears this easily , what will happen when put in a backpack ? For us , since we had to dispose of this product ( and send another item to the landfill ) , we have to vote no .	-1
This binder would be fine on a shop floor but is n't suited to presentations or school work . The outside sleeve has a loose fit with a slight gap at the top . The interior has multiple bubbles on the white vinyl . The hinge is very stiff , needing pressure on both sides to open . On the postive sode the binder opens very flat and the flaps flip around easily .	-1
& # 34 ; Heavy Duty & # 34 ; ? No . This is one of the flimsiest binders I 've ever used . It will be fine for light duty but it is certainly not & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; . I will use this binder to store documents that are not needed regularly .	-1
I was hoping that this binder would be better than the other Wilson Jones binder I selected because it was heavy duty . I like red . This might be seen as red by some people , but in reality it has enough yellow in it to cross over to orange . This is orange.The clear exterior pockets feel sloppy to me . The view cover part is not even on the edges and it has waves in it.The D-ring style is easier to have papers in because the pages stay flat . That is the best quality of this binder .	-1
My first thought was , $ 15 , really ? Really ? No way is this binder worth that . I 've bought better binders for half that price from an office store or big box retailer . Worse , mine has all sorts of dark particles trapped between the clear title cover and the white surface beneath . I have no hope if ever getting them out without ruining it.It seems rather flimsy to me for something that claims to be heavy duty , even compared to an older Wilson Jones binder on my shelf . I will use it but I am disappointed , to say the least . Really , there is nothing to distinguish this binder from any other , and for $ 15 , you 'd expect more . It is functional , but nothing more . I 'd buy something else because , why pay more if you do n't have to ?	-1
I do n't know if I just received a bad one in the batch or if there is a design problem with these 3-ring binders , but this is one that gave me several problems . First , there are bits of tiny pieces of cardboard , presumably from manufacturing , in the cover . Second , and far more egregious , the clear plastic cover has already developed about a one inch rip in the corner that pulls away from the front . This makes an already loose cover even looser . There 's really nothing that can be done to fix it , short of duct tape , as experience has shown me that using scotch tape on something like this is only a very short term ( and ugly ) solution.The problems with the binder are n't just aesthetic . I 'm also finding that the binder rings are very difficult to get open . So , despite having these really cool , slanted D-rings , the binder is a chore to use . I can imagine that if I were still a middle school or high school student , the frustration of the rings might actually prevent me from organizing my materials simply because it would be a burden.As I said , I might have just received a bad one , but I 'd opt for the Wilson Jones O-Ring Binder , or a different brand altogether , before purchasing this one .	-1
The white plastic covering felt thinner than older binders that I already have . Instead of having a smooth , tight surface , the plastic bubbles slightly in places . The outer clear plastic cover ( so you can put labels inside ) is ok , but overall the notebook looks and feels cheaply made . It serves its purpose but insofar as being heavy duty , I 'm not so sure . Even the way it is finished is not as nicely done as binders I 've picked up in the past . I would n't recommend this brand ; I 've picked up better quality ones at Kmart and Target .	-1
Not many of my children 's projects or classes require a 3 inch binder , however they product enough artwork that I could fill one of these every few months.I like the D-ring construction as it does n't tend to let pages escape the rings as easily , and D-rings do n't seem to get un-aligned as quickly as their circular brothern.WHAT YOU MIGHT WHAT TO KNOW about this binder is that it 's probably fine for kids projects but I would n't be using it in the office . The principal reason being that it is wrinkled . The plastic outer cover/pockets is wrinkled as it the white plastic that coats/covers the cardback backing . Solid it may be , but pretty it is not.The white of this notebook is not snow white . It has an every so small touch of yellow .	-1
I 'm quite sorry to say this binder is a big disappointment . It arrived with the upper corners ( opposite the hinged side ) bent , but that was probably bad packing , as it was just tossed in a large box with a couple of pieces of inflated plastic cushioning . It seems to me that it would be quite obvious to a packer that during transit those pieces of packing - which were not tightly packed - are going to shift and subject the object inside to the rigors of the sometimes violent actions of the delivery services companies.But I do n't hold that against the binder itself . What is a manufacturing ( or quality control ) shortcoming is that the cover is very thin vinyl , not as thick as that on some binders I have purchased for $ 1.00 at the dollar stores or Wally World back to school sales . It 's also rippled , it does n't lie smoothly over the cardboard covers . So I guess the thin vinyl is not glued to the cover . The textured ( to be glare resistant , I guess ) cover for inserting a picture or description of the contents is also thin and is loose over the cover . This makes me think it would be easy to snag the open edge on something and tear.Also , the covers are larger that 8.5 x 11 inch copy paper ( the illustration shows this too , but I did n't pay attention to it at the time of ordering ) which means it just looks wrong with the 8.5 x 11 paper inserted . Not professional by any means , and anyone with just a touch of OCD is going to be bothered by this . I think a sheet of 12x12 craft or scrapbook paper would fit , but you 'd have to buy 3 sheets to insert into the covers , including over the hinged area.Maybe these issues are too cosmetic , but they seem to me to indicate glaring quality control problems.As far as mechanical operation , the large D-shaped binder rings are easy to open and close and feel substantial , though I only opened and closed them 6 times.Had I seen this binder in a store , I would not have purchased it . And had I purchased it ( it was provided by Amazon through the Vine program in exchange for my honest review ) I would have returned it to Amazon immediately for a refund.Very disappointing that a well known and respected company such as Acco and Wilson Jones have delivered such a subpar product .	-1
I use a lot of binders in the course of my professional and personal life , and am disappointed to say that this binder is not what I 'd expected from the Wilson Jones company . The binder itself arrived with several corners bumped ( even though it had been packed in a large cardboard box with inflated plastic cushions ) . This could be attributed to in-transit damage so I 'll let that pass.On the other hand , the cover of the binder feels cheap . The plastic is n't of thick quality material that can hold up to multiple cover sheets being placed and replaced over time ( as people tend to recycle their binders ) . Oddly enough , the cover sheet itself with the brand name and explanations as to the binder 's purpose and dimensions was missing , which I thought rather odd . I use mainly heavy-duty Avery binders and they always contain that cover sheet and a sticker on the spine that states the thickness of the binder . Not only that , this thin cover also did not fit snugly , instead it hung loose on the front and back of the binder , which made me wonder how well it would hold up to repeated use and handling.The product description states that this binder has : & # 34 ; Custom formulated , PVC Free polypro material ( which ) lasts up to 10x longer than vinyl & # 34 ; . Only time will tell , but my first impression of this binder is that it does n't look to be made of high-quality , durable material . To be fair , the D-shaped rings on the binder are sturdy with the capacity to hold up to 660 sheets of paper . I did not have any problems opening and closing the rings and there were no gaps between the rings when closed . I will update my review on the reliability of this binder once I have used it for several months .	-1
When you look at buying these note pads without the Evernote free subscription , they are almost twice the price . You might be saving a dollar or so over buying the pads and the subscription separately . If you are a heavy Evernote user you would be better off just buying a yearly subscription and a year 's worth of notes.Nothing special here , and certainly nothing free .	-1
Nope . I have been using Amazon Basics Laminating Pouches for 6 months with my Amazon basics Laminator ( which I love ! ) I thought that there would n't be much difference between laminating pouches.To Compare : Swingline : 8.75 & # 34 ; x 11.25 & # 34 ; Amazon : 9 & # 34 ; x 11.50 & # 34 ; This may not seem like a big difference , but bigger sheets are nice.Swingline : sides curled and bottom curledAmazon : All flat . Once in a while , there may a little bubble , but nothing like the swingline sheets.Bottom line . There are so many positive reviews . Maybe I just got a bad batch . A really bad batch . In any case , I think I 'm going to stick with the Amazon Basics Pouches . They work better and are cheaper .	-1
It 's not about quality , durability , or even attractiveness , it 's about the usefulness of this product . First of all the good , it 's solid , not fragile , and the clear color will not clash with any d & eacute ; cor . That said next of is what is missing . There should be some stick-on feet to keep this from sliding all over the desk . Next , the memo pad is plain paper of an odd size when everyone uses post-it notes . I 've been in several office situations is the past decade or so , and they all use post-its . This does not even fit the size of even the square post-it , and is too small for the larger rectangular . Regular paper is less useful than ever in the modern office , so I 'm not sure why they are doing this product . It 's nice that it comes with paper clips and paper , but it has very little utility , even as a paperclip holder . I could never see myself using this.I ca n't recommend this to anyone for it 's intended use , it might may make a nice paperweight . It only gets 2 stars cause it 's not cheaply made , else it would not rate any . Can they improve it , the answer is yes . Add the Post-it size slot , non-skid feet , and maybe a stapler dock or something that mates with the company , plus something to hold the staples , those but not paperclips are at least still in frequent office use .	-1
The pen cup by Swingline is decent-looking , but I found it lacking on a functional level . Personally , I would 've preferred a deeper cup . The present design is a bit too shallow for me . The bottom of the cup interior also lacks a soft or cushioned lining , making it easier to break pencil tips if used with pencils . A small amount of cork-like material would 've made a big difference . But the biggest issue I had with the Swingline pen cup was the lack of felt or rubber feet on the bottom of the exterior . The cup slides all over my desk and will not stay in place . Luckily , I have some 3M rubber feet handy , but it really should 've come with some .	-1

This product seems geared to people from a different era -- the 1950 's . No , it is n't the fact that many people type their lists into a smart phone , or iPad/iPod , etc . making paper note pads increasingly obsolete . It is the name that calls back a bygone time -- Organizher . It has only been a few days since I put it on the refrigerator , but two people have already made jokes at my expense.Specifying a gender for innocuous household products easily used by either sex , especially something as unisex in appearance as this pad , just invites ridicule . For context , and if interested or need a laugh , please read a few reviews for Bic Pens for Women . Example of a possible joke review for this product - `` I received this pad as a gift from a friend but my husband does n't allow me to make lists . He says too much thinking makes my brow furrow . '' The possibilities are endless.Moving on , this four by nine inch `` to do/to buy '' pad is constructed with high quality paper and two sturdy magnets are attached to the back to hold it securely to the refrigerator . The lines are narrow rule , which I prefer . The last pad I had was wide rule with few lines and much of the space seemed wasted . Obviously , personal preference dictates what works for each individual.Lists are useful , but I do n't normally put things on my refrigerator . No judgment is implied in that statement , but in my modest living space the kitchen is visible from every angle so it does not take much for things to look incredibly cluttered . This pad is simple in appearance and although attractive , nondescript . So , no coordination of vivid colors is necessary.I like that the sheets are perforated vertically down the middle but utilizing that unique attribute requires some manipulation because the pages do not tear off the pad easily . I had to take the pad down to remove the list . To remove half the sheet I tore it part of the way across the top , folded it down the middle on the perforation and then removed one side of the list . I tried , and failed to remove a page while the pad was on the refrigerator.Eventually , I envision impatience will cause me to tear-off an entire sheet even if I 'd only filled-out half to avoid the extra step of folding over the perforation after I 've removed the pad from the appliance . The pad is attractive but not as functional as it should be - the paper should tear-off easily . It just is not user friendly , and oh , did I mention the issue with the name ?	-1
There is n't much that sets this apart from every other similar product.It 's a notepad with magnets.Yes , a notepad with magnets . Like every other notepad with magnets.This product has a target audience that is dying out like a T-Rex.Mind you , I 'm the first one to don an apron and make a tuna noodle casserole , but like most modern gals , the shopping list is digital . I was hoping to see a scannable icon or something , but this is simply a notepad with 2 columns . To buy , to do.While this is fine for a low tech house , and certainly it 's great for those that may take the last of something out of the fridge and need to indicate the need for replenishing , but this does n't even have a pen attached .	-1
My usual go-to brand for office supplies is Mead . I like the quality and durability of their products . I was excited about this password keeper . Unfortunately upon receipt , I was not impressed with the product . First , I think the notebook is too long . If you cut it in half , it would be easier to slip in a purse or drawer with calling attention to it . Secondly , the cardboard cover , while attractive , is quite flimsy . The inside of my purse is a war zone . Not sure this notebook has a chance of survival . Finally , the pages are not alphabetized nor is there room for additional notes . For these reasons , I would not recommend this product .	-1
We wo n't get into whether one should record passwords on paper , or use an online service ... I figure most of us have to do one or both of those things to get by these days . I 've been of the & # 34 ; write them down & # 34 ; persuasion , using a little spiral-bound index card set , one account per page . This has had the advantage of allowing lots of room for cross-outs and new passwords to be recorded . Also , it is & # 34 ; free form , & # 34 ; so I can note things like enrollment dates , expiration dates and balance caps . There are LOTS of passwords in my little book , for everything from the house wireless to the credit card account.However , the little book is pretty full , so I thought I 'd try this organizer . Had I noticed that it was specifically an organizHER ( emphasis mine ) , I would n't have . How condescending ! The cover of the booklet , itself , is not particularly feminine , and I see no reason this should be targeted so directly at women , as though a gender has exclusivity on forgetting passwords.Anti-sexism diatribe aside , the book is fundamentally useless , as far as I am concerned , because it does n't have any tabs to it . They call this organization ? It needs a section on finances , a section on web apps , a section on insurance ... you get the idea . Additionally , for each entry , all that is provides is ( conservative ) space for a URL , a user ID and a password ... no room for notes , no space to say what this account actually IS . I can always find a website ... what I ca n't necessarily recall is whether that is husband 's 401 ( k ) from old job , my 401 ( k ) from current job , an account we monitor for the in-laws ... I 'm sticking with my index cards !	-1
I am amazed at the number of people in this day and age who have no central place to store their passwords . I have used a makeshift password keeper for years , but it is running out of space , so I thought a fresh new keeper made for this purpose would be good . Hmm ... well ... .maybe not.This keeper , at 3.5X6.5 inches , is similar to those little pocket calendars that are sold in grocery and drug stores except that it is specifically purposed for password storage . As such , I find the cover too flimsy to protect my valuable information for any length of time and the band that is supposed to keep it securely closed far too flimsy and loose.Each entry has a space for a website URL , username and password and there are six such entries per page . There are plenty of pages ( 64 ) in the keeper for the average non-techie to keep all their passwords in one place . One major weakness of the keeper , though , is a complete lack of any kind of organization -- whether it be tabs or harder-stock dividers every so many pages that can be used to note certain categories of websites/passwords . It helps to have some way to remember where in all these pages to find the particular password we seek.In summary , I can only truly recommend this keeper to those who:1 ) have n't had a password keeper before ; or2 ) currently uses various notes and sheets of paper and wants something expressly for this purpose to consolidated all those papers ; and2 ) does n't plan to carry the keeper with them on a regular basis ( i.e. , will use it primarily at home ) .I do n't think this is going to be adequate for someone who wants to carry their passwords with them every day or has need for storing a great many passwords and needs a way to organize them for quicker retrieval .	-1
This does stick well to my fridge but that 's all I like about it . All of their writing is in a very light color instead of using bold so you can see it easily . Each category just has room to check the little circle next to the item in general that you need but very little space to write anything else below it and each space is very narrow and the next line below to write another item is very close to the one above so you have to write anything extra very , very small . Also very little space to write what you plan on serving each day that week . I guess it is at least good for a reminder but that 's about it . I would n't buy this item .	-1
`` Mead Organizher Magnetic Shopping List , 7.38 x 10 Inches , 75 Sheets Per Pad '' ( Mead Products , LLC , 2012 ) . . . .As a homemaker of the male gender , I 'm all for hanging a good to-do list on the fridge , and thought it would be nice to try one with pre-printed categories on it ... With this particular product , I had n't really noticed the item 's name , the OrganizHER ( get it ? get it ? ) and was slightly appalled by the retro-sexist branding and marketing : '' ... Being a Mom is a full-time job . You 're the queen of budget tracking and meal planning , juggler of multiple schedules and deadlines , and an all-around miracle worker.Designed with busy households like yours in mind , Mead Organizher productshelp bring all of the hats you wear together under one coordinated system ... '' Seriously ? To-do lists specifically designated for soccer moms ? Why not add a few references to tupperware parties or unsightly runs in your nylons ? Maybe something about remembering your school days when your hard-working hubby first gave you his pin , and asked you to `` go steady '' with him . Mead tries to have it both ways -- acknowledging that `` moms '' may actually have jobs , but still bizarrely insisting that running the kitchen is women 's work . Obviously , there are many households where this is true -- but , come on : this is 2013 . There are also plenty of houses where men do or share the housework and pitching a modern-day to-do list as a `` gal '' thing is kind of weird . Besides , which , other than the marketing spiel and the assumption that women do all the housework , there 's nothing about this list that makes it specifically `` feminine . `` In terms of the list itself and its functionality , it 's okay . It 's perhaps a little too prescriptive ( ie , telling you what to buy , assigning big sections of page space to stuff that you may or may not want -- a two-inch square devoted to meat and fish , several kinds of junk food such as pizza , ice cream and `` chips '' -- vegans or diabetics need not apply . ) Also , it 's a pretty large item - at 7x10 inches , this takes up a lot of room on the refrigerator door . Now , I do n't know about you girls , but fridge surface space is at a premium in our house -- I need the room for children 's artwork , report cards and coupons for the nail salon . If you really buy all the stuff on their pre-printed lists , this could be really useful , though assuming you only get a few of the items each week , there 's a lot of extra space that gets wasted -- after trying this format , I decided I still prefer a simpler , smaller , narrower to-do list , maybe one with about 15-20 blank lines , and I 'm good to go . This is good for what it is , and I 'm sure there is a target audience who will find it very useful , although for me , it seemed like overkill .	-1
I like the idea of this a lot . I already do this using just a plain piece of paper from my printer and using magnets to attach to my fridge.Cons : I 'm not really wild about the various grocery items listed such as & # 34 ; cereal & # 34 ; ... .What kind of cereal ? ? ? There 's no real room to write that info after the word & # 34 ; cereal & # 34 ; . There are lots of items on the list like this : fruit , vegetables , beans , soup , to name just a few . Why not leave a space to let the user fill in the specific info after the word ? This would n't work if I have to hand the list over to my hubby to do the shopping.As another reviewer noted : Why is the writing so light ? ? ? Also , they did not leave enough spaces under each heading for me to add what I need specifically . For example , under canned goods , after they list generalized things like soup , there are only 4 blank spaces for me to fill in the canned items I need . That 's really not enough . Who only buys 4 different canned items when they grocery shop for a week 's worth of groceries ? Sure , I could add them in the blank spaces at the bottom of the page but I want to list like with like so I 'm not back tracking or having to scan over the entire list to make sure I did n't miss anything while in the canned goods aisle.One last thing , there 's no sturdy cardboard on the back of this pad . Sometimes I 'm making my list out in the car while my husband drives or standing in front of the pantry where there 's no counter and it would be nice if this had a sturdy back to hold it steady while I write . If I have to go find a book or something else flat to use it on , then I may as well just stick to my plain piece of paper which is lots less expensive.Sorry , this just is n't as helpful as I 'd like and I do n't think I would spend money on it . I could probably print something up on my own computer that is more suited to my needs .	-1
We had an older Board Brothers calendar organizer and loved it . At some point along the way someone opted to clean it with window cleaner , ruining it . Since it was on its last legs I opted to try out this new one.Here 's what I like : Cork liner is thicker than my previous board so I can actually pin things to it without worrying about them falling off.Color tagged corners helps differentiate tasks/people/dates so it 's easy to divvy up the board.The rest , less than satisfying : Board was thick so it protrudes from the wall more than a typical wall board profile.The supplied pen was thick and hard to write clearly with.The surface was thick vinyl and rip/puncture prone.Mounting system was flimsy.Ultimately I think there are better white board organizing centers out there and would n't recommend this one .	-1
**I 'm sure someone in the world would find this product worth fifteen bucks , but I am not that person.To begin with , I am a male person , a him . The product is called an Organizher , not an Organizhim . I realize Organizhim does n't sound like a word whereas Organizher sounds almost exactly like the word organizer ( which I do n't think is a coincidence ) , but I 'll be gosh-begorrahed if I 'm going to display a product called Organizher on a wall of my extremely macho garage or shop or carry it around my extremely masculine gymnasium as I go from one station to the next , lifting weights that most estrogents could n't . And if I were gay that still would n't mean I 'd want to be using a product plainly labelled for hers . As Thor from Nurse Jackie once said , I think , `` I 'm gay . I 'm not a girl . '' Even funnier , in response to Zoey 's attempt to fake an Irish accent : `` We 're Irish , not pirates . '' Whoops , I think I drifted away there . **The product under review offers what at first seems like a useful combination of features , such as a dry-erase board and a corkboard . Well , OK , that is the complete list of features . However the dry-erase board , divided arbitrarily into five columns , is too small to be useful whereas the corkboard below it is too small to be useful . Also , it 's not really cork.Speaking of size , the Mead Organizher Reminder Center , 24 x 16 Inches ( 98137 ) measures 24 inches in width , as advertised . What it does n't measure as advertised is 16 inches in height . It 's 6 . If it really were 16 inches tall this product might be usefully large , but then it would take up 167 % more space . As it is I literally can not find a single place where I would mount it , at 2 feet across , in the kitchen . **Since all typical people are right-handed , why does the marker mount on the left side of the product ? I 'm sure there 's a good reason , and I swear by all that is holy that I will not rest till I find out what it is so I can report it back here to this review . You should probably check back every few hours . **As I consider this product in its totality -- pretending I 'm a harried mother of three or four busy kids with much overdue homework and many court dates and a lazy , forgetful bum of a husband and a three-dog , two-cat household to tend to , not to mention having to stop fives a day to pray -- I still do n't think I would ever go to the trouble of using the Mead Organizher Reminder Center , 24 x 16 [ sic ] Inches ( 98137 ) . Since it was free to me through the Amazon Vine program , you can imagine how much I 'd be willing to pay for it . **	-1
I this was a great idea when I ordered it as I am forever searching for loyalty cards . The problem is that it is hard to put the cards in and harder to pull them out . Whether the card is a plastic credit card one ( like a coffee card ) or a bread card , it takes just as long to put the card in and pull it out as it does for me to find it in my purse.I was hoping it would be more efficient to use . I 'm disappointed that this is n't more user friendly . It 's a great idea for all those oyalty cards that I have accumulated .	-1
I have an LG side by side stainless steel fridge . This does not stick to it . It has 3 very large square magnets on the back so I do not know why that is the case . I also tried it on my metal door and it did n't work there either . Perhaps it is defective.There are small spots for 5 people 's activities but only the most important ones of the day . I am very disappointed it did n't work out for us .	-1
Despite being surrounded by air-packs in an undamaged box , this item arrived creased and dented . You can damage it easily with light pressure from a fingernail . The marker has a loop in the top , but the board has no corresponding point to attach it , and there 's no cord provided . The magnets are sturdy , but limit you to putting this up on a refrigerator . While the price is low enough to make this a throwaway item , I 'd prefer to pay more for something a bit sturdier that could be mounted in a home office rather than the kitchen .	-1
I very rarely write a negative review , but this item in general is beyond awful . I can not understand how any reviewer can say this cover is sturdy and how anyone gave it 5 stars.The cover is basically 2 pieces of plastic held barely by a strip of material that surrounds the plastic ring device - it looks and feels like it is just holding together by a thread and it 's demise looks like it will be any minute . Placing it in my purse ( where it is intended to go ) is not an option as the trauma of it banging around in there will kill it off immediately . Plus the fact the pages do NOT even turn easy with the plastic junk rings . I understand that the cheap price should give a clue that this is not going to be a luxurious day-planner- but this can not be used in the way which it is supposed to be used . I give this part of the item ZERO stars and I am kicking around actually throwing the binder part away.That said - the inserts are OK and i think overall I would like them even more if placed in another binder . Shopping lists - always useful , thick paper pockets - can hold slips of paper like receipts and coupons which it is intended to hold , plastic credit card/loyalty card holder , another large plastic holder i am not sure what for ( but it big enough to be a pen/pencil holder if you choose ) and website organizer pages to jot down your favorite online retailer info . And I have already been to the MEAD website to view the inserts that can be downloaded , printed and placed in the binder . The inserts are the reason I overall gave this 2 stars.If it would be free to send it back I would , but since it is a cheap item and will cost almost the actual item cost in shipping it back , I am going to try to work with it . I am thinking of getting the smallest , thinnest , REAL 3 ring binder I can find , and placing these inserts in that binder , ( Of course Mead makes it hard by making this a 2 ring system , and so I will punch a third hole in the existing inserts ) . At 5.5 x 8.5 - it would take a standard half letter/junior binder so it will not be too hard to find the right size . It kind of makes me disappointed I have to jump through hoops and have extra expense to make this work for me . Just using the inserts part of this system is not worth the price I paid .	-1
This was not at all what I was expecting given the description of it . My old coupon organizer is almost worn out after 10+ years of service so I thought this might be a good replacement but it is lacking in several ways . Let 's look at it from the front to the back.The cover is sturdy with a hard plastic and water resistant fabric binding , the elastic strap is a good way to keep it close while the two-rings allow you to add in more pages.The first page is a clear sheet with eight oddly shaped holders for sometime but I 'm really reminded of business cards plus unused space more than anything too useful . If I 'm organizing my shopping why would I bring business cards ? Then we get the & # 34 ; here 's how you use the shopping list & # 34 ; page and the first coupon pocket which is a double-sided paper page with half of it a pocket to put things in ... things you then could n't see easily as I can do with my horizontal coupon organizer . There are four more of these coupons pockets for a total of 10 categories you could create.Then there are the two-column shopping lists that can be torn out after you are done . 30 pages with 4 lists each so a total of 120 lists . I removed mine and moved them in front of the first coupon pocket . Pulling the binder rings open is a bit of effort but they snap back easily . Then I realized this inverted the tabs and had to redo it all again ... Annoying ! Then we have three pages where you can list websites and blogs ... why ? There is no calendar here to help you organize this is really just a shopping organizer and I do n't know about you but I do n't cruise the Net while I 'm shopping and if I did the urls I 'd need would already be on my smartphone or tablet.Finally we get a big single clear zip-shut holder that again has an unclear purpose.I felt like this was designed by someone who has heard about shopping and coupons but never used them .	-1
For those of you who already track your expenses and have a budget , like I do , this may not be what you are looking for . I personally use Quicken to track all my expenses and I pay my bills online . I have one place where all bills go and I put when they are due on my Google Calendar ( though most are due on the 10th ) .This is a great tool for those of you who need one place to put your bills . There are pockets for each month to put them in . It is also a great place to build a budget , meaning estimate the amount of money in each category that you are going to spend . There is a place on each month ( you fill out the month at the top left of the page - so you can start anytime which is a plus ! ) and put the expense , amount you paid , date you paid it , check number and confirmation number.All those items that I mentioned above are recorded by me in Quicken and in my hand-written checkbook . So , just speaking for me , this is a duplicate record and does n't help me.There is also a checklist at the top of each page for things you may want to do each month . There is an example there of what you may like to use this list for ( like search online for airfare discounts ) and a box to check off when you 've completed the activity Again , that may be helpful for you if you like to coordinate hand-written lists with the bills you pay.For me , those types of lists are kept online so this is n't helpful.To be clear , if you are new to tracking your expenses and are not familiar with Quicken ( or not willing to become familiar with it - it 's pretty simple to use . ) this may be a very helpful tool . There are also other online software programs that can help you but I am not familiar with them . I use Quicken 2004 and have not updated it . It is wonderful for tracking expenses , balancing checkbooks , etc .	-1
It looks like a throw back from 1970s , and not a good one . It is ugly , not well designed , and unrealistic to use . The moment I opened it , I was disappointed and surprised that anyone can possibly find it useful . I would be enticed to make a not digital album if it offered an amazingly high quality clever design , paper , and was beautifully functional . This album is none of the above . A collection of ugly pockets bound in purple . What was the design team thinking ?	-1
This lamp is very modern in look and initially I was impressed by it . On the base are 5 buttons in a circle to control the amount of light being put out . The problem is that the light is harsh and unless you dim it to the nth degree , you 're going to be blind or have the mother of all headaches . It is not soft light but hard almost florescent type lighting.Another problem is that the black frame for the lamp attracts all manner of dust particles . It looks dusty and dirty even though it was just opened.Bottom line , the lamp has good output but the light hurts my eyes .	-1
For those who do n't know , a & # 34 ; touch typist & # 34 ; refers to those of us who learned to use a keyboard without watching our fingers ( I 'm finding this is a dying skill ) . Touch typists use their right thumb to strike the space bar , and since there 's a space between every word we 're constantly striking the space bar . The lip on this keyboard is elevated such that I ca n't properly hit the space bar , making this keyboard impossible for me to use.Yes , it 's a tiny keyboard with tiny keys , just like the iPad mini . I can generally adjust to even the smallest keyboards , but the space bar issue is a killer . If you 're primarily someone who hunts and pecks on a keyboard , this works fine . I was able to easily pair it with an array of devices , including a couple for which this keyboard is not intended ( e.g. , a Windows 8.1 ASUStablet , and an Android tablet ) . The Bluetooth connectivity is n't in question here . Also , my friend 's iPad mini nestled easily into this and appeared to be protected when closed.I 've used other OXA Bluetooth keyboards , including one for the full sized iPad , that did n't have any issues at all . I 'm a fan of inexpensive + good which is a hallmark of a lot of OXA products , but this just is n't one of their better efforts.NOTE : I received a sample keyboard from OXA for this review .	-1
I thought this would be a fun stapler for our school room . When I opened up the package , I found the skin it coupon and went online . The site had a great selection , but was very slow . I have fios and it was n't acting that slow on any other site . Eventually , I selected the skin for my alma mater and ordered it . That process was very easy.Unfortunately , a stapler ( while fun to see ) is really a practical item and it needs to work well to be really useful . I have two staplers in my school room right now . A standard metal swingline that 's fifteen years old and a plastic Stanley Bostich that 's just as old . Both work well though once in a great while ( like all staplers ) they can get jammed . I compared this new Swingline to my other two staplers to see how well it works.I folded a piece of paper until there were 16 thicknesses . This swingline could n't staple it -- at all ! It did a horrible job . My other two staplers both were able to staple the 16 thicknesses of paper just fine.I tried a thinner thickness of paper -- 4 sheets and the Swingline Skins stapler did fine . But , my other staplers ( which I looked up on Amazon and cost half the price of this one ) did well too.If you 're purchasing this stapler because it 's fun , then you 'll be happy with it . But , if you need a stapler that will actually staple between 16 and 20 sheets -- I 'd keep looking .	-1
Boy , did I need a new stapler at my home office . And boy , did I make a wrong selection trying this . Swingline has really lost its touch making staplers . They and Bostitch used to have the market cornered.This is a plain white stapler which has a long pin number enclosed . If you go to the website they tell you , you can enter the pin and obtain a free & # 34 ; skin & # 34 ; -- a sticker to apply to the whole stapler.Trouble is , the thing is a piece of junk ! Why , oh why ? Swingline 's other staplers are fairly reliable , yet too often they make real bombs . Avoid this and get a sturdy , reliable model that does not require any playing around like this one does .	-1
There is no way I would spend almost $ 20 on a stapler that can not staple a large number of papers . This stapler does not come with any staples when you purchase it . And it does not staple 20 sheets of paper . It really is an expensive kids stapler . Sure the idea of design your own is fun , but I think most adults looking for a professional desk top are not going to do anything too flashy . This stapler is really cost prohibitive , especially considering it can only handle small jobs . There are better choices for the money .	-1
It 's a Swingline , and if you 've ever seen OFFICE SPACE , the battle for who owns that stapler is now resolved ! Go to the website , order using the credit code and customize yours easily . Did this for my wife , a small thing but keeps `` rats '' away from making an essential desk accessory walk away : ) BRILLIANT , fun , cute , silly , a great idea for a student or someone with a small business : put that logo right there.Well , was I surprised that it took January to the middle of March to get this skin . Thought we had it and I frankly misunderstood . Today , the sticker came , actually 3 pieces of stickers .	-1
Yeah , this is the first stapler I have ever seen that is sold without any staples , not even one strip . And nowhere one the package or the description does say that & # 34 ; Staples not included & # 34 ; .The focus is entirely on the & # 34 ; Skins & # 34 ; designer labels , and yes it is nice to be able to customize your stapler as yours , the skins website was easy to access , order and they went on easy . But see above where it says & # 34 ; CUSTOMIZE ME & # 34 ; ? That is not a label , it is part of the stapler . If you do n't want to see it , you will have to customize it.As for functionality , yeah 20 sheets might be pushing it . It will be good for home use and maybe some school work . But for business or lots of paperwork , I would get a true business model.Overall , if it came with staples , if it did n't have to be customized , it would be a good stapler , but as it is , I would not recommend this product .	-1
I think the Design aspect of this stapler is a fantastic idea . Something fun the kids can do to individualize their look.BUT as a stapler this is fairly pathetic only stapling some of the time , and nothing close to 20 pages . That said , I can totally see buying this for situations where you do n't want to commit prime resources . Putting together projects for school or church or synagogue ... you could buy a bunch of these and if one walked off you would n't feel compelled to cry . Same with sending one of these off with your kids to keep in their locker . But I would never suggest anyone buy one of these for the office . Even a home office . It 's just too flimsy .	-1
Our old stapler gave out , so I was excited to try this one through Amazon Vine . When it arrived , I opened the package and found a piece of paper to try it out . To my dismay , there were no staples at all in the stapler ! I have purchased many staplers over the years , and I have never found one that did n't include at least a few staples so that you could use the product immediately.I really have no interest in customizing my office products , but to complete the review , I went to the website to choose a skin . At first when I typed in the code , it took me to the homepage where there was no obvious place to enter a code . I tried to search for a stapler , but nothing came up . I tried again and found that you have to type in the & # 34 ; www & # 34 ; at the beginning of the URL.I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were quite a few designs to choose from . Since we are a military family , I chose a skin that honored the soldiers who have died for our country . Very cool ! So basically , 1 star for the stapler ( since there are no staples included ) but 5 stars for the skin selections .	-1
I find this easy to get a good hand-around-it grip on . However , I tried 20 sheets and it was jamming and hanging up with the staple only half out , it would n't even do 10 for me . I find it 's only good for 5-6 sheets.There is a good selection of custom skins which you get one for free . It took about a week to arrive . I did not get it on quite perfectly - no surprise there.UPDATE - if you are going to buy a stapler , buy theSwingline Commercial Desk Stapler , 20 Sheets , Black ( 44401 ) It costs less and is an excellent stapler , much better than this one .	-1
I got this stapler because it seemed like a great idea to add my favorite team logo , The Chicago Blackhawks , to a nice stapler . The stapler is fine , but , the skin-it site is worthless . It took me more than 20 tries over two weeks to get into the site . Then , I could n't find any staplers under products . I finally gave up trying . Save yourself some headaches and buy a simple , plain stapler .	-1
I think you should spend your money on buying a stapler where the cost has been put in the mechanism . You can find on the website this same stapler , just in solid colors rather than customizable , for less than one half the cost.It can do 8 pages , sometimes . I used it to staple 120 math tests , each one 4 pages . It can do 4 pages but it jammed a total of 5 times during the test using Swingline staples . As a teacher , I do a lot of stapling , and it has been my experience that with newer staplers the ones that load from underneath , with a spring loaded carriage ( sort of like a staple gun ) jam the least . My favorite stapler is actually a Swingline , which is probably 20 years old and built like a tank . It never jams , ever . A close second is a stapler called Paper Pro that uses the property of a lever to make stapling easier , and the small size of that type costs less currently than this stapler.This stapler is cute and all , and picking out the skin is fun , but when it jams up the cuteness factor quickly wears off . This is sort of like putting a wonderful custom paint job ( and the skins are cool ) on a Yugo .	-1
I was excited to get this stylus/pen , but I was surprised to find that I really do n't like it . The most positive thing I can say about it is that that pen writes well ( black ink ) . But I dislike everything else . *The barrel is blunt at the pen tip , rather than tapered , so it 's hard to see what you 're writing . *The barrel is kind of slippery . *The whole thing is uncomfortably heavy . I thought maybe I was imagining it , so I weighed it . It is 23g vs. 6g for a ballpoint pen I had sitting on my desk . Nearly four times as heavy ! And because it is much shorter than a regular pen , the weight is concentrated in a smaller area . And without a grip , you really feel that weight . It 's very tiring on the hand . *The stylus works okay , but it tore a bit when I tried to put it back on after pulling it off ( as you would do when replacing it ) . Also , I wish there was a place within the stylus/pen to store the replacement nib . I do n't really want to hold on to the box , but what are the odds of my keeping track of the nib by itself ? Both the pen and stylus would be okay to use in a pinch , especially for a short time , but I ca n't imagine using this thing on a regular basis .	-1
Touchscreen styluses are not all alike . Besides color , there are subtle differences in sensitivity , length , barrel size , weight , and attachment clips or lanyards . The latest stylus trend seems to be ballpoint-pen/stylus combinations , like this MOSHI STANZA DUO ( 2-in-1 DUAL STYLUS AND PEN ) .The ballpoint-pen/stylus barrel has a handsome brushed-silver finish . With pen retracted , the combo is 5 '' long ; at 0.77 ounce it seems a little heavy for long tablet sessions . There is a pocket clip -- twisting the barrel retracts the clip into the barrel and extends the ballpoint pen for writing ( a noteworthy design feature ! ) . The pen has a smooth-writing , medium-fine point that I like quite well . The barrel pulls apart easily for replacement of the ink cartridge . The 1-1/4 '' barrel is comfortable to hold , either as a pen or as a stylus.Unfortunately , the stylus is not unusually sensitive , and it 's squishy-soft . Touch a tablet screen with anything but the lightest pressure , and the silicone nib totally collapses , allowing the hard end of the stylus to contact the screen . Although the tablet screen is protected from scratches and/or breakage by the rubbery nib ( at least while the nib is new ) , the feeling of metal stylus on touchscreen is quite unpleasant . I associate this sort of collapsing nib with ultra-cheap styluses ( e.g.,10 Pcs Stylus Set ) , rather than with advanced-design writing instruments . The package includes an extra silicone stylus tip -- to install it , you unscrew the stylus end , pull off the old nib , pull on the new nib , and screw the stylus end back on.A pen/stylus combination that I like much better , because of the solid stylus tips , is theamPen Hybrid 3-in-1 Stylus . For a stylus without a pen , I like theAmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devicesmuch better . Because of the soft stylus tip that completely flattens with minimal pressure , I rate this MOSHI STANZA DUO at 2 stars ( `` I do n't like it '' on the official Amazon scale ) .	-1
So this must be the Cadillac of stylus and pens right ? I mean look at that price ! That could easily be a person & # 8217 ; s first reaction to seeing this . All I can say is , it & # 8217 ; s not . I & # 8217 ; m not saying that the stylus isn & # 8217 ; t nice . It is . It works fine . And it looks fancy . The pen is ok. You can refill it which is nice as well . But honestly I & # 8217 ; ve had Bic pens that wrote better . So it works fine . Not sure about that price tag though.Quality : High Price : High Functionality : Fair	-1
This set has an eraser , 4 markers , and a holder . The holder ONLY works specifically with the Quartet Prestige Board . I have a different board , so of course it does n't work with mine . There 's one picture that comes with the package of how to install the caddy on the board , but no explanation about the rest of the set.I took the eraser apart and found a larger eraser piece inside . It was very strange . There was n't an adhesive strip on the piece so it could n't be added right onto the outside of the eraser ... .and there were no directions to give me a clue about what to do with it . The eraser , in particular , seems very cheap . It is oddly designed and has bumps on the outside as if it is supposed to clip into another piece except that the black piece it clips into does n't clip in on the sides . Odd . As for the eraser sitting in the caddy , I would have thought it would have been magnetized in some way or fit tightly into the holder as the markers do . It does n't . I 'm afraid it is going to fall out every time I slightly knock against it.The best part about the caddy is actually the markers . They are big chisel edge markers . The markers work surprisingly well , though they 're made for a big wipe board and not a small one like people might have at home .	-1
The four pen colors are bold and thick , great for larger white boards . The pens have a visual ink level similar to a gas tank gauge with full to empty measurements . The cap on the pen can be attached to the bottom of the pen while in use and makes a clear snapping sound so you know it 's secure.The quality of the eraser was disappointing . While the eraser itself measures 6 inches by 1.5 inches , the actual & # 34 ; eraser & # 34 ; portion is 1/2 inches wide . It 's a thin piece of grey felt ATTACHED to Velcro tape and does n't stay on the device . Both edges of the eraser have sharp points and are painful if you happen to use the eraser with your hands . Ouch ! The problem could be solved if you have a file and can soften those two edges.The plastic device to hold the pens is sturdy and measures 8.25 inches long by 4 inches wide , not including the additional & # 34 ; clip & # 34 ; that adds one more inch to the width.If you like the product , buy it for the thick bold pens and use a different eraser .	-1
This is a set of 4 Chinese made white board markers together with a very cheaply made holder which clips to the side of a while board , and a VERY cheaply made eraser . This stuff is junk and not worth half the Amazon price .	-1
First the pros : The EnduraGlide dry-erase markers are very nice . Four vibrant colors : black , green , red , and blue . These large markers are comfortable to hold and have bullet-point tips that provide smooth and precise writing . I expect that these will last a long time.Now the cons : The eraser and caddy are pretty useless . Most of the eraser is the handle ; the actual erasing component is only a narrow strip of felt approximately 6 & # 8221 ; x & # 8221 ; that began to fall off after one use . The eraser is too big for erasing small areas ( the small felt erasers found on the lids of many kinds of dry-erase markers work much better ) , and it & # 8217 ; s much too narrow for efficiently erasing an entire board . You & # 8217 ; ll be better served by using a simple cloth or paper towel for that task . I & # 8217 ; ll probably toss the eraser in the trash . The caddy seems needlessly bulky and takes up too much of my writing space when I attach it to the 2 & # 8217 ; x 3 & # 8217 ; dry-erase board that I have in my kitchen . It may work better in an office or classroom setting with a much larger dry-erase board . If that & # 8217 ; s not the case , I suggest buying the markers separately and foregoing the caddy .	-1
I like upgraded markers that come with this set , though not nearly as much as theQuartet EnduraGlide Dry-Erase Markers , Bullet Tip , Assorted Colors , 4 Pack ( 5001-1M ) . Further the included eraser is a bit odd . It has just a 1/2 inch wide surface so it makes erasing a lot of writing somewhat awkward.Also , the clip that attaches the caddy to the board is a bit flimsy . It does n't feel like it will stand up over time given how much stress the caddy with get with markers and the eraser being pulled in and out all the time .	-1
The ink quality on these pens is excellent , vibrant color and it does n't look like they 're going to run out any time soon . However , the caddy is basically a waste -- it 's so heavy that it unbalances my whiteboard , and the way it 's designed there 's no way to stand it up on its own . The eraser is also not a very useful shape -- it 's too large for anything other than erasing the entire board , and it 's only a thin strip of felt so you ca n't erase on the edge . Additionally , the caddy does n't even really hold the eraser -- if it 's tipped even the slightest bit in any direction , the eraser falls out .	-1
