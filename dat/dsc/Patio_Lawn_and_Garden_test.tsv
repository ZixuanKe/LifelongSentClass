This is an exceptional product : well-made , comfortable , light-weight . But most importantly they work wonderfully . I have never had a lopper that performed so well . The branches I have pruned were like butter . This utilizes your force much better than any previous product . It does n't telescope , but anything within reach or on a ladder will be very easy to prune exactly as you want.We have some huge roses and using a hand pruner is impossible . I can not wait until spring to try these on our roses . I am sure they will make quick work of what was an onerous/hard job . Bottom-line is the construction makes for the best possible use of your force and the blades cut through branches like tissue . It also has a handy storage piece for the blades that locks into place . Highly recommended .	1
These are pricey but will probably be the last pair of loppers you ever need . The blades are European steel and continue in one solid piece down the handles , so there are no joints/connections to break . I have actually broken the handle off cheap loppers . The steel handles are covered with high-quality aluminum handles , with cork grips at the end . I was curious about the inclusion of the cork but I suppose it is light and will improve grip , and cork will actually expand a bit when wet to give even better grip . I do wonder what the cork will be like if it gets chipped years down the road , but the loppers should still mechanically work fine regardless.So how well do they work ? The effort required to cut up to 2 '' branches is impressively minimal . I could almost say it 's like cutting butter . To open the blades fully and get the full ~2 '' cut the handles open almost perpendicular , 4.5 feet wide at the tips . This allows you to take full advantage of leverage and the gearing . But opening that wide can also be a disadvantage if space is tight , like when I was cutting dead branches off the trunk of a spruce tree with other nearby prickly branches and needles.Even though they are not heavy for their size they are fairly long , so using them can be a bit of a workout . If you do a lot of cutting your arms may feel it if you 're not in shape . The actual cutting is surprisingly easy , but just wielding them can be tiring.Overall I 'd highly recommend these loppers , they are well-made , strong , and cut with ease . They should last a lifetime .	1
Digging through my barn and tool shed recently I discovered that I have no less than seven loppers at my disposal - loppers I have collected down through the years . This does not count an untold number of these things that have been loaned to relatives and friends never to be seen again ... .good grief , I am a push-over.We have several acres of land which include woods , an orchard , flower beds , rose garden and numerous shrubs and trees . When I received these loppers by Fiskars I immediately put them to work . As of this writing they have over 28 hours on the . Trimming , cutting and cleaning is a year around deal at our place and for ever limb or plant that needs trimmed , a dozed more seem to appear over night.So far I have tried these loppers on apple , peach , pear , cherry , oak , hickory , mulberry , locust , wild cherry , Osage orange , large back berry brambles , grape vines and an plethora of trees that I simply do not know the name of . This lopper has not failed me one time.It does indeed , as advertized , handle limbs up to two inches in diameter . Hate to use the term , but these loppers go through everything like cutting through soft butter . They make a very clean cut ; a decisive cut and it takes very little effort to do this cutting . For me the handles are just the right length to give maximum leverage and the cord grips are great . They actually work even better ( the grips ) when they become a bit moist with sweat.Two thing to remember about this tool . First , it works best when the biting end is opened to the widest point ... do not try to nip a limb with just the end of the cutting surface . Second , do remember that the business end of this is steel and even though it is touted at rust resistant ... it will never the less rust eventually if not cleaned properly or left out in the elements . After every use I make sure mine or cleaned and I apply a very , very thin film of three in one oil . I have done this with all my yard tools over the years and I have some clippers and loppers that have been in constant use since the 1940s and are still going strong.This lopper may seem a bit high ended but if taken care of it will last you a life time and will quire likely be the only lopper you will ever have to buy.Impressive product.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I choose Fiskars brand a lot when I have the choice . I 've chosen their rakes , scissors , loppers and paper cutters . This Quantum Hand Lopper is replacing a Lopper I had that a neighbor `` permanently borrowed '' : ) Fiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper- my fault for lending because they are so amazing that there are always more projects to do with them . My other Loppers were over 8 years old and holding strong ... . but they have found a new home.That said , I decided to try the Cadillac of Loppers ! That would be these , the Quantum Hand Lopper by Fiskars . This one is different . It 's different with it 's cork coated handle that absorbs some of the shock and it 's light materials . The mechanism is flawless and it cuts branches and small trees ( 2 '' max ) like butter . The leverage these type of loppers provide is amazing . The handle takes some of the shock out of the last phase of each cut . These really are a lighter option too ... and that makes for an easier lopping experience when you are doing it for several cuts.These are superb and you are going to pay for that . If you take your pruning seriously and need the best tool to lop , buy these . They are nearly 4X more expensive than others but you do get what you pay for . Made in Finland with lighter materials and patented gearing technology that multiplies your effort.Fantastic !	1
I had to try these on some limbs that had been annoying me ... they were easy to use and I found them strong and durable ... I also asked me 80 year old father to take down a limb and he too found them to be simple to use and to not take much effort	1
I 'm a professional landscaper and as such , own a variety of loppers , including Corona , Garret Wade 's Pro Ratcheting lopper , and the Fiskars PowerGear models which are cheaper but do break more often . This new line of professional loppers is Scandinavian-made , so the metal quality and workmanship is a step above the usual `` made in China '' tools you 'll find at the local hardware store.This lopper has very long handles which makes them a little tough to ease into the interior of rosebushes , for example , but gives you much more leverage when pruning thicker tree branches . The handle length is something to consider when choosing a lopper - short handles get into smaller shrubs easier but require more power to work . This lopper cuts inch-thick woody branches with absolute ease , and because it is bypass-style , it makes a very clean cut that is unlikely to develop disease issues.This lopper is comparable in weight , for its size , to the PowerGear loppers from Fiskars , which is to say it is heavier because it is longer , but not much heavier . And I love that this high-end lopper has a similar gearing system to the regular Fiskars PowerGear loppers we use as standard in my landscaping business.If I were cutting hard , crusty dead wood , I 'd probably choose the Garret Wade Pro Ratcheting lopper over this , just because it has a ratchet feature which makes it possible to cut thicker , harder branches easily ( and it has extending handles , which is nice ) , but you pay for that gfeature set on the Garrett Wade ones with added weight . These Fiskars ones are the nicest everyday pruning lopper I have seen . They far beat out my standard coronas which were about seventy dollars , and are obviously a cut above the regular PowerGear line from Fiskars in both longevity and cutting ability ( they seem to cut with slightly more ease and have a coating to keep the blade from gumming up.The cork acts as a bumper to keep wrists from getting strained and reduce that jarring sensation after each cut . It 's surprisingly effective.Overall , a fantastic everyday lopper that is worth the extra money .	1
I live in Tucson and have to do a lot of pruning on Mesquite trees and sagebrush bushes . The largest diameter I can go up to with my current loppers is about 1.5 inches and that 's a struggle . With the Fiskars I 'm able to get through those branches with about 1/2 the effort . Of course the blade is brand new so that helps but the geared blades really give excellent leverage on the cut . The padded handles are a plus and the whole tool feels very solid and high quality . I 've got other Fiskars tools ( hedge clippers , scissors ) and the blades tend to stay sharp a very long time . Overall I 'm very happy with these and would be surprised if they did n't work well for years to come .	1
I frequently use loppers in the yard - my old loppers are also Fiskars but they were much lower quality - maybe a thirty buck pair . These are in a different league . I effortlessly sliced through a fairly thick oak limb today and used them to tame some Philodendrons Gone Wild in the front yard . I then used them to break up some cabbage palm fronds and to slice out a root that was keeping me from digging a fence post hole.There is extra leverage in the long handles . Couple that leverage with a gearing mechanism and you will no longer have to jar your shoulder trying to cut through a 2 '' branch . I 'm very impressed with these although there are two points that I believe need improvement . First , my loppers do n't stay closed - they are fairly loose and want to open when I 'm carrying them . My other cheaper Fiskars loppers are much more tight . Second , I worry about the longevity of the cork . Aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to grip ... but durable ? Time will tell . Finally , the price point is a bit steep which means you 'll have to really need good loppers if you plan to buy these.Overall , I 'm impressed by these and using them is actually a bit of fun . They 're just so effortless compared to cheaper loppers . Get them . You wo n't be sorry !	1
My `` yard '' is about a quarter acre , with no lawn , only trees , shrubs and flowers . The trees are older than 20 years and include multiples of birch , hackberry , Italian cypress , mock orange , crape myrtle , weeping bottlebrush , Callery pear , xylosma , pine , oak , redwood , and last , but not least , manzanita . I have cared for these trees with another heavy-duty lopper with varying degrees of success , so I wanted to try another tool.Because of the price , my initial thought was that these were going to lose a star for that alone . Then I used them . Many of the tree types in my yard can be cut fairly easily ; however , the pine , oak , redwood and manzanita are extremely hard , especially in thicker branches . These loppers went through the pine , oak , and redwood branches like a hot knife through butter . Obviously , loppers have limits because at some point , i.e. , thickness , you have to resort to a pruning saw , but when these went through one-inch plus diameter manzanita branches without too much effort , they had me . Supposedly the loppers will handle up to two inches , so this review will be updated as I try to prune larger branches as well as the item 's general wear.Generally in handling the loppers , I especially like the light weight and the shape of the handles being more flattened versus fully round . If I were to suggest one improvement , it would be to have the handles be telescoping as my older lopper is because I am only 5'3 '' tall . Here is the rest of the story : I 'm 66 and have fibromyalgia . Using these loppers nonstop for three hours was not anywhere near as difficult or jarring as it was with my old loppers . As for the cost , they will pay for themselves versus hiring gardening services.Regarding the lifetime warranty , I already know that Fiskars stands behind its products . I have the Fiskars 9240 Telescoping Pruning Stik , purchased in 2006 , and had to contact Fiskars for repairs in 2011 . Customer service is exceptional . Regarding maintenance , Fiskars recommends that if you do not feel comfortable sharpening your own tools , ask your local gardening center to recommend a professional sharpening service , or call Fiskars ' warranty service line at 1-800-500-4849 for more information . Fiskars does not provide sharpening service . Other care instructions are included on Fiskars ' website.September 11 , 2013 update : I did more cutting today , deliberately for 2-inch thick branches ; my old lopper could not do this at all , but the Fiskars worked beautifully .	1
Having had terrible experiences with similar ( yet different ) products , I was a little hesitant about the Fiskars Quantum Hand Lopper . The first time I used them , I knew they were perfect for me . They are lightweight and require little muscle power to operate them . They cut cleanly and , to be honest , are a little addictive -- I found myself lopping off branches that were n't even iffy , just annoying . Having struggled with heavier models that did not cut as efficiently , I was actually HAPPY to do this gardening chore . In fact , I ENJOYED it . I never thought that would happen .	1
These loppers were put to the supreme test in a tornado ravaged , wooded , 2 acre yard as soon as they arrived . My husband was amazed how easily & effortlessly they sliced through 2 '' branches . Our petite daughter-in-law was anxious to try them out too and was surprised how easy it was for her to cut up debris . She found them so easy to use that she decided to try them on larger branches . She was able to cut through a 2.25 '' branch but had to brace the handle against her body for more leverage . After spending a few weeks cleaning up our son 's tornado ravaged yard , we 're primed and ready to tackle our daughter 's overgrown lilac bush . I 'll update my review when we try these loppers out on some huge yucca plants & let you know how they worked on her lilac bush too.UPDATE : We used these on some huge yucca plants . The loppers cut through the large flower stalks like they were butter . I cut down at least 7 huge stalks . The worst problem I had was that I had to open the loppers all the way to get them around the stem.The Fiskars 9482 Quantum Hand Lopper has very , very sharp blades made from European steel which stays sharp . The blades are coated with a rust-resistant , low-friction coating which makes cutting easier & prevents the blade from gumming up . The cork handles are comfortable to grip . The patented gearing technology is designed to multiply your leverage & gives 3 times more cutting power than most loppers . So far , Fiskars 9482 Quantum Hand Lopper has lived up to its advertised claims . I will update my review if my opinion changes.We kept the hard plastic , packaging sleeve that protects the sharp blades , and protects you from the sharp blades , to use when we store the lopper.Lifetime WarrantyMade in Finland	1
This is not your typically lopper tool . Fiskars put alot of thought into this product . Even before you open your package you see the craftsmanship detail that went into them . You hope your first impressions last as you open up the package - and it does , and surpasses it . These are very strong yet lightweight . They are made of aluminum alloy handles and they have handle pads made from cork to provide a comfortable grip . I 100 % love this feature . Its not only comfortable to use , but also adds detail and style to these pruners . Best of all it comes with a lifetime warranty.These are idea for pruning tree branches up to a 2 '' diameter . The steel blade is 100 % rust-resistant . Fiskars has a patented non-circular gearing mechanism multiplies leverage for up to three times more cutting power than single-pivot tools . We have other tools just like this one from other brands and after trying these out , our others are collecting dust . There is a huge difference when using Fiskars . I never realized it until trying these . They are just more powerful , lighter and comfortable to use , and get the job done with ease . They are totally worth their value .	1
These are super-loppers , and for the money they should be . However , getting what you pay for has its advantages , and they are all in this set of shears . The cork handles are great , the aluminum arms are light , and the blade is fantastic . Having too much experience using loppers in the past , I just wish these had been available as the tool of choice . Even build flattish is an advantage when storing on a hook or shelf . The minimal weight means one can keep lopping when cheaper , heavier tools would have called for a break . The 32-inch reach is that extra bonus .	1
fiskars is my first choicemade in finland ... quality since 1649 ! i take this lopper around to my neighbors and let them put hands on the lopper and use it . we actually go around the property cutting branches together so i can show it off to them . it cuts up to 2 inch branches . i feel that this lopper is the top of the line . i always tell them FISKARS and AMAZON . those are the two most important words to remember . this is the ultimate lopper to me and i will keep itpolished and inside my shed proudly . i have plenty of branches ( many branches with stickers on them ) that need trimmed and cut off each season when the weather cools down and i will use this lopper . i do n't mind showing this quality lopper to my neighbors either . everyone else likes it too .	1
Effortlessly cuts - a truly superior tool . I own , or have owned a number of branch loppers because my yard is filled with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Elm tree runners . The runners grow so fast that it seems like within a few weeks the trunks are an inch in diameter . Let a couple of months pass by and a lopper like this is a necessity.The first lopper I bought over ten years ago was a Fiskars brand . It is smaller model , and I needed something larger because of the seemingly endless job of cutting off large runners , and the desire to clip them off as close to the ground as possible - something difficult to accomplish with a saw . I purchased that bigger lopper in a big box do-it-yourself store . I was unfamiliar with the brand . That should have been a red flag because the tool was so difficult to operate , required great strength to close the blades , cutting was quickly exhausting . Being that tough to use rendered it essentially worthless , so I donated it to charity.After that disappointing purchase I returned to the brand that had worked so well for me in the past , so three years ago bought a twenty-six inch ultra-blade Fiskars lopper with the same power head design as the model used for this review . I always associated quality with this brand , and although I was happy with the surprisingly inexpensive price tag , after briefly working with the twenty-six inch lopper , it was clear that along with the dropping price , the quality had also noticeably declined . While a great improvement over the lopper that did n't work at all , it was n't nearly as smooth to operate and did n't seem to stay sharp as long as my older Fiskars.So , I viewed this latest lopper with some suspicion but when it arrived it was obvious that it was of better quality than my last Fiskars model . I compared them side-by-side and although the mechanism is similar , the quality of the materials and workmanship is different . On this model the steel is more refined , less coarse , the edges on the head are finely finished , the bolts are of higher quality , the handle much more comfortable to grip , and it operates smoothly and so far the blades have n't dulled as quickly.My last Fiskars lopper , model which cost just under $ 30 , was made in China , and this much more expensive version is made in Finland . It appears the old quality has returned . And although there is a market for both products , the reality is that finding inexpensive , lower quality items of all sorts is n't difficult , but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find quality made items . This is welcome news because it is always good to have options . And , if interested , read a discussion about quality differences in production locations in the Fiskars scissors reviews on this site after all production for that product line was moved out of Finland.I 've been working with the lopper for the last few weeks , and since I ignored the Elm tree runners for far too long , there was much to cut . It was a big job , but this new model cut through everything smoothly and effortlessly . As far as quality , it puts my last Fiskars lopper to shame . I do n't like wasting money , and if this was a tool I just used occasionally perhaps the quality difference would n't be so noticeable , and the price difference hard to justify . But with tools that get a work-out , I find it is best not to scrimp .	1
Fiskars tools are my favorite and preferred garden tools , and with this line , they have gotten even better . These loppers are very light for their size , something you will appreciate when you are going up and down a ladder . They have the gear-style mechanism that gives them greater leverage than most loppers . The steel blades have a rust resistant coating that also prevents them from gumming up when cutting sticky , sappy plants . These cut thru green wood and dead wood up to 2 inches without straining , they cut smoothly and left a clean cut behind . The cork handles also provided an excellent grip , which is also important when up on that ladder.Over all , these are the best pair of loppers I have ever owned and depending on how long they last , I may not need another pair .	1
The first thing I did when I got the Quantum Hand Lopper was go outside and trim and cut my trees . This is my first manual lopper . I have an electric lopper . I also have some hand pruners and tree pruners.This hand lopper works very well for areas lower to the ground . It 's lightweight , easy to carry . It cuts with ease . I cut branches up to 1 inch or so in diameter . I cut a skinny tree down that has been dead forever , and I cut the stick that it was tied to . I could feel the extra power from the gear action , and I never have problems with the lopper sticking.The Quantum lopper comes with a plastic cover for the head . I 'm not sure if it was meant to be tossed , but I use it to keep it closed and protect the children from accidentally being cut by the blade . It 's a hard case and is a plus in my book.I like this hand lopper . It 's attractive and works so well . I 'm relegating the electric lopper to the larger branches and using this hand lopper for my small jobs . What a great tool .	1
The Fiskars Quantum Hand Lopper is a gorgeous , quality tool . It makes me want to go out and just start randomly cutting branches so that I can use it . I 've used lots of Fiskars tools and always been happy with them and this one is no exception . It easily cuts through 1-2 '' branches ( 2 '' is pretty big by the way , I usually bring the saw out for that size ) because the length of the handles and the gearing gives you lots of leverage . I have n't had them long enough to figure out how long they 'll last but that lifetime warranty is there as a backup . One thing I honestly ca n't figure out is if they 're really worth the $ 100 premium on the cheap PowerGear Lopper I already have . The steel might be different but only time will tell if that 'll have an impact . That 's really the only reason I ca n't give these 5 stars : the cost .	1
I have been using Fiskars tools for years and have always been satisfied with them . These loppers are no exception . They are fantastic and easy to use . They are easily adept at cutting limbs up to 2 '' thick . I first used these on an overgrown rose bush and had it pruned in no time . I 've also used it on tree branches . The only problem I 've encountered is that they are sometimes impossible to maneuver in tight spaces . They simply will not open enough to grasp a branch if there is another limb in your way . Otherwise , the quality of the loppers is excellent ( they are made in Finland ) . The open and close very smoothly and slice through wood like butter . They are lightweight but remarkably strong.I must add that I have a lower priced pair ofFiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopperthat are also exceptional . I have other Fiskars products as well ( including my all-time favoriteFiskars 7079 Big Grip Garden Knifethat I could not live without !	1
This hand lopper came to me along with theFiskars 9843 Quantum Hand Pruner , and the two products share the same attributes , especially when compared to the standard versions of those products made by Fiskars.I confess that I am a big fan of Fiskars hand tools . TheirFiskars 7936 PowerGear Prunerhas served me well for several years , and last year , I picked up theFiskars 9668 Long Handle Digging ShovelandFiskars 9654 Transplanting Spadeabout a year ago , and they have proven to be indestructible.I also have theFiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper , which is the plain-looking sibling to this Quantum Hand Lopper . Having both , it 's easy to make comparisons between the two and to provide some insight as to whether the large difference in price is worthwhile for you.As with its hand-pruner cousin , this cork-handled silver lopper is a beauty to look at . Unfortunately , that seems to be the only differentiating factors when it comes to using it . The description says that it 's made from `` premium European steel , '' but I 'm not sure how much of a benefit that really is . While using it for a couple of hours clearing fallen branches from a wooded path , it worked the same as the black-handled lopper I 've had for a few years ( which is a testament to that model 's durability ) .The cork handles have the potential of being easier on the hands , but they also have the potential of flaking off from use/damage . I wear work gloves when doing landscape work , so I prefer the rubberized handles of the 9154 . The cheaper model also has more bright orange ( the entire handles ) , which means that it is easier to find in the brush.The 9482 also shares the one limitation that I would like to see changed on the 9154 . Recently , I managed to pinch my thumb pretty badly while trying to use it in close quarters . Some sort of guard or ring near the top of the handles to help you be aware of your hand placement might have prevented me from my act of stupidity . Is that a fault of the loppers ? Not at all , but it is something that would improve already-fine products.As a result , I judge both models to be equivalent in all the ways that really matter . At almost 3x the list price of the 9154 , it 's hard to justify why someone would want to purchase this model . If the silver color and the cork handles appeal to you and you are willing/able to pay the price , by all means , go for it ! You 'll get a great hand tool that will probably last a very long time . Its lifetime warranty will be there if it does break or wear out , so you 're covered either way !	1
Last evening Mrs. Spudman asked me to loosen a bolt on her new sewing machine . I could n't budge it using the tiny screwdriver included with the machine . Using my long-handled screwdriver , I turned the bolt easily . Therein lies part of the secret of the special performance of the Fiskars PowerGear lopper - its long handle . I may have earned a D in physics back in the day , but I know what works - like this pair of loppers and my long handles Fiskars ax . Both are marvelous.The head of the Fiskars lopper is encased in a clear plastic cover that I removed using the pictogram instructions . These pictograms are often used in Fiskars products to convey directions . The hard plastic cover may be kept on the loppers during storage , but judging from my past history , I 'm likely to lose it.Owning four pairs of loppers presently , including a smaller pair of Fiskars , and having owned countless pairs previously , I 'm not new to loppers and the lavish promises made by promoters . My former favorite Corona loppers are supposed to have 3x power ; they perform well though I 've never been convinced of their super power.These long-handled Fiskars are the real deal . I used these loppers for several hours to test them out , cutting live and dead branches both . With each cut I was amazed and awed . No other lopper I 've ever used comes close to the smoothness and power of these loppers . They are comfortable to use and do n't require the back straining effort of other loppers , even on those 2 inch plus cuts . Even cutting branches above my head that required full arm extension was a breeze . I never would have considered paying this much for a pair of loppers , but having used the Fiskars 9482 32-Inch Quantum Hand Lopper , Id have to say they are worth every penny.The power gear mechanism of these loppers works smoothly , unlike the clumsy ratcheting systems I 've experienced with other loppers . This patented gearing mechanism `` makes cutting effortless . '' Yes , it really does.The blade has a polymer coating for corrosion resistance , the cork handle is light and supportive , and the aluminum alloy used in the loppers ' construction is strong yet light . A full lifetime warranty backing the product is a nice bonus.If you go to the Fiskars site , there 's precious little about how to maintain these loppers or buying a replacement blade in the future . It 's best to clean the blade with rubbing alcohol after each use to maintain the lopper blade and prevent spreading disease . There are many You Tube videos that address sharpening and oiling your lopper to keep it in good condition .	1
A while ago , I purchased aFiskars 9625 PowerGear Bypass Lopper , 18-inch , which can cut branches up to 1.5 inches with relative ease . Cutting thick branches with those loppers feels more like slicing through wet sugar cane or 1/2 inch thick branches than through 1.5 inches of solid wood . With those loppers , I was able to handle all but the thickest branches that I need to cut during a regular pruning . Thus I was looking forward to its larger cousin , the 9482 32-inch lopper.As much as I like its smaller cousin , this larger one is noticeably different in many ways . Although it 's designed for branches that are only 1/2 inch larger in diameter , this pair of loppers is significantly larger and robust . It has much longer and better cushioned handles , and a larger jaw with precise blade alignment . It makes easy work out of everything the smaller pair did , and much more.The first thing I tried with it was to cut through an old branch from my last pruning session . It was too big for the smaller loppers and needed to be cut with a saw . Cutting through an old dead piece of wood like that is akin to cutting through a two inch wooden pole rather than through a live branch . At first I thought that there was no chance of getting the loppers to budge . But with enough force , I was able to cut completely through it with enough control that my son was able to hold the branch loosely as I did so . That 's more of a task than I 'd expect these to be put through in normal use , and I 'm not in the best shape of my life.For regular branches , even those as thick as the jaws will allow , the amount of force needed is surprisingly low . The manufacturer claims that these give up to three times the cutting force of single pivot tools . In reality , they give three times the power of large , top quality single pivot tools with high quality blades . The `` three times '' statement is not a subjective claim , but an accurate one based on the laws of physics . Since work equals force times displacement , by designing the handles to move three times as far for the same amount of jaw movement as traditional loppers , you do the same amount of work with one third the force.There are only two down sides that I can think of for this product . One is that a lot more room is needed to open these up , so there 's a potential for them to be unusable in tight spaces . I did n't encounter any real life situations where that happened , and since you are more likely to use these with trees than with tight shrubbery , that might not be a realistic concern.The other is price . I think these are well worth the money for something of this quality and size . But if your primary use is for branches that are 1.5 inches or less , with occasional two inch branches , it might make sense to get the smaller Fiskars and use a saw for those rare occasions . But if you want something that cuts through those 1.5 inch branches like a knife through butter , you might still want these larger ones . A good strategy might be to get the smaller ones as a second cheaper pair for lighter work . Or you could buy the smaller ones first and then decide if you need the larger ones . But if you are looking specifically for something that cuts branches within this item 's range , I would not hesitate to recommend it .	1
I 've been a more of a fan of anvil-type hand pruners rather than the scissors ( bypass ) type . But these hand pruners have me rethinking that.The problem with scissors/bypass pruners is that the blades tend to move apart over time , and eventually you find you 're pinching and folding over woody stems instead of cutting cleanly.I 'm confident that wo n't happen with these shears . They are precision made . You can tell right out of the package that they are top quality . Everything is manufactured to close tolerances , and the materials are high grade . There 's no `` slop '' or wiggle in them , just smooth action . I doubt seriously anything is going to get out of alignment , unless someone tries to cut barbed wire with them or something.A few test cuts prove that these are indeed sharp and well aligned shears -- no folding or pinching , just clean , smooth cuts.As for the cork handles , I have a friend who does n't like to touch unfinished wood . So I asked her to try these out to see how they worked for her . She said they feel more like a rubberized grip than cork , so they are very comfortable for her.Five stars for these pruners . They 'll be a favorite of most every gardener and grower .	1
I own several Fiskars tools and have been quite happy with all of them over the years . I happen to own three other older Fiskars pruners and they are still in use . One of them is almost as old as I am and that my friends is old.This new pruner lives up to the quality and usability of it predecessors . These are used , for the most part , in our rose gardens . The cut they make is sharp and clean and we can angle the cuts anyway we like . The blades on this pruner are extremely sharp ( The cutting one ) and are far superior , in my opinion , the anvil type pruner.The cork handles makes for a very comfortable fit and the locking mechanism is far superior to many other brands we have used over the years.With proper maintenance these should last for years . They should be wiped clean after every use ( When doing rose bushes my wife continually cleans the blades with a cleanser to avoid spreading any disease that might be present ... .a bit paranoid I am thinking but hey , I am not going to be the one to tell her that.Overall we are quite happy with these new pruners and have already put them through quite a workout.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
The first thing I noticed about these pruners are the cork handles . The all-natural cork is supposed to be soft and shock-absorbing . I 've never considered cork particularly soft , but I will say that it gives the handles a very non-slip feel . I 'm concerned that the cork will wear poorly with heavy use , but I 'll add an update if I find that to be true.Overall , the pruners appear to be a very high quality . Everything except the locking mechanism ( and the cork ) is metal . The lock to hold the blades closed is easy to slide into place but not so loose that it might release unexpectedly . The blades are of steel and the top blade has a coating to resist corrosion . The coating does n't look like it will wear off quickly , either.However , the pruner is a bit large for my hand . I 'm an average-sized woman with long-fingered hands , but it 's awkward for me to hold these pruners fully open . It was the same for my dad , who is a tall man . I placed these pruners on top of two of my other pruners , and the handles on this one open about 1/2 an inch wider than the others yet they have the same width opening between the blades when fully open . When I hold these pruners comfortably in my hand , I can only cut about 1/2 '' or less width branches . From past experiences , I expect anything larger will quickly tire my hand muscles.I tried the pruners out on some 1/4 '' apple branches today , and they easily cut through the branches . I 'll probably just use these pruners for my smaller-width pruning projects . One nice thing about these pruners is that they can be used left- or right-handed.UPDATE : I 've been giving these pruners moderate use in our garden for about 8 months now . The cork handle does n't appear to be having any wear problems , so I 'm no longer concerned about that . I 've been using them mainly to harvest beans , bell peppers , tomatoes , and similar vegetables . For this type of resistance and thickness , they work well -- very sharp and do n't tire my hands within the short use period .	1
I love Fiskars scissors and gardening tools . They are quality made items that give years and years of service when treated with respect.The pruner is well balanced and light weight . The cork coating on the handles makes the pruner comfortable to use as the cork provides a bit of cushion when you are pruning a particularly thick stalk . The blades are sharp and precise . You can adjust the tension on the blades to get the tool to its maximum usage.The tool also comes with a blade guard which is very useful if you like to walk around the yard with them in your pocket . No more torn pockets.I love the Fiskars brand . They have never let me down and the life-time warrenty which is a wonderful perk to them -- means they never will .	1
As an avid gardener one of my most used tools is a hand pruner . I have had over a dozen over the years originally starting with the low end in terms of price and working my way up to the top of the line . Despite that I have never been entirely satisfied , but this Fiskars pruner may change that . I love the heft of the tool and the quality of the blades . So far it has cut great ( which all pruners do initially ) and kept its sharpness . It is easy to clean after use and care for . It is definitely the first tool I reach for when I head outdoors .	1
This is the best pair of pruners I have ever used . They are light weight due to their Aluminum construction and cut easily . They also have a blade coating that makes them rust resistant and prevents them from gumming up . I used them on my big sunflowers and they never gummed up or even slowed down . On branches , green wood or dead wood , it did n't matter , they cut right thru both easily . The cork handles provided a nice secure grip , but my one minor complaint would be to add the carabiner handle you see on other Fiskars pruners . It is very convenient to be able clip them to your belt loop for a moment so you can use both hands.In summary , they are pricey , but as a Fiskars product , they are worth every penny .	1
Fiskars has made excellent gardening tools for many years . These pruning shears are well designed , perfectly weighted , and fantastic gardening tools.We Alaskans have a very long growing season- ( midnight sun ) and as our plants grow very well , they produce a lot of flowers . Dead-heading and pruning is clearly beneficial for any garden , perhaps more so in the Land of Exuberant Summertime Growth.Make rapid progress tirelessly at one of your gardens necessary and critical chores.Your hands do n't tire as readily . Use less force to efficiently get the work done.These shears are a delight . Worth every penny as they make your chores easier .	1
I have another Fiskars pruner and this is just as well made . It should last for a long while with some care ( do clean , dry , and oil the blades after each use especially if you wo n't reuse for a while ) . I 'm only concerned about the cork handles . I 'm afraid that they 'll get soggy and dirty if using them in moist conditions or might even crack and break but only time will tell . My other Fiskars pruner has plastic-covered handles and just feels more durable .	1
These broke ( snapped in half ) the first time that I used them . The product comes with a full lifetime warranty so I called up the company and they sent out a replacement . I had filled out the form online , but I found quicker response by calling customer service and they were very helpful.We tested the replacement out all weekend on projects around the yard and they worked great and were comfortable to use.We have a lot of Fiskars products around the house that we 've had for years and they are still working as good as the day we got them , so I was surprised the first pair broke on us . Must have been defective .	1
Very well made . Very Sharp and will cut a limb up to about an inch . Not overly heavy , comfortable cork grip helps you to not get blisters when used a lot . Blade guard is useful when not in use . Lifetime warranty with your receipt . These should last for many years .	1
The last pair of Fiskars pruners I had broke the first time I used it . Of course they only cost half as much as this model , but Fiskars is supposed to represent quality in the gardening world . This pair works much more smoothly and are very comfortable in the hand . A lifetime warranty helps alleviate the high cost.Two niggling problems which cost one star . It would help if the unit had more orange , yellow or lime green coloring on it to make it easier to see when it 's dropped in the brush . The other concern is that the blade lock engages often when you do n't expect it too . I had the same problem with the last unit that broke . But all-in-all , this is a far superior unit -- maybe the best hand pruner I have ever used .	1
Fiskars tools are outstanding . I have other Fiskars tools and they really are quality garden tools . This pruner is top of the line . It 's light , because the handle is aluminum alloy and natural cork , which makes the grip very comfortable . The blade is very sharp , made from tempered steel and coated to reduce friction . You can adjust the blade tension as needed and it also had a nice blade guard.I 've used it to cut everything from small limbs on a pine tree to veggies in my garden to taking down some wheat that 's growing in my orchard that I feed my chickens . It worked perfectly in all applications . I use the blade guard when I carry the pruners in my shorts pocket as the blade is sharp . They also have a lifetime warranty . This was not my first Fiskars tool and wo n't be my last . Highly recommended .	1
I have used many a pruner in my years gardening and ca n't say I would recommend any of them.These pruners work really well , sharp , cork handles are comfortbable.I kept the plastic cover that they came in to protect them when not in use . They are easy to open . Appear to be well built .I used them on my roses , small crepe myrtle branches and shoots and small branches on my bradford pear trees . Nice clean cuts , did not have to cut a second time , At $ 79 I would expect them to last a long time ( with the proper care/maintenance ) . If you are a serious gardener and /or take care of the treees/plants/shrubs etc . in your yard I would recommend spending the extra $ and getting these pruners .	1
As a little background , we live in the country , we have an acre of land , we garden and my husband works with the local land trust clearing trails . We have a lot of experience with garden tools and have learned to look for the Fiskars brand when we shop for tools . This Quantum Hand Pruner is lightweight , preforms smoothly and should last pretty much for the rest of our lives . It comes with a plastic blade cover , which is a nice touch , but we keep it in a leather sheath so we did n't use it .	1
This is actually one of the nicest pruners I have ever owned , and I know pruners pretty well . I grow a lot of roses , and have had as many as 85 bushes at once . In addition , the rest of my garden is a jungle , gradually encroaching on every open area . Our time here may be limited , but I have hope that these will turn the tide . The blade is sharp , and the lock that holds them closed works well . The best feature may be the cork covered handles , which are very comfortable and easy to grip . They are reasonably light , and feel like they will last . These are keepers !	1
I like the miracle -gro Liquafeed . Very easy to use and comes in a handy pack . There is no mess as it connects directly to the hose . It can also be used for house plants . Plants definitely do better with miracle gro .	1
The Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food Advanced Starter Kit contains one ( 1 ) garden feeder , one ( 1 ) sixteen ( 16 ) fluid ounce bottle of LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food , and one ( 1 ) dosing spoon ( for dispensing the food from a watering can ) . The LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food is appropriate for use on plants which are in-ground and those which are planted in containers . The sprayer/garden feeder is handy for application over larger areas . I use a watering can with a measured quantity of food when applying in smaller areas or to plants in containers . Recommend .	1
So I regularly use Miracle-Gro on my plants . In my opinion there is nothing like the product because it does not burn the plant like dry inorganic fertilizer . In my case I use the dry Miracle-Gro and mix a pouch in a very large 50 gallon container . I then can dispense an equal portion of the mix to each plant knowing that each is getting the same formula . Now with the Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed - it is attached to a hose and is suppose to mix equal portions of liquid and water . If this is true then fine , however I have found that when you get to near the end of the liquid supply that you do n't know if the last to receive the mix are getting an equal portion . I always had this problem in the past with the dry mix gadgets that Miracle-Gro had in the past , and that 's why I went with mixing in a container first and watering with my watering can . Well if one wanted to use the LiquaFeed gadget and dry ( mixed with water ) then I suppose this would work , but then you run into the problem of the last run mix as I described.Now for the minus one star - the cost . I used Amazon Prime figures and Miracle-Gro 's per square feet dispensing numbers . Miracle-gro 10 lb powder on Amazon prime costs about $ 19.50 and covers 500 x 8 packs or 4000 square feet . This equates to $ .004875 per square foot . The Miracle-grow 4 pack Liquafeed refill costs around $ 11.50 on Amazon Prime and covers 400 x 4 bottles or 1600 square feet . This equates to $ .0071875 per square foot . So the Liquafeed on Amazon costs approximately 1.5 times more . If you do a lot of fertilizing this could get very expensive very fast . So the bottom line is that I will stick to the powder and if I use the LiquaFeed gadget then I will mix my own liquid using the dry Miracle-Gro .	1
wow ! ! ! I must say that I noticed drastic change in my plantsI would highly recommend now my plants are greenerand they look more healthier my only concern is thatrefills are kind of costly but hey its worth it ! ! ! !	1
This is an easy way to get a decent fertilizer on flowers and vegetables . I 've been using this for a few years and it is a quality sprayer with a variety of settings . You get the extra flexibility of a fertilizer that mixes in the correct amount to add to the water stream . Pretty effective and super easy . Recommended .	1
I must confess , I 'm a murderer of plants . Or plantslaughter because its not really on purpose but ... I tend to kill my plants especially in my pots because I forget to keep them fertilized . Containers require more attention to things like that . This kit has saved many a plants life . With the handy dandy nozzle which holds the handy dandy food , it makes watering and feeding my plants easy peasy . They are much happier now ! The kit includes fertilizer and a measuring spoon if you want to use a watering can . Of course this requires getting more fertilizer when this is gone , but compared to the cost of killing plants , that 's a slamdunk ;	1
I have always used Miracle Gro for feeding and planting all of my plants ( shrubs , flowers , trees ... ) , and have never had an issue . In the past I have used the granules that you disolve in the watering can and just pour onto the flowers/trees . This is much easier ! With this you just put the handle part on your hose and insert the bottom . The bottle just goes in the back of the dispenser and you can just water ( different spray options ) the flowers or trees with it on the feed setting . If you need just water you can easily switch to just plain water without having to remove the sprayer , which makes it super easy to quickly spray down dirty areas of the patio without wasting food ( or having to spend a few minutes unscrewing the dispenser each time ) . The unit also comes with a spoon to allow you to measure for putting it in a watering can if you would rather use it instead.in the end this is a great dispenser for the plant food and easy to use ! The bottle seems to go a pretty good ways before getting empty , and the refill kits are not that expensive ( but do cost more than the granules ) . My plants and trees all look amazing ( still pretty early in the year ) , but I always use Miracle Gro products and have never had an issue ! Highly recommend for ease ! ! !	1
My sweet wife is a potted plant junkie . Our patio has flowers , veggies and pots just waiting for a new plant . She has used mostly granulated plant food over the years , for overhanging plants like ferns it really can be a pain . This is our first experience with a liquid feeder , The Miracle-Gro feeder is a real time saver ! Just watering the plants takes quite a bit of time , when you consider that you can do the fertilizing at the same time ... ..well , that just makes this a winner.A hand held sprinkler head for the hose can be quite pricy on its own , the one that comes with this is quite substantial and well made . It can be used without the plant food bottle attached , for everyday watering with about the same watering patterns that come with one of the rotating type nozzles , and that in itself makes this a real value.Everything comes in a wall mountable holder for storage , hung ours in our garden shed , so it 's easy to keep everything together . Miracle-Gro has been on the market a long time and we have been faithful users . They have done a wonderful job putting this kit together . Consideration has been given for feeding with a watering can , using the sprinkler head , feeding and storage . What more could you want ? -- -- -- besides beautiful plants ! Would I recommend this product ? -- -yep ! Would I purchase again ? -- -you bet !	1
This is my third Miracle-Gro starter kit . I 've been using this product for so long I ca n't count the years . When this one arrived , I compared it to the older two spray nozzles ( which still work after a LOT of use ) : This is the same as what I bought last year -- not a single difference that I can see . Does the fertilizer do its job ? Oh , my , yes ! And I surely would n't be a long-time user and supporter of this Miracle-Gro fertilizer if it did n't give me great results.Plus , it is so easy to use and convenient ! I use the general purpose for all the flowers , green plants and herbs . Then I switch out the all-purpose bottle with the bottle developed specifically for vegetables for the veggie gardens . For my very delicate maidenhair ferns and my non-flowering orchids , I screw the spoon attachment onto the ( all-purpose ) bottle instead of the nozzle and I use a weaker solution in a watering can . ( You squirt fertilizer from the bottle into the attached spoon ( it has measurement lines ) , tip the spoonful into your watering can and go again . ) Now , if you have a many-years-old model , there are differences ; or if you 've never used this product before , here 's the scoop : There are four spray configurations from which to choose ; the turn knob at the top ( for plain water / off / water-fertilizer mix ) is easier to get a grip on and easier to turn ; the handle is ergonomically correct , with on / off button easy to manipulate . The bottle of liquid fertilizer ( comes with one bottle ) screws into the yellow end , so the nozzle as a whole looks a bit odd , but it is trying to do a balancing act with the bottle of fertilizer.Regarding the four spray choices : The `` shower '' gives a good , general coverage -- not too wide , not too heavy/harsh . The `` flat '' works very well for me when it is very windy , or when I have plants close together in a line . The `` stream '' is the configuration with all the tiny holes in the round ; it also works for me when it is windy , or when I want to reach plants further away , as it is a more forceful spray . The other one is `` jet '' , and I do n't use that much at all , because it really disturbs the soil around the base of the plant and is forceful enough to make a mess of flower petals . But I suppose the jet spray is good for shooting into a container.If you 've not used this product before , you should check on the price of replacement feeder bottles to see if it is in line with your budget : You do pay for convenience ! If you 've got a good-sized garden , you will go through many bottles of this fertilizer if you fertilize as often as the directions recommend . I fertilize about once every two weeks . So , once every two weeks , I switch out the nozzle heads on my hose and use this , then I water and fertilize at the same time . Whalla ! And done ! ( I have tried to use this nozzle as my everyday nozzle , ( because you can turn the knob on top to water only ) but I think it is a bit too heavy and cumbersome for constant use . ) One tip : After fertilizing , switch the knob to water only and spray for a short minute to clear the insides of fertilizer solution , in an effort to prevent corrosion . Happy gardening ! This kit comes in a plastic `` stand '' , with a hole for one bottle , the spoon and the nozzle . I think it is a waste of plastic , and I do n't think it adds value to the product .	1
I 'm already a fan of Miracle-Gro . I have yet to use a plant food of theirs that did n't work . This Miracle-Gro kit is a pretty handy delivery system for metered delivery of the all purpose food through the included hose sprayer attachment . The included plant food is good for flowers vegetables and other plants , and the bottle screws right into the sprayer unit , which also screws onto the end of your hose , so as you water your plants , you can feed them at the same time . This is great for gardens/beds larger than watering can size . For watering can size beds/pots or indoor plants , there is also a measuring spoon included for accurate measuring of the plant food into your can of water . The sprayer has adjustable spray patterns on the front of the nozzle and a dial on the top for regulating flow . Miracle-Gro also makes plant-specific liquid food bottles that fit this unit , so if you are watering/feeding all vegetables or all flowers , you can get that specific food , once this starter bottle is gone . I 've used products like this before , but it is nice to get a sprayer that has trigger control , flow control and multiple spray patterns . Not all plants get watered the same way .	1
Great packaging for the Miracle-Gro LiquafFeed plant food . It was very easy to set up and connect to hose . Now that it is warming up in Oregon , I used it yesterday on everything in the front yard . I 'll report back as soon as I notice things getting a little greener . The inclusion of the nozzle was a nice addition as well . It has multiple outputs so you can choose how hard or easy you wish to deliver the plant food . I would recommend based on the ease of application and you can buy refills for reuse .	1
I love to use Miracle-Gro , it really does feed my plants . I 'm so excited I just got 2 tomato plants and my blueberries are starting to flower , now all I have to do is add the Miracle-Gro and watch them bloom - OH and enjoy the fruit ! Jesus ' Blessings and Peace	1
For the best review , I probably should have used this on only half my garden for a more scientific comparison , but it just did n't seem right to rob some of the plants of the nutrients ! With the odd weather we 're having in Southern California , plants are growing fast . My flowers do seem healthier , though , and I 've given them about two doses of food with two weeks in between.I really like the functionality of the feeder . The pistol-grip is comfortable , easy to lock , easy to unlock , and the angle is good . It 's no problem to see the level of the plant food in the bottle and easy to insert and remove the bottle . Little bubbles confirm that the plant food is flowing . There are several different spray types . Even without the plant food bottle attached , the sprayer is a keeper.I 'll continue to use this throughout the growing season and will update when possible .	1
i enjoy using my miracle gro feeder on all of my vegetable garden plants . i can give special treatment to my plants as needed . its fun to use and it works great . the results are great . i am very happy with this product . its a time saver . thank you .	1
The Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food Advanced Starter Kit is a quick and easy way to fertilize your plants . While a measuring spoon is included , if you use the sprayer there is no need for measuring . Attach the bottle to the sprayer and attach the hose to the bottom of the spray nozzle . Done , you are ready to start.The spray nozzle includes several settings from spraying to a more direct flow ( great for soaking the bottom of plants and soil ) . The nozzle is fairly well built . It 's plastic , but appears to be tough . Overall , it does n't get any easier . This kit offers you a way to feed with no fuss and no mess .	1
I have a bottle of MiracleGro that I 've purchased years ago and never use it because I just did n't want to be bothered with measuring and little cups , etc etc etc . This is perfect ! Just attach and that 's it . I ca n't vouch for my plants being bigger and more bountiful . But the growing season just started so if I notice a change , I 'll certainly come back to update !	1
Miracle-Gro has been a staple in my garden and yard for years . This Advanced Starter kit combines three Miracle-Gro products into one -- the hose adapter nozzle , the liquid feed nozzle , and the manual scoop for when you want to do it the old fashioned way with a watering can . The watering nozzle works wonderful - no leaks , no fuss , just ease of use . It uses the special miracle grow cannisters ( one included ) to deliver just the right amount of product . You can get refills just about everywhere . If you want to get creative , you can even refill it yourself using regular miracle-gro and a little bit of water.This would make a great gift for a gardening friend !	1
I like that it attaches to a hose and you can also just use the liquid to mix with a watering can , if necessary . Although , honestly if you are just looking to do a watering can mix only , you should probably just buy the food and not waste your money on this system as it is most useful to attach to a watering hose . I really like that it has different settings on the sprayer ( just like a regular sprayer on your garden hose ) and you can even choose the watering only and it will not include the liquid feed bottle that you have attached . I think it 's a great system for feeding that allows you a lot of options and I would recommend it .	1
Easy to hook up and use . My flowers seem to be budding very well this season . Dosing spoon for the watering can works well . I like that it 's a general all-purpose feed that comes with the kit . Price is very reasonable .	1
Miracle-Gro , brand name trusted by many for years ! I lost the old nozzle years ago and just could never find one until this one came along I got all excited again ! YES ! Nearly identical to the one I had , it feeds your plants accordingly and never too much and never too little ; always the right amount ; plus the spray nozzle that attached to any garden hose with the dial to water and feed or water only makes gardening life easier !	1
Very easy to use and it does the job . It comes with 4 batteries you can use , along with the connectors needed for several popular electronic items . I am definitely going to use this on my next camping trip . It 's also great to have in the car if you 're on a road trip and might run into an emergency or bad weather .	1
The little battery pack did pretty good at giving my cell phone a quick charge to about half power . Enough to make a few calls and last till I could get back home to charge it . The solar panels are a bit slow even on a clear day . They would work ok for when you are out camping and you want to recharge your MP3 player or tablet . If it had another pair of panels to fold out and double the solar collection of power it would really help this a lot . To give it a good test I put a set of 4 rechargeable AA batteries that were dead in it and hung the solar panels in a south facing window . It took a good 2 days to get a usable charge in them and almost 3 full days to get close to a full charge . Now if it was laying out flat on something and got full on sunshine on it I 'm sure it would have done a lot better . The best use I can see for this is to take it with you when you go camping or back packing for when you have the time to wait and good cloud free sky and plenty of sunshine along with a couple extra sets of rechargeable batteries to have one set recharge with it while using another set in your radio or MP3 player or what ever.Overall its bit too expensive and too slow to actually be practical for use around the home when you can plug a charger in the wall that 's a lot quicker and easier to use . But , for those that live on the Gulf Coast or East Coast and often get hit with storms that can take out the power for several days to weeks at a time then this , or something like this , might be something to consider putting in your emergency supplies . For me , it 's going in my camping equipment for when I go to the mountains and camp to fish or hunt for a week or two at a time .	1
Note : I received this kit in addition to a second standalone Nomad 7 solar panel , allowing me to daisy-chain them together , effectively doubling the power capacity . My review is mostly based on the use of the this kit WITH the 2nd panel added to it , although I will try to touch on it 's function as a standalone kit as well.This is the coolest thing I 've added to my backpacking gear list in a long time.Pros : -Comes with a battery charger and 4 NiMH AA batteries , as well as an adapter for AAA 's ( but it does not come with AAA batteries ) .-The battery charger has a USB output , so you can use the AA 's to charge your USB-chargeable devices . from it . Goal Zero also recommends that you use the battery pack as a & # 34 ; buffer & # 34 ; between the solar panel ( s ) and your device , to allow your device to receive a consistant charge.-2 panels daisy-chained together provided more than enough power to charge my Samsung Note 3 , even without using the battery pack for a & # 34 ; buffer & # 34 ; . Each panel can be expected to provide about 1 amp at 5v under average sunlight , so 2 panels ( 2 amps ) can charge in iPad at the same rate as a standard wall-charger.-Folds up flat , very easy to pack in a backpack . Stays closed using built-in rare earth magnets.-Very well constructed , and looks nice . You can tell the engineers thought of everything ! -Each panel includes parachute cord loops on the sides , so you can use carabiners or string to hang it from something , or hang them from each other if you have more than 1.Cons : -It weighs a lot , and is probably not an effective replacement for disposable batteries during short journeys . On my home scale , the panel by itself weighs 17oz without the detachable cables , and the battery charger weighs 2.75oz with the AAA adapter . Add to that to the weight of a second panel , 4 AA 's and 4 AAA 's , and suddenly your power system now weighs around 3lbs . For a long journey , it is absolutely worth the weight to me , but for a weekend outing , I think I 'll stick with just carrying some spare batteries.-The pigtail cable that allows you to daisy-chain multiple panels together is too short in my opinion , and it is permanently installed in the solar panel so it ca n't be replaced , but you might be able to make a pigtail extension cable for it.Overall impression : Probably not good for short outings , due to the weight . A few spare batteries would weigh significantly less than this charging kit . However , for long outings , this is one of the coolest electronic devices I 've seen . It will make sure your GPS , phone , camera , etc . will never run out of juice no matter how long you 're gone !	1
this product is great . used it in montana at the property . put it on the hood of the vehicle while i was doing things and it recharged my dumb phone within a hour . would be a good product to have if you travel the back country to charge any portable devise .	1
This is good to we have only used it twice so far and was able to charge our phone and small tablet it will also let you charge various portable devices . The size is OK like a large text book but definitely not as heavy . It worked as advertised . It 's good to have for emergencies or if your going to be out doors for a few days.I gave it 4 stars because I prefer when my portable charging devices have several ways to be charged in-case the sun is not feeling cooperative . So it will not be replacing my Ambient Weather Emergency charger since it has solar/hand crank/battery/AC/DC/USB ect and also functions as radio/flashlight ect.So great to have compact user friendly and pretty efficient just not the best option for our emergency bug out bag . We have various back up power sources and this is one of the better ones ... recommended .	1
Let me detail what this kit consists of for those buyers who understand the numbers . This is a nicely built kit consisting of a lightweight solar panel ( & # 34 ; Nomad 7 & # 34 ; which is a nominal ( in full sun ) 7W panel ) , a battery pack ( & # 34 ; Guide 10 & # 34 ; which is a 4xAA battery holder with 10Ahr of storage capacity when used with the 2500mAh AA NiMH batteries ) , 4 of those NiMH batteries , a USB cable , and an adapter to charge and use AAA batteries in the Guide 10.Okay , so if you charge those batteries up using the solar panel , you have a good emergency source of power for a USB chargeable phone or tablet . Additional parts , such as AAA batteries , and additional panels and interconnects are all available here on amazon . It 's a nice looking system , light in weight , but seems pretty durable ( I 've carried the panel and batteries around in a backpack with no issue ) and well thought through . It 's not inexpensive though ! And I suspect that you will be a lot happier with this if you think through your device battery capacity and the need for hours of full sun for a full recharge .	1
I like this kit , it has some really neat feature . I am dinging it 1 star because it does not include a micro usb cable which is by far the most common for cell phones and tablets now a days . I found it to charge up the included batteries fairly quickly via the solar panels . The battery pack 's built in LED flashlight is not great , but will do in a pinch . Great for those of us that live in a sunny state . Also the panels can be hooked up in parallel if you have more than one .	1
I usually use a charger about the size of my iPhone . This charger is unique for me in a number of ways . First , the panels are light and flexible , which gives this unit a larger surface area for collecting those photons . Next , it is designed to charge 4 AA rechargeable batteries ( included , along with a AAA adapter ) , which gives this unit more flexibility in use . Finally , it comes to a full charge relatively quickly ( about 3 hours ) .I like this charger . It does take up space , however , meaning you are not going to be hauling it around all the time . And a battery charger that can be plugged in a 110 V outlet is not very expensive . You need to make sure this unit really fits your specific needs . If it does , great . It may not if you are better served by a less expensive , smaller model . Think carefully before you buy .	1
I received this product for review from the Amazon Vine program . I own a lot of cool solar gadgets but this Goal Zero solar charger is especially advanced . It is hard to believe how little it weighs . Closed up it looks like a small notebook or pencil case . We have other solar chargers besides Goal Zero and they also work well , but they are hard plastic , bulky , have sharp corners and are not something you could easily throw in a back pack . This charger is light and folds up flat . It comes with four rechargeable AA batteries . AAA batteries will also fit in the charger.The panel size when spread out in the sun has more surface area for the money than similar priced chargers . There are also ports for charging USB or 12 volt devices . This is a great little charger to use for back packing or traveling when you need to watch ounces and space requirements .	1
This Goal Zero 7 Solar panel charger is amazing . I could n't believe it actually works - it looks deceptively flimsy . It is great for emergencies and backpacking -this is a versatile charger . It is also very durable on the outside and light weight . It charged my iphone , my kindle and the 4 included AA batteries . Although it does not come with AAA batteries it does come with a clip/adapter where you can put AAA rechargeable batteries inside . ( I believe that you can buy AAA enelope rechargeable batteries and they will work . ) Since it is fall there was n't much sun so I had to keep readjusting the screen for maximum impact . I also notice the screen got scratches easily and I wonder if this affects charging in the long run . Weather could be a big issue and frustration . It works best in full sunlight when it gets overcast it did n't seem to charge at all for me . Due to the poor sunlight , my batteries still did not fully charge the first day . I did like that the battery charger has its own light which is good for emergencies and that it has a USB port to directly charge other items from it . ( I understand it is actually better to charge items other than the batteries directly from the battery charger and not directly from the system itself because the battery charger regulates the energy flow . If you connect your phone or tablet directly from the system there will be fluctuation in power going to the items depending on the amount of light . ) I really liked this item and was really impressed . The only big thing I did n't like was the bulky outside net which holds the charger and other connecter.Proscan charge multiple itemseasy to useoutside very toughportable , compactmultiple outputs : car adapter , USB and one specifically for battery chargerbattery charger has emergency lightConsdoes not include AAA batteriessolar screen scratches easilytakes a long time to charge if not very sunnymust make sure the panels are angled for best exposuremust makes sure that rechargeable items are covered so they do n't overheatside bag is bulky with netting that could catch on things	1
I 'm in the process of building up an emergency bag , and having some type of battery pack for recharging phones and such is a critical need . I tried out the Goal Zero 41022 Guide 10 Plus Solar Recharging Kit from Amazon Vine , and it fits the emergency niche perfectly.The solar panel can be used to charge the battery pack ( which is then used to charge devices ) , or you can charge the device directly from the solar panel . Living in Oregon makes the charging a bit iffy , but it does work ... eventually . : ) The total stored power in the battery pack is around mid-range when it comes to the various chargers I use . I got a couple of full charges on my iPhone , and it slowed down the power draw on my iPad ( not good for a full recharge there ) .For an ordinary travel bag , I would n't use this as my main power backup . It 's on the slow side for recharging , and the total capacity is limited . But as an emergency bag power supply , it 's hard to beat . If you do n't have power , your backup power units are useless once drained . Granted , you ca n't always rely on the sun to be out to charge the Goal Zero , but at least it 's a possibility . I can see this being the difference between & # 34 ; life and death & # 34 ; in longer-term disasters if it comes to needing to contact outside help.It 's definitely not a cheap option , but in the middle of an emergency , I think it 's well worth the price.Disclosure : Obtained From : Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment : Free	1
This `` fly-through '' bird feeder is highly specialized in that it can only contain sunflower seeds and/or peanuts because the mesh holes are too large for mixes and smaller seeds . The birds that it attracts not only must like those seeds but must be able to cling to the sides since there are no perches . For the first 24 hours , I did n't see a single bird eat from it even though they were emptying nearby feeders . By the second day , some were brave enough to try it : titmice , chickadees , and house finches . Now the birds will occasionally hit this feeder when the others are crowded . Even though they seem to love sunflower seeds , they do n't seem to love the feeder . Well , all but one bird prefers the others . When it 's rainy , one male house finch goes inside the fly-through part to stay dry . Who would 've thunk ? The feeder is relatively easy to fill : you hold in the catch above the roof and slide open the top . The top does n't move completely out of the way , so I have to be careful when filling it . With the open mesh design , a lot of the sunflower seeds fall through as I 'm filling it . I have to scoop up the seeds and funnel them back in with my hands . The feeder holds 2-3 pounds of seed . The construction seems sturdy enough , although I 'm concerned about other reports of bird injuries so I 'm keeping a close eye on it . I ca n't figure out how a bird would injure itself on the feeder since they are used to clinging and poking at things , and I do n't see any exposed sharp edges . Still , that does n't mean it wo n't happen.The best thing about this feeder is that it actually manages to stay full longer than my other feeders because it attracts fewer birds . If you have only one feeder in your yard , do n't make it this one . If you want a feeder to hold black oil sunflower seeds and/or peanuts and if you already have at least one other feeder , give this one a try. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
This feeder is so much fun . The bird actually go in the middle of it and can fly through . It is very sturdy . It is easy to fill from the top and easy to hang . I really like this feeder .	1
We got this bird feeder because we are always looking for something new and different to attract wildlife to our back porch . The design is unlike any of our other bird feeders , and the requirement of filling it with only large seed ( smaller seeds , and even large ones , fall right through ) promised to attract a different sub set of birds than we are used to.Filling is easy , as the top has just one button that frees it to slide along the hanger wire . Pouring in the black oil sunflower seeds was straightforward , but I recommend putting it on a flat solid surface to limit the amount of seed that falls out while filling . ( There & # 8217 ; s going to be a lot of leakage , anyway , so make sure you fill it outside in the vicinity of where it will be hung . ) Once it was up , it was only a matter of a day or so before the birds found it and started using it . Lots of finches , grosbeaks , sparrows and cardinals use both of the fly through holes and the sides of the feeder . Mourning doves tend to hang out on the ground and eat what drops down . Several smaller birds spent many minutes sitting on the inside , eating . The most common behavior seems to be for the birds to sit in one of the holes and eat seeds from the outside of the feeder by sticking their head out . After two days , we noticed the birds came and went in waves based on our activity , however , this feeder attracts a lot of birds and has caused them to largely ignore our multi-seed feeder . The feeder was more than half empty in just three days . Also , I haven & # 8217 ; t seen a single bird get caught or hung up in the feeder like other reviewers have mentioned.Because this feeder is all metal , I expect it will last a good while . It is well designed , and visually interesting . It does dump a lot of seed during the filling process , but most feeders do . Based on the large number of birds it attracts and the overall ease of use , I give it a full five stars .	1
We got this for our backyard so our boys could watch for birds . They really like this feeder . It holds larger feed such as sunflower seeds . Smaller birds can fly through the holes and we have seen a few do this so far . The bird feeder is simple to use and just hangs from the tree by a nail . This is very reasonably priced and works great .	1
This is quite a unique and interesting feeder that adds a new dimension to bird watching.Woodpeckers visit it often , feeding from the sides of the feeder , same as they do on trees.But have n't seen any use the fly through feature yet.It holds either sun flower seeds or peanuts . The mesh is fairly large ~ 1/4 '' squares , so it wo n't hold black sunflower seeds , only gray.Since the holes have to be large enough for the birds to pull the sunflower through , some seeds fall through the mesh while filling.I 've found it beneficial to keep on hand an empty 40 to 50 lb bird food bag.It 's nice to sit a feeder in the empty bag while filling , to catch the spilled food.The feeder is well constructed and holds 8 cups sunflowers seeds.It 's a very nice size , all metal mesh design 14 '' tall ( 6 '' locking hanger ) 4 '' sq.It has two round 'fly through ' holes 2 5/8 '' dia . from one sideand two rectangle 'fly through ' holes 2 '' x 3 '' from the other .	1
I got this bird feeder at the same time as a regular perch feeder ( with a hood ) . I was able to put up the perch feeder right away because I had the right kind of seed for it but this feeder requires either sunflower seed or peanuts and I did n't have either to hand . We 're fairly new to the neighborhood and the birds do n't know our house yet despite having some window feeders up for several weeks . The perch feeder too has largely been ignored but within a day of putting this feeder up we had several varieties at the feeder including a red-headed woodpecker.The construction is sturdy ... the top lifts off so you can add more seed . I 've seen perch in the fly-through areas staying out of the wind . We enjoy this feeder a lot and hope it attracts birds to our other ( less well-used ) feeders .	1
This was the third bird feeder we have set up outside one of our dinning room windows . At first I was skeptical that birds would actually go inside of the little holes - but they do ! I 've seen many small birds inside pecking at the sunflower seeds this feeder is packed with.We keep a small pair of binoculars on the table and its fun to watch the birds fly in and peck away . It also provides a bit of shelter for the birds when they are eating . The bigger birds , including a bright red Cardinals who visits regularly , use another of our feeders that they can better access so it 's good to know our littler-feathered friends now have a place of their own , too . Before getting this Perky-Pet feeder I 've seen larger birds shoo-shooing away the littler birds . Now they all have their place to eat in peace.This bird feeder is well-made and easy to fill with seed and then hang . Two thumbs up from me !	1
I have had a similar feeder for several years . It looks similar to this , but has only round holes ( I like the round and square on this ) , a copper colored top , and a platform on the bottom . I ca n't find it on Amazon to provide a link . It has been one of the birds ' favorite feeders , especially the chickadees . I fill it with black oil sunflower seed and they like having all of the places to access the seeds . I have trouble with deer in my feeders and they tend to leave these alone , possibly because tilting them does not allow all of the seed to fall out . Although the feeders do n't provide seed protection from the elements , they empty it quickly enough that it has never been an issue and I have never had a feeder filled with rotten seed.There are a couple of drawbacks with both feeders . The & # 34 ; fly through & # 34 ; holes allow small birds to perch while eating , but they also take up a lot of space , so the feeder does not hold a whole lot . The squirrels also can access the seed and they break the wire . This makes it difficult to fill the feeder without losing lots of seed . Even new a fair amount of seed comes out the sides , so I fill it over a platform feeder . The platform the other feeder has on the bottom catches some of the seed that falls out during use . This does not have the platform . The other feeder 's copper top is also more attractive than this plain black one.Still , this has quickly been just as popular with the birds as the copper version . Due to the size of the holes , it is really only suitable for sunflower seeds in the shell , but that is the most popular seed in my area , so that is no problem . I think other large seeds , such as safflower , might also work .	1
I acquired this product after I had read the heart-breaking review about the little bird 's foot caught in this feeder . Had I read it first I would not have placed the order . Also , it seems that sunflower seeds are the only type of seeds that might be good for this feeder , as the holes are a little too big for small seeds . I have n't seen any birds fly through it yet , but I 'll keep watch . I have many bird feeders and I would n't count this one as better or worse than the others.UPDATE : I 've had the feeder for a while now and I 've been monitoring it closely ( as closely as one can monitor a bird-feeder ) . So far no mishaps with birds ' feet getting caught , thanks goodness . There has been a really great upside , which is why I changed my rating from four to five . It just so happens that woodpeckers love this birdfeeder ! I 've seen them hanging upside down from the bottom , ( red-head and all ! ) with their long bill , poking into the holes to get out the seeds . Another bird I see on it often is the Brown Thrasher , which happens to be Georgia 's State Bird . I 'd never seen either of those birds close up , and now it 's a real treat ! Bigger birds ( like Blue Jays and big Cardinals ) ca n't eat from it because their just too big to get a solid footing , but the baby birds hop in and out of the holes.One bad thing -- squirrels can hang on to this thing and feast away like there 's no tomorrow . They are responsible for eating about 80 % of the seeds !	1
A feeder like this must be one of the wonders of the world to a small bird . Step inside one of the holes and you 're in a house made out of food ! It 's a neat idea and its popularity is growing in our yard , but there are a few things to be aware of . Because it 's made of a large wire mesh , there 's a considerable amount of spillage when you fill it . So make sure not to try on a surface you 'll have to sweep later . Do it at the feeding area and the ground birds will thank you . And because the seeds are only held in place be a bit of friction , all you need to do is jar the feeder a little and it 's snowing sunflower seeds . Any squirrel worth his salt will figure this out in a few minutes -- just jump against the feeder and you 've knocked dinner loose for the whole family.But I live in the West and we 've got plenty of raptors , so squirrels are n't a problem . House finches enjoy the feeder as do scrub jays , junkos and the occasional sparrow . I expect the grosbeaks will mob it when they show up a little later this year . In the East , cardinals will be attracted if you can solve the squirrel problem . Small birds can get inside , but larger birds can easily hang onto the wire mesh . It also takes the pressure off of feeders with smaller seeds , meaning the little birds also have a fair shot at a meal.So it 's a little messy , but it 's a neat idea for a feeder .	1
Obviously it is not squirrel proof - but still works great . The top lifts up easily to fill as opposed to some that are more troublesome to fill . The birds do hang out in it and on it - so that part is especially cool to watch . Only con is when you load it with the small black sunflower seeds , you will lose a few as they will fly out the sides etc - but will catch more than it loses , so no biggie . I would recommend it to anyone .	1
Birds really seem to love this feeder , and when filled with black oil sunflower seeds it has visitors all day long . The feeder itself seems to have a sturdy construction . The little button clamp on the lid does n't hold tight though , I 've had a problem with squirrels , possums , and raccoon lifting the top up to access the seeds inside . Also this feeder is not rain friendly . It takes no time and very little rain for the seeds inside to get soaked , so it needs to be hung under an awning to keep the seeds from getting wet and molding .	1
I own several Perky Pet brand feeders and have enjoyed every one I have purchased . This one is made of metal mesh that the birds can ACTUALLY fly through or perch in the middle of . Sunflower seed is not the cheapest wild bird seed on the market as I use mostly chicken scratch grains and cracked corn.This is a sturdy and very well-built bird feeder as is all of the Perky Pet brands.Happy Feeding !	1
This is a stylish feeder that attracts birds . It looks great hanging from a tree in my backyard and I 've enjoyed watching the birds feed from it - often , several at a time . Even though it 's placed far from any tree limbs , the squirrels still figure out how to get to it . I like having squirrels in my backyard , so this does n't bother me too much , but if you 're looking for a squirrel-proof bird feeder , this is n't it .	1
This is a nice bird feeder , but you need to be aware what you 're getting.First of all , you can only fill this with fairly large feed , e.g . sunflower seeds or peanuts . Regular small-grain birdfeed will be too small and just pour through the holes.Secondly , as the birds eat , lots of little bits of the feed ( sunflower seed shells in my case ) will fall down , so try to hang this above an area where you do n't mind the mess . ( I first had it on our patio , then moved it so it hangs above an area where plants and flowers grow so the little bits of food just hit the soil instead of junk up the patio ) .As long as you 're aware of these two facts , this bird feeder should work well for you . We have several birds who visit it regularly , and it 's a lot of fun to see them sit inside the little & # 34 ; tunnels & # 34 ; and pick at the food .	1
I replaced a very unpopular tube feeder that held sunflower seeds with the Perky-Pet Fly-Through Feeder and within 30 minutes I had birds visiting . From that point on , it has been the most popular feeder in our backyard , All types of birds visit - from chickadees and other clinging birds to the occasional cardinal and blue jay . The clinging type birds seem to love being able to chose where to eat - inside or out . If inside , they seem to enjoy being able to pick seeds from all the sides as well as top and bottom . It creates a & # 34 ; room & # 34 ; of sunflower seeds that seems to really enamor some of the birds . The cardinals will go inside the square hole and then eat inside or reach outside while sitting on the sill and having a leisurely dinner while being protected.The feeder is sturdy enough to hold up to starling and grackle abuse when they came through , unlike my other feeders . This one is tough and seems decently constructed . I have not found any problems with wires sticking out or sharp edges and no birds have had any problems with the holes or getting caught.This feeder has been a real joy to watch . It is very rare to see the feeder with no birds on it . Usually there is between 4-6 at a time and they have made for some comical entertainment at times . We use black oil sunflower seeds in this feeder and have not seen any real waste . Some does fall through but those are found by the ground seed eaters , so nothing really goes to waste.We are very pleased with this feeder !	1
The Perky-Pet Fly Through Wild Bird Feeder is great too look at , and very functional . It is easy to fill , easy to use and great for birds of all types . The large holes are great for birds of all variety and size , and it is fun to watch them in action . All home gardens are not complete without the Perky-Pet Fly Through Wild Bird Feeder . Great job ! !	1
This is a very different design in a seed feeder . The birds can go inside through one of the two tunnel levels . Whether inside or outside , they eat by pulling the seeds through the mesh . Because of the design , it will only work for sunflower seeds or shelled peanuts . We have n't tried the peanuts . Compared to other style feeders , I think a bit more seed ends up on the ground , which is not entirely bad , and some species prefer to feed on the ground . It is pretty easy to use , as the top lifts up easily for filling . You just press a button which releases it from the hanging cable and lets it slide up . All in all , not a bad feeder , and it is fun to watch the birds use it . I took away a star because the feeder is less versatile than those which use a regular seed mix .	1
My tree cutting activities are limited to my weekend trimming around the yard , but I want to trim limbs between 1 and 4 inches in diameter , so I graduated past the hand-held saw . My experience started with aBlack and Decker LPP120 Cordless Pole Saw , which is basically an electric chain saw on a stick . An awesome product , btw , but wanting on occasion to ditch the `` stick , '' I bought theBlack and Decker LCS120 Cordless Chain Saw . For the price , I think the B & D ; chain saw is good , but it 's not in the same league as this GreenWorks model . IMO , the B & D ; is definitely geared for people like me that do light trimming and nothing too thick . For a tree trunk of any decent thickness , I think that you 'd want something like this model.Overall , I 'm really pleased with this chain saw . I was skeptical at first about it being a good value , given the list ( and current ) price of $ 300 . I was very fortunate to be able to try this for free on the Vine program , but $ 300 is a lot of money , and I kind of expected to be disappointed in the overall value . I am not ! It is , so far , much better than the B & D . ; For full disclosure , I have n't used this extensively , yet , but I have tried it out . I do plan to do some more trimming over the next month as we move into the holidays , and I 'll update this review if my opinion changes.Do I think it 's worth the money ? Yes . I 'm not a chain saw expert , though , so I 'll just try to help you by describing the advantages over the less expensive B & D ; LCS120 . In other words , what do you get for that extra $ 170 ? ( * ) More cutting length : this might not matter to you if you just do trimming ( * ) Better build quality ( from what I can tell so far ) : the B & D ; is n't bad ... this is just better ( * ) Easier and faster chain tension adjustment : this has a knob on the side , whereas the B & D ; requires you to use the included small screwdriver to turn a small dial that is located at the base of the chain . It 's not a huge deal , but I love it . I find myself checking and adjusting the chain more than once in a session , and it was just inconvenient to have to go through the process with the B & D . ; This model makes it so easy ( * ) Chain brake on the hand guard : the B & D ; does not have one . I do n't actually know how important this is , but it seems like a good safety feature if the saw kicks backs ( * ) Better battery location : my B & D ; just gushed oil when I filled the reservoir , and it leaked all over where the battery connects . This battery slides down on the top and is n't in danger of that happening ( * ) Flat bottom surface : so you can set it down more easily without trying to balance it . The B & D ; will tend to fall onto its side for me , but this one sits down so easilyIt is heavier than the B & D ; , but really not bad , and I think it 's well balanced and helps a lot with the weight . I initially thought it would be a bigger deal than it turned out to be for me . However , if you are looking for something very lightweight , the B & D ; is definitely one to look into.On a related note , I also own a GreenWorks dethather that I bought last year . It has held up quite well over multiple uses . I only mention it as some more info on the brand , and that I 've been happy with my experience with their products .	1
I have always been a believer in the right tool for the right job . But then life and circumstances tend to get in the way and we are forced to make do with what we have at the time . Or a better way of putting it Adapt And Overcome ! ! Most of the reviewers on Amazon have used this saw for small jobs such as finish work on fire kindling and what not.My first job for this saw was cutting down a wall in a house . Do n't ask why , just know it needed to be done , and I had a short time to get it done , as in hey this wall has to be history in two hours or less . It bit through everything that was in its path . Triple layer two by fours with nails ( yeah I know ) , plaster ( that was something ) , sheetrock , and some aluminum . It took some time but the task was finished , and no animals were harmed during completion of this project.I then on the same charge went on to chew down a tree as big around as a hub cap . That was ugly and I was a sweat ball covered in tree guts before it came down . The saw battery was spent . I was spent . The saw had used up all of the bar chain oil in the full reservoir , and came out of the day undamaged.I have also used it for more suitable limbs , branches , and a slew of treated 4 x 4 fence posts with impressive results.Needless to say always use eye protection and gloves , and I do n't recommend abusing this fine saw like I did , just know that if forced to , you can and both you and saw will live through it.The only downside I found was that extra or replacement batteries are pretty pricey.Very Highly Recommended	1
Love it ! Just wish it came with a extra battery . I have a couple of the smaller B & D ; battery powered saws and this things out performs them hands down . The only thing that would make this one better would be if it had an adaptor like a fake battery with a extension cord so that you could run it off house current when the battery is being recharged.The saw is nice and quiet and really beats those gas powered ones for noise levels.I can highly recommend this saw for any body that needs one for light to medium work .	1
Bottom line : There 's a lot to like about this chain saw with regard to build quality , features and performance . However , it is equaled on all these metrics by a good corded model for a lot less . The convenience of cordless may not be worth the extra cost.Full review : Like many homeowners with a suburban-sized yard , a gas-powered chainsaw is overkill . It comes in handy when you need it , but it 's unlikely to see much use during the year . That complicates maintenance , since gas equipment does not like to sit idle unless it has been properly prepped to do so.The alternative has typically been a corded electric chainsaw . A good quality electric will give you much of the performance of a gas model without any of the gas engine maintenance issues . But , you 're tied to an outlet or a generator.This chainsaw takes it a step further , and is the first cordless chainsaw that is a `` real '' chainsaw . Up until now , the cordless models have been limited use tools , such as the line made by Black and Decker . I have three different B & D ; cordless chainsaws and they work well , but are limited to branch trimming . I think of them as pruners more so than chainsaws.The power this puts out is simply amazing , and equals that of my favorite electric chain saw , the WORX WG300 ( WORX WG300 14-Inch 3 HP 14 Amp Electric Chain Saw ) .The saw includes a number of great design features to make it easier and safer to use . These include an automatic bar oiling system with an easy to see oil level window , a blade brake ( an essential safety feature ) , metal dogs ( spikes ) at the base of the bar to reduce kickback , and a 16 inch bar that will give you the ability to tackle a pretty formidable tree . It is easy to adjust the chain tension , and it actually comes with a very good manual ( a rarity these days ) . The 40v battery is massive compared with the 18v models I 'm used to , and gives the saw ample power.The build quality seems excellent . This has a lot of heft , but it feels well-balanced . I did n't have any problems controlling the saw in use . You do notice the weight , but no more so than a good electric , and it is lighter than a similarly-sized gas machine.It includes a nice quality carry case that has an extension to fit the bar . It works well for keeping the saw clean while it is stored in the garage . The case fits just the saw ( with or without a battery installed ) . It would have been nice if the case were a bit larger so the charger could fit in there as well.Blade speed was more than enough to make quick work of some 10 inch diameter logs . Again , a good gas powered saw , such as a Stihl , would leave this in the dust , but unless you 're felling trees for a living , a bit slower blade speed is not a problem.The problem I had was the same as with any cordless device - run time . The manufacturer claims a charge will let you go through a cord of wood . I ca n't say if that is accurate , but I did start having run time problems once I had been using it for about 20 minutes . You can get through a lot of wood in 20 minutes with this , but the run time is not enough for me to get through what I need it to do on a single battery . As with any other cordless device , the solution is to have 2 batteries , so one is in the charger at all times . But that adds even more cost to an already pricy tool.The other issue I had was that it takes a second or so to come up to speed . Not a big issue , but enough to be noticeable . Lastly , while the handle is OK in terms of comfort , it does not excel in that area . It needs a rounder trigger handle , and the cross bar should have some non-slip padding on it for comfort and security . Collectively , these issues drop the rating to 4 stars.So , would I recommend this ? Yes , but with the caveat that you can get the same performance and features in a corded electric at about a third of the price . While freedom from a cord is worth something , I 'm not sure it 's worth the premium price of this model . It is worth considering , however , due to its performance and ease of use .	1
I bought this chainsaw for my husband , as we live in a wooded area and the other one conked out on him . Per hubby , this chainsaw is lightweight and it is easy to maneuver . He 's had to get on a tall , unstable ladder to cut trees hanging on top of room , and this lightweight tool did not make it hard from him to get the job done . It cuts well and the fact that this saw is cordless makes a world of a difference . The battery life is good and I was able to get what I needed to get done in one charge , considering we have a ton of trees on our property . He has other GreenWorks tools and says he likes these as much or a tad bit more than his previous brand , which I believe was Black and Decker .	1
I have used many different types of chainsaws in my life ; Gas , Corded Electric and Battery and while the electric chainsaws are good for some jobs , a big job always required a `` real '' chainsaw . Well `` real '' just went green . When I first used this saw I went from a 4 '' branch to a 6 '' to a 12+ '' log and I was blown away by the power of this saw . Hot knife meet butter . And this was dead wood I was cutting thru , that is the worst on a chainsaw.The pros to this saw are ; Push button start : Anyone familiar with chainsaws is also familiar with wearing yourself out just pulling the cord and trying to get it to start . Also it turns itself off if it sits too long or if the chain gets caught.Running time is easily equal to a full tank of gas in a regular chainsaw and since there is no gas , the bar & chain oil reservoir is larger , so no running out in the middle of a job . Also since there is no gas , it can sit for months without the gas going bad and gumming up the carburetor.Recharge time is fast , especially for a 40V battery.One major con is that when you run out of gas , you just refill the tank and go back to work , but with a battery powered tool , you have to recharge the battery . I wish the companies that make these tools would realize they need to come with two batteries . One to use while the other recharges.One minor con , Ice Storms ! I have used my chainsaws more to clean up after ice storms than for any other reason and often there is no electricity to recharge a tool like this . Another reason more than one battery is a good idea.Overall , this is a magnificent tool ! It is great for a homeowner who only needs a chainsaw every once in a while . When you need a chainsaw , this one is ready to go in a moment .	1
I have only used this saw for one day ... .but I used it all day . I own two gas saws , a Husqavarna Rancher 460 , and a Poulan Pro 16 '' saw . This cordless saw is equivalent to my Poulan Pro which I will probably never use again . I especially like this saw because it is quiet . I live in a ranch community and people are living here to get away from noise . This saw allows me to collect fire wood in places where I would othewise be disturbing the tranquility of the community . I am stunned at the battery life , and how quickly it can be recharged . By the time the battery runs down , I am run down as well . The other thing I like are the safety features . The saw is light and easy to handle and this really helps reduce stress . The chain brake works well . The other thing I really like is the ability to adjust the chain without needing tools . Just make sure you check the tightness periodically . I put a couple of drops of blue Loctite on the threads to help keep the hand tightened bar retainer from loosening . I cut through some huge 24 inch white oak today . Normally , this would be a job for my Rancher 460 . While it took considerably longer with the Greenworks , it was much more pleasant and I was free from noxious exhaust and forest raping noise . I will follow up with an update after a month or so of use.Update : I use this saw routinely since initial purchase and especially during the winter months in NC . My house is at 4k feet in the Great Smokies in NC . It is heated with an outdoor wood boiler . I feed my furnace with the plentiful seasoned dead fall which litters my property and ranch community . On a single charge , this saw will fill the bed of my Tacoma shortbed truck . I use the saw several times per week and it has never failed me . Rarely do I ever use my gas saws anymore except for really big stuff . I bought an extra battery for the saw but rarely use it . My back runs down before the saw battery . My neighbors never hear me cutting , and I can cut in areas where I might otherwise be disturbing somebody . Even if it fails on me ... I will immediately purchase another because it makes cutting so much more pleasant and safe . Tip : I spray the chain with DuPont Chain Saver ... .my chains stay sharp even when I am cutting soiled dead fall . This Teflon product is simply amazing for this purpose .	1
I already had two small battery powered saws , a corded saw , and the Stihl gas saw . Yet when I had the opportunity to get this saw with a discount , I jumped at the chance.Out of the box no assembly is required ; the only preliminary before cutting is the charging of the big 40v battery . Since I also own the Greenworks 40v leaf blower , I had a battery ready and charged for the chainsaw.From the first cut I knew I had made the right decision . This saw is much quitter than the Stihl , much easier to start , and cuts almost as well . One charged battery goes a long way , and with a second battery in the charger I 'll wear out before the batteries . Just for fun I tried cutting a 14 '' felled tree into pieces . Not a problem.I like everything about this saw . In addition to its impressive cutting ability , I like its looks , the visible oil `` tank '' , the ease of tightening the chain , the included brake , and its comfort and balance.For the homeowner who does an occasional cutting chore , this might be the only chainsaw you 'll need .	1
GreenWorks G-MAX 40V 16-inch DigiPro Brushless ChainsawNot being a chain saw aficionado , I will probably offend those of you who use a chain saw daily . I use a chain saw infrequently . Normally no more often than twice a year unless we have had stormy weather and if it is really stormy and I lose six trees simultaneously ( 3 years ago ) then I call my tree guy.I do not use a chain saw on a ladder . If I ca n't have two feet on the ground I do n't use it . Now that I have established my credentials , I like this little saw . It is very well made . It is replacing an equally small electric chain saw . I do n't intend to fell forests with it , but when the occasional tree does come down , this appears that it will be able to handle it . With that said , I am not planning on cutting down one of my trees to merely test it . It came with very good instructions , a charger and a battery.I called the 800 number to verify that there truly is a human being answering the phone and fielding questions . I asked if I needed to buy expensive bar and chain lubricant and I was assured a good quality , NEW not used , 10w-30 would work just fine.For some reason it runs even quieter than my electric chain saw . It has a nice tension knob that should be a feature on my electric chain saw but is n't . Screw driver and two wrenches were needed to change the tension on my old saw . This has a handy dandy little knob to adjust the tension.Overall without felling a tree , it cuts better than the old electric chain saw ( perhaps the brand new chain could be a factor there ) , it is quieter and much more user friendly . ( the tension knob ) In addition , I was able to get technical support immediately and she was friendly and informative . As far as I am concerned good customer service should weigh heavily on any purchasing decision.This appears it will give me good service and with a lithium battery , it should give me good life . The battery and charger are warranted for two years and the saw is warranted for four . That is hard to beat.Update : March 18,2014 , after having been away from home for 2.5 months , I came home to much tree damage . I had totally forgotten that I had this unit and was thinking I still had my electric chain saw ( given away ) . When I went in to get the chain saw I saw the battery and immediately assumed that it would be necessary to charge it as it had n't been charged or used since I first wrote the review , 5 months ago . Imagine my surprise when it fired right up , cut through branches up to 10 '' in diameter as if they were butter . The convenience of the battery , the lack of a cord and the hassle of a gas engine makes this my new favorite tool .	1
I can see why this saw gets mostly five star reviews . It is , indeed , as powerful as a gas saw , and much more powerful than my previous plug-in electric saw . Plus , you will be tired of cutting before the battery runs out . This saw is easily controlled and cuts fast -- really fast . The weight is just right , too . If you use a chainsaw , you wo n't go wrong with this one .	1
This is a wonderful multiuse tool that both sucks and blows ! Yep , it will suck up your leaves and carefully place them into a bag that you can empty into your mulch box ( You do have one do n't you ? ) . Of course , you may be one of those who simply mow your leaves back into your lawn . It will also blow those grass clippings off of your driveway back into the lawn.Do I sound like one of those `` green '' people ? Actually , our community has an ordinance prohibiting green waste from going into our landfill , so this was a lifesaver for me.The best parts : It is battery operated . I do NOT do gas powered items - sorry , they intimidate me . And , while I do n't mind cords , my husband hates them , so the only way for both of us to enjoy this is the mere fact that it IS battery operated.It is `` relatively '' light . It weighs in at about 6 pounds . While I would prefer to have it lighter ( I would prefer to have EVERYTHING lighter ) WORX runs over 8 pounds , and Toro is 10 pounds for their blower/vacs.It is GreenWorks . I have been using other garden products of theirs for some time and have grown to appreciate the way that they have lasted for me.It is easy to use.The things that are concerns : This comes with a single battery . Replacement batteries run more than $ 100 . Hopefully the battery lasts a long time , but if you need to use this on high for a period of time OR you have a large yard , this may not be the right one for you . On lower settings , I can use this for about an hour.This is my first blower OR vac , so I have little to compare it to , but I really do appreciate it in our 1/3 of an acre yard with 4 large trees and one small fruit tree .	1
Gas-powered leafblowers are powerful , but they 're incredibly loud , they spew out a surprising amount of fumes , you have to keep a can of gas-oil mix just for the blower , and engine maintenance is a hassle . So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower , which is zero maintenance ; but dealing with a 100 ' cord is a real hassle . So , when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower , I had high hopes , especially since I 've been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup . It 's lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating . The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool , so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force . Very convenient and easy to use . I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower , simply because its so simple and convenient . It takes three seconds ( literally ) to grab a battery off the shelf , snap it into the blower , and get to work.The only downside of the blower ( which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars ) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes . My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery , so I was expecting better battery life . The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups , but it means this leafblower wo n't be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup , when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line : I really like this blower for weekly cleanup . It 's lightweight , powerful , and super convenient . It starts instantly and creates no fumes , so I tend to use it a lot more often . It wo n't do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall , but it 's a great yard tool , especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools , since the batteries are fully interchangeable . ( Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools . The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge . I own three different GreenWorks tools and have become a huge fan of their system . )	1
I usually like to leave the outside work to my husband - but this inspired ME to leave the kitchen ( I love baking/cooking ) outside and suck up the leaves . I 'm only 5'4 and about 110 pounds but found this was n't too heavy to use . It was so easy to put together ( but one thing I 'd recommend to manufacture is to label the parts to the vacuum - that was the only thing that tripped me up a bit ) . I 've never ever used any machine to pick up leaves ( just a good old fashion rake ! ) - so I ca n't really compare this to anything . I was attracted to this seriously because of it 's color and what appeared to be its simplicity . The charge seems to hold and the bag is easy to throw over my shoulder and then empty . I love this and would highly recommend it - with something this simple AND good looking , it might inspire more women like me ( a girly girl ! ) to pick it up , get outside , and do some work ! Though I recommend if your wife does do that , it might be nice for you to whip up a great dinner for her !	1
Update 12/13/13 - After using the vacuum portion for awhile to vacuum up fall leaves , one annoyance has become obvious - when you go to attach the vacuum tube to the bottom , it is very awkward to try to balance it and slide it into the slot and lock it into place . Seems like it should be so easy , but it always takes me multiple tries and fumbling with it and sometimes when I think I 've got it , then I pick it up and knock the tube on any little thing and it falls off again . This process is very frustrating and makes me dread having to use it as vacuum . Everything else about this blower/vac is fantastic , but that one small thing really ruins the fun and ease of using this . Battery life continues to impress , as I have n't yet run it all the way down before completing a job.This blower vac is nice and powerful , when used at the top setting - the lower settings are not very useful as it does n't blow hard enough at the lower settings to really accomplish much . I confess I did n't immediately see the red button that puts it into high gear , but once you push it , look out - this blower really goes to town . On max settings this blower seems to easily put out as much power as a gas powered blower - definitely more powerful than any other battery operated blower that I 've tried.This blower is definitely way more powerful than my Worx 18volt li-ion cordless blower , however , it is also quite a bit larger which makes it a little less comfortable to blow grass clippings off after mowing , however I 'd say the bulkier size is definitely worth it for the increased power you get . The size/weight of this is comparable to my corded Toro vac/blower , and it performs as strongly or better than it , but you get the bonus of no power cord.The battery on this lasts about on average to other blowers , since all blowers seem to run down the batteries quickly - I was able to blow and vacuum up all my grass clippings without running the battery down , while with the Worx blower and I would have to switch batteries half way thru . So far , I have been easily able to do all by blowing/vacuuming on one charge . If you really want to stretch the battery run time out , you can run it at a lower setting or not in high mode.I also like how easy it is to convert from blower to vac - attach the tube to the bottom and lock it in and replace the blower tube with the bag and you 're ready to go . I use this weekly for the yard , since i mulch mow - i use it as a blower to blow all the grass clippings and leaves into a pile and then switch it to vac mode to suck up the leaves and clippings to use as mulch elsewhere . I ca n't wait till fall finally comes to Texas and I can try it out on all the leaves that will get dropped in the yard.As for price , I think that if you really want the power of a gas blower or corded , then this is absolutely worth every penny . If you do n't necessarily need max power and maybe only want to do light blowing of leaves or grass clippings , then maybe the cheaper non digipro version of this might be a better fit .	1
This works great . I have a black and decker 20V max blower which works well , but I wanted something more powerful and that could also function as a vacuum . Since I already have a GMax Lawnmower with Batteries I opted for this . The Vacuum is okay , but will struggle to pick up wet heavy leaves ( as expected ) . The blower is excellent - better than my black and decker blower . However , this unit is a bit on the heavy side , and with my long uphill driveway it can be a bit tedious , but it works well nonetheless .	1
The Greenworks G-Max is literally a snap to put together . It comes with charger , 40v battery , blower tube , concentration nozzle ( does n't help me concentrate ) , mulcher tubes , leaf bag , and operator 's manual . I actually found it challenging to find the printed in China manual since it 's printed on brown recycled paper that blends in with the color of the packing box . It 's an attractive tool , a little on the heavy side , but lighter than my Stihl gas blower and well balanced . But what about performance ? For clearing our deck and sidewalks the low speed setting with the variable speed set to five is far more than adequate . To move lots of leaves and twigs kick into Turbo Speed and be amazed by the flying leaves and the power in your hands . Of course , the Stihl gas blower is more powerful , but for my purposes the power of the GreenWorks is more than adequate . So far one battery is all I 've needed as long as I recharge the battery between uses . An hour and a half in the charger usually gets it back to full power . Unlike my NiCad Black and Decker battery powered tools , this one does n't weaken towards the end of the battery life . It just suddenly dies . To monitor the power left , one must keep an eye on the power indicator on the battery . Depending on the settings used , I can work 20 to 30 minutes on one battery charge.Verdict on the blower - I like it so much that I 'll rarely if ever use my Stihl gas blower . The low powered Black and Decker NiCad blower will go into retirement and the corded Toro will be used only on occasion . This tool is so good that I 'll probably buy the Greenworks chainsaw next so I can use batteries on both.Greenworks G-Max also can be configured as a vac . I must disclose that I 've never liked the vac function on any of my vac/blowers , but gave this one a fair shot just in case . For me the vac function is more trouble than it 's worth even though it only takes a few minutes to remove the blower tube and install the mulcher tubes and the bag . The suction is fair at best and vacuuming is a tedious chore . I think I could easily fill a large leaf bag the old fashioned way faster than I could fill the bag attachment of the blower/vac . I will say that the vacuum function is nice for getting leaves out of shrubbery or collecting leaves from between closely growing shrubbery in beds by the house.My only other complaint with this unit is the ON/OFF button , a slightly raised dimple on an electronic pad that 's not as easy to use as a push button or lever control.Bottom line - I am pleasantly surprised by the performance of this Greenworks tool and like it enough to want to purchase more tools in its 40v family .	1
As you can see from the original review , I had my reservations but overall , Greenworks has a decent product . As it turns out , the weak battery life ended up being a DEAD battery after less than 6 months . Greenworks customer service was contacted with no mention of Vine participation . They handled the issue very quickly and professionally , exceeding my expectations ( some other reviews report less than satisfactory experiences ) After trying the new battery , I can say that it performs better than the prior one , but still goes to 2 bars within about ~15 minutes.Original review from October 2013 below ... .I have a Black and Decker corded electric blower/vac , and it 's supposedly rated at 225 mph . This , at 185 mph seems every bit as powerful . The aur speed is like the PSI on a pressure washer - it can be a little misleading . If you get a large amount of air at 185 mph , it can be more functional than a small stream of air at 225 mph.It 's a little heavier than my corded blower , but the convenience far outweighs this.1 ) There 's an odd little nozzle extension that I decided I did n't need - this also gives the blower a larger exhaust.2 ) Using the extra power mode eats your battery pretty darn quick . My guess is that it will last less than 15 minutes on the high setting . That should be enough for most jobs , however.3 ) Charger is annoying - you have to push hard to get it to click in , then removing it is also very tricky since you have tu simultaneously release the latch which is now upside down , and pull away from you . My wife was unable to do this after several tries.4 ) On/off and high/low switches are really low cost `` membrane '' switches - very small and hard to use with gloves . I also do n't know how well they will hold up over time . They really should have gone with something bigger and more robust .	1
This is one huge grill cover . So large , I when I pulled it out of the packaging to try it out on my Weber charcoal grill , I realized it could almost fit two of them under it . So I decided to try and fit both my Weber and my electric smoker under it . While the base of my smoker is bulky and square like the top , the bottom of my Weber is just slim metal legs . So even with this grill cover cinching closed at the base , both my grill and my smoker are able to fit inside it together , as it 's the bottom that 's shaped more narrowly than the top.It 's much softer than I expected it to be . Other grill covers I 've had have been a more tarp like material . This is softer , like fabric , and drapes around the contours of the grill underneath it . The cover has sewn on handles and vent flaps on either side , and even a large pocket for keeping thing like dripping utensils.I really like the light color of this cover . It matches the siding of my house , and has a cleaner look to it than the black covers I 've had in the past . The brown color blocking at the base is nice since it keeps in mind that this section of the cover would be the most likely to rub/drag against the ground , porch , garage floor , etc . Since it 's the most likely section to get dirty , being dark brown helps hide what dirt might get on it.I 'll be very interested to see how well this cover holds up to our brutal northern Minnesota winters . Where sub zero temperatures and non-stop snowstorms last many months every year . During these snowstorms the winds are relentless . Last year an wrought iron bistro table I had on my porch was picked up and flipped , causing the glass on the top to shatter . So I will be eager to see how well this grill cover helps protects my Weber and smoker in the coming months . I plan to update this review with how well it holds up this winter.A product sample was provided for reviewing purposes .	1
It does n't fly away all crazy in the wind and repels the snow and rain . It is a bit heavy but it 's just because it 's so well made . I think it 's the last one I will need .	1
I 've had the canvas/vinyl grill covers in the past and they do the job but they are just 'okay ' and start to degrade in the sun pretty quickly.This cover is made of really high quality canvas with a water resistant interior coating . There are two handles on the top to help lift it off or lower in back on.It is very large and easily covers our grill with both side tables extended . It would think it will do okay for much larger grills but make sure you measure first.It has a dual color scheme , a nice creamy beige for the majority of the cover and a dark brown at the bottom which will help to keep any dirt that gets splashed up from the ground or your deck . There is reinforcing white piping on the seams as well.The cover repels water and has an elastic bottom to help pull it in tighter.I am really surprised at the high quality of this cover , especially at this price point . It is top notch.I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review .	1
This Epica grill cover is made of heavy-duty canvas with a PVC waterproof coating underneath to protect the metal grill from water . It 's noticeably hefty , weighing in at well over five pounds . The construction is durable , with heavy stitching and piping at stressed seams.There are a lot of thoughtful details such as the neutral color for the main body but a complementary brown border at the bottom to hide soil , a drawcord and straps with buckles at the bottom for secure storage in windy areas or for the winter , vents , padded handles to make removal easy and even an accessory pocket.This grill cover is quite handsome , especially compared to some of the vinyl ones I 've seen , very nice ! A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review .	1
This cover is made of a heavy-duty canvas material which may in fact be bullet proof . Certainly if you made a jacket out of it , you 'd be perfectly safe falling off your motorcycle . The cover is the right size for a full-sized grill with burners/extensions on both sides . If you have a medium-sized or smaller grill , you could possibly use the remaining space as a tent-style dog house , or for summertime guests.The only ( very minor ) nit I will pick is that the elastic bottom makes it a bit more of a struggle to get the cover fitted over the top of the grill . My old cover had parallel , non-elastic sides and it slipped easily down over the grill , using Velcro straps to cinch the sides tight so it would n't blow off . This cover is definitely not going to blow off , but getting it on the grill is a bit annoying and it does n't have quite as neat of an appearance . Then again , I do n't have to remember to fasten the Velcro straps like on my old cover - once this baby is in place , you 're done.Definitely recommended for the price .	1
The Epica grill cover is made of thick sturdy fabric . Two-tone color with beige on top and more like burnt sienna on the bottom . I have a stainless steel grill with a side burner and the size fits exactly to protect the entire grill . The bottom is girdled with an elastic band and a locking clasp which if properly attached can withstand the strongest winds . Two large handles on the shoulders make it easy to align and help for easy removal . There is also a big zippered pouch where you can store your grilling accessories at the front.I live in Virginia where we gets snow in the winter , the cover is rated to brave the cold temperature without getting brittle.Cons : - nothing much except the color as soot can be easily seen on light colors.Sample was provided for an unbiased review .	1
I was suspicious of this miracle product , but figured it was worth a try . I have one client with three dogs using one patch of lawn for the bathroom . What a mess that lawn is.I applied the lawn patch in the bare spots , made sure the automatic watering system was on , and came back three weeks later to a green lawn in those areas . Could n't believe how fast and well it worked . Of course , there were new bare spots from the areas the dogs had used in the meantime , but it 's great to know that I can fix bare patches with such an easy sprinkle.I 'll be recommending to my other clients with dogs .	1
This stuff really does work . You will notice growth in 2-3 wks . Wish I could buy a larger bag of this at a Home Depot or Lowes .	1
My backyard as no grass where my dog can do her business so I create an urban potty pad using some wood and sod . She would use but eventually the grass would die . This grass seed works pretty well but needs to be watered a lot .	1
This a well built molded plastic rain barrel , however I have a few concerns with it for long term use.We already have the Algreen 80 gallon rain barrel . You need to set these up on a level service , we bought pavers to sit them on . And place them where you know your going to want them , preferably connected to a downspout . Do n't plan on possibly moving the rain barrel to a spot it might look nicer in once it 's already placed , it will be too heavy unless you want to completely empty it out.This barrel does n't have a great set up for attaching to a down spout . And the planter area does n't seem the best either . My Agreen barrel has a planter with lots of tiny drainage holes . This one has just one small hole sort of on the side , not the bottom . I drilled several other ones in the bottom of the planter with a small bit . The idea is you want the plants watered , but not floating and the water to pass through into the barrel but as little soil sediment as possible to get in or you will have to take everything apart and clean it out so the spigot is n't clogged . Even then I think a shallow bed of shale before putting in your soil and plants is n't a bad idea . And cleaning the barrel out looks like it might be tricky as it does n't have a lid but just the small meshed area for water collection .	1
Like the other reviewers I deducted a star for the design of the top which is meant to function as a planter but I think would not work as it collects too much water - whatever you planted there would drown . I admit I have n't tried anything there yet - if something works I will amend this review . I have left it open but worry about mosquitoes breeding there - it 's a bit deep to function as a bird bath - about 4 1/2 inches.I like the looks of the rain barrel - better than my green plastic one - it does n't look like cheap plastic to me , could be cement from a distance . I like having one spigot up high - much easier to reach for filling a watering can . It was easy to install too ( for my handyman ! ) .Update after two months : the resevoir on top has turned out to be a breeding ground for mosquito larvae . I would prefer a barrel where water did not collect on top . It also collects dirt .	1
Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel is a good idea for most any home . It helps collect rain water which can then be used for other household purposes , helping to save money and conserve resources.I have used other rain barrels but this is the first one I have owned that is solid in construction . In fact , if I have to name one aspect of this rain barrel I like best , it would be the solid , sturdy design . It seems like it can stand up to the elements and withstand any type of inclement weather . Lucky for me , it doesn & # 8217 ; t snow where I live but the durable design is good for those who live in harsher climates.With its attractive , neutral design , this rain barrel matches up well with most outdoor d & eacute ; cor and I like that it has two spigots for convenience . There is also the ability to place a plant on top , as you can see in the picture . I haven & # 8217 ; t done this and , given how shallow the space on top is , I don & # 8217 ; t know if placing a plant here is really a good idea . If it was deeper , perhaps so , but it & # 8217 ; s so shallow that most plants won & # 8217 ; t fare very well.The things that bother me a little with this rain barrel are its lack of a removable top and issues with installation . There is a screen on top to help prevent debris and bugs from getting inside . And it & # 8217 ; s a good thing the rain barrel has this because there is no way to open the top for cleaning . The best you could do is remove the small screen and try to find something narrow to stick through the small opening for cleaning . The screen will keep out leaves and other things , but if the barrel gets smelly and needs an interior cleaning job , there is little you can do.With the installation , I did have some small issues and concerns . You need to place this rain barrel directly under a downspout and because it is so tall , that will likely mean removing a large section of your downspout in order to fit the rain barrel underneath . Depending on your particular downspout design , it could be a problem and you may have to cut off a portion of the spout to get it situated just right . Then , there could be issues with the spigots . They provide tape to help form a good seal , but only time will tell if the seal holds up and the water doesn & # 8217 ; t leak.Overall , however , I like the Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel and recommend it for most homes . It helps conserve water , performs adequately , and looks nice in my backyard . It could stand for some improvements , but it is still a good device for water conservation .	1
Some rain barrels are really homely so I 'm glad when I find one that 's not . I have another one that looks prettier than this one , but even so , this is not bad . I do n't really see trying to use the top for a planter unless I use plants that are potted and have a saucer underneath.I have n't needed the & # 34 ; Built-In Overflow Management System & # 34 ; yet and I doubt that I 'll use both spigots at the same time . However , having an upper one means I do n't have to bend over very far when I just want to fill a watering can , and the lower one is best for watering with a hose ( more pressure plus the barrel will furnish water even if only a quarter of the way full ) .The hardware appears to be well made . If this is your first rain barrel , consider placing it convenient to plants that are not easily reached by an existing spigot . Convenience means that you are less likely to neglect watering your plants . And if you are in a climate that gets low temperatures , do n't forget to drain your barrel as winter approaches . It 's best to drain it and then store it someplace where it 's sheltered from extreme cold.The water that comes off your roof and through your gutters is not completely clean but it is good enough for plants . Many homeowners will find this to be a worthwhile investment .	1
This is a 50 gallon rain barrel with a place to put a plant in the top with a drain hole for soil.It has a filter screen at top to keep leaves and debris out of the barrel . It has brass fitting and has very nice looking body.If you get low rain fall amounts this is a very cute barrel.I live in the mid west and we get huge rain down pours , this barrel has no way to direct over flow . It fills and runs along a small track to pour off the front . I have other rain barrels that I can daisy chain together , this one has two drains , one down low and one half way up , it wo n't work for over flow unless I have it set higher than the other barrels . Since I do n't want water to run over next to my foundation I chose to install this barrel below a gutter on a shed away from the house . So if you live some where with low rain fall amounts or have a small gutter on a covered deck or the like , this is a very nice looking rain barrel with good fittings . If you can get large amounts of rain in a short time and have foundation issues or do n't want to go out and flip a diverter switch in the middle of a rain storm , you might want to look for a larger barrel or better over flow system .	1
We live in an area with exceptionally high water bills and ample rain so water barrels are a 'no brainer ' . Unfortunately , living in the suburbs also means appearance matters almost ( maybe more than ) function . In the past , we 've purchased the Algreen rain barrels that look like big terra cotta jugs and have been happy with them more or less ( B0013CJLI6 ATIN number ) . However , one one can never have too many rain barrels so when this came up for review , I jumped at the opportunity.PackagingThis arrived promptly and well packaged without any dings or dents . My original Algreen order had a big dent which I managed to get 'unkinked & # 34 ; but suffice to say , this held up better . It is a big box and very cumbersome so keep this in mind especially if mobility or other related considerations are an issue.Quality of ConstructionI 'd have to rate the quality of construction 'excellent ' . It is molded but very thick ... much more so than the Algreen 50 gal rain barrels . The planter does not have drainage which is a bit odd . The screen is thick and built-in so more stable . There is a breathing hole and two well placed spigots made out of brass . You will need to install the spigots ( 2 of them ... tape is included to form a tight seal ) . These are attractive and made out of metal which looks better than the plastic but only time will tell if they hold up to rust/corrosion . There is a notable seam and for some reason , one of the spigot holes is placed adjacent to the seam making it difficult to position when attempting to hide the seam . Compared to the Algreen 50 gal barrels , this feels more substantial and of an overall better quality . Note , it does not come with a drainage hose so plan accordingly.AppearanceThis is an attractive , very neutral color , rain barrel . The picture does n't show it as well but the entire outside is covered in a type of 'wave ' pattern which I think will likely collect dirt more readily than a flat/smooth surface . The lighter color is also more likely to show it than the terra cotta Algreen barrel . All in all , this is attractive but not as attractive as the Algreen . However , it will be easy to wash off and appearance is truly in the eye of the beholder.StabilityAs you can see from the product photo , the bottom is smaller than the top although not by a lot . We set this up on a few paver/walking stones for added stability ... more than ample . This is VERY heavy when filled with water so taking the time to reinforce it before allowing it to be filled is prudent.What You Will Need- Stable place for placement . When filled with water this will weigh well over 400 lbs so shifting sand/other could become a problem . We use a couple of large walking stones/pavers for support which is more than ample.- Hose . This does not come with a hose . We use remnants purchased here on Amazon.- Downspout drainage . This is designed for use with a downspout which fits over the built-in ( but removable ) grill screen .	1
I have n't set up this item yet , I 'm waiting for a new gutter in the spot I want it but the item is well made . I like the bonus planter on top . I do n't know that I would put a real plant in it though , it 's kind of shallow for that . I think it 's very attractive and will go with multiple types of exterior .	1
Living in an area that is frequently subject to drought and immediately suffering , I like to capture rain water ( when we actually get rain ) for watering the plants . This is an almost perfect barrel for my purposes.Having already used rain barrels , I see two signficant improvements in this new barrel . First , I like that the area on top of the barrel has a hole to keep the depression where you could have a plant from filling and holding water . In my old rain barrel , this depression became a serious area for mosquito breeding , but in my new barrel the area will stay dry and mosquitos will have to move along.Also , I like the fact that there are two spigots , one near the top of the barrel , one near the bottom , and increasing the ease with which I can get water out of the barrel.So what & # 8217 ; s with my judgement of & # 8216 ; almost perfect ? & # 8217 ; I do not care for the look of the barrel . It is called Sandstone , but rather than the pink to red color of real sandstone , this barrel is an unappealing gray . Patterned after the bark of a palm tree , it does nothing to enhance the look of my yard . In spite of this , I & # 8217 ; ll use this barrel to collect rain water and keep my plants from dying in the ongoing drought.Overall , this is a good barrel which will hold 50 gallons of water and keep things moist during the worst of summer heat . I am happy to recommend it to gardeners and preppers.Four Stars !	1
Like other reviewers I wavered between awarding this product three or four stars . I eventually settled on four stars because of the easy installation , nice included hardware , and the striking aesthetics , but I 'm still on the fence . This rain barrel is not without its flaws and quirks though . As a frame of reference , I have a Fiskar 's rain barrel , two barrels made by the county out of large , converted soda syrup containers , and one homemade contraption converted by me from a large trash can.The Good Ideas barrel is relatively light and easy to install . I like that it comes with two brass spigots that screw into two pre-threaded holes . To install the barrel I elevated it on cinder blocks to improve water flow . I also removed a segment of drain spout and replaced it with a piece of flexible , plastic drain . The bottom end of the plastic drain piece rests firmly atop the rain barrel so that water falls into the barrel through the piece of included screening.An alternate way to install the barrel is to use a diverter like the one I installed for my Fiskars barrel . Installation requires cutting the downspout , but the inverter is then permanently in place . When the barrel is filled to capacity , the diverter then sends water down the bottom part of the downspout in the usual way . A diverter can be purchased on the Good Ideas site.I do n't particularly like the planter design on the top of the rain barrel . There 's only one small hole for drainage to the front of the barrel . After a rain today I had to tilt the barrel forward to drain water from the plant cavity ; this would be impossible with a full rain barrel . If the top plant cavity fills with too much water , it will drain down the front of the barrel perhaps discoloring it . If you opt not to plant anything in the plant cavity , then some water will sit in it and perhaps attract mosquitoes.I 'm also not crazy about the design for accommodating overflow , a channel around the perimeter of the top diverting water to the front of the barrel so that it cascades down against the barrel . I would prefer a system that lets the overflow be directed away from the barrel and away from the house.Amazon requires Vine reviews to be posted within 30 days of receiving the product . I 'll need more time to satisfactorily evaluate this barrel , so may return and modify this review if circumstances warrant any changes or additions.UPDATE - After watching the rain barrel function during and after ten inches of rain , I 'm starting to warm up to it . The top cavity for plants works better than I thought it would . Some water remains after a rain , but it disappears within a day . I 've even bought some potting soil to plant flowers up there.The overflow design also works better than anticipated ; in fact the flow of water along the textured front is quite attractive . Also overflow does n't puddle in front of the barrel as I feared . Some leaves collected on the front of the barrel from the gutter overflow , but these were easily brushed off later .	1
Very impressed with the construction of this barrel , solid plastic and looks good . Better than the rest of my rain barrels.Two spigots , placed at 90 degrees away from each other ( so if one is facing front , the other will be facing to the side . The spigots were easy to install.The top has a plastic grid . It has been my experience that these eventually crack and break . You can replace them with ( I know this sound strange ) the plastic & # 8220 ; canvas & # 8221 ; that is sold for needlepointing.Having had rain barrels for years , I have a couple concerns about this one , which may or may not apply to your situation.Over time gunk tends to build up in them ( from being washed off the roof ) and they need to be rinsed out . This is going to be difficult with this design , since the only hole is the one designed for the water to go in and it is about 4 inches in diameter . There are screws over the mesh , so you would be able to dump it , but that is going to be harder than taking off a lid and cleaning it out . That said , our lids often come off our other rain barrels , leading animals desperate for a drink to a watery grave , which is not fun for either of us.I put dirt and flowers in the top indentation . Water can run out from the top . Good . But when the rain barrel filled up quickly , then water started pouring into the plants , leaving them floating and dirt all down the side . This is because there is no overflow valve , for which I am deducting a star . They state a & # 8220 ; built in overflow system & # 8221 ; which is basically a channel along the top where the water goes in that directs the excess to the front where in theory it would run down the front of the barrel . In practice , a solid rainstorm overwhelmed this system . I have three other kind of rain barrels , and they all have places to attach a hose at the top , so that you can & # 8220 ; daisy chain & # 8221 ; them together or direct the excess flow with a hose to some other point . And you can not even add a connector to this rainbarrel , since the texture means there is no flat spot to drill a hole to attach a faucet . I ended up drilling a hole and inserting a piece of wide flexible tubing , which dribbles but does help to direct the excess water into a second barrel . If you have not used a rain barrel before , you will be surprised by how quickly they fill with water.The directions also say you need to drain it when temperatures are below freezing . With my other barrels I have found that if they freeze , and are full , the lid just gets pushed off and the ice expands without cracking the barrel . If they are only part full , the ice just expands up and it is not a problem . I am not sure that this one , with that small hole , would withstand freezing.I waffled between three and four stars , since the overflow system is simply not well designed . But this is solid construction and I like having two spigots so I went with four stars .	1
I have been wanting a rain barrel for some time and was happy to see this attractive `` planter '' barrel become available . We have a remote corner of our yard that has some banana trees and a compost pile that impede the water spray from the sprinkler system . Thus , some new hedge plants were not getting water and died . Reworking the sprinklers would not be worth it because the banana trees are ever changing and so is the compost pile . I wanted to find a solution to the water problem before installing more hedge plants . There is a gutter downspout near this area so it was a snap to set up this rain barrel and give it a test run ! Assembly and set up of the rain barrel was easy and quick ( 10 minutes to get it out of the box and get the spigots installed ) . Next was cutting the aluminum gutter spout ( I made quick work of it with a jig saw ) and pushing the barrel into position . That 's it ! This intelligently designed barrel has a mesh filter screen on top to keep out debri . It has a planter space with its own drain hole so as not to drown whatever you put in it . It also has an overflow `` gutter '' of its own that will direct water away from the `` planter '' in the event your barrel fills to the top and can not hold anymore water . Lastly , the attractive design looks classy and `` fits in '' to our upscale home.I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend . Thanks for reading , I hope this review is helpful !	1
I decided to test this fertilizer on my mound system . It is very sandy , and has some bald spots . I setup the dispenser per the instructions , and it did not spread . I do n't know if it was a dead battery or another issue , but I found I could manually shake the fertilizer out pretty easily . I spread a pretty healthy dose on the bald spots . Grass started sprouting in about 2 weeks , and now at roughly the 4 week point it 's about 90 % full of grass . I ca n't complain with those results . So overall I 'm very happy with the fertilizer but dinged the product a star due to the defective spreader .	1
I love this thing . When I 've tried to work with fertilizer in the past I 've always worried about burning up patches of grass because I did n't have it spread properly . This spreader takes all the worry out of it by automatically spilling out what you need . All you have to do is walk around and the job is done . It 's reusable as well , which adds to the beauty of it . Definitely a good purchase that works .	1
I went with the `` Lawn Food '' version , not the `` Weed and Feed '' . My lawn is too small to bother with a push spreader but a little too big for the handheld spreaders with the crank , which I always found very annoying . It only takes a minute to set up ( pop the lid off and remove the protective seal ) and then you are up and running . Or walking . Just walk at a normal pace and the battery powered spreader does the rest . With a small lawn you can have it fertilized in a few minutes . To refill just pop the top back off and pour in a refill bag . I 've used a variety of fertilizer brands on my lawn and they all seem to do the job . So far this one seems just fine as well . The selling point is n't the fertilizer , it 's the easy application for small lawns . For that reason alone it 's worth the price . For larger lawns stick with a regular push spreader .	1
I love new technology and especially when it works . This Greenview Rady2Go Spreader is exactly that . But only after I applied some of the more basic electronic skills know to us humans . Before I get any further , please permit one caution : Read and Follow the enclosed ( under the back label ) INSTRUCTIONS . Intuition does not work or at least did not work well for me.Turn the container upside down after reading the instructions . Test the motor of the spreader to be sure it works satisfactorily . Mine did not ; however , this is where my electrical skills , huge overstatement , came in . My motor would not work not even after resetting the new batteries . I replaced Lebanon 's batteries with 4 AA new ones I keep for special ocassions such as this . It worked . I did not change the supply door to a smaller size which I highly recommend . After using the first application I closed the trap door to about size and it worked better and obviously used less product . Take the bottom off and then remove the paper disk . Replace the bottom and begin the short process of walking the yard while spraying the lawn food.I sent my push spreader to the home for aged spreaders and kept my hand turning little spreader for all applications . Now , the hand spreader has been relaged to the top shelf of the Hooisier Cabinet and out of the way.I do wish there were calibrators on the trap door so that I would know what 2,500 feet represents . Of course , that is a varible that is almost impossible to solve since the batteries will fade with time and use . Having the On/Off Switch on the back and bottom creates a minor problem for me when attempting to get the first amounts on the ground.When I finished my first application , I turned off the switch and waited for 2 days ( just love that rain ) , refilled the container with the extra bag , a trap door setting and all went well . With a few minor issues such as mentioned above , this tool is a 5 star product and I expect to continue using it or its replacement .	1
OK , who has n't laughed at the fridges that connect to the Internet . Seriously ? C'mon . So I had the opportunity to try out the GreenView spreader , which is battery powered ( and to share my disclaimer , I was able to try the product for free , but I have zero incentive to provide anything but an honest review ) .I opened up the package , figured out how to slide the bottom part , and opened up the tab that sealed off the fertilizer . Note that it does come with a full load , but you can easily refill the container . I spent a minute or two trying to get it to work , and no luck . Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked ; once I fixed that , I was up and running ! It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing . Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom , and a little motor whirs to life , doing a very nice and even spread . Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly . I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn ( average suburban size ) in about 5 minutes . This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott 's push-fertilizer ( and much less messy ) . And this product takes up less room than my old spreader ; just sits on the garage shelf . The battery life seems good . It uses four plain old AA batteries , so in future years I 'll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader ( or my small hand-cranked spreader ) offers . My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer , and others without enough , but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn . The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading , but I just had to give the handle one quick & # 34 ; heft & # 34 ; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line , I figured I would be laughing at the product , but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders . Thanks for reading !	1
This refillable container of GREENVIEW READY2GO SPREADER LAWN FOOD , with its battery-operated spreader attached at the bottom , is an extremely clever idea . As the label says , this is an excellent product for use on small lawns , or on grassy areas that require maneuverability around trees , benches , walkways , or similar common yard obstructions . To spread the fertilizer evenly and in the right amount , you simply turn the spreader on , and walk along in a strip pattern carrying the spreader by the top handle.This part was very easy , and I really liked being able to distribute the right amount without having to figure out how to apply a certain number of pounds of fertilizer per square foot . ( If you prefer doing it the old-fashioned way , this product calls for 3.2 lbs . per 1000 sq . ft. ) This fertilizer is 22-0-4 ( nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium ) . In my experience , fertilizers are pretty much the same , so I 'm expecting my lawn to green up ( 22 % nitrogen ) and have some protection against drought and disease ( 4 % potassium ) . There 's no phosphorus in this fertilizer , because phosphorus helps with flower production.The hard part for me , was figuring out how to open the battery-operated spreader part -- which must be opened to remove the seal that keeps the fertilizer contents fresh , and to remove a strip that prevents the included batteries from going dead . To open the spreader , you turn the container upside down , then turn only the UPPER part of the green spreader to open it . There are a couple of tabs at one end that need to be disengaged before the spreader will open -- these made the spreader very difficult for me to open , every time I needed to.When you close the spreader , make very sure that you 've fully engaged those pesky little tabs again ! I did n't , and when I carried the container to my lawn , it came open and dumped the entire contents on my sidewalk . It was a pain to clean up , but not a major disaster , because I was able to pour most of the spilled lawn food back into the container . Even when it 's reassembled correctly , the spreader tends to leak some bits of lawn food , so expect it to be a little messy.The refillable container and any unused lawn food can be stored in a cool , dry place . The compact square container takes up hardly any space , compared to even a hand-held spreader ( for example , Scotts 71030 Easy Hand-Held Spreader ) .WARNINGS include : Use only when grass is actively growing.Do not apply by hand.Do not apply to wet grass.Do not apply during periods of drought.Water lawn thoroughly after applying.Do not apply near water , storm drains or drainage ditches ; do not apply if heavy rain is expected ; sweep any product that lands on the driveway , sidewalk , or street back onto your lawn.Keep out of reach of children.Use protective eyewear when using battery powered spreader.Because the battery-operated spreader portion was so hard to open , I rate this product at 4 stars ( `` I like it '' on the official Amazon scale ) .	1
i enjoyed using this spreader and lawn food combination on my front yard . i followed the instructions and was very careful to do it right the first time . after the application i turned on the sprinklers and gave my starving and thirsty lawn some relief . a week later i can see an entirely different looking front lawn of bahia grass . it looks very healthy now . it truly did work great for me .	1
It took me a few minutes of tinkering to figure out how to get the spreader operational . The instructions were a little hard for me to comprehend and some of the pieces were difficult to move . Basically , you are twisting the bottom of the container and it pops off . It feels like you are breaking it , but you are not . Once I was able to get the container open and the battery installed , it was really easy to use . If you look at the picture , the yellow thing on the bottom is the on off switch and the fertilizer comes out the bottom front . It was very easy to use . I have a very complex yard with a variety of landscaping . I wanted to apply this only to the grassy areas and had no problem limiting it to those areas and avoiding the flowers and shrubs that I wanted to use a different mix on . As I said in the summary , this particular mix is very high nitrogen and almost nothing else . Depending on what your lawn needs , this might or might not be a good solution . However , the package is designed so you can use it over and over with whatever fertilizer you want to use . For this , I give it 4 stars !	1
My lawn has reached an attractive , dark green color after applying this fertilizer . However , few ( if any ) weeds were controlled . I suspect this product works well in the Spring when vulnerable young weed seedlings are trying to sprout , but not as well on adult weeds.I guess pull the current generation of adult weeds by hand , and use this product to prevent future generations !	1
Expect this to leak/spill some . It is made from inexpensive plastic that does not fit tightly . The seal had come off before it had arrived in the mail . It is functional and getting it started was easy enough . Just twist off the large bottom piece and open the battery compartment and install batteries.Refill by pouring more into the container . Twist the bottom piece back on . Just flip the switch and walk and swing back and forth.This thing uses a fan to force air which gets granules added to it giving a basic small spray area . If you want a very precise delivery , this may not be for you . I like it . Walking with this it is easy to spread 4 feet side to side . It 's lightweight and does n't take much effort to swing side to side . It 's already calibrated so you do n't have to adjust any settings . Doing the front yard 20 feet by 20 feet took about 10 minutes.GreenView fertilizers that do not contain weed control herbicides should be applied to dry grass just before rain . The fertilizer will need to be rained in or watered in to be effective . Then you can mow after the fertilizer has been watered/rained in . Any extra fertilizer you have can be stored in a dry place and reused again for later .	1
Man this made my lawn as dark green as I 've ever saw it and I put down new seed also to over seed what is there now and those seeds popped up and the bare patch I made to fix a sprinkler leak is totally covered up to the surrounding existing lawn .. all less then a month is very cool weather here in the N.E	1
I had a little trouble with this at first , the batteries that were included were dead but no big deal just pull off the bottom from the container and easy to change . I then found it was n't flushing the lawn flood granules out correctly so had to turn the mechanism.Once I did this then everything was fine and it is quite a novel idea . Basically you pull out the yellow lever to spread the lawn food and push it back in to stop . If you get a clump of lawn food and it sticks then give it a shake . You might also have to do this when it is getting low.As far as the lawn food effect on the garden , it seems to have improved and instead of getting scrappy looking grass there is some consistency there . I also used this same spreader for putting 'moss out ' in and for some grass seed and it worked well so the spreader would be useful for anything which is like small granules.So conclusion the actual lawn food product is excellent , the spreader is a great idea and you can use it for other things so good buy overall .	1
The GreenView Ready2Go spreader certainly beats hauling out a rotary or drop spreader , pouring fertilizer in the hopper , pushing it around the yard and then putting the excess back in the bag . It essentially blows a pre-calibrated amount of fertilizer in front of you , with a fan . The spread is maybe a couple of feet forward and a cone-shaped pattern a foot or so wide . I found it necessary to wave the container back and forth as I was walking.When you get it , it looks as if the instructions are visible on the back label , but the real instructions are inside after you peel off the outer page . You first have to remove the bottom dispenser part , peel off a seal , and reinstall . The instructions say that you need to pull a tab that protects the batteries , but on the unit I received , there was no tab and the batteries had shaken loose during shipment and bent one of the terminal springs . So that was a few minutes of fussing with it to get the batteries back in place correctly.I noted that there was a plastic half-disc that rotated in the dispenser mechanism , seemingly unconnected to the on-off slider . It seemed to me that this could be used to regulate how fast the product dispensed , but the instructions were silent on that . Since GreenView claims it is pre-calibrated , and there 's no marking on this disc , I have no idea if I was really putting down the correct amount of fertilizer.One can refill the jug with whatever kind of granulated fertilizer you want , which is nice , and the batteries are standard AA and replaceable . For smaller yards such as mine , this is pretty handy .	1
My front lawn is separated into two sections by a sidewalk , and it has n't been fertilized in many years . I decided to apply this lawn food to one side of the lawn to see if it made a difference . I installed the batteries in the spreader and applied it as directed . It was easy to use , much easier than the old hand held spreader I used a long time ago . I took my time , gently swinging the spreader around me , and the food appeared to go on evenly . I watered my lawn and let it go . It 's been almost a full month since I applied the food , and I can definitely see a difference between the two sides of my lawn . It 's not a huge difference , but it is greener and looks healthier . My neighbors also noticed the difference . I feel confident that if I continue using this food , it will continue to look better . I 'll mark my calendar and update my review accordingly this fall .	1
This is excellent lawn food , greening up and helping our lawn thicken quite rapidly . As did many other reviewers , we had trouble with the built-in spreader and ended up using our regular hand spreader . The food worked fine with it . I 'd definitely consider buying the food again .	1
Pansies have unique needs because of their longer growing season . This particular fertilizer allows you to meet those needs , particularly by adding a good dose of calcium to the mix.Since I only had a small bed of pansies , I was glad to see that I could have used it in my vegetable garden , but chose to add the extra to my perennial plants instead . All are doing well .	1
GreenView GreenSmart Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer Pansy Food works well . Other reviews here have provided a breakdown of the specific fertilizer content , so I will not do that here . The bottom line is the GreenView blend is excellent for pansies and produces good results . The four pound bag covers about 150 square feet . The bag indicates that it provides up to 12 weeks of continuous feeding , but you may wish to reapply every 6 weeks or so .	1
I love pansies . These cheerful little flowers blossom before others in the beginning of spring and add fall color long after other blooms have faded . Formulated for these flowers , this fertilizer promises to keep pansies healthy , happy and vibrant all season long . The four pound bag is sufficient for application for 150. square feet with reapplication suggested every four to six weeks.Last year my pansies were far from optimal . They seem to suffer most during the summer becoming spindly and some of their vibrancy . However , I did not treat them with anything . This year I applied this product to one bed and not to the second . While both are thriving , the bed with this product are larger and sturdier.. Time will tell as the warmer weather comes.If you love pansies , this seems like a good way to insure continued vigor . It is easy to use and seems to help . Recommended .	1
This is obviously going to be mainly for big fans of pansies . People who plant a wide variety of things will probably end up wanting a multi-purpose fertilizer instead . That said , this is really good if pansies are what you 're growing . I looked it over and tried it out a bit and it seems to be very well tuned to what that particular flower usually needs some extra of !	1
My step father used to own a very large nursery in Colorado . He is a horticulturist by training and has many , many years experience . So when showed him this for input , he was very pleased . He looked at it and whatever he was looking at , he said this is a good one for more than just pansies . He said this was a great price as well ( I have n't ever purchased before , so I trust him ) I will update if the flowers do n't thrive . But from the guy I goto for all of my planting and growing questions , this gets a big green thumbs up ... . ( he has very big green thumbs )	1
The chemical mixture of this fertilizer allows for most acid-loving plants to flourish . This includes cool-growing flowers and vegetables that thrive in the shade of the desert Southwest or the normal climate of the Great Lakes area . I just sprinkle this in the soil in my garden , water in the early morning , and manage any pests that I see . Add this to any compost in the soil and you should see positive results.The granules do not clump nor cause any abrasions nor smell when in contact with skin .	1
The ingredient list is highly tailored to pansies . Pansies have unique needs as they are fantastic for fall landscapes , come in many colors and varieties , and are a highly adaptable annual.The nitrogen mix is probably ideal for pansies , which need nitrogen throughout the year including winter . The iron percentage , 1 % , is correct . Pansies also need manganese and potassium carbonate is good for them - all listed and guaranteed ingredients.One recommendation is to get the soil tested . Pansies do best in pH 5.4 to 5.8 .	1
This plant food comes in a 4 pound bag and covers roughly 150 square feet . A single application is goof for about 12 weeks of feeding so it will last through the entire summer . It does n't take a lot of this plant food unless you have a crazy amount of Pansies . This bag will easily last me the entire year . This plant food is 10 % Nitrogen , 7 % Potash and 7 % Phosphate . It also has 5 % Calcium , 2 % Sulfur , 1 % Iron and .3 % Manganese . It 's specifically designed for the needs of Pansies and will give you the best results . However you can use it with other plants as well with good results.The cost for this bag of plant food is similar to others that I would find plus it 's specific Pansy flowers . So at the present time this is my first choice for my Pansies .	1
This Greenview plant food is specifically formulated for Pansies but you can use it for other flowers as well that require similar fertilization.It contains : Nitrogen 10 % Phosphate 7 % Potash 7 % Calcium 5 % Sulfur 2.5 % Iron 1 % Manganese .3 % It is a nice mix that adds a good amount of Nitrogen , phosphate , potash and calcium to your soil.It does n't take a lot of product to work so the 4 pound bag should last for awhile .	1
I did n't have any pansies yet so I bought a large tray of them and used this . It takes such a tiny , tiny amount and they looked droopy when I bought them and the next day after using this they were all strong and full flowers . They looked like totally new plants . I tried them on my Fern Peonies too as they come along so slowly and they even boosted the growth on them and was noticeable just over night . Looks like it is good for other flowers as well . I suggest you just give it a try on whatever you have to see if it boosts their growth and helps them look stronger . Nothing to lose by it and it certainly did n't hurt anything . The bag is resealable and a good thing because it does have a strong odor to it , nothing that would knock you back but not exactly pleasant either .	1
I have one small flower bed I usually plant a lot of annuals in and although this fertilizer is a bit on the pricey side , one small bag should suffice for the season . One thing you need to keep in mind , is that you can & # 8217 ; t use this fertilizer in any bed you plan on growing any organic foods in.No plant person here so if I & # 8217 ; m gong to use a fertilizer , I tend to head toward plant specific fertilizers . For me , this takes the guesswork out of having to figure out what to feed them . For me , food plants are much easier , but flowering plants I don & # 8217 ; t know enough about them to make a fertilizer call .

I needed some fertilizer for my tomato plants and this pansy food contains ingredients that my tomato plants need . Primarily , the nitrogen is needed for new tissue . The phosphate in the pansy food contains phosphorus which is needed to stimulate root growth . The potash , or potassium , improves the vigor of the plants . Sulfur and manganese are among the other ingredients that are beneficial to tomato plant growth . So , although this product is labeled & # 34 ; Pansy Food & # 34 ; it contains ingredients that are helpful to other types of plants as well . My tomato plants are thriving after I treated them with this fertilizer.I plant pansy seed in October which is the time to do so in this neck of the woods . I will be using this fertilizer at that time as well . Yes , it is quite pricey but when the results are satisfactory then price is not quite that a big a factor . Sometimes .	1
I have a large barrel planter which I filled with a variety of plants , one being pansies . To be a more accurate review I should have made just a pansy specific pot , but I think I can still confidently say that this is a good fertilizer . This barrel gets a lot of sun and some years the plants struggle to thrive . After a month , my plants are looking better than when I planted them , and not just the pansies . This fertilizer is very fine so it was extremely easy to work into the soil and to essentially blend in .	1
This is a little pricey , but it does wonders with my Pansies . It comes in tiny pieces similar to coffee grounds that I worked into the top 2 inches of soil , and that was all it took . Quick easy to use and works great to feed for 3 months . Great flower booster and workded on my tomatoes also..	1
My parents used to have lovely pansies in their Colorado garden which would last well in to late autumn . The last few years the pansies they plant have not done as well and after a little research it seems it is probably because the soil no longer has enough nitrogen This GreenView GreenSmart Enhaced Efficeincy Fertilizer/Pansy Food has enough nitrogen ( in the form of nitrates ) to sustain the colorful pansy blossoms for many months even in colder weather . This should really perk up pansy beds .	1
For those unfamiliar with the chemistry of gardening , there are always numerous factors to consider when maintaining your plants , so here is a breakdown of what 's in the bag , what it means , and how it affects your pansies ( and your soil , or other plants ) .10-7-7What does that mean ? It means there is 10 % Nitrogen , 7 % Phosphorus , and 7 % Potassium , which is an optimal specific ratio for pansies . Other plants might require different ratios to encourage the proportion of nourishment going to the green parts like leaves , or to flowers , or to root development , to name a few.These ( 10-7-7 ) properties are optimal for foliage , rooting , and the setting of flower buds . The organic ingredients strengthen the plant and improve overall soil health.Keep in mind , however , that fertilizers are only one factor in ensuring your pansies ( or any other plant ) grow beautifully , and that you need to understand your environment.In terms of soil , here are some questions to ask : What kind is it ? What 's the PH ? What nutrients are present or lacking ? Other factors include the weather and rainfall . Pansies are ideal for cooler climates , for example.This fertilizer is easy to use , optimal for pansies , and contains organic ingredients that will nourish the soil not just for a short time , but in the long run as well .	1
Why do pansies need more Nitrogen ? Do n't blooming flowers need more Potassium ? I 'll answer that ! Pansies need more Nitrogen ( the first number in the three-number ratio ) because they grow and bloom in cold weather . When soil temps drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit , Nitrogen from Nitrates is necessary in a pansy 's diet . When it is cold out pansies can & # 34 ; digest & # 34 ; Nitrogen in the form of Nitrates easier than other forms of Nitrogen.By the time I received my bag of pansy food , it was getting a little late in the season for pansies , but I hurried and got an application onto the beds . I noticed an improvement in the bloom size and color vibrancy within a week and a half . The grains are uniform in size ( with no dust to blow away in the wind ) , some of them are slow release , and it was easy to work into the ground.I also liked that there were different application rates provided for beds , round pots and square pots : Now , that 's getting down to the nitty-gritty -- and left no questions in my mind as to the exact amount to use.If you have any left over , be forewarned that it is not suitable for use on consumable ( food production ) plants.This fertilizer contains organic fertilizer in addition to more usual & # 34 ; conventional & # 34 ; fertilizer material : Feather meal , meat and bone meal , kelp , diammonium phosphate , calcium nitrate , potassium sulfate , ferrous sulfate and manganese sulfate.It is not always easy to find fertilizer for blooming plants that contain Nitrate Nitrogen . This GreenView Pansy Food has 3.4 % of its 10 % Nitrogen in the form of Nitrate Nitrogen . And that is a good thing.During the warmer months -- beginning sometime in March , depending on where you live -- pansies can take on and thrive with less Nitrate Nitrogen and you can turn to a more balanced diet ( ratio ) of Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium , plus trace elements .	1
This review took a bit of time to write due to the need to test the results . I happened to have some hanging baskets in need of a bit of TLC since they were bought on the clearance rack at the local big box store . When this arrived I sprinkled some in , watered diligently for a few weeks and waited to see what would happen . Blooms all the way around ! In fact , not only did my somewhat dubious looking hanging baskets of flowers fill out with new leaves and begin to bloom profusely but a few unknown hitch hikers draped down the sides and started to bloom as well . Additionally , I like the green factor of a more 'natural ' type fertilizer even though this is only for flowers . Worked well in container/potted plants and resulted in significant leaf restoration as well as blooms .	1
So it 's pretty hard to write a review for fertilizer but I wanted to provide some feedback . This seems to do a good job , reading the bag it looks to be high in nitrogen , now I am not a fertilizer guy but what I can say is this . I know if you over fertilize you can burn your plants , under fertilize and nothing happens except you waste your money . What I can confirm is this fertilizer has not killed any of my plants that is has been placed around . I ca n't tell if it 's helping , but it certainly is n't hurting . If you need fertilizer there is no reason why you should n't try this .	1
This fertilizer is working quite nicely with my flowers , which is saying quite a bit as I have a tendency to kill plants . I was n't sure about getting a product with a nutrient blend so specific to just one type of flower because it it does seem rather narrow . However , in my case , at least , I realized that this was the ideal product because I do n't know what the heck I 'm doing in the garden , and I 'm intimidated by gardening advice that tells you to test your soil and all that . This product allows me to sort of plant it and forget it . It 's my kind of gardening .	1
I think this is a good value really - do n't make the mistake of comparing it to a water soluable food - this is the type of food that you put out and it works for about 12 weeks/3 months - this provides extended feeding - so 1 or 2 applications , depending where you are , might get you through the growing season.I 've used this in my soil mix to start pansies with , and they are doing great . The iron content helps the leaves stay nice and green , and they are growing much faster than when I 've not used it . ( I used Jungle Grow/Hyponex , instead of the more expensive potting soils that already have fertilizer in them to test this in my greenhouse- and this is really just as good . ) I 've also used this on pansy seedlings , in pansy seed starter mix , on full grown pansies , petunias , dianthus , and marigolds , and it really seems to encourage healthy plants and abundant , blooming . I saw an increase in blooms just a few days after application . I like to apply mine right before I know it will rain . Wait 2-3 days , boom- Flower bomb ! The extra nitrogen boost really helps keep flowers on the plants.I 've also used this on very young cucumber and tomato plants , and they both seemed to like it , with vigorous plant growth .	1
very good results and lasting up to 3 months ... dust free granules which are easy to work with and easy to apply . i have the most beautiful pansy bed i have ever grown . the list of ingredients that this product is derived from is very impressive too . for example feather meal meat and bone meal kelp and sulfates for their acidity . thank you .	1
This is impressive 10-7-7 fertilizer . It is very concentrated , so it covers a lot of soil , and it is in granules rather than dust , making it easy to spread without blowing away . Overall , just what I was hoping for .	1
COST EFFECTIVE AND LABOR SAVING NUTRIENT FOR THE PANSY FLOWER BED.Pansies are supposed to be annuals , maybe in some cases bi-annual . Johnny Jump Ups on the other hand are perennial ... ... ... ... ..Either way , they both seem to thrive on this food.Alaska is not the typical garden spot of the country ( ACTUALLY OUR GARDEN SUPPLY STORES DO A GREATER BUSINESS THAN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY- I 'VE HEARD OUR LOWE 'S HERE IS THE HIGHEST GROSSER IN THE PACIFIC/WESTERN STATES-SO , MAYBE ALASKANS ARE THE BIGGEST GARDENERS ) . Here , our pansies are behaving more like perennials . Maybe it 's 'cause the bed is sunny . Maybe it 's 'cause we made our own soil mix-including composted steer manure , azomite , and worm castings . Maybe the pansies try to thwart that big garden plunderer- The Moose ... .. Who knows ? ... ... ... .It 's been said that Alaska has a short growing season . When they do the calculations for our extended hours of daylight in the summer months , it just may be equivalent to -or greater than-many other statesWhatever the case , this is an easy to apply and well formulated nutrient mix for your flowers.UPDATE : AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER APPLYING ( TROWELED IN ) , THE PANSIES ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT NUTRIENT . THE PANSIES HAVE SPREAD , ARE ABUNDANT AND FLOURISHING . THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT THIS YEAR WAS THIS PANSY FOOD -DEFINITELY MADE A GREAT POSITIVE DIFFERENCE . THE BLOSSOMS ARE LARGER AND MORE VIVID IN COLOR- NOT PEAKED LOOKING AS IN PRIOR YEARS.I LOOK FORWARD TO RE-APPLYING THE PANSY FOOD AND SEEING THE RESULT . THIS IS A GENEROUS BAGFUL , SO THERE 'S A LOT TO GO AROUND.PROBABLY BEST TO GIVE THEM SOME MORE FOOD PRIOR TO THE ALASKAN WINTER -NO DOUBT WE 'LL HAVE GREATER ABUNDANCE NEXT SPRING . THESE PANSIES HAVE BEEN IN SINCE 2007 OR SO ( 7 YEARS ) AND GOING STRONG . THEIR MAIN THREAT SEEMS TO BE THE UBIQUITOUS DANDELION ( TOOTH OF THE LION- FRENCH ) WHICH LIKE EVERYTHING IN ALASKA SEEMS TO BE BIGGER . ( Today I dug out a dandelion with a root the size of a rutabaga ) .Yes , everything seems to be bigger-too bad the weeds benefit from the Midnight Sun , too . If flowers are well nourished they can hold their own against these leviathon weeds.if you like to garden , you 'd like to see the fruits of your labors . Soil-Science and nutrients make a huge difference ! Give this pansy food a try-it 's great !	1
Does everything that it claim . My flowers do really well with this fertilizer . The mixture is well thought out and works .	1
Pansies are heavy feeders . They are plants , as you probably know , that need a stead stream of nitrogen . And my problem in the past is that I start out well , giving the little transplants their food , but then I get distracted and do n't do the follow up feeding they need.This GreenView GreenSmart food will fix this problem . It gives plants a dose of nutrients it can use right away , and then it has a slow release component.As for odor , I thought it was mild . It smells like fertilizer but not stinky . It 's also not dusty . The texture is like grounds , not pellets , and it is easy to work into the soil.I 'm happy with it . Been feeding my pansies and azaleas with it . No signs of 'burn ' with the pansies . This is a nice fertilizer .	1
I never plant pansies at my house I have tried several times but they always seem to die too quick . But I plant geraniums and have never had a problem . So I decided to use this when I planted my geraniums in my front yard box ( although the weather has been crazy here so they are in the garage at night ) . Very good soil and fertilizer . I noticed a perk up of my plants within the first few days . The only downside of this product is the price which is a little high for the amount you get but it worked fine.Would use again if I had a few extra dollars .	1
The main differences between this and most other flower food is a higher level of nitrate nitrogen and a good dose of calcium.The nitrate nitrogen makes the fertilizer useful in prolonged cold weather ( below 45 degrees ) , when pansies are still active but wo n't take up ammoniacal nitrogen . Too much ammoniacal nitrogen may also cause spindly growth during warm weather , so this formula balances the two , with a little over half the immediately available nitrogen in the nitrate form . It also includes slow release nitrogen in the form of feather , meat and bone meal.Some problems with pansy greenhouse plants have been traced to calcium deficiency . Most soils already have enough , but some growth mediums ( i.e . the material the plants are typically grown and sold in ) , which rely on liquid fertilizers , do n't . Curiously , this product does n't include magnesium , which should also be present in soil in a certain balance with calcium to avoid boron deficiency , another particular issue with pansies.The guaranteed analysis for this 10-7-7 NPK product is 10 % total nitrogen ( N ) , including 3 % ammoniacal N , 3.4 % nitrate N , and 3.6 % insoluble N ; 7 % phosphate ( which gives the P number ) ; 7 % potash ( the K number ) ; 5 % calcium , 4.5 % of it soluble ; 2.5 % combined sulfur ; 1 % soluble iron ; 0.3 % soluble manganese.This 4-pound bag covers roughly 150 square feet at the recommended amount . Reapplication is recommended every 4-6 weeks.Application is easy , the granules are heavy enough not to blow away before you can lightly work them into the soil and water them.By the way , this fertilizer *is* safe for food production ( contrary to what one review implies ) , but since it is n't organic , it is n't suitable for the production of *organic* food.The Lebanon in the manufacturer 's name comes from Lebanon , Pennsylvania .	1
The fertilizer is earth-toned and really looks like regular soil/sand mix . I like to put my fertilizer in one clump next to the plants and remove the clump at the end of the growing season . With this fertilizer , it 's difficult to distinguish it from the regular soil to remove it . Have to mark it with other means to remember where the fertilizer was applied .	1
My huge yard has the propensity to collect a ton of leaves during the fall . And , what one must do once they bag or garbage can these leaves is ... .. stomp with your foot to pound them down . If anybody who has pounded and stomped into a large garbage can , you risk falling.But attach this to the end of the rake , and you always have your & # 34 ; stomper & # 34 ; ! The bright orange & # 34 ; big foot & # 34 ; is sturdy plastic that attaches to the other end of the rake . When you need to stomp ... ..simply use the big foot ! .Excellent product , handy , sturdy , efficient ... ... Rizzo	1
I do n't bag my leaves as our lawn trimming and leaves go into large plastic trash containers . Still , I have the same goal of increasing the capacity of the container . The stomper definitely does the job . I 've always tamped down the leaves and grass with a scoop shovel . That 's always worked too but it 's obviously not an option if you 're using a bag and since the leaf stomper has more flat surface iit will compress a wider area than other tools . I like that I can secure the rake handle into the stomper using my foot to open and close the spring loader . One negative : I used a lot of force to really compress my leaves . Once done it was fairly difficult to remove the rake handle from the stomper . There is a small indent at the bottom of the stomper to hold the rake handle . The handle was jammed in there securely and I struggled to get it out . I was afraid I was going to break the plastic stomper . I did n't break it , though , and possibly if you 're stomping into a bag you 'll use less force and not have this problem . But the bottom line is the stomper works and is a useful tool to add to your garden implements . One other comment : the stomper comes in a rigid blister pack . It 's not the easiest packaging to open and requires a knife or scissors to remove the product . I would have preferred to see less packaging , i.e. , something that is easier to open and uses less materials .	1
This big orange plastic foot can be attached to a rake or broom handle . It works well in tamping down leaves in those big but awkward recycling bags . It also does an admirable job with papers and trash . A fringe benefit is that it attracts kids who think it is great fun to use . It is sturdier than I expected and would be great for using with lawn clippings as well as leaves . I do think the list price is a bit high and the packaging was a beast to undo . Still a fun way to squeeze in every last bit . Recommended .	1
This EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper is essentially a manual trash compactor . The user pounds the trash down with it , making more room in the trash bag . It can easily double the bag capacity for soft trash.It comes in two parts : a foot-operated spring-loaded sleeve for a handle ( not included ) and a `` stomper '' shaped like a foot . Assembly is easy - just snap the handle sleeve into the socket of the stomper and it is done . Except for the steel spring , the entire assembly is made of hard plastic , measuring approximately 9-1/8 inches tall , 10 inches long , and 5-5/16 inches wide . The spring-loaded handle sleeve will accept handles from 7/8 inch to 1-5/16 inches in diameter . I used an old broomstick as a handle . I also tried a one-inch PVC pipe . They fit well and stay secured due to the very strong spring . The foot-operated spring mechanism makes attaching and detaching this EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper a breeze . This stomper is really neat . I highly recommend it to Amazon shoppers .	1
Arrived in super flash time . Like another reviewer..Hard to open ( thick plastic package ) . Delivery time is always amazing with Amazon Prime . The leaf stamper is a 10 inch orange plastic foot.Your required to use you own pole , The pole slips in easily and locks with a lever at the base.I use paper bags , .The & # 34 ; Footdoes a great job of compactor..leaves and garden debris . A fun item . Especially if you children are around to help.Five stars Recommended	1
Every fall , we share our property with about a million leaves . Our town does n't have one of those leaf vacuums to pick up leaves at the curb but they do drive a truck around to pick up bags of autumn 's largess . That means we have to pick them up and get them to the street . We usual use a shovel and our hands to pack the bags but when I saw this & # 34 ; stomper & # 34 ; I pounced . What a clever idea . It attaches easily to the end of our rake and does a good job compressing / packing the leaves so we actually use fewer bags . That 's both an economical issue and a practical one . Obviously , the fewer bags you use , the less you have to spend buying them plus , the fewer bags you pile up at the curb , the less work you have to do hauling them to the street . Throw in that dozens of bags in front of the house is unsightly so the fewer bags out there the better.Overall , it does exactly what it says it will do and the humorous shape of the stomper ( a foot ) is just plain fun.We like it - recommended if you have to bag leaves .	1
Our yard waste goes into a large plastic container that is collected via a service , but only every two weeks . Therefore , we 're always looking to maximize the amount of waste into the bin . We 've had a stick with several ends that we 've used but found this to be a lot more helpful . It fits very securely on a rake handle - so securely that removing it is a bit difficult ! Minus one for the difficulty of opening the package - it took about 5 minutes of cutting with scissors to open it and get it out . If you have limited physical ability ( which is one reason you might want to use a stomper ) , it 's too hard to get out of the package . I also wished it was slightly wider . Overall , though , I am happy with this item and would happily recommend it .	1
This is kind of a fun metal foot shaped thing that helps compact the leaves into a bag or trash can when raking them up . I usually use my hands and so when I saw this product , I thought it might be perfect to help with raking . It 's a good invention and works well , although I would n't consider it a & # 34 ; must have & # 34 ; . I am still rating it 5 stars since it is good quality , fairly heavy ( which is a good thing ) and seems like it will last a while.The tool attaches to the end of a rake or you can just get an unused broom handle and put it on there if you have multiple people working on the yard at once . The bright color and fun shape helps make raking appear to be fun to kids , so that 's always a plus as well .	1
I maintain the yard myself . This EZ Lawn and Garden Leave Stomper is a good addition to my collections of garden tools.I have been compacting my garden waste with various awkward ways , like using shovel or using my hands ... etc . I am very happy to find this garden tool . This stomper is very useful when pushing the leaves down in the bag . It can be easily attached to a rake or broom handle . I only wish if this stomper can have a larger surface so that I can stomp more leaves.All in all , this is a useful garden tool , though the price is a little bit on the high side .	1
Awesome product.It arrived just in time for a major yard cleanup as we had just had a nifty autumn windstorm and the 50 gazillion leaves on our trees ( we back up to woods ) all fell at one time . When they fall in the normal way the gods intended - over a few weeks , gently , in a nice even layer - they can be mulched by the mower . But this year , those buggers held onto their trees with all their little might while the cold weather got closer and closer and my poor hub cursed them for holding out on him . Finally , he had to winterize the mower.Five days later , the mother of all Fall wind storms rolled in and - Whomp ! - leavage.So we got out the rakes and called the kids to come over and help ( I promised chicken and dumplings for dinner afterwards . ) The raking actually went pretty fast , but we had some HUGE piles of leaves . They set about bagging them and this cool tool really helped ! We filled 9 bags which would have been maybe 15 without our & # 34 ; leaf foot & # 34 ; ... well , the kids and the hub filled 9 bags while I made dinner and played with the grands . Rank has its privileges.Bottom line is , this leaf packer-downer worked like a charm and no one had to use their hands and get covered with dirt and leaf schmutz . And when the leaves were packed and the bags lined up for the recycling truck , the grandson had quite a bit of fun making Bigfoot tracks in the soft soil next to the woods and we all got to help him & # 34 ; fool & # 34 ; his Mom into thinking that Bigfoot had walked through there . She was a good sport although we 're not sure she did n't really believe it .	1
I do n't bag my own leaves , however I do try to mulch and reduce down yard waste when possible so when I had the chance to try this out I did . It arrived last night and I was surprised at how heavy it was . The leaf stomper is built really well , very solid and I love that it is not another tool with a long handle I have to secure somewhere . Instead I can put it in my garden tool area and hang it on the wall and when needed pop it onto the end of my rake , +1 for that.I saw some other reviews mentioning that the design allows mud/dirt to cake in around the bottom and that is true . Thanks to the & # 34 ; foot print & # 34 ; design that can happen , however because of that same design it also acts like little knives as you push down on leaves . If this was totally flat like a cement tamper then leaves would be flattened but not & # 34 ; chopped & # 34 ; . So the design actually works well here , it would work better if you raked your leaves , put them in a bag and then used this purely in the bag to smash them down . BUT it also works well if you have a small pile somewhere and you just smash them on the ground , yes you may get some dirt caked on the bottom but a quick wash with the hose and problem solved.I like this tool , all to often you have to have special handles or attachments for things . I love the fact this works well with my existing tools , the solid construction and overall design of it . 4 stars , I am taking one star away , I do think this should be a little cheaper , at $ 9.99 it would be a great value , I think it should be closer to the $ 14.99 range instead of at the $ 19.99 range .	1
There are things that people like to have around , and the EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper is one of those things . It has a purpose , and it works.The quality of the rigid plastic is excellent . It comes in a clamshell packaging in two pieces , the main shaft and the foot . Once the shaft is pressed into the foot , it 's not going to come apart without some effort , though it 's not supposed to . Its durable construction will stand up to any leaves or trimmings for which it is used to stomp . The stomper shaft has a strong , spring-leveraged hard-rubber grip on the inside , which opens when the rubber-coated foot pedal is depressed , most appropriately by stepping on it , in order to insert whichever garden tool handle one has at the ready.I was out of leaves , but I did have several half-barrels filled with dead tomato plants , which were long overdue to go out for green waste pickup , so I used it on those . I have garden tools with either bare wood handles , or foam rubber grip coated handles , and I used each type to test my Leaf Stomper . I started with the foam rubber grip hoe , and because I noticed a slight bit of play while stomping , it gave me the idea to try the wood only handle in it , and it wobbled a bit , too . Having thought about it , I guess it does n't matter that it wobbled , it held in place like a champ , and it did everything it was supposed to do . It requires a diameter that will support what people might have on hand , so it was normal . This item works perfectly for what it is.If stomping leaves and trimmings were not enough , imagine the fun kids could have making footprints in the mud to pretend that there 's a Bigfoot on the loose . This ten-inch stomper foot is shorter than my own foot , yet it is most definitely wider . It will easily fit into smaller bags , and it works brilliantly in my green waste bin with enough surface not to poke through things ; it did n't pull anything up on its way out either.I 've had to climb a stepladder before to stomp on thorny lemon tree prunings , so I guess this really would have been nice to have back then . I do recommend the EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper for those who do their own yard maintenance . It 's engineered beautifully , from high-quality materials . This is a fine quality lawn care accessory , which is what my high marks reflect about the product .	1
I was looking for ways to make my leaf cleanup easier this year . I was going to buy an attachment that snaps onto the top of a garbage pail and hooks up to my leaf blower/vac so I can vacuum the leaves directly into bags . However , I realized how much more work it would be to lug the pail around with me as I vacuum the leaves.This season , I resorted to mowing the leaves and bagging them , using my foot to repeatedly stomp the volume down after each time I emptied the mower bag . I received this item in time for my last weekend of cleanup . It made the job so much easier . It did a great job of compacting the leaves so I did n't have to use my foot . I & # 8217 ; m looking forward to having an easier time next season thanks to this product.The only complaint I have is with the packaging . It was in a plastic clamshell that was difficult to open .	1
A leaf stomper that looks like a big orange foot does superbly just what it was designed to do : crunches down leaves so you use fewer bags to dispose of them.The thing really works . We managed to use a little more than half the normal amount of bags for yard cleanup . The stomper also has the advantage of not ripping or smashing bags when you try to use your own foot to accomplish the same task.Just a good idea that someone should 've thought of sooner ( now maybe they can think of it at half the price - $ 20 for this is a bit steep , hence the four stars . )	1
This is a great little helper when you 're out in the yard cleaning up leaves . It easily snaps into place and you just step on the foot pedal to insert your rake handle . It 's made very well , a heavy plastic and it has a good weight to it . It easily pushes down the leaves in your bag so you do n't have to get in there to do it yourself . This is a great way to avoid ticks and I will recommend this to many people just for that reason , especially those who live in heavy tick populated areas.Because this has a cute look to it , I think the kids will enjoy using this product and helping out in the yard as well . I love it !	1
The leaf stomper arrived encased in rigid plastic clamshell packaging that could not be opened without scissors , an annoyance who 's use I can understand in brick and mortar stores to prevent shoplifting but makes little sense for online products . This has no bearing on the function of the stomper , just a heads-up for those who suffer from 'wrap rage'.Once it was freed from the packaging the stomper is in two pieces that easily snap together . Put it on the ground , press the foot pedal , attach a broom handle - I had a broken one lying around - and it 's ready to go.The first thing I noticed was the size of the foot . It 's smaller than I expected and another couple of inches might make it even easier to compress the leaves.The product description states that it allows packing up to 4X more in a standard recycling bag - that may be true if you never attempted to pack down the leaves at all . I was already compressing the leaves so I saw no real change in volume but it does make the job much easier . Previously I would jump in the bag and stop the leaves with my feet . Probably not the safest thing to do once the bag gets over half full and begins to tip over with me trying to get out of it . I was happy to find a safe , alternative way to stomp that accomplished the same task.Overall , a nice little gadget to help with yard cleanup .	1
Shaped like a big paw , I feel a bit ridiculous stamping down my leaves.That said , it is much nicer that what I was doing before , using a five gallon bucket as my stomper .	1
Although made of plastic , the stomper has a sturdy feel and weight . The foot is ten inches long and provides a large enough stomping surface to compact leaves or other debris with as few possible movements while preserving maneuverability which would be hindered if the surface area was larger.It is winter but I still had leaves to rake ( don & # 8217 ; t judge ) fallen from a large elm tree located in a neighbor & # 8217 ; s yard . The tree is close to the fence separating our yards and each Fall , this variety is one of the last to drop its foliage , often not occurring until the end of November . This year after the bulk of raking was complete I let the elm tree debris slide . So , I had plenty to rake to test out the leaf stomper.Enough bending is necessary to bag the leaves , so I appreciate being able to stand , using the stomper to compress the leaves saving both trash bags , effort and my back . The pole which is not included , but virtually any yard tool handle will work , was easy to insert and remove via a foot pedal that opens and secures or releases the inserted handle . I also used the stomper to compress a large amount of packing paper that appeared to be in every package I received over the holidays .	1
This is an ingenious little device that attaches to the bottom of your rake ( or broom ) that allows you to smash and compress whatever you are raking up . Now I compost all my garden waste and I have learned that the more it is smashed , the faster it composts . And this stomper works great for that . I had a big dead branch fall from my tree and the wood was very fragile . In stead of standing there snapping each branch , I just went stomping thru my yard and made short work of the branches . Now they are all little pieces that will compost quickly over winter.Oh and another thing I noticed , when I lean the rake against the fence or a tree , the foot helps keep it standing there .	1
This is just what I needed . I can save on bags because the Stomper will push and crushed them down in the bag . Using less bags and lawn bags arent cheap . I found that it is easy to just attach to any rake , hoe , broom . Simple but durable . You will only need one yo last a lifetime . Great product and easy to use .	1
Properly using this gadget is a bit of a workout for this 80 year old , but my fifty five year old son is more capable of using it . Indeed , this does the job of getting twice , at least , the amount of leaves into a bag . Anything that helps lessening the autumn chore of yard cleaning is indeed worth having . I do agree with the reviewer who fussed about the plastic packaging . That is indeed a pain to open up .	1
Phew . Barely got out to test The Foot before the snow came and hid the leaves I should have gotten raked up.What you get with the Leaf Stomper is a cute orange foot . It has a spring loaded lever that attaches it to a rod -- like a rake rod or a broom handle . So you obviously need to know that you 'll have to provide the rod.At first I was n't sure I was going to like the Stomper , but it was definitely useful -particularly to me . I happen to have allergies to leaf mold . It 's not usually so bad that I do n't rake , but it means that I wear gloves and that I like to reduce contact with the leaves.What I found with the Stomper is that I did n't have to hang my head over the leaf bag to crunch down the leaves by hand . I could stand up and compact them with the foot . The foot is n't huge , but it 's certainly bigger than my hands , and it fits into a variety of different sized bags.So , I 'm happy I received it . And I 'd suggest it to others who are sensitive to leaf mold .	1
We received the `` EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper , 10-Inch , Orange '' via the Vine Program to evaluate , and we found it to be very well-designed and functional , but not very reasonably priced . We recommend it , with the price caveat . Here are our findings in more detail : Pluses ( & # 9650 ; ) : & # 9650 ; Well-constructed orange plastic foot-shaped `` stomper '' & # 9650 ; Foot pedal activated attach/release system works well & # 9650 ; Attaches to most common rake & broom handles & # 9650 ; Saves space , bags and timeMinuses ( & # 9660 ; ) & # 9660 ; Price : It seems to us that $ 10 would be more reasonable , given what it is . A quick search online today shows it selling in the range of $ 15 to $ 30 on various websites ... today Amazon is selling it for $ 20 . We would not be buyers at these current price-points . If they were $ 10 , we might even buy a few more and give them as gifts.It might be worth mentioning , from an engineering POV , that the spines and extra air pockets designed into the molded shape appear to provide some added reinforcement and strength ; the downside is that wet debris can get clogged in them . Overall , we would say the tradeoff is worth it.Thanks for reading !	1
This is a fun way to stomp leaves . A round or square leaf stomper would be more practical but not as much fun.To use this you take any rake or broom handle and easily attach it to the universal attachment which then attaches to the foot shaped leaf stomper . It dose a decent job of pressing down leaves.I usually put leaves in round and square garbage cans ( I have both ) and then take them to my curb where my town collects them . Stomping the leaves made them more compact.Using a foot shaped tool is fun . Yet leaves did move when I stomped on them in the garbage can because the can is big . A larger round or square stomper would have worked better . Even if you put leaves in bag I would think a larger round or square design would better.That being said raking leaves is tedious work for me . Having a foot to stomp them allowed me to release some frustration that will only be resolved by cutting down a couple of my oak trees one of these days.This is a fun way of stomping leaves .	1
Since I got this in December , and live in Ohio , I have n't got to try this out on leaves yet but I have found it useful for a couple other things.The first thing I found it handy for was smashing down wrapping paper in trash bags . That kind of stuff usually takes up a ton of room and requires several trash bags . This probably cuts the amount of trash bags required in half . That can be especially helpful when you have a large family Christmas at your house.Another use that I 've found for it is to smash down snow in order for my little chihuahua to be able to go outside when the snow is too deep for her . Wish this I can clear out a small area for her to be able to do her business.From using it for these 2 things , I can tell it 'll be very helpful for smashing leaves . This will be very handy and it wo n't take too long for it to pay for itself in the savings that you get from using less bags.I find the Stomper itself to be a very great quality . It 's nice and thick and a pretty decent size . My only complaint would be that it does n't have a handle of it 's own . I wish I did n't have to attach it to another tool in order to use it . I have n't really had any problems attaching it but I just think it would be more helpful.I like this product and I would recommend it .	1
One of my jobs is having to compact the garden debris in our lawn bags . It 's difficult and not always pleasant , and when we 're pruning the roses , it 's downright dangerous . But the EZ Stomper makes quick work of all that shoving and compacting without me ever having to touch big , dangerous , homicidal thorns.It 's a simple design , a little whimsical , which is always a plus . What 's not to like ? Oh wait , the price . Yeah , the price is kind of a sticking point . I do n't think it 's worth $ 20 . $ 10 and I 'd say , & # 34 ; Great , perfect ! & # 34 ; but $ 20 seems to be a bit excessive for a big plastic foot that you stick on the top of your rake.So yeah , I 'm glad I have one , but would I pay $ 20 for it ? I do n't think so .	1
I have tried other kink resistant hoses in the past and was disappointed . Most of them did not kink , mostly because they were very heavy and thick . I was looking for a hose that was kink resistant but was still easy to get back into my hose reel . The Scotts MaxFlex really fit the bill.The first thing you notice is how light this hose is . It weighs in at a little under 7.5 pounds . I couldn & # 8217 ; t wait to try it out . Being that I live in western NY , that means washing the car in 35F ! I wasn & # 8217 ; t able to test the Lay-Flat technology feature of the hose because it says in the directions that the temperature should be above 70F . Guess I will have to edit the review for this one & # 8230 ; .maybe sometime in May if I & # 8217 ; m lucky ! The coupler looks and feels like brass and turns very easily . I was able to connect it to my hose reel without the need for pliers . It threaded very easily and with the enclosed washer I had no leaks ! The hose did not kink once while I was washing my car and I even ran it over with my car a couple of times to test the durability . No problems at all . There is also a reinforcement cuff that Scotts calls & # 8220 ; Hose Armor & # 8221 ; to prevent kinking at the spigot . This is a real nice touch and it works great.The hose is also drinking water safe . I will also have to test this again out on a much warmer day ! The hose also comes with Scotts limited lifetime warranty . This hose is a winner and worth the little extra money .	1
My house and yard are old , and we have the old fashioned spigots ( or hose bibs ? ) around the yard . These have always been terrible to use with newer hoses as the hose connection is always bigger in depth than the spigot , so I end up with bending and leaking . Also , it seems that the normal coupler is plastic.This has a heavy steel coupler that fits my old spigots quite well with no leaks . Easy to turn , and not likely to crack . It 's a much better connection.The other thing I liked is that you & # 34 ; can & # 34 ; officially drink from these hoses ... years ago it was discovered that normal hoses have lead and other problems in them and it was advised that people not drink from hoses ( so all those years as a kid drinking from the hose was actually living dangerously ! ) . That small detail makes me look to this as higher quality than other hoses . Otherwise , this is a good length , does n't seem to kink when I pull it around my raised planters , and feels strong . I will revise my review if it starts to kink up , otherwise , this is a winner !	1
So far I 'm VERY happy with this product . It lives up to the & # 34 ; Flex & # 34 ; name by rarely kinking . In fact , it tends to coil up a bit instead of kinking ; almost as if that is some kind of built-in kink-resistance.The fittings are top notch and leak free.The only draw back is it is far too stiff -- especially in colder weather . This makes winding it up for storage a bit of a pain .	1
I have a decent size lawn and yard . I usually use two hoses , one for the front , one for the back . I used to buy cheap department store hoses , but they usually didn & # 8217 ; t last and would kink a lot . The last time around I spent a bit more and got a better quality hose . I found it was thicker and more durable , but still kinked often - even though it was advertises as & # 8220 ; no kink. & # 8221 ; I have a lot of landscaping and as I wind around shrubs , flowers , rocks , trees , and paving , I almost always end up with a hose kinked , or stuck on something . Then I have to stop what I am trying to do , go back and free up the hose , etc.Enter the Scotts MaxFex . While it is still winter and my use of this hose has been limited , I have used it to wash the cars and flush a gutter.The hose measures 50 feet in length . The couplings appear to be brass ; they are marketed as being lead free . The entire hose is advertised as lead-free , which makes it & # 8220 ; drinking water safe. & # 8221 ; This is not an inexpensive hose . However , for the extra $ 10 or $ 20 you may spend , to me & # 8211 ; it is well worth it . The hose is clearly made very well . The couplings are heavy duty and the hose has a nice feel to it . You can see and feel that it is reinforced . It has what Scotts calls & # 8220 ; Lay Flat & # 8221 ; technology . Basically it tends to keep its shape , which helps it resist kinks . They refer to it as being & # 8220 ; kink resistant & # 8221 ; which I am fine with , as I hate to buy a & # 8220 ; kink free & # 8221 ; hoses that kink . At least here , they are telling you it should avoid kinks , but & # 8211 ; just about anything flexible can kink.I keep my hoses in storage containers made for that purpose ( decorative with a cylinder in the middle to wrap the hose around ) . Even with my decent hoses , I tend to have to fight and exert some strength to roll the hose around and around into the container . Yet with the MaxFlex , I found it recoiled quite nicely , allowing me to more easily roll it into the storage container.In the short time I have had it , this hose has demonstrated an ability to maintain shape , recoil very easily , and to avoid kinks . In fact , not a single kink yet & # 8211 ; again I have used it just 2 or 3 times.What has really pleased me is the way it keeps its shape and tends to continue to slide around things as you pull it , rather than become snagged on things . People often complain about a hose that kinks , but to me snagging on things is just as bad . I hate having to stop what I am doing , retrace my steps and go free up the hose from whatever it got caught on . So far , this hose has tended to slide freely around objects and hasn & # 8217 ; t snagged & # 8211 ; even once.I will update the review as I continue to use it.To me , this hose is well worth the extra cost versus an average hose . I am buying a second one for the yard.Scotts also backs it with a limited lifetime warranty .	1
This hose female end is the most effective I have ever seen , it works amazingly easy -- making it so nice to attach or remove ! Having the lay flat capability significantly reduces tripping hazards , much more important for my wife and I at this stage in our lives ! bogie	1
I & # 8217 ; m a master gardener with a yard filled with an expensive collection of unusual plants . We & # 8217 ; re talking about gardening as a passion . So , hoses are critical to maintaining my landscape.The MaxFlex does what it claims to do . It will lay flat on the grass . It does not kink . It does not leak . The included washers keep it tight . The sturdy , black coupling keeps it from bending at the tap . It feels sturdy.I like the & # 8220 ; drinking water safe & # 8221 ; quality , since I use this hose to add water to my pond , which contains fish and frogs . I haven & # 8217 ; t noticed any mold , but that would probably take a while to develop . Still , I don & # 8217 ; t expect it to develop mold , since the other claims seem to be valid.This hose comes with a & # 8220 ; limited lifetime warranty. & # 8221 ; This probably doesn & # 8217 ; t matter , since few people would take the trouble to mail back 6 inches of the hose , the couplings , the UPC bar code from the package , and the receipt . But , I think that the warranty is an indication that this is a quality product.Also , the hose is not ugly . It & # 8217 ; s a nice , deep green , rather than yellow , purple or a faded , pastel light green . Since I have to look at it every day that matters , too .	1
On Amazon , this hose is going for about 15 % cheaper than I can find it at my local hardware superstore ... plus it 's delivered right to your doorstep , without sales tax . Winning.I 'm using this to water some newly planted trees ( coconut palm and mulberry ) in my front yard and it allows for decent waterflow , has n't kinked yet , and is n't too bulky on the rack.If you 're looking for a solid all-duty hose , this one is a good deal for quality construction .	1
Garden hoses are one of those items every homeowner needs . But the problem with so many garden hoses on the market is that most of them are low in quality and can not be used without experiencing frustration . These garden hoses may not cost much , but they cause endless headaches and are ultimately not worth the savings.I have used my share of these lesser garden hoses and have found that cost cutting is not worth it . A good garden hose is worth the money and the Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose is one that everyone should consider . A full 50 feet in length , this hose is made to last and designed to resist some of the common problems associated with cheaper hoses.My favorite feature with this garden hose is that it doesn & # 8217 ; t kink . In fact , of all the issues associated with garden hoses , the tendency to kink is the most frustrating . This is what I was talking about when I said that cheaper hoses aren & # 8217 ; t worth the savings . Most all of these less expensive hoses kink and fold up continuously . You end up spending a good amount of time undoing the kinks to restore water flow . This Scott & # 8217 ; s hose doesn & # 8217 ; t kink . It is lined with a heavy duty vinyl covering that keeps the hose straight and the coating doesn & # 8217 ; t peel.Once you & # 8217 ; re finished with the Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose , it rolls up easily for storage , ready for future use . Yes , the price of this hose is a little steep , but it is definitely a quality product and for the headaches it prevents , the extra dollars are easily worth it .	1
Those of us who live in the subtropics give garden hoses a year-round workout . The results can be brutal -- splits or kinks that render a hose unusable , with the accompanying hassle and unfortunate wastage of sending it to the landfill after only a few years ' use.This sturdy hose has been coiled and uncoiled daily . It 's also been chased and chomped on at least once by a dog who enjoys helping water the yard and insists that she attack the water stream and then be watered herself as part of the process . Unfortunately , the hose also was inadvertently run over one morning when I forgot to coil it up , running late on the way to work.Happily , it has survived unscathed thus far.Although this hose spends the majority of its time attached to a hose bibb and coiled on a keeper , the other end never smells funky , which may be because of the bacteria and mold inhibitors mentioned in the product literature . This composition and the lead-free couplings put my mind at ease when my canine helper mounts her daily attack on the mysterious jets of water the hose puts out . Two paws and two thumbs up .	1
The first thing you notice about the hose are the heavy duty couplings , biggest I have ever seen on a garden hose and the large size contributes to ease of use , real easy to grab . & # 34 ; Unrolled & # 34 ; the hose to avoid kinks . Works great and practically rolls itself up . I guess the real test is how long it lasts , will update as necessary . Highly recommended heavy duty hose .	1
We have actually had some very nice days ( when all things are considered ) recently so I was able to take this hose out and actually use it.This is most certainly a well constructed hose and is equal to or better than several hoses I have been using here now and in the past . The connectors are extremely heavy-duty and the female connector is built so that you can get a wonderful grip so that attaching the hose is a snap.I found the hose to be very kink resistant and again , acted like a hose in this price range should act.I have and use a lot of hoses on our place and this one has the appearance of lasting a long , long time ; that is if I do not mow over it & # 8211 ; something I have done quite a few times in the past.All in all , as one reviewer has pointed out , you get what you pay for and I have found that spending a few extra dollars now will save me a fortune on down the road . This hose should last for quite a few years.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
This is a nice quality heavy-duty hose . Three features I appreciate ; the extra-large fitting on the faucet end makes it easier to attach and tighten to the faucet without resorting to a wrench . The rigid plastic sleeve at the faucet end to keep the hose from kinking at the faucet and the fact it is drinking water safe . I did extensive hose searching last summer and found that any hose certified drinking water safe will be right around the price range Amazon is selling this one for . Because the hose has thick walls it is resistant to kinking but I have yet to run across a hose that absolutely will not kink . I am using this one on a hose reel and it is easy to pull out and wind back up . I expect this hose will last quite some time .	1
The & # 34 ; Lay-Flat technology & # 34 ; is better described as the hose relaxing to flatten out on the ground . This seems to happen best when the hose is largely extended . The last remnants of the loops flatten out into meanders . If you are dragging the hose and there are still full coils , those coils seem to even out in both size and spacing , unlike many of my other hoses , and this may be a result of the hose & # 34 ; relaxing & # 34 ; into this state.Several of the other reviews here report that they had a problem with kinking . I have seen no evidence of situations that lead to that . It may be because I have been using the hose in warm weather ( mid-70s to low-80s ) . Or it may be my usage pattern . When I want to extend the hose to a set position , I do n't drag it , but carry and uncoil . When I am dragging a hose during watering , I am moving slowly , which gives the & # 34 ; Lay-Flat technology & # 34 ; time to balance out the coils and avoid the situations that I see leading to kinking with other hoses.When I am done using the hose , it has curled nicely -- it has memory of being curled , but little bias about the diameter ( I have done a medium and large diameter ) .The female hose connector is wonderfully large . I had no problem gripping it even with muddy hands.Experience : I have used ( deployed ) this hose about 6 times in the month I have had it ( I received the product in exchange for an honest , timely review ) . -- Douglas B. Moran	1
The Scotts MaxFlex hose is wonderful . I can not review all the features the hose is advertised as having due to the cold weather here ( and everywhere ) . I can tell you what I have learned this far.We used it the day after receiving it , and it came just in time to prevent what could have been a catastrophe . Our winter has been horrid , not unlike most of the USA . Our snowfall for the winter is double the normal amounts and it has piled high in our yard , driveway and walks coupled with sub-freezing temperatures . I believe it was almost a full month in our area where the temperature never got above 20 degrees or maybe it did get into the low 20's.Suddenly we had a couple of days of warmer weather coupled with thunderstorms that caused flooding conditions in our yard . With a driveway that slopes downward toward our house the melting snow and rain brought a cascade of water toward our garage door . There is a grating with a drain at the lower end of the driveway that normally handles any torrential rainfall without problems . This time it was overwhelmed.We have a submersible pump that we use for draining our hot tub when it is time to clean it and many hoses as well to use with it . Unfortunately , the hoses were stored in an outdoor shed which could not be reached due to a 3-4 foot high snow accumulation covering the yard . Plus , they are all 75 feet in length which causes a diminished flow rate when pumping . Hot tub maintenance is n't urgent so they worked fine for that purpose.The new Scotts MaxFlex was 50 feet long and it hooked up perfectly to the submersible pump . The hose instructions caution you to begin the hose initial setup in 70 degree + temperatures , and we could only partially do that . The indoor temperature where the hose was stored was in that temperature range , but outside it was about 35 degrees at the time . The female fitting coupling is brass not plastic and is larger than the normal coupling . It measures 1 1/2 '' in diameter , making it simple and easy to connect and disconnect . No tools needed to tighten or loosen and absolutely no leaks at the joint . Once we made the hose connection and turned on the pump the shorter length let the water fly out of the hose and it kept up with the massive melting with ease . We could pump the water out past the part of the driveway that slopes downward and out toward the storm sewers in the street.The hose did unroll easily , and did lay flat without kinks or curling , but the `` snap back '' feature was n't even tried . By the time the water flow had ceased , almost 2 1/2 hours , the hose was virtually frozen . Soft and pliable at the start it was quite rigid when we pulled it into the garage . We just dragged it in and put it anywhere we could so we were finally able to close the garage door and get out of the cold . We did not attempt to recoil it because of the coldness that night , but it remained unkinked as it laid on the floor . By the following morning it seemed it had attempted to recoil itself , but because it was all wrapped around chairs and benches in the garage that was not doable . We were able to manually recoil it without difficulty later that afternoon once it had warmed . There is a white or light yellow line about 1/8 '' wide running the length of the hose that I suppose is to let you know if the hose is twisted . We were only concerned with the urgency to remove the water as any flooding in the garage area would have continued into the recreation area of our home that is on the same level as the garage floor . I did not look to see if there was any twisting in the hose that day , but in the summer that would be a benefit if twisting would prevent the anti-kinking feature.My opinion , given the task it was given to perform , even though it may cost more than cheaper hoses , is that this is an extraordinary value for a garden hose . We always keep our hoses in a `` roll-up '' storage case and it always proves impossible to reroll the hose because it curls and kinks as it rewinds . This hose will never suffer those troubles.It is the best ! By the way , we can finally see bits of grass in our yard after weeks and weeks of constant snowfall . Of course , the weekend forecast is for up to an additional 13 '' of snow ! Has n't this been a wonderful winter ? ( I know this has nothing to do with a product review , but the need to complain is overpowering ! )	1
this hose is a very nice addition to my yard / garage . Very flexible and seems to be durable and the connectors have a pretty heavy anti-kink feature . They are not brass but seem to be gold / yellow anodized aluminum -- still seem to be heavy duty . If you like to wear gloves when using a hose like I do , you may find it easier to attach and detach it from the spigot than other hoses . It just seems to be a bit pricey to me ( $ 42 at the time of my writing this ) . I think you will probably get years of service out this hose with proper care , so it may be a good value to you .	1
This has a heavy duty female connector , a nice touch since the cheaper connectors wear out over time . The hose feels rather firm when you try to squeeze it . I 'm not into the yellow stripe on the hose , though , since I like to keep it camouflage when it is rolled up . My favorite hose is still the Gilmour Flexogen in 3/4 & # 34 ; or 1 & # 34 ; diameter , which makes a noticeable difference increasing the flow compared to the typical 5/8 & # 34 ; hose .	1
The true test of a hose is whether it remains durable and kink-free over time so I will update this review in the future.As of now , this hose appears to have a good build quality . The female connector has an impressively robust construction that is easy to grip . There is a nice rubber kink preventer . The entire hose feels very lightweight which is a good feature as long as the durability holds up .	1
Lots of bounce , no kinks whatsoever , massive brass fitting on the connection end and a nice brass fitting on the business end . Interesting iridescent green like a snake . I own ( from Amazon ) a 15 ' garden hose which is still in decent shape and a 100 ' red rubber garden hose which I like , but which is no where near the quality of this Scotts garden hose . The long red one kinked in several places when it was right out of the box and will kink if I do n't watch it . A 50 ' hose is all you really need . This looks like a good one for a chance . I have high hopes for it . Nothing says & # 34 ; satisfied suburban dweller & # 34 ; like a fresh , high-quality garden hose . If I had a hose bib out in front , I 'd hang it out there to impress the neighbors . It 's *that* nice .	1
Whoever thought there could be a perfect garden hose ? I did n't think I would ever sing praises to a garden hose , but here I am . As someone with not particularly strong hands or wrists , I really appreciate the design of the hose coupler . It is easy to grasp and I could turn it tightly enough not to leak without using pliers . A big thank you to whoever came up with this design . Another welcome feature is that the hose curls the way I want it to . I keep it in a large pot , so I want a larger circle of hose and not the tight ring it came in . It was so easy to place it neatly in the pot , and it willingly goes back into the new , looser curl . The hose it replaced wanted to curl tightly , even after years of use , so it was always tangled . I have four garden hoses , and this is by far my favorite . Eventually I 'll replace the other three with Scott 's MaxFlex - it is the best garden hose I 've ever owned.Added 5/6/2014 : I have learned that I need to carefully unwind this hose out of the pot . If I simply pull it out of the pot as I walk across the yard , it will kink in multiple places . It is still the best hose ( by far ) for curling into the pot , it lies flat and it never tangles , so I 'm not deducting stars for the kinks .	1
We use hoses to fill our lifestock tank . So we are using a hose on and off all day . I have tried just about every kind of hose . I was not expecting to be this impressed with this one.Even on below freezing days it has stayed kink free and flexible . One day was very cold and the water froze in the hose . But the couplings stayed tight and did n't leak . After the hose thawed out it was still fine . The hose had been chewed on , pulled through a sharp corner of the tank , dragged over barbed wire , and stepped on by fat cattle with sharp hooves . It is still fine . There is n't a mark on it.I plan to replace my other hoses with these .	1
We appreciated the opportunity to test this hose . The most important thing in a hose for me is that it does n't leak at the coupling to the faucet . This hose passes that test with flying colors , obviously a high quality hose.The second most important thing in a hose is that it does n't kink , and in this department the hose does n't perform as well . I was hoping that the lay flat technology that does make it a lot easier to coil the hose without it curling into a messy ball would keep the hose from kinking . No such luck . Nevertheless , the hose is definitely easier to manage than the hose it is replacing.Do I recommend the hose ? Absolutely . It is not a bargain hose , but you are n't getting bargain value either . That said , do not expect a true kink-free experience here . Within minutes of use , I found myself unkinking sections of hose .	1
I have four existing hoses in my house , all of varying dubious quality , inherited from the previous owner and all feature a combination of zero kink-resistance , leaks and questionable fittings . The MaxFlex is the Rolls Royce to the fleet of Skodas I have and trumps them all in every feature category - it 's not just kink resistant but completely kink proof . It coils and uncoils easy and has a heavy weight without being difficult to drag around . The fittings are high quality and do n't leak at all even with the mediocre faucets installed in my yard . I 'm so impressed with this hose I 'm going to replace the others in the next few weeks since it stands heads and shoulders above the others . It 's certainly not the cheapest hose you can buy but works so much better that I 'd strongly recommend shelling out the few extra bucks .	1
I was hoping to get a few car washes in with this hose in the time that I owned it , but Mother Nature did not cooperate . The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars . Regardless , I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F . Why am I mentioning this ? The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F . Despite being well below the recommended temperature , the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised . Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it , the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather , even after running cold water through it . It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other & # 8220 ; good & # 8221 ; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard , I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight . It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent . Prior to obtaining this hose , I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied . The female end of the hose is large and textured . This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot . I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses . The male end is just as easy . The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting . I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting , but the connection still leaked . I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting . In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those . Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer . For now , I am deducting a star for that reason . If it works better when it gets above 70F , I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $ 1 per foot on a garden hose , I would have thought they were out of their mind . I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $ 30 works just fine . However , after trying a quality hose like this one , I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow . I highly recommend this hose ! Fighting with stiff hoses that bunch up and kink every time tension is put on them will be a thing of the past !	1
I 'm thrilled that this hose does n't leak at the faucet connection , and that it took no effort to get it attached and leak-free -- which has always been challenging with cheaper hoses I 've bought . Although reviewers are calling this a medium-weight hose , it 's heavy for me ( a petite woman who 's used to the cheapest hoses I can find ) and puts a strain on my hose keeper.It does n't kink up at the faucet , but it 's not truly kink-free . It 's not bad , but it 's not perfect in that regard . However , it is a heavy-duty hose with a lot of other things going for it -- antimicrobial protection , lay-flat technology , ability to handle high pressure , etc . I expect this to last me for many years to come .	1
I had the chance to try this house out the other day , has the cold temps subside I started spreading grass seed and I historically have an & # 34 ; always kink & # 34 ; hose , it is advertised as never kinks but it always has a kink . So when I had the chance to hook this hose up I was interested to compare it to the one I had already.First impressions , this hose is heavy literally but built solid . Instantly you can tell the ends are quality as they are heavy duty connectors , they did n't skimp at all.When unrolling the hose it did n't want to roll out , it & # 34 ; remembered & # 34 ; it 's coiled position and I had a hard time putting the sprinkler where I wanted it because the hose kept coiling back up pulling the sprinkler . I finally turned the water on and after a few minutes of running water through it the hose straightened out.I really have no complaints over this hose except the price . I typically spent $ 20 on a hose , and like I said the ones I have used previously always kink so I do think this one is built better which would justify a higher cost , but at $ 33.99 it 's a bit more then I think it should cost . That being said it is a great hose and if the cost does n't chase you away then I would recommend you get it .	1
I am greatly annoyed by a constantly kinking hose or an inflexible hose . This hose promised to provide maximum kink resistance . Does it deliver ? Yes , mostly.Before this hose , I went to the Big Box Store and paid over 5 ten dollar bills for a premium hose . The result - after one year of use , it was leaking from the connector ( where it connects to the hose material ) , it kinks every time I use it and it has become stiff as a board . Its last act of defiance was developing a crack and leaking somewhere down the line.I almost wrote a bad review for this hose 2 days after I received it . When I first hooked it up , getting this hose to stay on my hose hanger was like wrestling with a boa constrictor . It wanted to go its own way and I could n't get it to stay where I wanted it when stretched out . So I stretched the hose out and let it stay fully extended for 2 days ... now it is very easy to manage.I am impressed that this hose is drinking water safe , probably because it is lead-free . I do n't drink from a hose but it is good to know it does not contain trace amounts of lead . I am also impressed by the connectors on this hose - top quality . I 'm willing to bet this thing will last a while.After a week of use , I find that this hose still kinks from time to time but mostly behaves . It is light years better than the one I had before . My only regret is not buying the 75 ' length .	1
I seem to go through quite a few garden hoses . At least a couple times per year one of my hoses seems to develop a tear and spray water everywhere ( usually in my face ) . One of my hoses even tore in half near the connection valve and it was less than one year old . Maybe it 's because I tend to buy $ 20 garden hoses at Home Depot.Well this Scotts MaxFlex garden hose retails at $ 45 and it 's definitely nicer than my $ 20 hoses . The hosing is more rugged , the valves are more rugged , the hose does n't kink that easily . A very nice hose - if I can get 1 years use out of it ( without getting sprayed in the face ) then it 's worth it for me to buy another one for $ 45 ( instead of 2 subpar $ 20 hoses ) . So overall , 5-stars from me in consideration of price/value thus far - if I have any quality issues I will update my review .	1
While this hose may seem exorbitant to some people , as a retired landscaper I understand the value of a good hose . The fittings on this are excellent . Well cast and sturdy . The hose itself is well made and will resist abrasion and kinking . Unfortunately it is below freezing here right now , so I ca n't take this out and test drive it , but I have every confidence that it will be well worth the expense . I have paid upwards of 50 dollars for the good Goodyear rubber hose and not been disappointed . The looks to be of the same quality . If you buy good hose to start with , do n't abuse it and do n't mow over it , you will be rewarded with years of use and less in the landfill .	1
This is a quality garden hose . It 's very thick/heavy & the fittings are sturdy . It 's even drinking water safe so you can use this to water pets , etc . The hose is made by Swan for Scotts . I have several Swan hoses that I 've used/owned for about 18 years . I do n't exactly baby my hoses so that is impressive . I expect this hose will hold up also . It is & # 34 ; kink resistant & # 34 ; but you will still be able to kink it if you do n't handle it properly . But this one is better than most . I 'll let you know by July if it 's still & # 34 ; kink free & # 34 ; . My experience has been that it takes a few months for the better & # 34 ; kink free & # 34 ; hoses to start kinking . : )	1
I am not able to test the hose as thoroughly as I would like because of the winter weather . I still have about 4 feet of snow in my back yard , so taking it outside at this time is impossible , unless I want to use it as a tow rope . I tried the hose in my basement in the utility sink . The hose is very well made ; rugged , but not extremely heavy . My favorite feature is the large coupling . It is easy to handle , and twist on and off ; what a nice feature . I look forward to bringing my new hose outside to give it a more thorough test , as soon as the weather improves . I 've always been a fan of Scott 's products , so I 'm not surprised this is a quality product . I don & # 8217 ; t think you & # 8217 ; d be disappointed in this hose .	1
My dad is the yard guy and I know he has never splurged on a hose of this quality , but once you have one , you wo n't go back to the cheapies . The anti-kinking feature is the most obvious plus . The oversized coupling is great and easy to handle . We would n't have thought about it when we were kids , but having it be lead-free is important for when the kids want to drink straight from the hose . It 's very heavy , which I now know is important . The lightweight , stiff hoses we used to have kinked up all the time and leaked by the end of the summer . This hose will last for years and years .	1
Great hose . It 's thick and supple , and it does n't kink or pinch . It has high quality brass fittings that have not leaked at all when I added a brass nozzle on the end . It has not leaked at all at my faucett end either.It has some weight to it , but it 's not hard for me to pull around . The label says it is drinking water quality.The first day , it seemed like it kept wanting to roll back up , which might be handy if you have it on a hose spool . I do n't though , so it worried me a bit , but then after it was out in the sun all day for a couple of days , that stopped and it 's behaving nicely like I want it to now . I used this hose to lay straight to my greenhouse because I will use it there more than once a day.It 's really nice to have a good quality hose . It 's one of those things that is easy to skimp on when you garden , but if you do , you will end up not enjoying gardening as much , and you 'll find you 'll have to keep buying cheap water hoses that will not work when you want them to , causing you to lose valuable time working running back and forth troubleshooting your hose . That 's why , IMO , it is worth it to just buy a good hose.Even with heavy use , and occasionally getting ran over by a car , a good hose like this should last a long time . We have one other like this that is on it 's 3rd year .	1
I get tired of replacing hoses when they wear or kink , but this hose is really excellent and I feel it will last for years and years . It is a heavy hose and has quality hardware at each end . I trust the Scotts brand , as well . This is a 50 foot hose , and I anticipate that I will also be buying the longer hose to reach all corners of my yard . Good job , Scotts !	1
This is a really nice 50 ft hose for our backyard . We use it at least every other day to water potted and hanging plants all around the yard and blast the pool deck sometimes too . It attaches well with the & # 34 ; hose armor & # 34 ; at the spigot and it does prevent the hose from kinking at that spot . It also attaches to the wind-up reel but we already have a little extension to enable any hose to work with it . We drag our hose across the yard and back so it is really nice that this hose coils back up easily.We have found that as we pull it/unwind it to use , that is does still kink but not as bad as cheaper hoses.The hose it really nice because it is heavy duty , light weight , has a good texture to it , is flexible and it winds up well . It has some sort of anti-bacteria and anti-mold element so that you/your kids can drink from it if needed . It says it has a burst strength of 500 psi so it should hold up with our pool deck cleaning . Good hose for around 40 bucks .	1
Scotts SMF58050CC MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose , 5/8-Inch by 50-Feet , GreenHere is what I can tell you : It is sturdy , heavy , and well-constructed . The fittings appear to be brass and and well made , unlike those on the cheaper hose I was using before . And It will still kink ( is there any hose that will not ? ) if you stretch it to the max , but the & # 34 ; Hose Armor & # 34 ; does at least keep the hose from kinking at the spigot . ( My old cheap hose without this armor also does not kink at the spigot . ) My water pressure is not close to 500 psi so I can not evaluate any claims about how strong the hose it.The true test will be how durable this hose and its components turn out to be once it bakes through a Georgia summer . So far , yes , this hose feels like an upgrade but not necessarily an essential one unless you need the better features this one offers .	1
If there is such a thing as a `` luxury garden hose '' , this SCOTTS MAXFLEX PREMIUM HEAVY DUTY GARDEN HOSE is it ! What I like best is the heavy brass coupling that attaches to the outdoor water spigot . My garden hoses always want to leak at the coupling , but this coupling is firm and tight.What I like least is the bright yellow stripe down the center of the bright green hose . The stripe is much more noticeable than you would expect from the product page photo , although it 's not all that hard to get used to.Unlike the cheap garden hoses that I 've been using , this hose is made of `` drinking water safe '' materials , and includes a `` bacteria/mold inhibitor '' to protect the hose . However , to keep the hose safe for drinking water , it needs to be drained when not in regular use . As the instructions say , `` Water left in a hose for extended periods of time may result in the formation of bacteria . `` This garden hose does NOT kink easily , and it 's easy to coil back onto the hose holder after use . To maximize the hose life , I always drain out some water after I turn off the spigot , because I use a `` control-top '' garden spray nozzle . Sunlight or cold can expand the water left inside , and cause the hose to burst or leak prematurely . The instructions recommend storing the hose indoors `` when not in use '' , which I think means during the winter months.The hose has a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship `` under normal , residential , non-commercial use , for the 'Warranty Period ' '' . Defective hoses will be exchanged for new ones of equal or better quality .	1
This garden hose is everything the promo promises . I have had it two weeks , and it is still winter here , so had to wait for a spring day to give it a test . First , notice it is 5/8 inch instead of the 1/2 that one might grab to save a few bucks . There is nothing skimpy about any feature : the fittings slide right onto the spigot , and the black rubber/silicone grip at the ends just makes the hose easy to control , besides relieving possible stress at the joint . It does coil nicely , and is not too heavy for its size . I do expect it will last a lifetime .	1
What I always look for in a water hose is that the outer walls are thick enough to take the abuse of being in the blistering sun for at least one full summer . The walls on this hose are very thick and I believe this will last a full summer , at least . I also look at the fittings to see if they are of high quality metal and these are . The fittings attached to my outdoor faucets with no problem , no leaks . The only downside is that this hose is a little heavy , even with no water , so if you 're looking for something lightweight , keep looking .	1
How do you improve on something as simple as a garden hose ? Well one thing is to include couplings that are easy to screw on and off . I waste more time trying to connect my hose than I do actually using it sometimes . And while no hose is truly & # 34 ; kink free & # 34 ; this is the best one I have seen so far . The hose armor protects the spigot end from kinking and from overzealous pulling . It is also drinking water sale for those hot days when only hose water will work .	1
This is the best hose I 've ever used/owned.Some details : -5/8 & # 34 ; x 50'-About 7 pounds-Reinforced vinyl covering-Lay-flat technology-500 psi-Bacteria & Mold inhibitorsI love this hose . And , to my surprise , the lay-flat technology works ... it lays flat ! And I did n't notice any kinking . Love that it is lighter than my previous hose as I will primarily be using it for gardening/car washing . I had no issues and it was n't difficult at all to roll it back onto the rack . Never thought I would be this excited about a hose ... but I am ! Highly recommend !	1
I `` KNOW '' hoses ! Having spent my entire life as a landscaper , the only people who handle hoses more than I do are firefighters ! The primary purpose of a hose is simple : deliver LIFE-SAVING water to plants . Yeah , you can fill a child 's swimming pool , wash your car , and clean the sidewalk but the main reason why garden hoses were invented was to deliver water from the spigot to your garden , without you becoming `` Jack & Jill went up the hill , to fetch a pain of water . `` That 's why I 'm CONSTANTLY confused as to the `` WHY ? '' people that spend $ 100 's and $ 1,000 's of dollars on their landscaping , will go the CHEAPEST ROUTE POSSIBLE , in regards to the most basic of garden equipment . WHY , people , WHY ? If you buy a GREAT quality hose ( and this is one of them ) , it can literally last you decades . If you truly care for it as a valuable piece of equipment , it can last you a lifetime . So , skip those 150 ' hoses that sell for $ 20 bucks that kink as soon as you unwrap them , blow their walls from the constant P.S.I . that is required to contain the water , and couplings so fragile , that one single accidental tug will break the seal , allowing water to leak everywhere.So , `` How Do You Know A Hose Is Worth The Money ? '' First , ask your landscaper ! See what THEY use ! If you do n't have a landscaper , go with quality brand names such as `` Swan '' and `` Gilmore '' . Although this hose is sold under the `` Scott 's '' brand name , it 's manufactured by SWAN , a hose company that I 've used for decades of hard/daily use.Start with the couplings that connect a hose to your spigot : Are they solid ? Are they brass ? Are they of substantial weight ? In this hose , the answer is `` Yes ! '' to all of these questions . The couplings are actually oversized , with a nice tooled `` grippy '' surface , making it easy to connect to your spigot.Then , a critical piece : DOES IT HAVE AN ATTACHED WASHER ! A 'washer ' is that little rubber 'thingy ' that seals the connection between hose and spigot ... .often times , when your hose is 'leaking ' at the spigot , it 's because you 've lost the washer . This is VERY easy to happen : when the hose has been attached to the spigot for a fair amount of time , when you unscrew it , often the washer will become 'stuck ' to the end of the spigot , then falls off , and you 've lost it for good . Be sure that you always check your hose for the washer , every time you take it off of the spigot . Now , in the online sale of this hose , the washer is INSIDE the coupling , where they always used to be placed . In stores , because of the high THEFT factor from people stealing them to replace lost ones at home , they are usually threaded through the cables that bind the hose together . NEVER BUY A HOSE THAT DOES N'T HAVE A WASHER ! Okay , you 've checked the coupling . You 've got a washer . Now what ? There should be a good 4 '' -5 '' area , directly under the coupling that has either a brass spring or hard rubber area , that keeps the hose rigid at the spigot , so the weight of the hose does n't kink immediately , cutting off your water supply . THIS hose has a very nice black rubber collar that is 4 '' in length , preventing all future kinks at the water source . Swan calls their collar `` Hose Armor '' ... cute . : DNow , as to the hose : IS IT HEAVY ? Weight is everything with a hose and a standard 5/8 '' hose that 's even 50 feet long , should weigh A LOT , even when bone dry . That weight equals the heft of the walls and reinforcement of the hose 's construction . The weight on this hose is substantial.Next , look at the walls of the hose : is there a pattern or waffling along the walls , indicating that they are reinforced . The walls are very reinforced on this hose , allowing it to hold the 40 p.s.i . ( 40 pounds per square inch of pressure ) that is standard from homes.Added bonuses to THIS hose include : 1 ) Drinking water safe , which is important if pets or kids or even landscapers are going to be quenching their thirst from this hose ! 2 ) An inhibitor against mold/bacteria has treated the hose . It does n't say `` where '' , I 'm guessing it 's the actual material . and 3 ) The brass coupling is LEAD-FREE , especially important for safe water delivery to you , your fish pond , your kids or pets.Two more notes : NEVER BUY MORE HOSE THAN YOU NEED 90 % OF THE TIME ! ! ! If you ONLY need 40 ' of hose 90 % of the time , then owning a 100-150 foot hose is Overkill to the Extreme ! Not only does that bulk of the hose get nasty that 's not constantly used , from being in soil , dirt and mud , but that 's the area that mold can build up in the hose , when not in use . Plus , the area not used is almost certain to ultimately kink , simply because it 's not being used and sitting in the same position for months/years will age it . If you only need an additional 25-50 feet of hose 2-3 times per year , then buy ANOTHER HOSE to hook up to the female end of the hose , and then detach it and hang it up to dry when not in use , then coil it up and attach the coils with cable ties.Second note : ALWAYS DRAIN AND BRING YOUR HOSE INDOORS FOR WINTER ! Nothing ages a hose more than being left outside , attached to your spigot . Not only can water freeze in the hose , driving it into the spigot and your home , but the ice expands and can rip a hole in the side of the hose . Drain the hose by removing it from the spigot , lay it flat on your lawn , then pick up an end and begin coiling it up , allowing the hose to dictate the direction it wants to be coiled . This makes it easy to store and also drains all the trapped water inside of it . Attach together with joined cable ties and you 've now Winterized your hose for the following year . And store your precious nozzle away from freezing , too . Just be sure to check that the nozzle 's washer is also inside the unit when you put it away.If you follow these steps about buying a QUALITY HOSE and how to STORE IT , you 'll be passing this along to your grandchildren !	1
I have had quite a few bad hoses , so this one was a very big improvement . The guard around the spigot end , aka the `` Hose Armor '' makes it a bit more difficult to attach the hose if you are using it with a hose reel . It is quite heavy and a bit awkward , but it rolls smoothly around the hose reel once you get it attached . I water my hanging plants every two days in mild weather , and usually daily once the summer gets here , so I use a hose on a regular basis . I tried extending this with one of my old hoses , and while there was n't any problem connecting the two , the old hose was very prone to kinking , which is a problem I have had with every hose I have tried except for the MaxFlex.Recommended , however , depending on the size of your yard , it might be economical to buy the 100 foot long version ( the product link is n't working for the 100 ft version , but try putting B00E1HXYG0 in the search bar and it will come up ) of this .	1
The Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose has several selling points:1 ) The lead-free couplings and bacteria and mold inhibitors making drinking from the hose safe . I can fill my dog 's outside water dish with confidence . And , better yet , my husband who insists on drinking from the garden hose is a bit safer too.2 ) At 7+ pounds it 's light enough to move around yet heavy duty enough to get the job done , and , I hope , to last out our hot summer sun.3 ) It 's fairly flexible ; we 've had fewer kinking problems than with our other hoses , but some twists seem inevitable.We 're in a warm enough clime to be planting a bit for spring , and so far , no problems from the hose . We 'll have to blame our gardening failures on the gardeners !	1
I have a love/hate relationship with hoses . I garden so I need good and dependable hoses to get the water to where I need it . However , even the best hose tends to fail me eventually . Kinks are my worst enemy , requiring me to stop what I am doing in order to walk back and unkink the hose . Connectors can also be problem . They can leak and even break which is extremely frustrating . When I got a chance to get the MaxFlex I was a little skeptical as I have had many other hoses fall me in the past.The first thing that I noticed was the very heavy-duty couplings . They seem almost over-sized and the spigot is reinforced with a plastic sleeve which Scotts calls & # 34 ; Hose Armor & # 34 ; . When I first received it I followed the directions and rolled it out and let it lay in the sun ( they suggest to do this when the temperature outside is a lease 70 degrees ) . The helps to made the hose more flexible after being stored and shipped in a coil.Once straightened out for a while the hose is pretty flexible but rigid enough keep from kinking . I have been using it for only a couple of weeks and , I my experience , it takes at least a year or two in order to tell whether a hose like this is worth the money . I will update this review later in the year and it meets up to it 's promises I will be happy to upgrade my rating to five stars .	1
Grilling steaks , hot dogs and whole chickens for the Game these were amazing . My husband was blow away at how comfortable they were to wear and he felt no heat on his hands . They also fit nicely , a lot of times gloves are either too big or too tight and these worked well . Thinking about getting another couple sets for our Dad 's for Fathers Day this year !	1
These gloves are amazing . I barbequed ribs in a foil pan the temperature was at 650 degrees when I opened the grill . I used my Mr . Grill gloves and was surprised that I felt no warmth from the pan.. Not like a pot holder , I felt absolutely no heat whatsoever . The next day I used them to remove a casserole out of the oven with no problem . Love these things .	1
Fantastic product . I can remove hot items from the oven or the grill without burning myself . I love these gloves .	1
These gloves worked perfectly as described . Did n't test them out on the grill yet , as there is still snow in PA . But , did try them out in the oven and was impressed how convenient they were to use . I did n't have to rush to find a spot on my counter for my very hot pan , as I used to when I used regular oven mitts . I also like that they are black , they 're easier to keep clean . The only thing I would change is to be able to select what size glove you would want to purchase . For a girl , these gloves are very large and the fingers are very long . But , these are made for men , although they were still a little big for my husband . Would love to see & # 34 ; Mrs. Grill & # 34 ; gloves which would be smaller and have them in pink !	1
Aside from these gloves being huge on me and a bit thick for holding things that are tiny or in need of using your actual finger tips , this product is very good and most importantly is works .	1
These gloves are ideal for grilling season ! They are large enough that they will fit even bigger hands . On my smaller hands , I like that they offer protection for well up over my wrists , especially near any open flames . They are very heavy and while I have not had them very long , I am confident that they will be around for a long time , as they are thick to the point that I can comfortably grab the hottest dishes and still have confidence that they will hold up . These are really well made . I received a sample product for free in exchange for an honest review but I was not compensated for the review in any way . Christina VanGinkel	1
Received these terrific gloves quickly and in perfect condition . Went quickly to my grill to give them a try and they werewonderful ... .Well made , effectively insulated and very easy to use . Will probably order two more sets , for my 2 son-in-laws , as they are a perfect Father 's Day gift .	1
I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review . I was not compensated for this review in any way . When I bake , I am forever hitting the top rack when I am reaching into the oven and always add a new burn now and then - hey - that hurts . I received these and decided the best test would be cookies . I actually was a little tired because we are in the process of getting ready to move , and I bumped that top rack a couple of times and no burns ! Excellent product . I was a little nervous the first time reaching for the cookie sheet but it was really nice to not have to grab a pot holder . Had a much better grip on the hot cookie sheet also ! Everyone should have these in their kitchen !	1
These Mr . Grill gloves are the best I have used for grilling , I can handle cast iron that is very hot and not feel any heat on my hands . The grippers that cover them also make them very safe to use with no slippage . Overall , spend your money on these and you will not regret it . I plan to use them for oven use also as the safety factor with not having to use pot holders is worth every penny .	1
I received this product free of charge from Mr . Grill and was not compensated in any way . This product is great and definitely works well for grills and ovens in preventing your hands from getting burned . I used them when I was pulling food out of the oven and did n't get my hands burned like I usually do so I was very happy with this product . It is great and I wish I would have known about it sooner . It would have saved me a lot of burns on my hands .	1
I bought these to avoid using hot pads for delicate work.Hotpads are great for simple gross movements.When you need dexterity and precision these gloves deliver.Now you do n't have to worry about the hot pads position since your hands are I the hotpads.I have used these for stovetop popcorn in a pan , roasts in the oven and that have been great . They fit well and are washable.I will use them on the grill this spring and I know they will perform well .	1
The gloves themselves are very good at resisting heat . The are made of strong material that reflects heat , however , they are one size fits all and for me , they were huge which made them rather clumsy . My husband was able to pull the gloves more taut and were easier for him to use . Although large in size , they do keep you protected from the heat of the grill and make it easier to handle the grilling process and transportation of the food to the table . They are also better than pot holders for baking . I can imagine they would be fantastic to use for outdoor campfire grilling . I received the gloves free and would definitely recommend them . I would suggest the company make a smaller size .	1
I received a sample product for free in exchange for an honest review but I was not compensated for the review in any way . This was an awesome product , it really was able to get under the skin but gentle enough not to pierce the skin . The only con was it was that it came a little tight so it was hard to to pull in the juices , so I had to work it for a bit to get it to loosen up . This works great and it was really easy to clean , can wait to use it again great for the kitchen !	1
We have a hot tub/spa attached to our pool and occasionally , especially after recent chemical additions , it will foam when you engage the jets and blowers . We had hoped this would help with that issue . Big mistake . Huge.Upon first use it did quickly dispense the foam , but it also , not quite as quickly , made the water cloudy and with an odd odor . It had an almost oily texture that left a ring on our wall tile . GROSS ! We ended up having to turn off the pool and pay someone to come out and drain the spa , because we did n't want this gross water polluting our entire pool . Disgusting and expensive.Our ( unattached ) water feature ( fountain ) also has some foaming issues , but , as this was n't listed as animal safe and as birds often drink from the fountain we did n't want to try it there . After our disastrous pool experience we are very glad we did n't .	-1
Well ... I must admit ... the product quickly dissipated the foam in our pool ... but it left an oily residue which resulted in a `` tub ring '' on our liner . We ended up having to clean the pool walls TWICE to eliminate the ring . And ... WARNING ... this product has an AWFUL odor . We decided the discard the remainder of the bottle . I do NOT recommend this product .	-1
I have tried a few different brands of antifoam and have n't really had any that could eliminate foam altogether . This product did noticeably reduce foam but as other stated it left a film around the sides . I personally would prefer a little foam over the scum line around the spa .	-1
I planted them in containers on my deck and watered them gently . Next day it rained and we had pleasant , sunny weather for several days and nothing ever grew ... I saw a spindly sprout appear in one of the four but it died and nothing has happened since so I 'm assuming it 's a loss . I 've NEVER had problems growing from seed before . I checked it daily to make sure all was well and not dried out.And also the term `` kit '' is a bit misleading . These are seeds in tiny starter pots that you plant somewhere , such as a container or in your garden.The kit is really very expensive . It would be less expensive to buy the seed starter cups and then buy the seeds and you would also know what type of tomato , etc. , that you are getting .	-1
I usually garden with starts , not seeds , so I thought these might be a good way to learn to love seeds , but I was so disappointed . While there is a nice variety , once I opened it up and read the directions , I was a bit aghast at how little food this kit makes , and how much packaging it uses . I think I pictures smaller pods -- more like little protective peat bullets -- and a lot more of them , 18 types , not 18 total ( so that 's my fault -- but that does n't make this product any less silly ) . These are little pointy peat pots , about the size of a tiny Dixie cup , filled with soilless mix and 2 seeds , with a peel off lid like a little tub of coffee creamer.I 'd give it 0 stars for me , but if you 're a city dweller with only a tiny sunny balcony and a few pots , or someone not concerned with actual yield who just wants a tidy , educational project for small kids , this might be a fun and cute way to grow a bitty bit of food . If you have any space at all , it makes no sense.Seriously , who plants one bush bean plant ? That 's one dinner . Ditto the lettuce and pepper.Even if your space is limited , if you want one of each plant , buy starts for the herbs and vegetables and a packet of bean seeds . You 'll spend about the same , get to pick more interesting varieties , and be that much closer to harvest and with no fussing over tender shoots , which can get knocked off by one hungry bug or especially hot or cold morning . Or if you love seeds , this price tag will get you a good 8-12 packets or more of seeds , giving you a full garden , and probably plenty to save for next year.Germination was n't spectacular , either . The cups did n't seem to hold any more moisture than just plain soil ( but I do have good , sheep poo-enriched soil ) , and did n't germinate any better than bare seeds . I do n't get the rave reviews , unless others are a lot richer and grow vegetables for novelty rather than the table.If this were an herbs-only kit , I *might* be able to see it , since that 's more where you 'll see spreading and a couple seeds going a long way . But one bean plant ? That 's just deranged .	-1
I thought this would be a fun idea to make a tiny winter garden indoors . We have a lovely warm sunny spot that is just perfect . So I got some nice planters and planted the seed pods . I read the directions and followed them carefully . I have actually gardened for years but this is the first time I have tried a ready made garden.Only 1/2 of my pods sprouted and one of the sprouted guys looks like he is not long for the world . So there are huge gaps in my planter but these little seedlings are n't exactly hardy enough to move . It is a very fun idea and might be a good way to introduce gardening to kids or adults that do n't have room for a full garden . But I have had much better luck just dropping seeds in the ground and hoping the birds do n't eat them .	-1
We could n't get these to work much at all . The idea is that the pod is a self-contained herb garden starter kit , including the seed and fertilizer in one . This seemed like a great idea , and as we have had limited success in the past with gardens , we were excited to try this . We had very limited success even after trying to follow the instructions for water , shade , and the appropriate zone ( we live in Phoenix , AZ and it is summer ) .Despite watering according to the recommended schedule , we had very little germination and those that did promptly died . I 'm no garden expert , but it seemed like everything just dried out . I wonder if I just needed more than the recommended watering due to the hot and dry climate in Arizona . But it seemed to me that the pod may have actually limited the amount of water that was able to be absorbed and kept in the soil around the seeds.Guess I really do n't have a green thumb . I 'll just keep going to the grocery store . Too bad , cause I was pretty excited about this .	-1
I 've done a little gardening in the past . Not much , but I 've grown a few things in a few square feet in my backyard . If you 've ever done the same , I 'd skip this product altogether and go straight for seeds or starts . They 're MUCH cheaper ( a single 99-cent seed packet might contain as many individual seeds as this entire kit ) , and you do n't need to buy a set of 13 different plants that you may or may not even like . While this kit does simplify a few steps , there 's nothing difficult about putting a seed in the ground . And while gardening is wonderful , I feel that kits like this just serve to distance people from the experience that much more . Add to that the questionability of the fertilizers added ( I prefer something a little more natural ) , the `` California wo n't let us sell this manufactured product there '' , a little `` only 94 % biodegradable '' ( what else is in there that WO N'T decompose in my soil ? ) , and the questionable safety record of the Scotts Miracle-Gro company ( they eventually admitted to poisoning bird seed they sold with pesticides highly toxic to birds ) . Not a recipe for success.Anyway , I 'd suggest starting with something less commercial . Maybe a packet of seeds ( or twenty , which will give you ~50 times the growing potential of this kit , and still likely be cheaper ) . Or a 4-pack of tomatoes for a couple bucks . Tomatoes are good .	-1
Miracle Gro really has a great idea here with the Gro-Ables Salad and Herb Garden . Each pod contains seed , growing mix , and plant food , so all you need to do is stick it in the ground and water . Each cup of dirt and seed is like a compostable K-Cup . However , you 're really paying a lot for the cost of `` semi-convenience '' here.Buying the starts for a globe tomato , cherry tomato , cucumber , pepper , basil , cilantro , and dill will probably set you back anywhere between $ 7-21 at a nursery , BUT you 'll be guaranteed a live plant that is a couple of weeks old . You 'll also get more varieties of some of the plants ( such as heirloom tomatoes like Yellow Jubilee , Black Krim , etc ) . Also , you can bypass buying plants you simple wo n't use . I personally have no use for dill or cilantro , and would rather grow a yellow variety of tomato instead of the cherry tomato.Some of the plants listed here simply need more than a single plant to do well/yield well . A single bush bean will not feed a single person , let alone a family . Five heads of lettuce wo n't last long either . That said , the bush bean , lettuce varieties , snap pea and spinach plants just do n't make sense to have as single plants . You 'd be better off spending the buck each to buy full packages of these seeds to plant yourself . You 'll be ahead of the game in case one of the seeds in the Miracle Gro batch does n't sprout . Offhand , the Miracle Grow pea I planted faired about as well as the full package of peas I planted in the garden.That said , yes , this set does offer an almost fail-proof method of growing your own food . If given the choice however , I would sooner purchase starts , or full packages of seeds instead of paying for the convenience of these seeds . You 'll have more variety , a good jump start with starters , and better luck with a seed in a cup of dirt - and if that seed should fail , at least you 'll have a package more to test with .	-1
These are individual pods of seeds . Each pod is to be a part of your herb and salad garden ; there 's dill , basil , tomato , peas , etc . Well , it 's cute in theory but nothing grew . I had a couple of the tomato seeds sprout but they died a short time later . I had thought you start them inside in these pods and then transplant outside but you 're suppose to plant the whole pod in the garden right from the start . The pods dry out quickly so you do have to water everyday . Once the seeds sprout you then pull out the extra seedlings leaving only one or two to let grow . It 's very difficult to pull seedlings out by the roots without disturbing the other seedlings since all the seeds were dropped right in the middle of the pod . Just go buy packets and do it yourself . This was toooo much trouble .	-1
The Miracle-Gro 170025 Gro-ables Salad and Herb Garden Kit reminds me of a cross between those chemistry sets we used to have as kids in the '60s and those Kuerig coffee packs that are all the rage these days.The kit is sealed inside aluminum wrap and at first glance looks like something one might want to bake . It contains 18 seeded peat pots and a dozen different vegetables and herbs . There are extras of the herbs and lettuces to allow for staggered and companion plantings ( still too much dill here for my tastes , though ) .The selling point is ease , convenience , and instructions . Put the Kuerig-like pods into a container , raised bed , or garden ; space the plants as directed ; water them ; thin seedlings and transplant extras when possible ; fend off the various critters that will come to enjoy your work ; and let the sun and rain do the rest save for weeding and feeding.It 's almost everything one needs for a garden , and it makes the planting process quite easy.The growing process , however , is another matter . I 've heard and read the idea of putting a 50 cent plant in a five dollar hole more than a few times . If you have not prepped your soil with amendments for drainage , air , and nutrition , then you plants may lose their initial enthusiasm after sprouting and either be stunted or just die . Keeping them feed and pest free is vital , so learning about fertilizers and companion planting with other herbs and flowers should be the next step . Light and drainage and soil depth are also important.My point is just that aspiring gardeners may think the whole process is a bit simpler than the reality of getting from seeds to harvest . The presentation of this kit suggests a science experiment more than a horticultural exercise to me . So it is a great way to get started -- -but what 's here needs to be augmented by trying things out and learning more about the whole process of growing vegetables and herbs.Meanwhile , I will be seeing how my plants do in the coming weeks and hoping the various bugs and chipmunks leave something for the table . I learn something from every garden and am still trying to figure out what killed my tomato plants in my other raised bed that were poised to deliver my first-ever fruits by July 4th.Update : It is September , and as I look back , I have to say this garden kit failed to produce . Pretty much everthing we planted either died despite plenty of water and light or was consumed by squirrels and chipmunks who must have found the little peat cups full of seedlings to be tasteful appetizers . I think the term failure to thrive applies .	-1
This is a cute idea , but really , is quite pitiful . You only get a couple of seeds packed into each tiny peat pod.The kit is great for getting your feet wet in the world of planting with seeds but do n't expect to grow anything resembling a plentiful herb and veggie garden with this tiny little kit.For the price I have to say Miracle-Gro could have done A LOT better . Nice idea , poor execution . Your money would be much better spent buying seeds and soil ( or if you like the idea of the peat pods , some empty pods and a few seed packets would yield a lot more herbs and veggies for a lot less money ) . I really wanted to love this product but I just ca n't recommend it . Very disappointing .	-1
I 'm a gardener and for the last several years I have been practicing the `` art '' of gardening with varying degrees of success . I buy heirloom seed and raise my seedlings before planting which for me , is fun but still work . I wanted to try out these seed cups by Miracle-Gro and so far I kind of like them . I wo n't be changing to these from what I 've been doing , but for someone who has a very small area to grow vegetables/herbs or just want a small patio garden I think this is a great way to accomplish that.You wo n't be raising a large garden with numerous plants of each kind , but you will get a small sampling of some fairly popular vegetable garden plants . I 'm sure the seed used in these seed cups are NOT heirloom , so I would n't bother trying to save any to use the following year because they most likely will not produce any vegetables . Plants yes , but no produce . And I would n't mix them with plants that are heirloom if you 're planning on saving any seeds because they will cross pollinate and could sabotage your heirlooms.However , for children , school classroom projects , or the micro gardener I think these are perfect . They are very easy to plant , I just made a small hole in one of my raised beds and pushed the entire container into it after peeling off the lid . Sprinkle with some water and wait . It 's too early yet to report on the quality of the produce , but so far I have only planted the herbs . I already have a lot of the other type plants growing and do n't want to risk cross pollination . I always get excited when I see the new plant babies breaking the surface of the soil - never gets old for me ! I 'm looking forward to some fresh herbs though , and each seed cup will produce several seedlings . I do n't like to waste seedlings so I carefully separate them and replant . Most people will choose one or two of the healthiest seedlings and discard the remaining ones , but I like to give everybody a chance if I have the room . I think these seed cups are an excellent way to introduce gardening to children and for those who just want to start out with something very easy and not much of it . Some plant food granules are included along with very good instructions.4.19.14 UPDATEThe plant pots I planted never amounted to anything , and this year while getting my raised bed ready for new plantings I found a pot I planted from last year with it 's seeds still in it , buried underneath the soil that did n't germinate . The pot did n't even decay much . I would n't waste my money on these things but buy fresh seeds instead or seedlings that have already been started . I have a few more pots left over and I 'll try them again somewhere in the garden , but I 'm not expecting them to do anything .	-1
UPDATE ( october 2013 ) : got this kit in june . not a single seed sprouted all summer or fallOriginal review : =======right out of the box , i tried the cucumber , tomato , and sweet pepper . i 'm going to try some of the other ones inside ( as per instructions ) , so after 3 weeks not a single sprout on the first round.last year at the local farmers market , for $ 10 we bought a whole flat filled with a variety of 15 starts . i think 13 of the 15 were producing within a matter of week . that was a much better deal.additionally , the miracle-gro are not local seeds , so there 's no way to know if they will acclimate to your particular climate zone . and this kit is incredibly expensive compared to just buying starts from a local supplier . if you can find organic non-gmo starts that are native to your local climate , then even better .	-1
I had hopes that surely I 'd have luck with these groables , but my general lack of luck growing stuff extends to this kit with zero results . Very disappointed .	-1
Now that the gardening season is over , i find myself wondering what problem this product is trying to solve . It 's such an awkward middle ground between starting seeds and buying started plants - instead of getting a packet of 20 or 200 seeds , you 're getting just a few , which one could argue is less wasteful . However , you 're starting from seed instead of buying an established plant , so you get all the risks of seed-starting with none of the flexibility to start 10 seeds to make sure you get one viable plant . Further , with the 'tender ' plants like tomato and pepper , if you want a harvest at all , you still have to deal with the hassle of starting indoors , and these pods make that quite awkward.And , of course , my criticism of the mix still stands . One pea plant ? One bean plant ? Even the best harvest will result in a snack 's worth of peas . Further , beans and peas like to grow crowded , so a single vine wo n't do as well as it would with neighbors . Were these products grouped differently , i 'd be less critical . Perhaps an herb garden ( just the herbs ) , a cool-season crop mix with the greens and at least half a dozen peas , and a warm-season crop mix with the tomatoes , cucumber , pepper , and at least half a dozen beans . Then at least you would n't have a handful of pods sitting around gathering dust between the early planting and the late one , and would actually get enough beans and peas to work with.The biggest problem i had with this kit was that it clearly was n't designed for Pacific Northwest gardeners . ( Ironically , about the only region for which i 'd recommend this would be central California , and for reasons unclear it ca n't be shipped to California . ) I planted these side-by-side with varieties suited to this climate , and without exception the local varieties did significantly better than Miracle-Gro 's generic seeds . I say generic because they provide absolutely no information , even vital tidbits like whether the tomatoes are determinate or indeterminate , and whether the peas and beans had inoculant on them already . If you adored , say , the cherry tomatoes that grew from this kit , you 'd have no way at all to buy more except maybe through Miracle-Gro ( or seed-saving , but if you knew how to save seeds you probably would n't be buying this kit ) .Realistically , if you want a small but successful garden , you should n't be ordering seeds blindly on the internet . You should find a local garden center ( ideally a real one , not the annex on the side of a hardware store ) and ask the employees to recommend varieties well suited to your area . There are very few tomato plants that would thrive in both Oregon and Texas . I 'm sure Miracle-Gro did its best to find one that would so they could make the product as uniform as possible , but the end result is that gardeners in Texas will probably have horrible blossom end rot on their tomatoes , and we up in the north only had a few tomatoes ripen up before the cold and wet weather started.I think this product is a waste of time , money , material , and effort , and would really like to give it only one star . However , nearly all of my seeds did germinate , and nearly everything gave me at least one nibble or snack . The only duds were the cucumbers , which fell victim to a neighborhood cat , and the bean plant , which got lonely and died before even flowering . But buying two globe tomatoes , a handful of cherry tomatoes , a bell pepper , and a few baby lettuces at the store would cost less than this kit and require no yard space and no watering . ( If anyone wants to explain away my troubles and poor harvest with my own ineptitude , i 'll defend against that by pointing out that i 'm a Certified Master Gardener , and my harvest from my garden this year is more than 350lbs of fruits and vegetables . I provided these pod-plants with the same care and attention as their neighbors . ) [ What follows is my original review , going through the step-by-step of planting and maintaining . ] -- Unpacking and Planting -- ( early June ) I ca n't imagine many experienced gardeners using this product for one major reason : you do n't know what you 're planting . My local garden center has 99 varieties of tomatoes in stock this month , and those are just the kinds that grow well in this area . The tomato included in this pack is just described as 'globe tomato ' . I 'm assuming it 's going to be a red tomato , because even though you can get tomatoes in any color from nearly-white to nearly-black , people think of tomatoes as red . But it does n't even say if it 's determinate or indeterminate , much less other important details like disease resistance . All we know is that it 's a globe tomato and should be ready to start harvesting in about 65 days.The lack of information is dangerous for novice gardeners in different ways . The website says to thin plants after the first set of true leaves appears , but does n't say what 'true leaves ' are . The included information says you can plant these either in the ground or in containers , but gives absolutely zero guidance on what size the containers should be ( though they do suggest Miracle-Gro 's potting soil mix ) . A novice who either has their local extension office on speed dial , or is very comfortable with internet searches , can probably find the information they need to have a chance at success with these . ( The website appears to still be in development , so they may well add more information as they go . For now , though , it 's seriously lacking . ) And of course , some of the information is just plain wrong . On the website it advises picking your peas early in the morning , while they 're still crisp . But the sugar in peas starts turning to starch almost immediately after harvest , so if you want the sweetest , best-tasting peas , you need to pick them right before you 're going to use them . I was also amused by the one-sentence suggestion of dividing your garden into square feet instead of just planting your crops in a row . There 's no further information about how to plant within those squares ( for example , only one tomato should go per square , but you could probably put both lettuces in a square together , etc ) . And a row with two tomato plants , one cucumber , some basil and dill and cilantro , one pea , one bean , and a couple types of lettuce would be a strange row indeed.While i 'm on the topic of being amused , i 'll add that i 'm desperately curious how they decided what to include in this kit . There are two tomato plants , which should provide a bounty of tomatoes , two dill plants , which is more than anyone would need unless they 're a dill addict , but only one pea plant and one bean plant . That means you 'll get a few pea pods a day at peak season ( not even enough for a salad ) , and a small handful of bean pods a few times during the season ( maybe fried up with garlic as a side dish for one ? ) . Perhaps the pea pod and bean pod are for kids to grow as an experiment while their parents grow the real food plants ? The theory and information are n't the only flawed aspects of this product.-The pods come packaged in a sheet of cardboard , and mine at least were very snugly fit in . I managed to shoot a couple pods across the room while trying to free them . One other , i broke the entire edge of the pod off.-The paper lids of the pod fold open to reveal a little more information about the plant , but on about half of mine , something had gone wrong and the paper was stuck together as if glued shut . Trying to open it just tore it into illegible pieces.-You take the paper lid off the pods , and if you watch the video online , you know to use your open palm to press the pod into the dirt . This works fine , except that residual glue on the rim of the pot makes it stick to your hand and pop right back out of the ground with you try to take your hand away . I found that smearing a little dirt around the rim of the pot first solves this problem , but makes the whole process take about three times as long.-The pots also do n't seem to travel well . When i peeled the lid off my pea pot ( and no , this is n't one i shot across the room ) , the peas were just rolling around on top of the planting material . Peas like to be planted about an inch deep , so what i ended up doing was just packing an inch of soil on top of that pot.-The pots need to be watered VERY gently . My hose sprayer , set at what i water every other plant with , blew the seed starting medium right out of the pots . Even the mister setting was a little too vigorous . I 'm wondering if it might be better to soak the pots before planting , water the planting area thoroughly first , then stick the pot in , mulch it deeply , and leave it alone for a week or two.I 've planted mine inDirt Potsof various sizes , with a sand and soil mix that has worked well for me as a potting soil in the past.So at this point , i think the only type of person to whom i 'd recommend this product is a gardener with some experience but no yard . These could make a fine container garden on a sunny patio . Assuming the plants germinate and grow well , and the resulting product tastes good , this could be a one-stop-shop for someone who wishes they had the time and space for more , but simply doesn't. -- Germination -- ( early June ) I started seeing some germination within about 5 days . By 14 days , the only things that had NOT germinated were the peppers and cucumbers . Seedling counts of those that have germinated range from two ( the peas and beans ) up to six ( romaine ) . I lost one of the bean plants to birds , so i highly recommend using some sort of netting or remay to protect your pea and bean sprouts until they leaf out ( birds seem to mistake the little bean sprouts for tasty worms , and rip them out of the ground - this happens to my other beans too ) .One full month after planting , i 'm comfortable assuming that anything that 's going to germinate has germinated . Here 's my tally for minimum seeds per pod i received . It 's entirely possible there were more in some , but i can only count what broke the surface.Cilantro ( x2 ) : 3 and 4Dill ( x2 ) : 2 and 3Loose Leaf Lettuce ( x2 ) : 1 and 1Pea : 2Bean : 2Basil ( x2 ) : 3 and 2Butterhead Lettuce ( x2 ) : 2 and 5Romaine : 6Spinach : 2Cherry Tomato : 3Globe Tomato : 3Sweet Pepper : 3My cucumber never germinated . I later verified that this might have to do with one of the neighborhood cats using that container as a bed every afternoon . I dissected seed pod and found two seeds in it.Germination is not a perfect predictor of what you 'll get . For example , the day after i thinned my basil plants down to one plant per container , some critter came by and finished the job on of of them . So despite having five total basil seedlings , i currently only have one small small plant.Everything except one of the pea plants are thriving , even in this strange weather ( unseasonably hot mixed with overcast and humid , a very strange July in this part of the world ) . I did n't thin the peas , since peas usually like to be crowded . One of the pea vines is happily climbing the pole i stuck it next to . The other is an odd , stunted plant , with misshapen leaves . I 'm letting it grow just to see what happens. -- Flowering/Fruiting/Harvest -- ( mid-july ) The pea plant has flowered and produced one small but tasty pod . I picked it slightly under-ripe to encourage further flowering , but as yet , nothing . The bean plant is also not flowering . There are flower buds on the tomato plants , but none on the pepper plant.The spinach plant is extremely not heat tolerant . This is the Pacific Northwest , and while it 's a bit hotter than usual , it 's not hot by any standard measure . Even so , the spinach plant is a withered sunburned mess . The lettuce plants a few inches away are doing just fine in the 'heat ' but still too small to eat.I 'm glad i did n't thin the peas , as the second pea plant progressed from short and misshapen to dead on the ground . I have no idea what befell it.One cilantro plant needs to be watered 3x/day , the other is fine with water every other day , and they 're planted in identical soil in identical containers . I am no more able to explain this than the short unhappy life of the second pea plant ... .	-1
It 's really hard to tell who this product was created for . The components in this kit only serve to save you the trouble of dropping a seed into the soil and fertilizing it . You still need a full-sized garden or sizable elevated box garden ( this is no `` windowsill '' garden ) in which to have room to grow all these herbs and veggies , and you still need to prepare the soil and dig holes for each of the superfluous seed pods . They ca n't really claim this has value in terms of teaching kids how to garden , since all they would be doing is making a hold in which to deposit the ready-to-plant pods.It makes more sense to me to spend the $ 25 on quality seeds or starter plants than on this gimmicky kit .	-1
Let me get this out of the way - I have a black thumb . I start out good , and then inevitably forget to water my plants , and they all die on me . My husband , on the other hand , is decent when it comes to plants and gardening.I got this set thinking I could finally have my own little garden , and for awhile , things were going along well.The set comes packed well and has plenty of information to get you going . We planted this next to my husband 's garden ( I call it that , because once again , I am useless when it comes to gardening ) . We put some soil in the area we set aside , and popped the little discs in . Then watered them . Easy as that . And in a few weeks , things indeed did begin to sprout . Every pod sprouted . We followed the directions , watering a little bit , twice a day.Unfortunately , we got hit by a few very bad rains in a matter of a few days , and that seemed to affect a few of the pods . Most everything was still alive and well , but a few pods did n't make it.Because of the few loses , I have to point out the primary downside of this set - cost . We have to wonder if this is a good value for the money . You need potting soil for these , just like you would for standard seeds or starters . So you wo n't save money on that . Yet seed packs are very cheap and if I want to pay a bit more , a starter plant usually costs a dollar . This set costs quite a bit more.When one of our plants die , I 'd much rather it be worth a quarter . And as is the case with planting seed packs , I 'll have 3 or 4 more plants right next to it to take its place . You only get one of each plant in this set - in some case , 2 . These plants seem to be growing a little slower than our seeded garden as well.We 'd suggest going to the local store and grabbing a bag of potting soil and some seed packets , all for less that $ 15 . Plant them and enjoy your efforts . This set is really not saving you any effort .	-1
This device did not work very well . I followed the instructions to the dot and It never killed a thing . Rats and Mice were not fooled by this device .	-1
The first two days we had the Rat Zapper , we caught two mice . After that , it seemed to stop working . We would reset it and re-bait it , the red light would go on , and there would be nothing in the zapper . This has gone on for two weeks . We put fresh batteries in it and it still is n't zapping the rodents . Too bad , I was excited about zapping lots of pests , but this just is n't doing the trick . We 've abandoned it .	-1
... as a feeder , that is . For a week now I 've baited the trap and turned it on each night , confirming the green light shows briefly , only to find the trap exactly where I left it and the bait gone . I 've verified each morning that the switch was in the `` on '' position . When I ordered it I did not realize this was for `` indoor use only '' and have been using it outside in my vegetable garden , but I have been very careful to put it raised on a cement paver and in a very dry spot . Not so much as a drop of water has gotten on or near it ! Each morning I 've put it up on a chair off the ground where any possible moisture would air-dry ( even though we have very low humidity here ) , so I 'm not sure why it *wouldn't* work . Nonetheless , since I 'm not using it *exactly* as intended I 'll give it 2 stars instead of only 1 . But in the end , instead of getting rid of the little rats that are eating my vegetables , the Rat-Zapper has only served to attract more to the garden . No more - I 'm going back to wooden snap traps .	-1
I have had this set out for about two weeks . It has n't caught one rat or mouse ! However , the first night I had it out , something did try to eat the bait ( dog food ) . When I got up the next morning , I discovered the Rat Zapper turned upside down , with the battery cover dislodged and the batteries ( and bait ) strewn a couple feet from the trap . Apparently , it has enough of a zap to royally tick off whatever critter wanted the bait , but not enough to kill it.I put the batteries back in and re-baited ( and reset ) the trap . Two days later , the kill light was flashing , and I eagerly looked inside . The trap was empty . Not only was there no critter in the trap , but the bait was gone.I gave it one more try . Put more dog food ( and peanut butter smeared in a soda pop top -- you ca n't put wet bait directly on the bait tray ) , and then I reset the trap . It has been almost two weeks , and except for the bait , it sits empty . I guess the critters learned their lesson , and they 've decided to leave the trap alone , but still infest my property.I ca n't recommend a trap that merely annoys its intended victim , but does n't kill it .	-1
I tried using this for three weeks and never caught a single anything . I re-set it and baited it every night and the bait was gone every morning and the red light was on but nothing in the trap . Still have rats in the ceiling going back to poison I guess . Wish this worked but it was useless .	-1
I was very excited and happy when I saw the Rat Zapper Ultra offered on Amazon Vine . Living in Southwest Florida , we have always had problems with large river rats eating some of the wiring in our cars ' engine compartments . I have used traps and poisons with varied success . Most rats seem to be smarter than the standard traps and the poisons disappear without leaving any evidence of their effectiveness.When the Zapper arrived , I put on surgical gloves before taking it out of the box . I learned a long time ago that human scent is easily detected by rats and mice and acts as a deterrent . The unit looked efficient and well-made . Once I put the required batteries in , the light came up green indicating a good charge . Then I put 10 pieces of dry dog food in it and set it up outside at a likely spot , covered to protect it from any rain.I went out to check it the next morning not really expecting anything to have happened yet . However , the trap had been moved a few feet , was upside down , and all the bait had been removed . In other words , whatever got to the bait was not disuaded by the promised shock . In fact it must have reached in several times in order to get all the small pieces of bait . Or possibly the charge plate is n't working properly even though the light shows green.So I reset it . The next morning I had to search a twenty foot area to find the trap . This time the red light was flashing but nothing was inside . Once again all the bait was gone with no kill . Something , like a raccoon , must have long legs that allow it to reach the bait without touching the hot spot . Or it holds the trap up and shakes it . Or a feral cat is messing with it . So I reset it again , and again , and again with the same results every time.So then I looked closely at the instruction sheet . FOR INDOOR USE ONLY . Oooops . Knowing that the Rat Zapper seems to be working properly , even though set up outdoors , only two things can be happening . Either rats and mice are entering the trap and not getting schocked hard enough to kill them , or some other animal is adept at robbing the trap . I will set up some classic Victor traps to see if I can determine what is really happening .	-1
I noticed a couple of rat dropping in our garden , so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try out the zapper . We have many fruit trees on our hillside below our house , so it is not uncommon for us to have critters wander our flower gardens around our house during the warm months . I followed the instructions and baited the trap with dry dof kibble in the back of the trap and left it off to lure the rat into feeling comfortable about the trap ( apparently they are very skittish ) . After checking daily I found the kibble was eaten ( it took about 10 days ) , so I reloaded the trap and turned it on . After another three weeks there has been no activity in the trap , also the low battery light is on.It is unclear if we still have the rat or if it moved on . We are blessed to have many raptors in our area ( hawks , owls , turkey vultures ) so it is possible the varmit succumbed to the Circle of Life . Either way , I am disappointed that the batteries went dead . As far as the idea that there is no mess ; I have doubts about that . There have been times when we have caught critters with the snap trap ( still my favorite method ) and they have oozed their bodily fluids . If that happens in this trap will it not short itself out ? There is still clean up of the inside of the trap after a kill . You need to wipe it down once you dump the body . This is where the snap trap excels . Yes you have to see the body , but the snap trap is less than a couple of bucks , so i just toss it.I have not given up hope on the trap and if I ever catch anything in it I will edit this post . But at this point I prefer the old fashioned snap trap . Sometimes you just have to get you hands dirty .	-1
This summer the bugs have been awful in my yard even with citronella candles and lanterns so I thought I 'd give this a whirl . It runs on 2 C batteries ( not included ) and activates when you slide and hold the button . This product is junk ! It does n't kill large bugs like bees and wasps or really small ones like gnats and believe me I 've tried . A wasp got stuck in the mesh but it did n't zap it ! It flew away - defeats the purpose of the racket and the gnats just flew right through it , so basically the bug has to be a perfect size in order to kill it . Also , the bugs have to essentially fly into it in order to kill them ; because of the bulk of this racket and how thick it is , you ca n't smash a bug on a flat surface . Waving the racket around to try to kill the bug gives it ample time to fly away and you look crazy in the yard swinging this thing with no results . The head of the racket is not flexible at all either . So to me , this is a waste of $ 13 . You can buy a 99 cent fly swatter at Target that 's much more effective than this .	-1
The device is operated by two C batteries which go into the handle of the `` racket '' . It is a bit clumsy to use because it is a little heavy and very rigid . It is tough to catch a fast flying insect with such a device . I was able to zap the very small flying insects but a bee or a wasp appears to be too large for the current to kill . For several times , I was able to get a bee which became stuck to the mesh but it did not kill them . In one instance , once the bee recovered from being shocked , it just flew away . I would not recommend this as an effective way to kill flying insects . I think an old fashion fly swatter would be just fine .	-1
First , if someone is going to sell me a `` 50 foot hose '' , what I get better be a 50 foot hose . This is n't . I 'd say it comes out to half the length at best.Second , the exterior of this hose is a fabric . If you are going to use it around a driveway ( dragging on rough concrete ) or there is any chance of it snagging on roots or branches near the spigot , it is simply going to wear through at some point . With your normal rubber garden hose , that is n't an issue.Third , the fittings on each end are just cheap plastic ... not the solid brass fittings you get on better garden hoses.It 's cool to watch this thing expand and contract , but that makes it a toy of very limited interest , not a real tool.Sorry , give this one a very wide pass .	-1
We are were satisfied with this hose until it broke ! Problem was not the hose so much as it is not very sturdy to haul around the yard to water in the desert . We have cactus in our yard and when we went to water near the cactus it seemed to jump out at this hose and put two tiny holes in the hose . The hose worked fine for a time and then when I was watering some tomato plants I heard this pop ! The water had been flowing just fine until then . It broke and there was no way to repair . We bought the one from TV as it is designed for a little more rough use . The problem as I see it is that the covering has to be a stronger mesh . Be sure when you order one of these hoses for the yard , that it will work for you . There are instructions on the other hoses which say that you should not stop the water without turning the faucet off first and then let the water run out . Also , keep it out of the sun when storing ! Keep it in the container in which it came when storing as well . The price of this hose is a bit high compared to other hoses on the market and its reliability ! Updated 6/6/2014 .	-1
While my yard is not as big as many homes , it is still 7500 square feet . I hate to sound lazy , but unreeling 100 feet of hose , weaving it amongst the flower beds , dragging it around to water the flowers on the far reaches of the property , and putting everything away again is not exactly fun . By the time I drag the hose around , water the flowers , and try to reel it back into the hose reel , I tend to be wet and full of dirt from guiding the hose and the water flying about when I reel the very end into the hose reel . I thought that an expandable hose like the Rumford Gardner Expanding Hose might make life a bit easier.The hose is quite easy to operate as I show in the video . The `` female '' end of the hose is like any other hose . The male end of the hose is the same as well , but it comes with a plastic shutoff valve to attach to the end . To get the hose to expand , the shutoff valve must be closed and then the hose needs about 10 seconds to expand to its full length.When the hose is unexpanded , it measures in at right about 17 feet long . Once allowed to expand and with the shutoff valve remaining in the off position , I measured the hose to be about 48 feet long including the connectors . It might not be a full 50 feet , but I will call it close enough as the two feet might have been lost due to measuring error.While the hose does seem to work just like the DAP Xhose did on TV , it just is not the same as a regular hose . Once you open the shutoff valve , the hose starts contracting again . Another issue is that if you are trying to fill something like a bucket or a pool , the hose is so light it really does not stay in place and the end will start flailing wildly about . On the plus side , I found the hose was much easier to drag around and put away when I was doing regular watering duties of the gardens.After using the hose for about 6 weeks , the hose is still operational My main complaint is the cheap plastic fittings always seem to be coming loose , leaking , or spraying water everywhere . Also , the screw holding the shutoff handle in place on the valve is already showing a significant amount of rust . I am wondering how long it will take before it rusts through.Overall , I felt this was just an OK product . If hauling 50 or 100 feet of standard rubber garden hose is something that is difficult to do , then this product very well might be something worth trying . I did like the lightweight of the expandable hose . However , to me the product seems to be cheaply made and while after 6 weeks I have not had the product fail , I do question how long the hose will last.Update # 1 : The host did make it through the summer . I drained the hose to the best of my ability and put it in my deck box for the winter . I tried to use it a few days ago and found that the hose suffered a massive leak . There does not appear to be any damage to the external wrap of the hose , so I am not sure what caused the leak . Regardless , I am updating the title of the review and I recommend staying away from this product .	-1
I was really excited to try the water hose , since I 've seen so much about this type on TV and in stores . When I got it in , I decided to go try it out . I had the water pressure on normal ( as I always do ) and within 10 minutes the hose had busted . So within an hour of receiving the hose , it was in the trash . I would n't go with this brand , for the price , it 's just too risky !	-1
I have to change my initial review of this hose . I thought it was truly a great hose , but now I have changed my mind about the quality of the hose . I gave it 5 stars in my first review , but I ca n't do it now . I only used this hose about 4 times , and it finally broke from the hose attachment . I believe the manufacturer needs to make the attachments stronger with brass attachments .	-1
Updated : Bummed ! At time of first review , I loved this hose , but it turns out it is a fail . After less than three months of use , the cloth completely detached from the coupling that attaches to the faucet . Not repairable . Useless.Previous Review Title : Makes My Daily Watering Easier And QuickerMother 's Day is the beginning of the outdoor growing period in our area of the Rocky Mountains . Once winter 's passed and there is little chance of snow , we begin transforming our barren , uninviting , expansive wood deck into a our own little summer oasis.From out of the basement , we move the barbeque , patio furniture , awnings , umbrellas , a gazebo , a fountain and a chimenea to make the deck an attractive outdoor living space . Dozens of planters and flower pots get arranged in groupings on the deck and in multiple hanging baskets.The job of planting and maintaining the annual flowers is happily all mine . Every morning I water and joyfully watch hundreds of blooms proliferate as summer heats up . Two heavy 25 ' traditional garden hoses are attached together to make one long hose . The length is necessary to zig zag my way back and forth across one thousand square feet of deck . The hose is heavy . Sometimes I have to stop and use both hands to swing it up , over and/or around the furniture , etc.About a month ago I received the Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose . I 'm never going use my old traditional type again . The Rumford weighs about two thirds less . It takes me much less time maneuvering it about , plus it delivers better pressure than my old hose.My Rumford Hose has not ripped despite me dragging it up , down , across and around everything on our wooden deck . As I swirl it to collapse inside our hose pot it naturally drains and is protected from direct sunlight . From what I 've read in other reviews , that might be the reason my Rumford Hose has n't ripped . My hose pot is n't available here , but it is very similar to this Liberty Garden Products 1913 Hammered Bell Garden Hose Pot - Copper.The Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose has made my daily routine tons easier and given me more time to enjoy my hard work . I 'd say I have more time to stop and smell the roses , but I do n't grow them : )	-1
The first time I tried it , it worked exactly as the ad claims . Turned off the water , it coiled up , and all was well . The second time I used it , 2 days later , the hose sprung a geyser a couple of minutes after I turned off the water . Oh well . Never again .	-1
This is a great idea especially if you do n't have much room . It does expand a good amount and we 've used it successfully a few times . But we can tell the quality is n't that great and the material seems thin . I think it will break for sure after some use . So what we have done is to turn on the water at a very low pressure and it has been fine . But even then , we 're not really sure how long this will truly last .	-1
I have tried two of these hoses at this point ... .first of all I would like to say that they do indeed work as advertised . When no water is running to them they can be made very compact and stored almost in a cargo shorts pocket space ... when you turn the water on you get a nice thin , lightweight 50ft hose . All great ... Rumford even includes a carrying pouch so you can store the hose when not in use.I started using these as someone normally would ... for light duty yard work , cleaning the deck , etc ... .nothing major . The hose was always around a wooden deck or a soil filled flower bed ... never near brick or concrete . The first hose ripped after about 3 weeks and the Rumford after about 4 weeks . Disappointing.It should be duly noted that I live in a home that has WELL water with very little pressure . Yes it was enough to expand this hose ... but not enough to make it rip apart.Personally I feel that this is a great product that may need a bit more work before I would recommend it . I give it 2 stars because it does work and because Rumford is the only company that includes a carrying pouch.2/5 ... .	-1
UPDATED REVIEW : 9/29/13The hose popped in the center ! ! What do they make these hoses out of these days ! ! ! The reason why I chose this one was because all the other hoses we had also popped . They do n't make hoses like they used to . We took care of this hose to great lengths . We would drain the hose and never leave water in it when we were done . We 'd disconnect from the faucet and put it away after each use . It still popped ! ! ! You can read my original review when I got this hose , but now that it is of no use , I 'm altering my review.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I was so frustrated that we bought a standard hose and then one day , it just popped and water sprayed out of the hose . We had been looking to buy a replacement , but hoses are expensive and the one we had was the second hose we bought.Then came the Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose . I 'm glad I held off buying the standard hose . I like this expanding hose for the following reasons : A ) Very lightweightB ) No need for a hose box you have to wind up to put the hose awayC ) Comes with a carrying/storage caseD ) Expands as the water runs throughE ) Comes with a fitting to allow you to shut the water off at the end of the hose to change fittingsWhat I thought could 've been better is:1 ) Water pressure was not as forceful as with the standard hose . I think this is due to it 's size2 ) Plastic fittings instead of metal3 ) Would not be easy to replace the fittings4 ) End that connects to the water faucet is hard to grab in order to tighten . Water was coming out and I had to tighten moreOverall , it may be a bit more than a traditional hose , but I like the weight and ease of storage . When it is time to replace my other hose , I will consider replacing it with an expansion hose .	-1
I think we can all agree that this is a very cool concept . This hose is very capable , very light , very portable - it 's just about perfect in the whole concept department . The only problem is that it has no lasting power . The fittings are all in plastic and hardly durable . The hose itself ca n't be left out in the sun - the sun will break it down . Then it 's not even durable because even when you are super careful with it , it can still develop leaks . The outer covering is a strange , crunchy material that fades in the sun - none of it seems up to par for durability . I think this is useful maybe for times when you need a portable hose - this has to be the most portable hose around ... but you ca n't rely on it , so I 'm not sure if the convenience of the portability is worth not knowing if it will last for you and when it will break for no reason at all . I can not recommend this item .	-1
I 've been using pruners for the last 30 or more years , on roses , bushes , trees and more . These ones do the job and are easy to use . Only a gardener knows the difference between `` hacking '' and `` pruning , '' and good pruning is like creating a sculpture . These Fiskars hand pruners help me do just that , in green , living color ! Thank you for the opportunity to review this excellent product.Update : WHOOPS ! I used these shears for the second time , and the plastic gear inside broke . I am going to contact Fiskars about this problem , as all the shears I have had in the past had metal parts and lasted 20 years or more . I am quite disappointed that a product could be made so poorly with plastic parts ( this certainly did n't show on the outside ) and I would not want people to be misled by my previous 5 star rating.At the risk of not being `` popular '' with a now negative rating , I am changing my rating to reflect the truthfulness of my experience . One star . Useless if they break in two the second time out .	-1
I picked this feeder up to add to our backyard collection . Every year the gosh darned squirrels manage to destroy at least one of our feeders . My husband 's least favorite feeder was the ball one that they kept getting stuck inside . He twice had to cut a squirrel we named & # 34 ; Tubby & # 34 ; out of the thing . At least that will not be an issue with this feeder ! Anyway , on to the review : Positives:1 . I like the idea of this feeder , the pass through holes are a neat idea.2 . There appears to be decent spacing for medium to smallish birds to hold on and feed.3 . This feeder is suitable for the black sunflower seeds we like to use . ( Note : see spillage issue below. ) 4 . The price is fair for this quality of feeder . ( I would say it is designed to last no longer than a couple of seasons. ) Negatives:1 . I had not read the review about the bird with its foot caught nor the injured chickadee before I picked this up . If I hear a repeat of those events , I will update this review and will throw the thing away.2 . My squirrels are not yet active but this feeder looks like it will be highly vulnerable to their shenanigans . I will observe them when they come back and update if this is in fact an issue.3 . Filling this feeder is not easy,4 . Seeds fall out of the feeder very easily.All in all , there are any number of decent feeders out there . I ca n't really recommend this one because it has too many issues and the reports of injury to our fine feathered friends are too problematic.Not Recommended .	-1
I must have the worlds most stupid birds . It has been Over a week now and the birds still do n't know what to make of this feeder.They just sit and stare at it , maybe pondering the fly-throughs on/in it ? You can also , for lack of a better term , call this feeder a 'squirrel magnet ' ( something like a chick magnet ! ) The birds stay away in droves , but the squirrels love it . They cling on to the wire and contort themselves into all kinds of odd positions to chow down on the expensive black oil sunflower seeds I use in the winter.Since this feeder really does n't hold all that much food , once the herd of squirrels are done scarfing down their little snack ( it takes about 1 hour to do so ) , I find the herd with their noses pressed up against the deck sliding doors staring in at me as if imploring me ( or trying to manipulate my mind ) to go out and give them more hand-outs.I 'm on to these little suckers finally , and I will no longer be brow beaten into submitting to the squirrels demands ! I have moved this feeder to various parts of our yard and tried several different ways to hang it . I have tried a squirrel baffle to . Nothing helps.Also this feeder is quite difficult to fill.I swear these squirrels must have escaped from some government experimental laboratory -I have never seen anything like them and their frenzied eating .	-1
I have way too many squirrels at my house as it is and this feeder really attracts them while not attracting birds at all . I should have been warned when I saw it was for sunflower seeds and peanuts - two of squirrels favorite foods in the world . Thirty dollars seems a little high for this aside from the squirrel problems .	-1
I loved the thought of this feeder when I first saw it . I own quite a few Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders , so brand wise , it was a good choice for me . But , it was all down hill from there.First off , so much BOSS falls through the bottom while filling . Next , once the squirrels get a whiff , hang on it , do the hokey pokey and turn themselves around , the BOSS gets flung all over the place , to the hoard of squirrels waiting below.Finally , towards dusk , when the squirrels were tucking themselves into their nests , the cardinals came to investigate . I was horrified to see a female get her claw stuck in it . All her flapping around was stressful to us both . I went over with the leather gloves and a towel , but by the time I got there , she probably broke her foot so that I would n't get her ! I took it down immediately.Should be starless !	-1
The Perky-Pet FLY THROUGH WILD BIRD FEEDER is an all-mesh feeder designed to allow birds to feed from any position - they can cling to the sides or the bottom , or they can fly into the round ports to feed from inside the feeder . This might have worked if the mesh squares had n't been so large ! The instructions suggest using only sunflower seeds or peanuts , since smaller seeds would fall through the mesh . Well , sunflower seeds fell through the mesh , too ! This thing is a mess to fill , since seeds pour out as you 're trying to fill the feeder . When I realized what was happening , I tried filling it over a cardboard box ( to catch all the seed that poured out ) , but even once it was filled I saw that it was leaking seed all over the place . I could n't even carry it out to the tree where I was planning to hang it without seeds continuously leaking out from the sides and bottom . The entire feeder is mesh , so the seeds come out everywhere.I have no idea how other customers were able to use this thing . I gave up , since it was obvious that as soon as I hung it in the tree the seeds would leak out continuously until only the ground feeders would get any use from it . It 's possible this would work with peanuts , but I can attest that it 's a failure with sunflower seeds . This is a poorly designed bird feeder that wastes seed . Not recommended .	-1
First , I like how easily accessible the seeds are from almost any location on this bird feeder . I also love that it 's all metal.The birds , however , have a differing opinion . I have five feeders up , all have black oil sunflower seeds . They are all empty within two weeks ... Except this one . I have yet to refill it . The birds seem to do their best to stay away from it.You can fill a feeder with bird seed but you ca n't make them eat it .	-1
I understand the idea behind this design , but the execution is simply lacking.And the materials are flimsy and of very poor quality.I think this company might be better served by designing good products , using quality materials , and charging more.After all , a birdfeeder is a lifetime product , not a seasonal product.Pass .	-1
The highpoint of this feeder is the nice-looking unique design , with the `` fly-through '' holes and inner access . It 's all metal construction ( except for the little plastic slide lock on the upper cable , which holds down the lid ) seems decent . It attract birds well , the smaller ones get inside easily , and it 's entertaining to watch.I have a few reservations . . . . This feeder has no perch or tray . Birds feed from it by hanging onto the wire mesh and picking the seeds out through the mesh . Appears difficult , and the larger birds , like cardinals , which often prefer the larger seeds ( I 'll get to the sunflower seed part ) , will not fit inside and seem to be ill-adapted to hanging off the sides . Due to the wire mesh sides , typical small bird seed mix will leak right through the sides . The label recommends peanuts or sunflower seeds ( shelled peanuts ? ? ) . When filling , even the sunflower seeds leak quite a bit -- so , a bit messy , and not economical -- but then when hung , the birds have much difficulty digging out seed through the mesh . It 's a whole lot of work for them.The squirrels have n't seemed to have caught on yet , but they will . When they do . . . the wire mesh sides are ready made for leaping/climbing squirrels , and I suspect over time they may wreck this thing . ( I 'll update if that prediction becomes reality ) .I 've only got one other feeder . It has a plastic dome , tray , perch , confounds squirrels and has lasted for years . Again , this new Perky-Pet Fly-Through thing looks great . . . but in practice , it does n't hold a candle to my old cheap plastic reliable.UPDATE after several weeks of use : No squirrel problems , which I credit to my locating it up under our roof overhang ( inaccessible to squirrels ) . However , the poor birds have great difficultly coaxing the seed out of this thing . They have tried but mostly given up . I give it a few hard shakes occasionally which causes some seeds to fall out onto the patio below . On behalf of the birds , I 've lowered my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars .	-1
I have very active bird feeding stations . We made 2 drilled out logs with perches and stuffed the holes with homemade suet and then also have bird feeders with trays for seed.This feeder says to fill it with sunflower seeds . The birds that are attracted to and enjoy sunflower seeds are cardinals , grosbeaks , chickadees and sparrows . Cardinals and grosbeaks will not feed off of this feeder unless they are desperate ; they want tray feeders.When this is filled with sunflower seeds , the bottom holes are so large that you lose a great amount of the seeds dropping on the ground.The fly through holes can catch the birds and make it difficult for them to get out . I watched one fat chickadee struggle and hurt itself when several grackles approached . The last I saw of the poor chickadee was it hopping and dragging a wing across the snow on our deck . That was also the last time this feeder was used.Between the holes that drop the sunflower seeds and the damage to birds- this is not a feeder for the birds .	-1
A oouple of weeks ago I spread this high priced product over some spots in my back yard that my Dobie had turned to a yellow color . He watched me carefully as I violated his favorite watering holes and when I finished he watered them quite thoroughly . Not to worry , I thought , this product is allegedly impervious to my Dobie 's output and soon grass will appear . After a week of no grass despite my Dobie 's assistance I decided to reseed and use a garden hose to do the watering rather than depend on my faithful companion . As I watered I kept thinking of the old saw `` You 'll wonder where the yellow went when you ... ... etc '' . Another week passed with no sign of grass . I do n't need to wonder where the yellow went because it is right there where it has been ever since the Dobie arrived .	-1
I purchased this with the hopes of patching up some dead spots in my yard from my dog , as well as some spots where the grass was n't growing as well as it should.Well , on the positive this grass DID grow . I had a high success rate with the seeds germinating and having grass come up . That was n't the issue.The issue was the strength of the grass . It was VERY flimsy , no matter how long I let it grow it did just not get the thickness that the rest of the grass had . It also would start to die if it did n't receive a lot of water , and we 're talking much more water than the rest of the grass , including sod I had down.Every area where this grass was has been replaced with grass from other places in the yard from gardens I dug up this year . This product is a good idea but did n't work out for me .	-1
This rain barrel is relatively attractive visually compared to some of the other ones out there , including my other rain barrel , the Fiskars salsa ( http : //www.amazon.com/Fiskars-GallonSalsa-Barrel-System-Diverter/dp/B00213JPFA/ref=sr_1_14 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1396868655 & sr ; =8-14 & keywords ; =rain+barrel ) .The barrel can somewhat be disguised as a planter . The planter portion is about 8 & # 34 ; deep and is somewhat wide , you can easily get a flat of flowers in.The aesthetics however is where the beauty of this barrel ends . Unlike the Fiskars , which has a diverter to hook up to your downspout , this just has a screened inlet . There is no mechanism to attach this barrel to a downspout . The instructions tell you how to , but there is nothing to do so . Further , with the included instructions and screened method , there is nothing to stop this barrel from overflowing once the top has been reached by the water . There are also holes in the planter portion , which means the soil is going to be a soggy mess all the time unless you close those holes . This is because the inlet and top level of the barrel is above the depth of the planter . If you were to use the planter , I would recommend either a fake plant , or plugging the holes entirely.It is nice that the barrel comes with decent hardware for the lower and upper spigot .	-1
This seems to be a nice idea to make it easy to spread fertilizer on a small urban plot that & # 8217 ; s too small to warrant getting a traditional push spreader . It & # 8217 ; s basically a plastic container with a battery-powered fan blade that spins and ejects granular fertilizer . However , the build quality is so poor that using it to get an even fertilizer dispersion is a hit or miss process.The battery compartment on mine was misaligned so that before I could use it I had to bend the connectors so they would contact the batteries ( it takes 4 AA batteries , which are included ) . The compartment that houses the battery and fan blade snaps off , but the plastic is so thin and bendy that getting it back together is a chore . This does not have the build quality that gives me any measure of confidence that it will last for more than a season or two.Once I got it functioning it did spread out the fertilizer in a reasonably even spray . You can stop and start dispensing by pushing a lever at the base . Again , that & # 8217 ; s not well-built and it sometimes jammed a bit in use.While the idea is good , the execution is very poor . If you have a small plot and don & # 8217 ; t want to deal with a traditional broadcast or drop spreader , you & # 8217 ; re far better off using a hand spreader or one of those new mini spreaders . The latter will take up more space than this product , but will do a better job by far . Plus , you can use better fertilizer than the stuff that comes with this , such as Milorganite . It won & # 8217 ; t green your lawn as quickly , but it & # 8217 ; s far longer lasting and there & # 8217 ; s no danger of burning the lawn with too much nitrogen , or contributing to nitrogen runoff into streams.Nice idea , but not worth the trouble . Not recommended .	-1
The idea of turning on a switch and just walking around letting the spreader do the work was appealing . If it worked , it would have been wonderful ! Likes : Easy to carry , lightweightEasy to storeSeemed to help the lawn - not a huge difference , but noticeableDislikesKept jamming , was a pain to get started againBatteries work looseBattery cover was looseI think it would probably be easier to use a manual spreader . While this was a great idea , the effort it took to keep it from jamming was just too much trouble .	-1
I have a yard that is interspersed with ` islands ' of mulched areas- plants and trees and thought this idea for fertilizer for small areas would work perfectly for the grassy areas around and between these mulched areas . What it turned out to be seemed like an unnecessary ` gizmo ' to distribute fertilizer.The battery part is awkward to use and the container leaked too much fertilizer as I tried to get it going and then stop it . The amount spread seems to vary with the battery power - another not so positive factor.The container is nice , but it would seem to be that you are paying for the gizmos and could get a better deal and also more physical control over your fertilizer by buying it separately . This and the refills seem very pricey and just a way to dress up fertilizer.The fertilizer - yes works and has seemed to help my grass .	-1
The chemistry of this makes sense for pansies ... so we added this as instructed to our pansies ... and they promptly died . Maybe it was just the time of year , maybe they were going to die anyway , maybe I just do n't know what I 'm doing . But it would only make sense that it was the pansy food that killed the pansies . Within days of application , they died .	-1
I used this to & # 34 ; stomp & # 34 ; all my winter trimmings ( rose bushes ) in my green recycling curbside can and it did a great job ... until it broke . The part that broke is the spring loaded piece that attaches the stomper to the wood handle you supply ... in this case it was the other end of a broom . When I pressed on it to release it the third or fourth time of use , it SNAPPED loudly and all of the pieces fell out . The stomper was useless after this and I threw it in the garbage bin next to the green bin it had been working so well on . Before it broke , I found that it compacted the can down by about 50 % so you could fit half as much more in the can . I think it would work better if it were weighted down instead of a light piece of plastic ... Overall , not well-built , not garden tough , a gimmic that was a good idea that fell apart in manufacturing in some distant land.Sorry , ca n't recommend .	-1
I have already reviewed another CobraCo fire pit , theCobraCo SH101 Hand Hammered 100 % Copper Fire Pit with Screen and Cover , which I actually liked with a modification.This fire pit from the same company looks like it was made in a completely different place ... the quality is not good . The four legs are held on with allen screws and nuts , which will likely rust in a year or so and be unremovable anyway . Sharp edges abound during assembly , so wear some protective gloves . When assembled the legs are not all square to the frame - it looks like the plates welded to them where the screws go through are not all lined up . The coating on the steel is a flat black paint , which may or may not hold up for a year or two . After that , I would think it will be mostly brown with rust , especially the screen where heat will oxidize the paint off . The thin , vinyl cover that came with it is useless -- it 's too tight and the sharp corners on the legs already have torn its seams . I just threw it out , since it 's not going to keep the fire pit from rusting anyway.Is there anything I like about it ? Well , the burning area is spacious and will fit the standard 16 '' split wood with room to spare . I also like the air holes that are covered with angle iron on the bottom . This will allow some air up through the fire and drain any water that gets in.But if you are going to spend this much money on a fire pit , I would definitely look at the copper ones by CobraCo instead . Copper will last longer and I think is more attractive than flat black steel . The mod I did to mine was to just drill a few 1/4 '' holes in the bottom of it to let water drain and to allow some air through the fire .	-1
This is a feeder intended for wild orioles . It consists of a lavender tinged plastic bottle that , turned upside down , screws into a circular orange base plate . The base plate includes a small plunger that can be turned from the bottom to release more food from the jar into the base plate . Assembled , the feeder stands approximately 8 & # 8221 ; high and is 8.5 & # 8221 ; in diameter . The plastic bottle has a capacity of approximately 20 fluid ounces . Empty , the feeder weighs under 2 ounces . The base plate includes a outer edge that birds can use for toe holds , and 3 holes on the outer edge that could accommodate a hanging chain or twine ( shown in the product photo , but NOT included ) . The feeder is designed so that the plastic bottle can be replaced with a jelly jar ( 2.25 & # 8221 ; diameter , slightly smaller than standard home canning jelly jars ) .I was thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of this feeder , starting with the fact that no chain or other hanging implement was included in the package . It is up to you to find a way to hang the feeder , either that , or you will need to set the feeder on a ledge or table . In general , orioles do like fruit , especially oranges , so this feeder might be attractive if you 've got orioles in your neighborhood . However , given that all you get in this package is a plastic bottle and a simple plastic base plate , the list price seems exorbitantly high .	-1
Upon receipt , I was n't particularly thrilled with the cheap plastic tray . I never expected it to be such a flimsy product , especially since I 'm big on using Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders . I 'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it 's not going to last too long . The clips from the chain were pretty difficult to snap on , I did n't think the plastic would survive the snap , but all 3 did.I waited until the Orioles showed up and immediately put this feeder out . That was 2 weeks ago . I filled the container half way , to test the waters , and hung the feeder from a shady tree . I have plenty of birds in my yard ; woodpeckers , cardinals , titmouse , nuthatches , chickadees , sparrows , robins , orioles , hummingbirds , starlings , goldfinches , mockingbirds , on a daily basis . I have a suet feeder on a pole , that I now fill with seed cakes , that is the current favorite by all above mentioned birds . For 2 weeks , I sporadically checked this feeder . I had never seen one bird visit . I had noticed the jelly dropping from the 3 drain holes in the orange plastic tray . The ants were thankful for that . I went out on the deck last night and heard unusual noise ; sure enough , the local gimpy raccoon ( has a bum leg ) was tossing & turning the feeder . I did n't even bother to shoo it away or spray it with the hose . I figured I 'd let him enjoy it . He licked it clean , and for that , I 'm kind of grateful . I 'm unsure if I 'll even bother putting it back out .	-1
I just ca n't like this feeder . No orioles have come to visit ( yes , they are in the area ) and it 's sticky and gross and a pain to clean and refill . No other birds have visited the feeder , either , but that does n't keep the insects away .	-1
NOTE : Before deciding to buy this model , look at the just-announced LED version that AeroGarden ( AG ) claims to be a major improvement : More effective lighting and cheaper over time . Although the LED version lists for $ 100 more than the fluorescent light version , the fluorescent lights are a major expense . The fluorescent lights list at $ 35 ( as a set of 3 ) and need to be replaced every six months -- comments on the AG website indicate that these lights often *burn out* around 6-8 months , not just that they become less effective . The LED version is advertised to last 3-5 years , or $ 210-350 worth of fluorescent bulbs . And the operating cost is less . Other than the LED lighting , that model seems the same as this one . However , see the comments below about ( poor ) quality of construction -- the LED model might not survive long enough to reap the benefits.Limited review : I was given this product in exchange for an honest timely review . The time limit requires me to post this review well before I have had the experience of a full cycle of growing plants . I am commenting on my early experience and will update this review as appropriate.Because of my professional background , I tend to be much more critical in my evaluations of products . You may well decide that various of my comments are irrelevant/unimportant to you , so I have tried to structure this to make it easier for you to spot and skip such comments.Details : As an engineer ( software ) I not only developed products but dealt with the company 's marketing people about design decisions . And another part of my job was evaluating products , both competitive analysis and for purchasing decisions . One lesson-learned from dealing with Product Managers ( Marketing ) was to play close attention to their visible decisions because they are highly predictive of decisions that you do n't immediately spot. -- -- My first negative reaction came with unpacking the product -- it felt too insubstantial for what it was . It was not just me . I asked several neighbors to give me their quick first impression ( no hints ) and the responses were `` cheesy '' , `` flimsy '' , `` cheap '' and not built to last . However , in looking through various comments , I could n't find complaints about this being a problem , so maybe it is tougher than it looks , or maybe people adapted.First , the plastic could easily have been a bit thicker in both the tank and the hood . Second , the pole for holding up the hood is probably more than strong-enough , but the impression was `` cheap '' . The cutting-corners was evident in that AG did n't even bother to de-burr ( smooth off ) the rough ends of the pole . But most worrisome is that the sockets for the pole in both the base and hood are relatively thin-walled -- I would have thought they needed to be much thicker to handle the torque of even a partially raised hood.Note : I do n't know how the construction of this model compares to earlier one ( for you to extrapolate from the reviews of those models ) , but the taller ( extensible ) pole is an advantage for growing taller plants , but creates torque greater than those models . And the hood carries more weight from an additional bulb ( 3 vs 2 in the previous model ) .Because I know to be very careful about this , I expect that I can keep it from breaking prematurely . However , if you plan to let children help you , there may be a problem . And if you have a cat , you may have a problem : I could n't use the initial place I planned to put the unit because I knew that my cat would be rubbing against it ( curiosity and scent-marking ) . And I think it would be the height of folly to grow catnip in this unit ( one of the seed kits that AG sells ) .The biggest example of corner-cutting and unimaginably bad design is the trellis . This is thin cheap plastic bar that seems to be capable of *guiding* the growth of plants , but not supporting plants such as tomatoes , much less supporting tomato plants while you are picking . The trellis was not designed for reuse from season to season : Connecting the two halves is permanent , thereby greatly increasing the likelihood it will be broken during storage . Although I do n't see this being a significant factor itself in your buying decision , this is indicative of the pervasive problems with this product. -- -- One of the basics of Marketing is to do multiple things to make your customers happy with their purchase . If this were not a review unit , I would have had significant buyer 's remorse.1 . The cost and frequency of replacement lighting was a major surprise ( see above ) . Having used straight fluorescent grow-light tubes , I expected an operating life of 2-3 times these , and a lower price.2 . The need to immediately buy supplemental items . For example , I had n't considered the need to change the water in the tank . I judge it impractical to carry the tank to the sink , because of ( 1 ) the lack of grips suitable to the weight , with the risk of both spilling the water and of breaking the tank , ( 2 ) no good way of leaving the growing plants behind ( at my location for the product ) . So the alternative is to siphon out the water into a bucket -- not great in several regards , but the lesser evil . And surprise , AG sells a siphon pump separately , but you can likely get one from a fish/aquarium store.3 . Badly over-priced supplies . For example , paper labels for the pods cost $ 0.26 each ( in bulk = 50 count ) . For comparison , file folder labels cost less than $ 0.04 . The pod baskets which are trivial pieces of plastic cost $ 0.34 each ( in bulk ) . The plug for unused holes is a combination of these two and is further marked up to $ 1.33 each ( from $ 0.60 ) . Furthermore , this is the wrong way to plug the holes -- the plugs should have been a more robust construction and should have been included , not an after-market purchase . Then there are the `` Grow Domes '' which are essentially the little plastic cups you put Salsa in at Mexican take-out : $ 0.30 each ( in bulk ) .Advice : Before making a purchase , look at the price of supplies and decide if you are going to feel that you are being gouged . If so , that is likely to adversely affect your use or enjoyment of this product.4 . Difficulty find a location for the unit . You are instructed to *not* locate this product where the plants will get sunlight because that can overwhelm them . This eliminated most of my prime locations for this unit . I was surprised that the product could n't handle this . Then eliminate locations where draining and refilling the tank will be a problem . Then ... From what I have figured out , the product was designed on the assumption that you would find a location suitable for its requirements , rather than being designed to be adaptable to where you wanted to put it.Note : One can adjust either the starting time or ending time for the lights , but not both . Setting one automatically resets the other to have a fixed period the lights are on . I wanted to put the unit in a south-facing garden window and set the start-time to be roughly sunset , with a 6-hour runtime to supplement the natural light . You ca n't do this . The closest approximation I found is to disconnect the unit 's lights and leave the windows lights on until bedtime.5 . Mediocre instructions . While setting up the unit is easy and intuitive , there is much more to using it . There is not a coherent user manual . Instead there are several overlapping documents ( equiv to Quick Start Guides ) , various FAQs and lots of blog-style postings . Many of these are erroneous , ambiguous , contradictory or incomplete . [ 1 ] It took me more than a 10 days to start up my unit because I repeatedly reached my frustration limit trying to hunt through the web pages to find what I thought were answers to basic questions ( I am not a `` Just do it '' person ) . There were too many clicks and searches yielding too little result . I kept muttering that it should n't be that hard . Part of what you are paying for with a product like this are instructions and guides to use it successfully . But as in the manufacturing , there are big deficiencies here.Note : My professional background makes me inclined to get a more complete understanding than the typical user , partly from a well-earned paranoia . And I do understand that there are people for whom ferreting out such info is part of the joy of products such as this.6 . In poking around on the AG website , I discovered many complaints about problems with the water pump . Under `` Accessories > Replacement Parks '' the description for the pump begins `` Keep your garden growing at its best with periodic pump replacement '' . Looking at the pump in my unit , I had to wonder if the reliability problems were simply the result of AG skimping on this part.7 . When I went to register my unit , the web site offered $ 125 of coupons for signing up for the newsletter . 90 % of those were discounts on buying other models . Hold it . I have just started using it -- I am hardly ready to buy another , either for myself or as a gift . Marketing wisdom is that those coupons should either be to reduce the shock of the cost of supplies or to encourage purchase of add-ons that could make the user more satisfied/enthusiastic with operation. -- -- Using for transplants : I was strongly considering using this to start transplants in the spring , but after looking at the details , I am reconsidering.1 . In looking at comments on the AG website , I found numerous complaints about poor success rates . I expected transplanting from a hydroponic environment to a normal garden to be more involved than normal transplanting . What I expected to find , but did n't , were articles of the form `` How to successfully transplant '' and `` Common mistakes made in transplanting '' .2 . One needs to look at the comments under their `` Seed Starting System '' and not just the description . This is Styrofoam and people report that it is often non-reusable because it breaks as you remove the inserts ( Grow Sponges ) for transplant . And it floats on the surface of the water -- none of the air circulation around the roots that AG advertises as so beneficial ( and I did n't find an explanation of why ) . And why do n't they need the Grow Domes and the Pod Labels ? Especially since the Pod Labels are advertised as useful/important in reducing the evaporation of water from the tank when you have the normal 7 pods vs 66 pods for the Seed Starting System.3 . The insert is similar to theHydrofarm JSEF55 Smart Float Grow Tray with Plugs ( and about the same price per position ) . Searching keyed to that product and its ilk may produce useful advice ( I have n't looked yet ) .==== Examples of problem in the documentation ====1 . The maintenance schedule omits any mention of the existence of the filter on the water pump , much less cleaning it and changing it ( every 6-8 months ) . I discovered this when scanning the product offerings on the web site . Similarly , the online maintenance schedule had n't been updated to include this model ( the Ultra ) . This sort of sloppiness is common.Plus : The filters are very inexpensive , bur rather than including several changes , you have to purchase them , with S & H ; making them *very* expensive ( better alternative : go to a B & M ; fish/aquarium store ) .2 . When I clicked on what was advertised as an online tutorial for new owners , what I got was a brochure targeted at potential buyers formatted to be a glossy hardcopy handout . Most small startups try to avoid this mistake , and there is no excuse for a mature company to do it.3 . The documentation for the control panel is minimal -- just enough to get you started . I put water in the tank and started experimenting , but who knows what I missed or misunderstood.4 . When I looked at the advice on growing seeds for transplants , it said that the baskets came in two parts which were held together by the Pod Label . And in the AG product listing , there are `` Easy Transplant Baskets '' that `` snap away '' . However , when I looked very closely at the right picture , `` snap '' seems to mean `` break '' not `` disengage '' . Minor , but this is an example of the casualness of their descriptions.5 . For the seed kits , the descriptions of the plants can be vague . For example , it treats `` cherry tomato '' as good enough , ignoring/oblivious to the fact that there are a wide range of cherry tomatoes for different tastes and uses . I know that they have adapted some of the plants to better fit , but why not say `` similar to variety X '' ? 6 . Statements with no explanation . For example `` baskets help regulate moisture levels in pods '' . I could find no info on when I needed to change what was happening or how to accomplish that . Or was this simply puffery ? 7 . Fertilizer is specified using different units in different places : Milli-liters , fluid ounces , and `` season '' . I can convert between the first two , but why do n't they just give both together ( eg , with a parenthetical ) . As to `` season '' , if you look around on the AG website , you can find the Rosetta Stone . This is yet another example of AG not putting what seem to be normal efforts into making their documentation user-friendly. -- Douglas B. Moran	-1
Tried this in two plants , was able to find the plant in the iPhone app but was never able to sync it.Maybe I got a dud .	-1
This item is the perfect example of a product that is a great idea on paper but is terribly executed , leaving the consumer with a high priced paperweight that serves as a reminder of what could have been . First and foremost , this product ONLY works with iPhones , so all of the Android users of the world , DO NOT pick up this item until they come out with the app that they are promising to make available in the future . Second , the iPhone app is poorly designed at best and is in major need of an update to become more user friendly . Third , for $ 60 , you are able to use the device with only ONE plant . If you wanted to expand this to all of the plants in your house , the price would be astronomical . If you have a really expensive plant that you feel needs the extra time and care that a $ 60 sensor with a poorly designed app will provide you , this may be the option for you . For the rest of the world though , I think you 'll agree with me that sticking to the tried and true formula of watering your plants daily will be more than sufficient .	-1
First of all , I may not be the market for this product , a beginner gardener . I am an Extension Master Gardener , educated and certified by my state university and I teach horticulture classes . As such , I am comfortable learning the conditions my plants need and whether I can meet them . Perhaps this would be better for someone who has no clue as to whether something needs watering , but my use of this has made me not very trusting in its advice.The instruction sheet had several languages and was quite hard to follow . I found the English , but it was not laid out in a manner that made any sense.I put this in a potted Meyer lemon tree that I keep indoors during the winter . The plant should probably be repotted and I know the soil is not optimal . I fertilize it at appropriate times for the plant and its condition ( over-fertilizing and over-watering kill most houseplants ) . I was able to select the plant from the app 's plant database . It gave a little description of the care conditions.This takes 24 hours before you get the first real readings , which tell you if the plant has enough water , light and fertilizer . It analyzes the fertilizer needs by checking the salts level . I am not sure which salts it checks . You can see a live analysis of all but the fertilizer and a chart telling you what the levels have been live and at 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 months , 6 months and 1 year increments . I am not quite sure why the long history would be needed.The sensor checks the first few inches of the soil . Depending on the plant , this may not be where most of the roots are , and the condition around the roots are what counts . I had just watered the plant and it said the water was fine . It said the plant needed fertilizer . I do n't think it does as it does n't need a lot this time of year , but as I wanted to see how well this worked , I fertilized it with a liquid fertilizer , which should have hit the sensor . The display continued to tell me I needed fertilizer until , after several days , I told it that I had done that . This would not give a beginning gardener any indication if they had under- or over-fertilized.The database told me that Meyer lemons needed four ( out of five ) dots for the fertilization level . The analysis does not use the same dot scale , but instead a 0-5 . The analysis is showing a very low level ( about .5 ) , but the & # 34 ; to do & # 34 ; list no longer shows it needs fertilizer . I would much prefer a consistency between the recommendations and analysis . The only factor that is consistent is the temperature , which is given in degrees on the plant care and analysis.My plant needs as much sun as I can give it indoors . I have it in a south window , but the size of the plant makes it shade the sensor during parts of the day . Because of this , it tells me I do n't get enough light . I would be O.K . with this , but I know that part of the problem is that the sensor is shaded by plant leaves as the sun moves . I had to tell it I moved the plant and the warning went away . It has n't come back and I did n't really move anything , so I do n't have a lot of confidence in this.It is telling me my water is fine , ( again , the analysis is % , but the plant care guide shows water drops ) , but by looking at it I can tell it needs watering . The live monitor says the level is at 17 % and the plant care recommendation says the plant needs two ( out of five ) water drops . I am going to give it another day and see if it tells me to water , but my experience tells me I should be watering it today.Ideally this could be used for a week or two for a gardener to learn the needs of a plant , then moved to another plant or turned off . However , the fact that I ca n't trust what it is telling me makes me unlikely to recommend it . Sorry .	-1
This app tries to be too hip for its own good . First off it only works with Apple iOS . Not only that , it only works on the newest apple products . 4s or later iPhone , newest iPads and iPods . Though I have an iPad AND an iPod , they are not the absolute newest , and will not run.I managed to borrow a family members iPhone 4s . I found it does track light , water , and other things for the plant , you can choose the correct conditions from virtually any plant you may grow . The app is a bit cumbersome , and is n't very well designed.Really , do you need a $ 60 device ( you 'll need one for every plant ) to tell you if it needs water ? People have been growing houseplants for thousands of years and got along just fine .	-1
I understand Cutter is pushing their & # 34 ; dry & # 34 ; backwoods bug spray , but at this price for 4 ounces , it 's not a good value . DEET is the active ingredient in most all bug sprays out there . This one is 25 % DEET . Coleman sells the same amount of bug spray ( 4 oz ) at 100 % DEET . I ca n't imagine why Cutter calls their product & # 34 ; backwoods & # 34 ; when it 's a paltry 25 % DEET ? Sure it goes on smooth and works well - but this amount at this price - not worth it to me . I 'll stick with 100 % DEET products , no matter what the cost .	-1
The concept for this bird feeder makes sense - have a baffle that prevents the squirrels from getting at the food . The grate covers the seed , so that if any squirrel can get past the baffle , they ca n't get at the seed.I placed this bird feeder at the end of a long metal hook that hangs from a tree branch ( like I do all my bird feeders ) . Unfortunately for us , the only creatures that came near this bird feeder were the squirrels . Even on a day with only a very slight breeze , the baffle constantly moved and this seemed to scare away the birds . By day 2 , the squirrels had gotten past the baffle and were munching on the bird seed . Not only that , but they somehow managed to knock this feeder off the hook and it was on the ground ( the only feeder I 've ever had that has been knocked to the ground ) .Considering how easily the squirrels got to this feeder and how little seed fits in the tray ( as it can only hold about 1/2 pound of bird seed ) , this feeder did n't work for us .	-1
Calling this feeder squirrelproof is like saying that chocolate is a weight-loss food . Seriously , if you want to keep squirrels away from bird food , follow this simple formula : your feeder must be at least 10 feet from the ground and at least 5 feet from the nearest tree . Squirrels can jump 10 feet up and 5 feet sideways . Hang your feeder on a metal pole . Otherwise , it & # 8217 ; s bon appetite , furry friends .	-1
I 'm always game for trying any bird feeder that might make it more difficult for my chubby backyard squirrels to get at the birdfeed , so I was really excited to be offered this one from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review.After 6 weeks of testing this Perky-Pet 412 platform feeder I have to honestly say that it is a great squirrel feeder but a not-so-great wild bird feeder . In fact , the only birds who even bother with this feeder in my backyard are those nuisance starlings and grackles.Depending on what I filled it with during my 6 week testing period - seed , suet , peanut nuggets or mealworms - the platform feeder did attract a few species of wild birds at first . As a full-time resident of the Gulf coast of west central Florida where the birdlife is unusually rich and abundant , I have identified many species at my other bird feeders but only the starlings and grackles continued to visit this platform feeder , especially when I filled it with peanut nuggets or mealworms . ( The squirrels , by the way , do not like the mealworms ) .I positioned my feeder in a nearby tree using a 36-inch `` S '' branch-hook which provides a lot of clearance around the feeder to foil the squirrels . The adjustable dome is designed to wobble and throw the squirrels off balance when they attempt a raid but my squirrels still manage to get under it , tilt the feeder and spill the food . I do n't mind this too much though because I also enjoy watching the birds ground feed.The Perky-Pet platform feeder is made in China and requires some assembly . It is easy to assemble but the wire grate that fits overs the metal feeding dish is warped on my unit and is a very poor fit , leaving about a half inch gap allowing the squirrels a better foothold and easier access to the food . I have since removed this grate inasmuch as it serves no good purpose.The distance between the dome and the feeding dish is adjustable but the dome is also a poor fit and sits at an angle , wobbling and bouncing wildly on its spring with the slightest movement of air . It is not a bad looking feeder but I would visually like it better if all of its pieces were a straighter fit and the feeder did n't look so wonky.The feeder requires frequent cleaning which means dismantling the feeder . It 's a bit of a hassle to disassemble the feeder twice a week but necessary to prevent disease transmission in birds through decayed and contaminated food.But during the process of frequent disassembling , cleaning and reassembling , I 've done a little experimenting with this feeder trying to make it a more successful feeder for wild birds and this is what I 've discovered:1 . The grate really is useless so I just keep it off.2 . The bouncing dome does not deter squirrels . Rather it scares the birds away . So I tried keeping the dome off in order to attract more birds . This did n't really work for attracting desirable birds other than nuisance birds . I also discovered that the dome is actually beneficial for keeping the feed protected from the elements and bird droppings . So I decided to continue using it.3 . The dome does work better when I reassemble the feeder without using the spring . The dome wobbles much less and is more steady without the spring and therefore does n't frighten the birds with that frantic wobbling.After all this tweaking I 'm still not satisfied with this Perky Pet feeder . I most definitely would not buy another . Nor would I ever recommend it . In fact , mine has gone in the trash.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend theBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic . Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny . My Brome feeders paid for themselves in no time , just by what they save me in all the birdfeed that the squirrels can not access .	-1
This is an OK feeder , especially for smaller birds , but it does have some problems.First , is does n't hold as much feed as other feeders , so you will e refilling it more often.Second is the squirrel baffle . I like how its height can be adjusted to keep larger birds like Blue Jays and Starlings out of the feed , but it moves so much in the wind , it chases off the birds I want to attract.Which brings it to three , no birds ! between the design and the baffle swinging back and forth , my birds seem to be avoid this feeder . I may try it without the baffle to see if they will use it more.Overall , I am not impressed by this feeder and really ca n't recommended it .	-1
Update , April 2014 : My original three-star review is posted below . I am updating to remove one star . A few weeks after posting my review , I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder , chowing down on bird seed . When I went out to chase him off , he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome , but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away . Squirrels are amazing acrobats , especially when there 's good food to be had . This feeder will not deter them.Original Review : Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder , but in actual use the results are n't as good as I 'd hoped . Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option . However , when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds , the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome . Then , while they were feeding , they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring , like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder . The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea , and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food . I 've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they 're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full . Once the level of seed drops , the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate . I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out , then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they do n't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill . I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate . However , the feeder only holds half a pound of seed , so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance . So far I have n't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder , so I ca n't comment on that yet .	-1
This is a mediocre feeder . It is n't sturdy on it 's own , so make sure you hang it somewhere it can be leaned on for stability . Birds might or might not like that . The birds around here seem to not be big fans of it.In terms of how tight the seeds are keep -- that does provide a nice seal , so that the deer are n't attracted to it.If you have a small townhouse or a balcony in an apartment , this might work for you better than the regularly-sized big feeders .	-1
I glanced at the other reviews as I was scrolling down to the customer review button , and I see a common theme that is consistent with my opinion . This feeder is not as good as I was expecting . It looks and seems cheap . If I had not received this for free to review I would be returning it . I even debate hanging it up . The grey part looks like plastic , although when I tap on it sounds like metal . My husband 's first comment was the squirells can probably get into it . It is very small . It 's under $ 20 , but still I think there are better ones out there for the same price , or invest a little more money to get a better one .	-1
I 'll start by saying this feeder does not work in my large , rural yard which is host to plenty of red & gray squirrels . I have had it up for 2 weeks and though the steel housing so far seems solid , the clear section , which seems to be plastic , is already showing signs of chewing wear around the seed flow opening . It is only a matter of days before that hole will be twice its original size . Plexi glass would have been a much better choice . The 2nd squirrel issue is that the top does n't latch ; savvy squirrels have had no trouble flipping open the top - plus the wind has also caused to top to pop open.I do like the flat back and ability to mount to a wall or post . I used two nails , one for the handle and one for the slot on the back , to ensure it would hang securely . My perspective is that for a person without squirrel problems and who wants a small feeder to attach to a wall or post , this will most likely do the job and is why I gave it 2* instead of 1* . Sadly , I 'll be taking mine down shortly because it just does n't work for me .	-1
This is not a very good bird feeder . First of all , the top has no latch to keep closed - it just pivots open . Any squirrel can open this easily and just eat from the top . Also , not clear from the photo - this is not a cylander . It has a flat back for mounting on a wall or post ( which is what the description says ) - but the photo made this unclear.My big knock on this ( only two stars ) is because of the top mechanism .	-1
It speaks poorly when a company does not minimally test a product before bringing it to market . The Perky-Pet Top Fill Bird Waterer is a good idea failed.There are so many things wrong with this design that it is embarrassing . Only small birds possibly could sit on the flimsy plastic base ring and turn in just a way to drink water that is , if water stayed in the container and did n't leak on the ground . Our container lost all its water in just over an hour . On a positive note , you do n't have to worry about water getting stale or dirty as you do in a bird bath . This design does n't even work as a last resort for hummingbirds because there ai n't no water there . Nuf said . Shame On what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products .	-1
It 's a beautiful day here in New Orleans , calm , the breeze is barely stirring , and yet the slight breeze is enough to de-perk my perky bird waterer . This is actually really cute , I hung it on a plant hanger and it looks cute in the yard . I noticed the perky waterer seems very flimsy but I hung it up anyway.The waterer , in theory , will be filled by rain , but if I hang it in a tree the branches would interfere , plus , here in New Orleans , rain is usually accompanied by wind , so this would be flying around and spilling out instead of filling up.I saw a bird trying to land and drink and the waterer swung around like a carnival ride , the bird looked confused and so am I . This is so light weight and ever time it swings just a little water drips out this way and that . I have filled it four times since hanging it up yesterday . Neither the birds nor I are impressed with this bird waterer .	-1
I ca n't really tell if the birds like this or not ; if I fill it in the morning , it 's empty by the time I 'm home from work . If I fill it in the evening , it 's empty by the time I wake up in the morning.The water in the basin keeps 'filling ' until it overflows and drips out , so this waterer basically just leaks itself dry in half a day , or less . Nevertheless , for the sake of doing a thorough review , I kept refilling it and checking it later -- yesterday , I noticed it lying in the yard ; the basin / reservoir had come off the top part . I guess a squirrel or bird got on it and it broke off ? Anyway , the bottom line is this is n't worth the money . You 're better off with another waterer , or a classic bird bath .	-1
I imagine this would work if the tray were deeper . Fill it up and it 's empty in a matter of minutes because of all the water pouring off the unit . Even sitting flat on the ground , it empties out very quickly . I really like the idea of a top-filling water dispenser for the backyard birds , but pass on this one until they redesign the tray .	-1
When I first used this , the water dripped out of it within the hour , but it really does depend on which side you put the disc on that is underneath . However , the writing is hard to see as to which side is right , and even when it 's right , it 's only good if the wind is n't blowing , which is almost never . I think the wind tips it and it drains out . I never got to see any birds on it because it was a new item on the bird feeder and emptied out so fast . It was a good idea but poorly executed .	-1
This is a plastic water reservoir and tray designed to provide liquid refreshment for wild birds . It weighs 10 oz empty , and holds 2 quarts of water . It stands about 10 & # 8221 ; high and is 8 & # 8221 ; in diameter . The top is plastic mesh , allowing the reservoir to be filled from the top , or to be refilled by rainwater . The waterer includes a metal hanger on the top lid to the reservoir . The design allows water to trickle continuously from the reservoir to keep the lower tray full at all times . The lower tray has toe holds on the edges for birds to perch on.I hung my waterer in my back yard , which is generally filled with wild songbirds . In addition to feeders , I also keep a self-standing birdbath in the yard . The waterer hung for a week in a bush near both the feeders and the birdbath , but no birds made use of it during that time . Then I had to move my feeders indoors because wild bears were seen in the neighborhood stealing from bird feeders . I figured this waterer would be safe to leave out despite the bears because it did not contain any food , and did not smell like food . But I was wrong . Bears are smart & # 8212 ; the next night they went straight for this waterer because it looks like a feeder and hangs like one . A bear cub walked right up to the waterer , took a sip from the edge , then tore the waterer apart . I also had problems with leakage with this waterer & # 8212 ; if the waterer does n't stay completely level , then water drips over the edge of the bottom tray , and the reservoir slowly empties onto the ground ( it can completely empty in as little as 15 minutes ) . Even if you manage to hang it so that it is exactly level , a gusty breeze can tip it ; I found half the water gone after a windy night . What I can I say ? Perhaps this waterer might work in urban environments where there are no bears and birds are really thirsty and you do n't have much wind . But if you live in an area where bears are a problem , a self-standing birdbath might be a safer bet since bears do n't expect to find food in them .	-1
Sorry to say that this was cheaply made plastic waterer and leaked . I followed the direction and set it out to hang from a branch for the birds to enjoy . A few minutes later , I noticed it was half empty and there was a puddle on the ground below . I thought I did something wrong but when I took it apart , re assembled it and added more water , I noticed that the bowl was not sealed properly to the base cap and leaked from above the actual bowl . I had to toss it before any birds got to enjoy it .	-1
I own several Perky-Pet feeders and a few are fine and some are total failures -- this one falls into the latter category . I honestly have to wonder if anyone at the company actually *tried* this bird waterer before they tried to sell them . My guess is they bought them wholesale from China sight unseen and then tried to market them : bad idea.The idea is brilliant : a bird waterer that can refill itself on rainy days , or that can be easily filled from the top using a garden hose or whatever . Great idea ! The problem is that this thing simply does n't hold water -- even when it 's perfectly level . I tested it in my kitchen sink and filled it with water and left it on bottom of the sink and came back a while later ( like a half hour ) and it was completely empty . So I tried it again , and I put it in a bucket with a perfectly level bottom to make sure I was giving it a fair test and ( insert buzzer noise here ) , another fail ! I 've been trying to think of someway to re-engineer this so I can find a use for it , but so far nothing.Who in their right mind would sell a product that did n't work at all ? If you want to give the birds a drink ( great idea ! ) do yourself a favor : buy a nice birdbath or a little garden fountain ( birds like running water , so the latter is probably a better idea ) .As far as this goes : Next !	-1
I have several Perky Pet bird feeders and have been pleased with all of them . I was excited to see this on the Amazon Vine , as I have wanted one for a long time . It was very easy to assemble , but Noticed right away how flimsy it is ... ..cheap plastic ! The first time I put it out the water just ran out . Tried again , and again water was gone in a few minutes . Filled it again ( I really wanted it to work ) and put it out . I checked again an hour or so later and it was lying in pieces on the ground ! I guess a big bird tried to drink and it just fell apart ! Sure wish it would work . I had high hopes that the birds would love it ... ... sometime the little birds , like the Chickadees , have trouble drinking out of the birdbath if the water is to low , and this feeder would have been perfect for them !	-1
Update : I initially gave this product 3 stars , mediocre , for the reasons below . However , I have now experienced more of the problems that some of the other reviewers encountered , and this waterer is pretty much useless to me . When I filled the empty container this morning , I apparently did not have it centered right on the hook , and water spilled out continuously . I tried twice to recenter it , but could not get it laser-level even , and it spilled until it was completely empty . No wind today . Do n't the designers actually test these things ? ? ~~~~~~~I like the idea of this bird waterer . The birds have not used it yet , but I think they probably will as weather gets hotter and water gets scarcer . Previous to getting this , I used a hummingbird feeder as a waterer , but that , of course , limits the kinds of birds that can use it . ( The feeder leaked , and I did n't want sugar water on the ground attracting ants , but a little water leaking was okay . ) So , this product should have been ideal . And it would have been had it been better designed and made.The reservoir is quite large , and when I am filling it and holding it by the saucer underneath , the saucer is so flimsy that I 'm afraid it is going to break.I could n't carry it outside without spilling on the floor between the kitchen and back door . The saucer is too shallow . I know that birds like shallow water , but the sides still could have been made higher . There is no lip or anything that helps keep the water from sloshing out.The waterer is hung on my patio , sheltered from most sun and most wind , but still gets a little of both . The slightest breeze causes it to spill , emptying it in short order . The saucer is so shallow that I ca n't even climb onto the chair I use to reach the hook without spilling water , usually down the front of whatever I am wearing.The top is perforated , supposedly to let in rainwater as well as making filling easy . What it does more often , in this land of little rain , is let in tiny bugs.The reservoir is frosted plastic , but I ca n't find information on what kind of plastic it is . I would prefer glass or plastic that is safe for water bottles . I do n't know if this plastic is harmful to birds.It is easy to clean , and the reservoir does hold quite a bit of water . A smaller reservoir that did n't spill so easily would be a better idea . I looked at some of the other waterers available , and several have different reservoirs but the same too-shallow saucer underneath.Given the negatives , this feeder with a patio light shining behind it in the evenings makes a very pretty glow . The birds do n't seem to care , though .	-1
I give this 2 stars because I like the concept of a hanging water feeder for birds that the rain can fill , but this one does not work as intended.Perky Pet makes excellent products that last . I have had their bird feeders and hummingbird feeders.When we first put this out , it was raining heavily for days . The container filled but drained almost completely . Now it has water in it that I put in , but it is not draining through the holes . I have never seen a bird sit on it , but of course , there would be no reason as the water does not come out.This will become a mosquito haven before too long so it is being removed.Until they improve this product , it is not recommended . Consumer products should not be tested on customers . Perky Pets ' engineers should have worked out the kinks before it went to market .	-1
I really wanted this to work as I hate cleaning the bird bath daily but like to provide one . I read the instructions and made sure the unit was securely in place filled with water and hung it in my backyard . I went to check on it 10 min later and watched the final water in the clear portion disappear . It was overflowing the saucer that is the only place there is water for the birds just what the saucer holds.Will try calling company tomorrow and will update if they have a fix that works .	-1
I love feeding the birds , and I provide a bird bath for them , as well . When I saw this , I thought it was a great idea . What it is is a huge disappointment . I have filled it and carefully hung it nest to my bird feeder . But a singe bird landing on its ledge , or a breeze , will tip the water out . This item is utterly useless.DO NOT BOTHER ! It does not work as described .	-1
There is little I can say that wo n't duplicate what others have said . It 's a great idea that I loved . But the execution of the idea is completely flawed . The darn thing does n't hold water . What good is a bird waterer if it ca n't hold water ? Perhaps if the bottom pan were wider and deeper , it would hold water ; I am not sure . I am going to try to repurpose it somehow and will edit my review if I find a way to make this useful .	-1
I have fiddled with this thing off and on for a couple of weeks now.The form factor is okay . It is n't ugly . It 's light , that 's a plus right ? It seems built for the size of bird my feeding station is geared for , so what 's the problem ? Well it leaks . A lot . The thing bleeds out in about 10 minutes . You might as well just fill the little dish at the bottom because that 's all that will be left 10 minutes after you fill the thing.If anyone else has tried a bird waterer that they like , please leave a comment below and point me in the right direction .	-1
I 've had this waterer out for well over a month now and have not seen a single bird come to it . It 's top fill , which is great , and which is not . Nasty stuff falls into the water turning it colors . The waterer is plastic and I suspect because of its light weight birds may weigh it down on one side . It 's really been a bust for me and never gets used despite being in the middle of four feeders .	-1
I 've tried it 4 times so far and , either I have the thirstiest birds around or it plainly just leaks . The bottom part ( that has a built in floater much like a toilet tank ) is not stable enough . If I gently press on one side then the water just starts dripping out . My guess is that 's what happens when a bird lands on it to drink.I 'll probably disassemble it and see if I can find the problem but so far it 's not working for me . Also , I wish that the top had a deflector . I hang it under my tree and all sorts of cruft still gets through the sieve at the top and into the water .	-1
The idea of a hanging bird-waterer is a good one , providing water for birds that shy away from the ground , in an elevated location where they are safe from predation . It 's both easy to top-off and self-filling ( with rain water ) through the perforated top . A flow limiter keeps the reservoir from just pouring out the bottom.So what 's to not like ? Unfortunately , a lot . For one , the bottom is too shallow to hold much water . Combined with the swaying motion of the waterer in the wind ( or its wobble when first hung ) , water dribbles/drips over the edge steadily , leaving an empty unit after a day or two . It 's possible the flow limiter is n't working right either , and allowing the pressure of the reservoir 's contents to overfill the tray.The platforms edge also seems too shallow/rounded for birds to grip and land -- the design looks like it might have been modeled after a hummingbird feeder ( they do n't generally land when they feed ) .Worst of all , I did n't observe any birds using the unit . Maybe they were just nervous about the new unit -- but they did n't shy away from the feeder on the same post , and did patronize the nearbydeck-mount birdbath ( since discontinued , but my favorite ) . Maybe `` puddle in a tree '' is n't natural for my birds ? I even tried the waterer at my mother 's house ( she 's an expert birder ) , with a different population of birds . No luck there either -- and she tried moving it to different locations and hanging arrangements in a futile effort to get birds to drink from this unit.Finally , the top does n't close tight unless you try ( hold the top and lift/turn the bottom ) -- otherwise it 's just a slight turn , and it does n't lock into place at all . I would n't be surprised if the waterer twisting in the wind works its way loose and comes apart periodically.I was able to easily fill the unit with a watering can , though a piece or two of leaf had already worked its way into the reservoir the first week of use . It would likely need to be cleaned out periodically . The bottom tray also gathered small leaves in the same week ( non-autumn ) .A good idea , but this implementation is badly flawed .	-1
I tried to give this waterer the benefit of the doubt because it looks nice and is a neat idea . However the sad fact is that water leaks out in just few minutes . At first i thought that maybe when hanging from the hook that a slight breeze was enough to cause the water to drop out and then for the try to try and refill . But no , even if you put this on a flat level surface , the tray below will fill and then start running over and pretty soon the whole thing is empty . Would love to recommend it , but in good conscience , I can not .	-1
I like Perky-Pet feeders . Every summer I put out regular feeders and hummingbird feeders . The birds like them and they 're generally easy to keep clean . The streak has been broken with this.A waterer is a great idea , especially here in the dry west . I was excited to have a chance to test this unit , but I began to get the & # 34 ; uh-oh & # 34 ; feeling almost immediately . It has a snap-together construction -- nothing particularly bad about the idea -- but I found that it was very easy to snap the bowl/perch area right off the feeder . The weight of a jay ( a common bird here ) would have been enough to snap it right off : that is if water had stayed in it long enough to attract that jay.This unit is extremely sensitive to orientation . Any tilt -- no matter how slight -- will be sufficient to drain it dry . This might be fine on a windless , airless planet . But here on earth , the smallest breeze was enough to knock it out of the vertical . I could see the water dribbling out , and it only took about 15 minutes for the thing to be completely empty . There were no evident flaws in construction . This is a problem of design.It 's top-fillable without disassembly . The idea is to catch rainwater -- a noble idea . But try filling it from a jug . It only accepts a slow flow of water and you have to stand there dribbling in the water for several minutes . I think it drains faster than it fills . Perky-Pet needs to head back to the drawing board ( or directly to the bin ) with this unit . It 's a great idea , but this implementation fails completely .	-1
This CobraCo Iron Fire Pit is one step above junk . The feet on the legs might be good for grass , but the are not made for a brick patio . The mesh cover does n't fit well at all , and I definitely would not leave the pit unattended.The first night I received the Fire Pit I put it together , and left it outside covered . That night we had a summer storm , and a lot of rain . Two days later I pulled the cover off to start a fire , and discovered the entire rim of the pit was covered in RUST . I ca n't tell you how shocked I was at that discovery . It did n't even seem possible that it could happen so fast . I 'm not talking about a couple of rust spots , I mean the entire ring was rust . I had to get soap and water , and scrub it off . You can still see that it has rust on it . In my opinion this is a toy and it 's junk . I ca n't recommend this . For a product that cost over $ 250.00 , it is a waste of money .	-1
I would not recommend purchasing this hummingbird feeder as it spills very easily . Even in the slightest breeze it spills everywhere through the flower openings . I recommend this Perky Pet hummingbird feeder instead : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GVLDF9K ( Perky Pet 210PB ) .Not only does this feeder not spill , but it also holds more nectar and I 've watched the hummingbirds and they seem to prefer it . Plus , it 's quite a bit cheaper . There is no competition between the two in my opinion .	-1
This has been a great year for the hummers in our yard . Have two nests , each with two eggs and a source of pleasure just watching . The one feeder that we have had just does n't hold enough and a royal pain to clean . So glad we were able to get this -- -it holds plenty of our `` nectar '' and refills a lot less often , very easy to clean . A great feature is the `` ant moat '' The top of the feeder has a indentation that you fill with a bit of water , preventing the ants from stealing the nectar ... .and it works ! After years of feeders in our yard I can honestly say this is a cream of the crop -- -- I 'm thinking the hummers agree ! A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space ! **May 17 , 2014 ... I AM RETHINKING THIS REVIEW , as the feeder is becoming a MAJOR LEAKER ! My wife thought if she were to quit hanging it in a tree ( wind causing it to sway ) , and place it on a stable post , that the leaking problem would be solved ... wrong ! Because the plastic bottom is in two parts , it is easy to clean , ... but , when putting it back together and screwing it on to the glass jar ... it WILL NOT SEAL PROPERLY ! Losing all of the Hummingbird solution by leakage is not what we bargained for ! ! ! We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet , as we had hoped that this new model would finally be the perfect feeder . If Perky-Pet could figure out how to attach some type of sealant or rubber ring between the two bottom pieces , that would surely help . We would like to think that the company is concerned enough to address this issue ! ! !	-1
UPDATE 5/16/2014 : I 'll leave my original review in tact below ... but I am going to change this to one star `` can not recommend '' because the feeder leaks like crazy . I do n't mean just a little leak , I mean red liquid all over the place kind of leak . At first I thought the birds were just feeding like crazy and that 's why the levels were going down ... then I saw because it was sitting on a picnic table that the entire table was covered in red gooey sugar water and the feeder had a slow drip . I 'm surprised that Perky Pet would release something like this with a quality problem of this magnitude ( it appears other reviewers have experienced this issue as well ) . Ca n't recommend , sorry.ORIGINAL REVIEW : There are lots of great reviews for this feeder already so I 'm not sure what I can add , but one thing that I did n't cross my mind when I ordered this large feeder ... you have to have a LOT of hummers feeding to consume 30 oz of `` nectar '' before it spoils in the sunlight and heat . Our hummers are very territorial and fight off others in `` their '' backyard so they can have all the flowers and of course this feeder to themselves . That results in the nectar going down much more slowly than I would have predicted.As others have stated , this is a great design , with a wide mouth opening on the REAL GLASS ( yay ! ! ! ) container ( dishwasher safe , do n't worry about a bottle brush as someone else suggested ) . The ant moat seems to work and the bright red color attracts those hummers . The nectar that comes with this is comically small amount ... only 8 oz vs 30 oz capacity of the feeder . You 'll want to make your own with sugar and water ( google the recipe ) and without any food coloring which is bad for the birds ( Amazon also sells clear nectar which is becoming the new norm now ) .One star off for being cheap with the initial supply of nectar , but overall an excellent feeder that seems design to perform and last.Hope this helps .	-1
Perky-Pet makes all sorts of hummingbird feeders , but I think this simple style is one of their best designs . This is a new model , but it has all the important features I look for in a quality hummingbird feeder -- glass , easy hanging ( S hook ) , durability and no leakage . I like this particular feeder because the wide mouth makes cleaning and filling easy , the base separates in half ( again for easy cleaning ) and it has built in bee guards and an ant moat . Most important , hummingbirds like it . We have over ten different feeders hanging around the yard , and it 's obvious which ones are preferred . Their favorite feeders are n't the fanciest or most expensive , but they all resemble this fundamental glass tube style.UPDATE : This feeder leaks like a sieve ! It held liquid just fine for about a month , but now the two-part base just does n't seal . I checked reviews , and sure enough , lots of other people are experiencing the same problem . Leaking renders the 209B feeder useless ... my five star review has been revised to one .	-1
This is OK soil for a garden but it is full of branch pieces , sticks , and even a few stones . If I am buying soil , I do n't want to pay for stones and such . I understand that it is not potting soil and could overlook a stick or two . This was just too much	-1
The perlite did not do much for my plants . I mixed the perlite with soil as instructed . However , the perlite always seems to find it 's way to the top of the soil . Maybe i am doing something wrong but i did follow the directions . Secondly , the perlite did not help the root development of my plants in any noticeable way . I used the perlite for Parsley , bee balm and pepper mint . The parsley still looks a bit weak at root development even after 4 weeks . However , i have not had any negative results either . No positive no negative , why bother ? For the extra cost without noticeable results , i dont like it .	-1
I ordered this with great enthusiasm but ended up disappointed . There are some things I like about it based on the description but many more things I do not like . Such as : I could never get the bottom not to leak after filling the clear reservoir . I tried it several times , nope its just going to drip . And if the wind blows the water leaks out of the yellow feeder holes . While it looks like it will hold a lot , most of the sugar water goes into the red reservoir at the bottom when you turn it over after filling so the clear portion is about half full . We actively have hummingbirds around and feeding , I understand it takes awhile for them to start using a new device but the whole time it was out I only saw one hummingbird approach the feeder.The ant block reservoir . In the meantime since it was hot the water that is suppose to keep out the ants evaporated and I ended up with ants actively feeding and getting into the feeder . Then the birds will not drink . While the water block is a great idea I really do not want to have to fill this constantly . A good idea but not practical .	-1
This otherwise well-built little feeder leaks . I tried tightening to the max : still leaked . Perhaps I was over-tightening and distorting the plastic ? : nope ; still leaked . Maybe some aquarium-grade silicone along the joins ? : nope ; no joy.My lawn does not need sugar water , but that 's where it is going . Into the trash with this feeder .	-1
This Rumford Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is the second hose of this genre I tested . The first one was the lime green Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose . It broke at multiple places in three months on very light use . This second expanding hose fared even worse ; it exploded with a loud pop on my driveway on the second use.Knowing the vulnerability of this kind of hoses , I had treated this hose with kid-gloves . I turned on the water valve from to and let the hose expand over a period of one minute before I turned on the valve fully . I used the hose only on smooth cement surface . I drained the hose after use and stored it in a covered bucket in my covered patio . The water pressure of my house is consistently around 75 psi , well within the norm of residential water supply . My advice to Amazon shoppers is to stick to heavy-duty rubber hoses . They are heavy and clunky but they do n't explode in your faces like these expandable hoses.P.S . There is no warranty or any contact info of the manufacturer in the box . The only recourse a buyer has in case of problem with this hose is to return to Amazon within one month . Outside of that , he/she is hosed .	-1
I love the idea and have used an expanding hose before , even directly compared this one to a new Pocket Hose Ultra . This one had too many drawbacks for me . After I got this hose untangled which took a while ( it does n't compress as small as the Pocket Hose ) I connected it eagerly . I was impressed by the brass fittings and sturdy appearance of the hose , but it 's maybe too much of a good thing . First off it would n't expand smoothly . The crinkled fabric outer skin bunched up in various areas restricting the water flow to other parts . I could n't manually smooth out the troubled areas , but figured since I did n't really need all 50 ' on my deck , that was n't a deal breaker.In order to get the hose to expand to semi-full size , its on/off 'switch ' must be in the off position so the water pressure builds up and forces the expansion . When expanded in that manner , the hose is quite hard and was not easy for me to maneuver . It is lighter weight than a rubber hose , but not very flexible . Once to the edge of my deck , I opened the pressure switch all the way and got the equivalent of the jet setting on a nozzle attachment . The water stream projected a long way , but would n't be suitable for watering plants . It had the force of my small pressure washer . Still , I thought that with a nozzle I might be able to regulate the water flow to my liking . I never did get around to adding a nozzle though because with the pressure switch open the hose started to contract back to a smaller size and I had to work to keep it from pulling me back to the hookup . I had to use more and more strength to keep it where I wanted it . It was not a pleasant experience.I 'd had enough with only the one sample use and went to turn off the water and try the Pocket Hose for comparison . I again turned off the pressure switch on the hose as I returned to the spigot , but when I turned it back on to drain the water after turning the water off at the spigot , the hose went crazy like a striking snake and danced out of my hand spraying me all over . Too bad someone was n't taking a video , it would win America 's Funniest.The Pocket Hose is a worm compared to this python . Of course it 's only 1/2 '' where this is 3/4 '' , but it 's far better behaved and that 's the hose I 'll be using until the plastic fittings give out . Still I gave this hose two stars even as I sit here dripping wet because for some folks , particularly stronger people than I , the pressure and power of this hose will be a benefit and the fittings may last longer than the wimpy ones on the Pocket Hose .	-1
All of these expanding hoses have the same problem : They burst . Most of them work great for a brief time -- you feel happy because they are indeed lighter and easier to handle than typical hoses that are unwieldy , heavy , and a pain to store . This is the kind of thing you can just unscrew and toss into the shed ... well , kind of . If your shed does n't get too hot.The thing is , it seems that it 's going to burst eventually even if you treat it right , but you 're supposed to really handle it with kid gloves : Do n't leave it out in the sun or cold . You have to shake it dry in between uses and store it indoors . It 's not safe for drinking water.If you 're absolutely determined to try this type of hose , then Rumford seems to be the best of them at the moment ( maybe due to the better brass fitting ) , but that 's not saying much . A product this likely to burst under normal use should n't be on the market yet .	-1
As with many of these types of hoses , there are too many restrictions on use and how you must use it . As they say you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks nor can you expect someone to change how they have used garden hoses all their lives . You are supposed to follow a specific method for initially operating the hose . Another factor in rating it a 1 is there is no manufacturer contact information included with the hose . None on the box and none in the directions . I also tried to find the manufacturer on the internet and no luck there either.If the hose goes bad , you are simply out of luck . Another concern is that this hose is not to be used for drinking water . Makes me wonder what is leaching out from this hose into the water and worry also about pets or animals drinking water that came out of this hose . The better option is a 50 ' coiled hose which we have two of . I bought two very good quality coiled hoses and have been using them for 3 seasons now without any problems . Overall I think these hoses are a useless gimmick .	-1
Look , it 's rare that I have trouble assembling a product , but as at least three other reviewers ( several of whom gave the product three stars ) have said , the fit and finish of this pressure washer are terrible ! One reviewer claims it took him an hour or more to assemble it and another said it & # 34 ; took forever & # 34 ; . Well , I do n't know about & # 34 ; forever & # 34 ; because I still have n't gotten used to the poor directions and the slipshod quality ! Those & # 34 ; directions & # 34 ; are small pictures of the assembly steps , with no text to speak of . The wheel assemblies themselves have to be separated before you force them into position and the handle assembly fits poorly and that also had to be jiggered and then forced , then the screws inserted . Somewhere past adding the handle assembly and a yellow piece behind it , I gave up and will considering spending even more time on this piece of junk , later.My gosh , with all the cheap plastic parts ( many of which do n't align without much effort and time ) , etc. , it will be a miracle if this unit lasts very long . And yes , the wheels do n't move easily , but that 's a minor issue , compared with the difficulty of alignment and assembly . What were these people thinking ? If I can ever get the entire unit together and operating , I 'll update this review . But the highest I can imagine rating this product is 3 stars , even if I can get it running for any length of time . And did I say the price is ridiculous , given all the problems and issues I 've already seen ? Well , the price is ridiculous ...	-1
**** See update below for why I knocked it down to 2 stars . Original review is here : ****I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004 . It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle . That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down . Then , one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass ! I could no longer get the MM675 model , so I went to Home Depot and `` upgraded '' to the MM1800 , the 18 '' corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker . Immediately I was dissatisfied . It did n't feel as strong as my old mower , was more unwieldy , and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver . Everything on it felt cheap , and two years later , it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick ( the motor blew out and smoked ) . I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B & D ; Mower.For mowing my own lawn , I did not consider gas because I do n't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard . I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I did n't want to deal with battery management . Cords are a fine option , but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said , B & D ; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower , and for the first time in my adult mowing life , I think I might be back to both B & D ; ( and using battery operation ) .Opening the box , I found the mower in 3 pieces . The battery was pre-installed ( with half-charge ) , so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle . The handle attaches in 2 parts . You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in , but once installed , they loosen with a simple lever . This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage . I have had `` easy fold '' handles before , but this one is actually easy . The mower is very light , and with a handle on top of the body of the mower , I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space . I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B & D ; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries . It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries , but gives no indication of the performance difference . This could be important because the 36V batteries are $ 80 and the 40V are $ 110 . So understand that you are getting over $ 200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies . The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad . You also get a really nice charger which has `` smarts '' to let you know when a battery is charged . Each battery also has a `` power gauge '' to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow ? I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season . Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts . I plugged in the safety key ( great feature to keep your mower off when you are n't around - it appears to be `` smart '' and wo n't let you just short out the terminals ) . I also decided not to bag initially . The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck . I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower ( no surprise - the grass was tall and wet ) . Most impressively , the mower stopped on tall grass and did n't burn out like my older corded mowers did . It appears to know not to destroy itself . You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going , a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor . I set it higher ( to 6 ) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance , I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other . Each worked for about 20 minutes ( not quite the 30 advertised ) . The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead , so no period of `` weak mowing '' when you 're not sure if you should replace it . When it 's dead , it 's dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you do n't need to fight to keep it open like other bags . It ca n't hold much , so you 'll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires . Unfortunately they are plastic ( not rubber or real tires ) , but they seem to get the job done . The mower is a total of about 17 '' wide , so it will fit into very tight space , but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall , I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management . If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you do n't want to mess with power cords , this mower is certainly a fine choice . All of that being said , be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower ( like the Greenworks 25022 ) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower . It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord ? If the answer is `` yes '' , then you will be quite happy with this B & D ; Mower . **** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today . While mowing , I hit a few rocks which is common around here ( very rocky soil ) . My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks , but it 's been going strong for years with the dings . However , the small ding knocked the B & D ; CM1640 totally out of balance . It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed . I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse . These were n't giant rocks mind you , but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers . As I pushed on , the mower caught a root and it was all over . The blade literally bent 90 degrees ( see photo I uploaded ) . It is now trash . Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks , and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots ? Both are possible , but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up . I have hit quartz , granite , and just about everything else in my yard , and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened ? I have a theory - it 's a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible . Looking at the blade , it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current . The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries can not be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot . The charger wo n't charge them . So you ca n't recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2 . Another issue ! I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower . Once again I left it outside , under my deck , all winter , and it finished up my yard for me today great . A few minutes with it reminded me why I left B & D ; in the first place .	-1
Oh yes there had been a mouse there . It left some hair and some feces but it walked away . Bad & # 34 ; trap & # 34 ; .	-1
These traps are without question the most horrific , most cruel , and most devious devices some truly sick mind has ever invented . Any animal , target species or not , will die a slow and terrible death , will break about every bone in its body trying to free itself from this medieval torture device , and either die of dehydration or blood loss due to self-inflicted amputation attempts.Why any decent human being would ever want to torture an animal like this is beyond me . Owls have gotten so hopelessly stuck on these terrible traps when they tried to grab what looked like an easy meal that they had to be euthanized . We are working hard to get these types of traps banned from US markets for good . Pets have gotten stuck on those things , and if you have ever tried to get this thing off a cat 's face and witnessed its agony and terror you might get a glimpse at what you are doing to animals if you decide to use such a trap.There are much more humane methods out there to eliminate a mouse problem , this is most definitely , without any question , the absolutely worst one you can choose . And if you still decide to deploy such a thing after reading this , shame on you .	-1
An old workplace used these around animal feed and areas where rodents tended to visit . I have never seem a more cruel , horrifying site than watching mice struggle to free themselves . If you are going to use a kill trap , at least use one that causes instant death . I ca n't get the horrible images of desperate , terrified mice out of my mind . These traps are horrifying .	-1
Whoever designed this product obviously grills differently than how we do it in the US . These mats are not suitable for conventional outdoor grilling , where high heat and licks of flame are part of the process . These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods , whether it be steaks , burgers , kabobs , veggies , seafood or fish . Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature , I still start out by searing the outside . Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for ? When I grill over fire ( wood or charcoal ) , even when I try to prevent flare-ups , they happen . And when I crank up the Weber gas grill , it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food . Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling : Why ? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing : Why ? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats , you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy , but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect ( caramelization ) , because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear . And , if you 've used a marinade , and if your food becomes juicy , the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip ... .Hmmmm ... ..So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS : They , also , are limited in use : The tips are rounded , not pointy and sharp for easy piercing . These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies . Forget trying to skewer tomatoes , onion rings , peppers or shrimp . Take a close look at the middle picture , you can see how rounded the tips are . Also , notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer . What that means is this : You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole . Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable . Your food will definitely NOT hold in place . It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable , because it started out by going through a big hole.And I 'm not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting : Foil wraps any way you want it to , and it can keep fluids contained so you do n't lose the juices and so you do n't dirty a pan . These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill . *I received a sample product from TeiKis for review , and I 'm not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted . If I had paid money for this crap , I would be livid right now . I do n't regret spending the time writing a review on it -- my ultimate goal is to help customers think through their decisions to buy , before they hit the buy-button , and before things get ugly when they open a package and are disappointed by what they find inside .	-1
Original review : It 's going to take at least a season outside to see how this cover performs , but , so far it 'll do the trick . It 's a lot lighter than my last cover , but that one was getting new rip after new rip , despite it 's heft just by being on a sharp corner . http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCNEWM/ref=wms_ohs_product ? ie=UTF8 & psc ; =1This Budge Industries grill cover fits my grill nicely and is easy to maneuver for me ( a 5'3+ woman ) , it just seems like it could be too lightweight to really protect the grill from the elements . Only time will tell ! UPDATE : This cover caught under the wheel just moving it to the side to reach something and ripped before I even knew it was stuck . Disappointing since it was an easier cover to remove and put on , but with this fabric type , I 'm not surprised it tore so easily .	-1
This is that very thin material . It is not heavy canvas . It is probably okay for a mild climate , but will not last more than one season with heavy snow or rain . We had a table cover made out of this thin material and the wind shredded it after only two months . Spend the extra money and get a heavy duty cover .	-1
This is a hard product to review . I own three covers and this one being the most expensive just under 60.00 feels like the cheapest by far of the three lesser expensive ones . The material is almost a paper like fabric , it feels like it will never withstand the south florida hot sun but time will be the only way to tell . Just so you know , the 60 inch fits a weber genesis Gold and does cover all the way to the ground , I 'm just not sure of this thin fabric yet.In comparison I have a Weber brand cover that is 45.00 on amazon and it is a good heavy material has a vented front over the handle and it has lasted 16 years and is still in good condition tried and true . It could be longer but might be now.My other one is a Glorious Montana priced 30.00 on amazon and it is also a substantial cover minus the vent which is better if the grill is in the rain . For the price , of the three , I would get the glorious Montana . I use sheila shine on my stainless grill it leaves a water proof barrier to prevent rust and keeps it looking new .	-1
This grill cover is huge , big enough to cover both of our somewhat small grills at once . The true test of a grill cover is how well it protects the grill and how long its protection lasts . I can see that , so far , it 's doing a good job of protecting both grills simultaneously . By the end of the hot , humid Texas summer , I should have a fairly good idea of how long it will last , because any cover that 's able to withstand several months of obnoxious heat will probably last for more than a year . Time will tell , and , should it crash from the heat , I 'll update this review.FOUR STARS ! UPDATE : July 22 , 2014After less than three weeks , this grill cover has separated at the seams . Soon it will be on the ground in pieces ; therefore I have changed my rating from four to two stars , and I can not recommend this grill cover .	-1
I wanted to see if this grill cover would work well for both our Coleman grill and 17.5 HP Troy-Bilt lawn tractor ( since that is what many people use these for ) . First I tried it on the lawn tractor . It covered everything except the wheels just fine , and stayed in place great . It just fit , so it would n't fit a larger tractor.Next , I tried it on the grill . This is an average-sized , 50 '' wide 3-burner grill . It fit over the top okay , though it did n't quite cover the base . It was about 1-2 '' too short . Then I tried fastening the velcro straps on each side just under the side shelves to keep it in place . On one side they fastened fine , but on the other the slightest pull on one and it came right off . As a test I tried the other also - it came off with only a little more force , a little less than what it takes to tear a sheet of paper out of a spiral notebook.The picture on the product page does n't match the one I received . For one thing , it does n't show the 2 straps on each side , so maybe they were a last minute change ; without them the cover can slide around , and might even blow off in windy conditions , esp . on small to medium grills . The side without the straps is billowing a bit right now outside in moderate wind . Also , the seams on mine are completely different . The fabric looks similar , but mine has heat welding seals all along the bottom edge.I pulled the cover out to one side and measured it ; it would just barely fit a 60 '' wide grill of average depth and height , though it might be a very tight fit.The material itself seems medium-weight , has heat-welded seems and a cloth feel . It will probably last several years ( except for the straps ) .	-1
