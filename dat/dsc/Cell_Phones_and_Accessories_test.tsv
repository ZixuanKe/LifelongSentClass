the colors are so great on this case i really like the look and it fits great on my phone .	1
This phone has everything and I mean everything ! I use the note 3 for everything & # 34 ; work/personal & # 34 ; more than my laptop or ps3 . it has a lot of features that you can find online , but in the end it 's worth it !	1
I was afraid of getting it due to the & # 34 ; regional locking & # 34 ; complaints - but my aging eyes really needed the nice big screen . I made sure to activate it in the US with my T-Mobile PAYG , and it works fine on that ( the 4G is nice when available ) - and was happy it took my 3 UK and Orange Spain SIMs just fine . I sold my iPhone 5 on ebay and it even inspired me to get rid of my iPad and get the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 2014 edition !	1
Last year I owned the Galaxy Note 2 . I thought it was a near perfect phablet , except for just two main areas for improvement : Screen resolution/sunlight legibility , and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed . Now that I have the Note 3 , things are getting very very interesting ... .Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing : PROS:1 ) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen . There are a handful of improvements : * The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p ( from 720p ) . You can noticeably tell that it is crisper . * You will also find out that it is a bit brighter . For us geeks , that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max ( when auto brightness is turned on ) . * Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2 . However , it is still not as good as the HTC One 's screen . The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels ( velvety deep blacks ) . As a whole however , and because of its Pentile pixel system , it comes just a bit short of the HTC One 's Super LCD 3 . It is really nitpicking though , so you wo n't ever regret this.2 ) This phone flies , almost literally . The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag , and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart 's content ! 3 ) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it 's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note . Too much to describe all the functions , and you can do without it for most functions . But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4 ) All those software features ! Granted , you can do without most of them for day-to-day things , but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use . The are also too many to go through all , I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay , which uses the front camera to monitor that you 're looking at the screen and wo n't dim/turn off , which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages , etc. , holding the phone up with one hand , and your other hand is pre-occupied . No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up . This is especially and specifically useful for me when I 'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5 ) The sound is noticeably louder as well . It does n't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One 's dual stereo speakers , but by itself it is louder . This is useful when you are in a noisy environment , and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear . As good as the HTC One sounds , I hate that for most things like music and video , it is so darn soft and frustrating . I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6 ) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it , and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I 'm in bed at night . The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME . I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20 % will already be gone . And when I charge it , it trickle charges like a turtle ! With the Note 3 , being able to replace the battery is an added plus , and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly . But even these two advantages can not compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS : There are few things you can nitpick , like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy , not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones . With rumors of a new Galaxy line , this may be changed very soon though . Also , the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss . It 's not for everyone , that 's for sure . Luckily , being Android means we 'll never have to settle . My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look , is Smart Launcher Pro . Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I ca n't think of much else really to fault this phone , except for the fact that simply for what it is : It 's a niche machine that 's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement ( I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range ) , and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it , and do all the things you need one-handed ( I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S ) . But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is , then there is no better alternative . This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen , powerful hardware , useful software , and awesome battery life .	1
excellent phone i use in venezuela whit 4g Whit Digitel and is faster and powerfull i love that phone i recomend for all peoples likes better and excellent phone	1
I am very happy with my phone because i can use it in europe also . i got it very fast and it works great i love the prone	1
This smartphone is awesome , powerful , bright , excellent battery . size is not a problem due to many accesories are available including cases .	1
My only problem with the Note 3 is Knox . The very first thing I did with this phone was flash TWRP recovery through Odin , so I obviously know what I 'm doing as far as root 's concerned . And if you 're worried about performance on the Qcomm version , my Antutu benchmark score is 36354 .	1
It is great looking.Not much you can say except that it has everything a smartphone should have.A fast browser.Super apps.Great call quality.Excelllent resolution and loads of feature.Free yourself from contracts and go for it .	1
Great phone , very easy to setup and use . Everything is just as the features specify . My only issue is the charger being European . They should provide American chargers instead of an adapter . Overall , a great buy ! !	1
Note 3 phone is just amazing . This phone has all features your looking for in a smart phone . It 's a real keeper .	1
I 'm moving from the mini galaxy onto this..so ca n't really compare it to much other phones , I just know I wanted big screen , nice camera and fast . That is what I got . This phone works with Simple Mobile because thats what I have . I have yet to see 4G on my signal but I did see H+ , and from reading other reviews , I think thats some form of 4G . I 'm not bothered by it cause simple mobile is rather low priced for their services .	1
This is the perfect phone , i ` m married with samsung . This phone have all that you need and more ! Do n't hesitate and buy this one .	1
Very happy . There 's not much I can add to the overwhelming reviews that this product has gotten . I do n't think I 'll be buying another phone or tablet for a long time . This covers everything I could possible ask a device like this to do.The 9005 version will do 4K video ( some of the other 900 models do not ) , but it 's almost a non-factor . The bitrate is too low for any real quality difference . In fact , I recommend using standard 1080 @ 60fps video recording . You will get better results . Until 4K video recording technology catches up to the level displays have gotten , 4K is n't really practical yet.This one was configured for the French market I think . So you may have standard French apps , and some language settings you need to change . Not a big deal .	1
Awesome tablet holder . Stays steady even over railroad tracks . Holds my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 version very well and also my Galaxy Note 3 . I use it for both and yes you can turn it landscape or portrait . It swivels so you can turn it either way . Fits the cup holder perfect and the tightening system works great . I highly recommend it for a large phone or a tablet .	1
Love this item holds my tablet in place so I can use my navigatio , also adapter to hold my iphone	1
This thing is sweet so far . I have a Chevy Cobalt that has cup holders in the front of the console . This puts my samsung 7 inch tablet just below the radio . It 's perfect , like it a lot .	1
I gave it a 5 because it does what I need it to do . It is sturdy and adjustable . I would recommend this to anyone needing it .	1
When I got this , I thought it seems rather flimsy and poorly made . But I have had it for 2 months or so , and it works well . I do wish there were more adjustments you could make , but other than that seems good .	1
Sturdy and well designed . Arm folds neatly and out of the way . One part of the design that does not fit my cup holder perfectly is the top lip of the base designed to keep the arm level . My vehicle 's cup holder has a rubber edge protruding inward which I need to position above the lip . This forces me to place the base to the very bottom of my cup holder and so only the thin plastic lip is pressing against the cup holder 's inside wall . This causes the base to lose proper grip and shift when the vehicle is turning . I found I can wrap a thick piece a cloth just below the lip to use the full surface of the base and providing a very tight and stable fit . This is not a deal breaker for me as I know the design of my cup holder is different from many others and iKross did a good job of trying to accommodate most common types . The arm length is perfect for my center console and the simple adjustable angles and pivot points allow almost any viewing position . There are separate detachable phone and tablet grips that does not easily pry off , but I do n't interchange it often enough to worry about .	1
iKross 2-in-1 Tablet & Cellphone Adjustable Swing Long Arm Cup Mount ... packaged well ..fast shipping ..love the long arm ..it puts my phone up higher for better view ..do n't have a tablet ..was hoping it would work with my Garmin RV GPS but it does n't ... wish they made one for that ... I love the cup holder ones ..it keeps things off my dash to fly around if you get hit or hit something ... works in my SUV Town and Country and my truck ..Dodge 3500 cup holders	1
Good but unless the attachment for iPad is straight up and down it will vibrate off . Really annoying when driving .	1
Purchased for my iPad Mini , I use it in my work truck ( 2013 E-450 ) fits great , hold the mini landscape just like I wanted it to . I use my iPad for everything including professionally and I use it often . This holder makes my pad convienant , accessible and easily removable which is a big ++ cause I take it in and out of places all the time . On another note : I use my iPad for navigation now due to it being in such a convienant place in the truck and I 'm thinking `` why did I not do this a long time ago ... ? '' The iPad is a superior navigator over the Garmin nuvi I was using ... Superior in every way and did I mention it 's superior ? I use Google maps not the built in map app , boy what a difference ! No wonder Garmin 's , Tom-Tom 's and other portable GPS 's are getting so cheap . Once people find out their tablets are superior ( sorry I wo n't use that word again ) they will never go back . Jeez , I meant to leave a review about this tablet holder ... . Anyway I 'm very happy with it .	1
I LOVE this and I use it everyday . I use this for my tablet In the living room ( cup holder in the couch ) , In the theater/Game room ( cup holder in the recliner ) , in the RV . I am seriously thinking of getting a second one . The only change I would make is I wish the height was adjustable .	1
I received my case today . So first off i am happy about this to start . Case in my personal opinion feels good . The only issue i have is . The case is hard to put on and take off . However it does have a snug fit which is great.I would reccomend this case to anyone .	1
Love this cover for my galaxy note 3.It fits perfectly.It even makes it look way bigger than what it really is.Very easy to put in.And u have access to all the connections that u are suppose to have.Even the colors are perfect.Other then the fact that these are my favorite colors.It 's a really good product .	1
i love these i-blason phone covers they do what they are ment to do keep your phone protected . the thicker pading on the corner of the phone keep it so that if you drop it the cover stays in place and keeps your phone safe	1
I had one of these for my Samsung Galaxy SII ( which was stolen ) I loved it but hate taht when I got the Note 3 I would not be able to get one to fit the Note 3 ... Low and Behold ! ! ! ! They have them . The are fantastic protection for phones .	1
Not a bad cover and in not bulky . but in not as durable as more expensive one but it will protect your phone . Shipment was fast and on time	1
These make a great phone protector and this is the second set I bought one previously for another samsung model , if you turn the phone on it 's face it protects the screen from scratches because of the space between the rubber and the surface . We 'll made and easy to fit and the two tone is quite nice .	1
not quite what I expected but good	1
i like this case because it is blue and it protects the phone and it is durbale and even if you drop it it wount break	1
I purchased this for my hubby because Sprint nor Best Buy had covers for the Note 3 when I first came out : - ( so he had to go about 3days without a phone cover ... I WAS VERY SCARED FOR HIM ... anyway , shipment was FAST and it was an awesome fit and he has no complaints which its been awhile since we purchase this cover ... .OH and it does lose its fit like the outtabox covers ! ! !	1
I hate phone cases but this is as god as any . My note 3 is too big already . It 's not the phone cases problem . As cases go , its good . Not great if you like to remove it regularly . It wants to stay on .	1
I ordered this on a Monday mid afternoon and got it the next day through prime . I like the case . It 's very cool color oriented . I got the white one . There is so screen covr . It 's just the case itself . It seem it does n't cover the whole phone . It seem the edges and side would slip off any moment . But the plastic cover keeps it in place . The rubber part easily slips off the top and bottom corners . That is the downside . It should n't do that . This is only temporary for me . I will only have this phone for a year . I guess it was worth $ 13 . It could be a lot better tho .	1
Great case . Dropped my phone the day I got this case . Was so sacred when I saw it flying thru the air . It just hit the ground and bounced . Not a scratch ! Wish there was room for more cards but there is limited room . I use it as my wallet now . Keep my license and few cards along with business cards . Its a great case . Maybe someone will figure out how to make a regular wallet out of it . Once you put your phone in it there 's no reason it ever has to come out .	1
Love the protection .	1
I love this case . It fits perfect on my Note 3 . It has three slots for cards and another to place money . It is awesome . I highly recommend .	1
Bought this for my Galaxy note 3 , I can use this to watch netflix and to view my email with ease !	1
Very good product , highly recommend it . value for money and protect your phone very good . you can also use to put your credit card and licence in it .	1
I bought the expensive Samsung cover , okay so it turn off the device when you close it ... all advantage at that point turn to this cover ... which is much more versatile and cost only a fraction of what the OEM Cover cost me ... lesson learned the hard way	1
I thing i brought this solely for novelty purposes , but overall it is a good Quality case with a lot of uses .	1
It is so fashionable and my phone feels so much more secure in this case . It is a handy case to have .	1
I bought this for my husband , I had a Celleto case , but they did n't have the color in black . The case when your talking on the phone does n't fold back with magnet lock of latch and cover to back . This makes it awkward for talking on the phone to your ear .	1
I love the case . It fit the Note 3 and you are able to carry money ( paper ) and id . I also love that screen protectors that came with it . The price was excellent . It made this item a very good buy . Alas , my daughter did not love the color . I sold the case and the new owner raves about it . They especially like the way you could make it stand to watch videos and stand to play games . Do not hesitate to buy .	1
This item is as advertise great cover easy to used and accommodate the phone was a snap . I use it every day as a wallet , phone carrier and protector very durable great price .	1
Well put together , worth the money . I have this as a back-up case in case something happens to my main one the i-Blason Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Note III N9000 Prime Series Dual Layer Holster Case .	1
I purchased this case for my daughter and she really likes it ! Her favorite color is pink and it fits her new phone perfectly ! !	1
Really was hesitant at first to purchase this cover . So happy I did . Fits perfectly . Easy to remove phone from inside insert without any trouble . I say this because the last note 3 cover similar to this I could not remove my phone without breakage of the insert . This is easily removed allowing access to my sd card . Easy to put in and easy to take out ! It fits my hands perfectly and I do not consider it too bulky . Also it takes great pictures with no interference . The holes are cut perfectly and also allows easy access to the s pen.It looks like a wallet and I enjoy how easy it is to shut with the magnetic closure . I have a bright pink one easily seen in my purse and intend on getting several different colors . Does not interfere with phone conversations . You can hear the phone ring and if you have voice to answer it can just say ANSWER and carry on a conversation while traveling in car with contact that just called you.It is well made and looks like real leather . Has place for driver license and credit cards as well as cash . Protects the cover of your phone so while it is in your purse can not get scratched with keys or something else . Excellent priced and perfect !	1
Fits the Note 3 perfectly . Nice quality leather . Separate case holds phone and attaches to wallet . Nice protection . The only complaint that removes one star : The magnetic tab obstructs view when in landscape mode and hard to text two-handed when in wallet because of flap . A nice product and good price . I will continue to use until I find another that does n't have this small issue . Would like S-view window but not completely necessary .	1
Excellent cover .. very well made . The storage slots in the flap as well as the cover are very helpful . Also appreciate the ability to use as a stand .	1
I loved this case and I 'm sorry it took me so long to write a review I did n't know I had to until today . thanks	1
Fits the Galaxy 3 Note perfectly & seems to be good quality . It certainly is a good value for the money .	1
The case is nice and slick , almost as if it 's leather based , but it is n't , It could second easily as a wallet , my husband loves it	1
I got this case as a surprise for my niece and she loves it so much and I am planning on buying her two more for Christmas .	1
The product is a little pricey but you are getting quality . Like the slot features so that I do n't have to carry a purse and can just hold the phone with ID .	1
hard rubber case inside fits exactly and makes all the buttons work.wallet pouch is soft , but little too fat.It looks like a pretty wallet.nice color , nice pockets , nice design .	1
My sister ordered this case and she absolutely loves it . Very stylish and practical all in one . Great color too .	1
I absolutely love this case , it does n't look cheap and for the price you cant beat it . It fits my note 3 perfectly , good quality phone case/wallet , you cant go wrong with price for this . Best phone case iv'e ever had .	1
This sturdy case is excellent as an everyday cover for my Note 3 . The pink color shown is what you receive . I love the slots which I use to hold my MetroCard , credit card and ID . It also has a pocket ( behind the card slots ) which you can use to hold money or receipts . The quality stitching is evident throughout the entire leather design . It has a magnetic closure which is strong enough to keep it securely closed yet I do n't need to fight with it to access my Note 3.The rubber holder fits like a glove for your Note 3 . It does n't bulk up up the device and yet is not flimsy either . Keep in mind , you can not remove the rubber holder from its leather shell . You can easily access your stylus , both cameras , earphone and charging ports . It even has an opening for the mic.I highly recommend this case for the quality materials and slim design .	1
I chose this case because I thought it was cute , it also holds my case very well along with any cards I choose to carry in it .	1
This is a nice wallet for the Galaxy Note 3 . Looks elegant and comes with a case which fits the phone nicely .	1
Nothing outstandingly great or terrible.Somethings to note if you are considering purchasing this.The frame that holds the device has covered indentations for where the volume and power buttons are , not holes . They are rather difficult to press through . This is both good and bad . It 's bad because you 'll need to press strongly if you use these buttons often . This is good because it prevents accidental activation and if you do n't use these buttons that often it 's fine.Strap has a strong magnet and makes for an easy and secure closure.The slots for holding cards on the flap also houses a magnet . Poorly magnetized cards might lose their information if they are oriented with the strip facing the edge . Typical cards are usually not a problem but the occasional hotel card-key might degauss .	1
Love it ! Best screen saver EVER ! Tried other screen savers , bubble 's , hard to apply correctly ! Not with this screen saver . No matter what phone I have I HOPE this screen saver will be of available ! ! !	1
nothing special if you like this kind of thing , tried it for a while decided it was not needed and removed , dont carry phone this big in my pocket so not really needed , seemed to work fine with finger and pen just took away from phones screen view in my opinion	1
I was finally able to install a screen saver on a smart phone . It protects the screen , is easy to clean , and reusable .	1
it was simple to apply to phone and looks durable . ca n't tell the different of the screen with the propertector on . The shipment was really fast and on time .	1
Wow finally a screen protector with NO Bubbles . It does work , just follow the instructions . Clean the screen with alcohol first , and they recommend running steam in the bathroom to get rid of dust . The installation was easy for a change .	1
OMG ... this is truly the BEST screen protector EVER . It does exactly what it says and it IS bubble free . I would highly suggest this screen protector . It puts all the other flimsy protectors to shame . I have and will continue to order from i-Biason .	1
Not to bad . . Arrives pretty quick and it comes with 3 screen protectors . I myself have sausage fingers and took me all three screens to put it on but once it was on , it looked great ! Worth the money for sure . The screen protector is very Precise for the Galaxy note 3 so when you install it you have to make sure you put it exactly even on all sides or you will have bubbles .	1
Very happy with this product . It goes on clear and the phone does not look like it has a case . The s-pen functionality still works and after a few weeks , the screen protector is as good as new even though I keep the phone in the same pocket as my keys , pens and the occasional kids toy.Included in the package is a microfiber cloth and stiff card to clean the screen and squeegee the air out of the cover . I did n't use the cloth as I put on this cover right after removing the screen cover from the factory . My first attempt did n't line up perfectly , so I lifted up the screen protector and reapplied . The screen protector did n't leave any wrinkles and you can not tell I removed the screen protector and reapplied .	1
Got it on time and I love how it fits on my device . Also the price was really good . Recommend it to anyone with a galaxy note 3 .	1
very clear	1
sorry it has taken me so long to write a review I did n't know I had to until today but this is what I was looking for . thanks	1
I got 3 of these for my new note 3 . I must say I like it better than others I have tried in the past . Easy to install with no water , sticks well and is almost unnoticeable when applied . Great job guys	1
Case is soft tpu and its matte in the back providing non slip.case does not add bulk at all and at the same time prvides protection.The shiny black part of the case matches the black phone making it invisible.THIS DOES NOT WORK ON VERIZON MODEL as it says on the description.The case is easy out easy in , it does not stick.in your pocket too.If you have screen protector it does not lift it.Personally i like this kinda case coz it slim and does not add any bulk at all . I recomend this case to someone who like slim cases.this case is very flexible and durable .	1
I had this exact case for my Droid Razr M and I loved it . I switched to T-Mobile and immediately looked up Fosmon cases.What I like : The two tone color , I think it looks sharp.The grips on the side , the phone never slips out of my handThe snug fit , it does not come sliding offIt is removable without issueAll ports are accessibleThe price ! - Are you going to find a better case for under $ 5 ? What I do n't like : Nothing , this is a great case , get one .	1
The first Fosmon case I bought was for a Tab 3 8.0 . I was very impressed with the fit and finish of such a low prices case.When I got the LG G2 phone and was looking for a case I first looked at Ditztronic and Cruzerlite and then saw that Fosmon had a TPU case for under $ 4 shipped I thought it was worth a try , and it was.I really like this case and it fits very well . It does have an extra mic hole for the AT & T ; version of the G2 ( Mine is T-Mobile ) but it 's not a big deal . The only thing is the hole for the USB cable is a little tight on the top so I had to open it up a tad . Took me 5 minutes and looks factory . Small price to pay to save $ 6 to $ 10.I will be looking for Fosmon cases first from now on when getting phone or tablet cases . I have found them to be constantly good in fit and quality and a great deal	1
I 'm impressed with this case and would recommend this product for anyone with a G2 . It helps to keep the phone protected .	1
Feels great knowing I have a bit more protection on such a pricey phone . The best part is that the case even covers the volume rocker and power button . I love it !	1
I was kinda iffy about ordering this , but I decided to go for it since it was dirt cheap and it was n't like I was gon na be out a bunch of money if it stunk . But let me tell you , this is probably the best case I 've ever bought for my note . It comes up and around the front of my phone so if I were to drop it screen down the case would protect it . The teal color that I got shows the pretty backing of my note ( because let 's face it , the back plate of the note is so pretty compared to other phones ) . It has form fitting covering on all the buttons on my phone . It 's soft material feels pretty good on my hands when I 'm holding my phone and texting for extended periods of time . I ordered this on Tuesday night and it was in by Friday . I had bought a $ 35 case from my cellular provider but this case does n't slide off like that one and I totally regret ever buying that expensive one when I could 've bought this in every color . : )	1
This item seriously took about three days to arrive , and it was packaged in a padded envelope along with packaging inside the envelope . A bit stiff to use at first , but I think it 's because I have to break the case in . I have to press a little harder when I push the volume button or the power button , but it 's a really nice case . Covers the corners so that when I dropped my phone it did n't get damaged . Good buy .	1
it was not thick enough to give the camera some space between the surface and itself if you were to set the phone on its back . It really is a great cover , but I prefer something a bit thicker to protect the lens and the screen .	1
This was perfect for my phone and of great quality . I would definitely buy this product again in the future .	1
I bought these specifically for the antifingerprint feature , and they work great ! They 're easy to apply ( well , as easy as any screen protector is & # 8212 ; a bit like the game Operation ) but the employees at my local T-Mobile store offered to apply screen protectors for free if I wanted , so if you 're having trouble or just plain intimidated by the process , you might stop by your local phone store and ask if they 'll do it for you . They 're probably pretty good at it by now ; ) I have n't seen any bubbling or peeling away at the edges in the 3 weeks I 've had one on my phone , and I did n't have a case on it for the first 2 weeks . They are great for antiglare , too . I 'll definitely be buying these again when mine are gone !	1
Works as intended . Really cuts down on the Clare but also cuts down the beauty of a naked screen . A must have for use in bright areas .	1
Tech Armor Apple iPhone 5/5S Premium Anti glare and Anti fingerprint Screen Protector is one of the best screen protector in the market . The screen protector is not too thick or too thing . Therefore it ensures that it does n't effect the resolution . I did n't feel any difference with the phone 's touch screen accuracy . The screen protector is scratch proof . It also comes with a lint free cloth , smoothing card and bubble removal tape.Things I like : + Lightweight+ Good Quality+ Will last long time+ Scratch proof+ Price ( Way cheaper than some other screen protector with similar quality ) + Lifetime Warranty+ Easy to install+ Received 3 screen protectors.Overall , the product is priced very fairly for the quality of the product and the warranty that it comes with . I did n't have anything negative point about this product because I could n't find one . I would highly recommend this product to everyone .	1
I just got the iPhone 5s , instead of buying screen protectors like these at my wireless store and paying almost $ 20 for them , I decided to wait and order these , and I 'm really glad that I did . I 've purchased the screen protectors from wireless stores before and they 've always been fine , but these are great too , for a fraction of the cost . These went on easily , I did n't get any bubbles , they stay on , there is no glare , nor any oily residue from fingers or face . I highly recommend these .	1
They gave me more then one screen Protector inside which is awesome . The package was shipped pretty quick . I am happy with this product . My screen is safe from scratches . You cant even tell that I have it on . Im in Love with it .	1
yes ! ! ! works well with my daughter 's case . protects and improve visual fields . wish it came with her case when ordered	1
Very good screen protector that has good quality and is well made . Tech armor has always been good on every phone I have had .	1
The tough armor screens are from a very good quality.I had adquired another package for an Iphone 4 and the screens were very good also.I recommend this product.The only thing that I saw is that it 's a little difficult to install the screen , I have seen another screens that comes with a liquid that helps to clean the screen of the equipment and it 's also used to align the screen in the equipment , this screen do n't have this accesorie.I normally use two screens for each equipment when I am installing it , because I usually made a mistake installing the screen the first time I try.But once the product is installed in the equipment it 's a very good product of a very good quality .	1
This was so much easier to apply to my iPhone than the screen protector that was included with my Otterbox Commuter case . I like the feel of the matte finish and its antiglare properties . I have n't had it long enough to make a determination of the durability of this product yet but I 'm usually careful with my phone so do n't see this as an issue . This is a three-pack so I have two spares just in case .	1
I would say the product has met our expectations . It is sitting well on the device except for the few kinks of bubble that we could not get off . May be we just need an additional technique as the wiping and pushing did not help .	1
I have bought multiple screen protectors for different phones that I have owned , for friends phone and for coworkers phones . They fit well and do n't cause any issues with use . They go on easy and come with instructions to help prevent bubbles . The trick is while applying the screen protector slowly remove debris using tape .	1
We put this on my wife 's iPhone 5C . It does the job well and does n't show fingerprints.Although , the texture ( which is what masks the finger prints ) seams a little heavier on these than some other that I 've seen . Not a big deal but it does degrade the image quality a little .	1
I think the company is amazing , I do n't like the Matte screen protectors though . I was n't expecting it to kill the quality of the screen so dramatically also the anti glare was n't up to my expectations . I contacted them and they quickly responded and told me that the Matte screen protectors are n't for everyone and that they would send me out some HD Glossy at no charge . If you 're in need of screen protectors only buy from the best and that 's Tech Armor .	1
Now I can really get a lot of use out of my Galaxy Gear without fear of scratching it . Great Product !	1
**Update 10/27** After posting my initial review I was contacted by Jeff from Tech Armor about a revised screen protector that has a better fit and more coverage . He sent it out and a couple of days later I received the updated protector and I 'm very pleased to say that the fit and coverage is WAAAY better . It now fits the entire screen so it no longer feels weird when you 're swiping around on the screen and I have n't had any issues with it catching on things . The new & improved protector along with the great customer service has led me to change my rating from 2 to 5 stars.I LOVE Tech Armor protectors . I have them on all my devices , my wife 's devices , my brothers devices , moms , sisters , etc . They 're such a great value for the price and super easy to install . When I saw that Tech Armor was releasing a protector for the new Galaxy Gear I figured it was a no-brainer . I purchased it , got it the next day ( Thanks Amazon Prime ! ) and went to install it . Installation was a breeze as usual , but I was very disappointed to find out that it only covers part of the watch face ( the actual LCD area ) and not the whole face . This makes swiping around feel odd since you 're always rubbing the edge of the protector with your finger . Also the one of the corners keeps catching on something and gets peeled back . I love the clarity of the protector , but ca n't really stand the feel of rubbing the edge of the protector everytime I use the watch . I think this is a bad design flaw that hopefully gets corrected soon . I 'm currently using theArmorSuit Galaxy Gear Screen Protectorand it covers the whole face of the watch .	1
Go out and by it now if you have a gear watch . It offers very good protection . Very easy to install .	1
I got this product for my WIME Wi-Watch M5 smart watch . I had to cut about a centimeter of the bottom and it fits perfect . No bubbles and the sensitivity is still there . Swipe and touch not affected at all . I would recommend this product to others that have the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch or the WIME Wi-Watch M5 .	1
Fits well , easy to apply .	1
The screen protector is very clear and pretty much no existent when applied correctly . I suck at applying these so it took me three tries before getting applied correctly . I used the top camera and speaker to guide myself and not the bottom home button as recommended . I will buy a few more just as a backup and as gifts for people I know that have a iPhone .	1
The 'insurance ' provider through cell phone carriers is n't worth it ! I find it far better to not waste money on them and just invest in other protection options for cell devices . Between the case and the screen protector , the phone is better taken care of . This screen protector works great and we have put one on all 3 of the iPhones in our house	1
Great screen protectors . Had them on my 4S . Upgraded to the 5S . Easy decision to buy these . Love them . Figured out a trick to apply them easier . Lay phone on towel . Remove the first cover ( screen side ) grab like you would hold a point and shoot camera with both hands . Slightly bend the protector along the long axis . This allows you to line up the front camera , ear speaker , and home button . Then lay it flat , get the bubbles out . And you 're ready to roll .	1
I 'm horrible at putting these things on and even I did it correctly the first time ! Unfortunately , something punctured the screen protector ( SO happy that I had one on because it would have scratched the glass otherwise ) so upon taking it off , I did n't have as much luck putting on the other two . I saw on the package that they have a lifetime warranty and figured it could n't hurt to contact the email they give you and let them know that I messed up the other 2 in my package . I figured they 'd tell me that my error was n't covered under their warranty and if that was the case , it 's ok , they were only 7 dollars . But instead , within 8 hours ( I sent my email at night and had a response in my inbox the next morning ) they asked me to send them my Amazon order confirmation number , confirm my mailing address , and then they shipped me a 3 pack for FREE ! This is the absolute definition of superior customer service . I will be a Tech Armor customer for life with every phone or tablet I have .	1
I 've been using this screen protector since the iphone 5 came out . It does what it say , protect the screen from scratches . one thing i like is the lifetime warranty . if the screen protector got scratches , you can request new one if you run out . I put my phone in my pockets and on tables . Sometimes I forget my keys is in the same pocket so the protector prevent scratching the screen . When i 'm working , there are times i put stuff on top of my phone without noticing , so I have to replace it a few times and the best thing is it 's free when i run out .	1
The screen protector itself becomes statically charged when you remove the cover so it 's best to remove the first peel-off and place it quickly on the phone or it will start to attract dust/hair of opposite charge . Once the screen protector is on it is , in fact , crystal clear . There is nothing to make it feel like a screen protector , which is what I wanted . This serves the only purpose I think a screen & # 34 ; protector & # 34 ; should serve and that 's to protect the screen from scratches .	1
I rarely use the word & # 34 ; transformation & # 34 ; but this crystal clear , GLASS screen protector will let you see your screen just like nothing is on.After years of sticking plastic sheets on our screens , which offer no protection in a drop , this beauty will give you back the brilliant clarity of the retina display and will sacrifice itself in the event of a sever impact . Tech Armor is correct that it has 99.5 % clarity and 99.5 % touch sensitivity . I consider this the best accessory for the Iphone anyone can buy . Because it 's so thin and beautifully engineered , it 'll work with any case/cover . ( It has & # 34 ; home button & # 34 ; extender pads , but you do n't need them . ) I strongly recommend taking it to your Verizon or AT & T ; store where either will guarantee a perfect bubble and dust free install.When your phone store & # 34 ; tech person & # 34 ; hands you your phone back after the install , you 'll say the same thing I did- & # 34 ; WOW. & # 34 ; Enjoy .	1
These are nearly impossible to get onto a phone , without multiple bubbles . I used all three before getting the last one on the phone just right . The anti-smudge ones are 100 % better , and do n't allow any & # 34 ; gunk & # 34 ; on the screen from faces & fingers .	1
It arrived in the mail pretty quickly . I liked how it comes with a little cloth and stickers to remove dust . The first time I placed it , I ended up with a lot of bubbles . However something most people do n't know is that they can be rinsed with water to make sure you end up with less bubbles/ make it easier to apply . So I used the same one and ended up with 2 bubbles in the corner which I think is better than using all 3 protectors . Over all the product is good and comes with extra accessories to help you out . In my case I 'm just bad at applying these anyway .	1
Great product overall but I guess it 's just user error ... I feel like I have to hold my breath and really take my time with the application . Ended up going through two of these before getting it right . But I 've never doubted for a moment about protection and durability .	1
Yes it fits the iPhone 5c but it 's not a perfect mate to the upper and lower holes but it 's very close . The installation would be much easier if it came with the pull tab on the upper part of the phone . It 's much more important to line up with the front camera and speaker than the Home button . Still , i would purchase and recommend this . It works like it should .	1
These screen protectors are really easy to apply . I have had several disasters with other brands . They seem a better quality than most . My package came with two and should have had three . The vender has already contacted me to resolve problem . Have recommended them to family and friends . Great price for a great product !	1
Great ! Tech armor HD screen protectors for iphone 5c are great . Come in a pack and everything are good , will purchase more in the future . Love it .	1
Item seems to be high quality . Good price . On the 2nd day of having it on my phone , I accidently skid a sharp tool thru the screen , and it left a very deep cut in the screen protector , but the IPhone screen was untouched . On the negative , it had only two screen protectors enclosed , instead of the advertised 3 ? ? ? ?	1
It is exactly as described ; no complaints , and it arrived quickly , and was easy to apply . I would n't hestitate to recommend this item .	1
This is the 3rd Tech Armor screen protector i 've purchased this year , the first for an iPhone . As usual the protector works well , and is a great price . Installation was fairly easy since the phone screen is not very large . The only thing to note is that by putting this protector on an iphone , you will feel the edge of the protector around the home button . It '' s does n't interfere , but feels like a rough edge . I would guess this is an issue for any protector being put on an iphone 5 .	1
I got the 3-pack when I purchased two new iPhones . I put a screen protector on the first phone with relative ease . All was aligned perfectly and worked out the bubbles . It looks good and offers good protection . I did not have the same luck with the second iPhone one week later . I just could not get the screen aligned perfectly as the first one . A small piece of screen was over the front camera opening . In my efforts to remove and re-install , I ended ruining both remaining screens . I am not going to buy another set . I will just have my phone without a screen . The point is that if you are a perfectionist about alignment , you may have a problem with installation .	1
This is my 3rd brand of screen saver ! ! ! ! ! ! All provided perfectly adequate screen protection , the strongest difference being the application process . I found this one to have the most concise , well written and illustrated instructions by far . I was able to EASILY and quickly apply it with no issues at all . All of the other brands were problematic for me due to screen sheets that did not easily separate causing too much lifting and repositioning . I also felt others I tried did not have easy to decipher application illustrations . I did not encounter this problem at all with the Tech Armor screen sheets which were EASILY applied with few bubbles . The few bubbles present were EASILY removed . I am very happy with this product thus far and would highly recommend .	1
Pros : Very Clear , 3-pack , cheap , simple.Cons : not perfectly straight when applied to phone.Overall , I would give them 8/10 .	1
Red is my favorite color ... .I love this ... I really like how the handle is at the top of the wallet instead of at the bottom ... .keeps all of your stuff from falling out . Arrived in excellent condition and very quickly .	1
This case is nice and sturdy I love it it is the best one I have ordered so far its very pretty	1
I absolutely love this case . It 's GORGEOUS ! ! It came very fast . Love it so much that I might also buy it in another color . The material is good , the strap is very strong . I have many cases for my phone & they are all very nice , but this one blows the other ones away	1
My sister loved it , very feminine and I thought it was great quality until the flower fell off . So disappointed . I gave this to her as a gift , very embarrasing .	1
I bought this case for those nights when I want my Note 3 to match my glammed up style.I love that this case has a window pocket for my ID . It is able to show all of the necessary information without having to remove it . It also has slots for my credit cards and MetroCard . The pretty white flower which is also the & # 34 ; lock & # 34 ; keeps everything in place . The gold color wrist strap feels secure on my wrist without being annoying . The pink color is true to what is shown on the site . The quilted shell keeps everything safe ( do n't have to worry about water damage ) while I am enjoying the event . I like that the vendor ( HandHeld ) sent a mini stylus with my purchase - it really does work with my Note 3.Highly recommend when you want a special upscale look for your Note 3 .	1
Got it as a gift . It protects the phone well and it 's eye catching . The only worry i have is the bow tie at the end seems like it will come off if it 's hit directly . But it 's on pretty well .	1
This case is absolutely beautiful ! ! ! ! I got this case for a lady I know , she love it . It really looks well made . Does n't have a cheap look at all . I was n't sure when I ordered . When I saw it I thought she 'll love it , she did ! ! Very nice product .	1
yes I would consider this item to other people . I love the convience of this item because you do n't always have to carry a purse it 's a mini wallet .	1
Love my phones case , very good quality and worth the wait ( 3wks ) . If you 're looking for something sturdy , this is it and cute !	1
I wanted the color shown on the display . I received a black one with bling . It 's pretty , but wanted it a light color . So it 's fine . It 's nice , just the color issue .	1
Very pretty case ; once I got it and used it a coupler of times ; I made the determination that it 's more for the younger generation . But again it 's pretty .	1
I use this clamp on many applications . Car , paddle board , boat , railings ... Its my favorite mount as it works anywhere unlike the other gopro mounts . I really do n't think you can go wrong with this . As for the price , it is what it is ... overpriced but there is n't currently a great alternative .	1
Just came back from a trip up to the mountains . In the way up , I had the Hero3+ mounted directly to just the clamp portion . Camera stayed in its original position and I had some great video . On the way home I forgot how I had it mounted and use the long neck portion as well . While the neck does take some force to bend it to the position that you want , I guess the winds at highway speeds were enough to bend the neck back a little which changed the position of my camera to shoot higher than I wanted . What a bummer . Clamp itself is VERY tight , it 's not going anywhere by accident .	1
Very strong clamp , so much though that it may crush some items if they are not very stiff . But it 's a nice mount .	1
Got this to clamp my GoPro and it works as advertised and sometimes use the arm to film and keep steady when I am moving .	1
This is my favorite mount for my new GoPro camera . The clamp portion is very strong and will provide a solid base for the camera . The neck has some flexibility , but not so much as to reduce the solid foundation for the camera . It will be used often .	1
It was a gift for my son and he says it 's a good product . I would buy from this source again .	1
JUST RECEIVED MY GOPRO JAWS SO I CAN USE IT TOMARROW ! WOW , this thing is great . Made well , strong grip.And compared to MSRP everywhere else it 's worth every penny ! Especially if you are a die-hard GoPo'er . I am and this item will give me more and more of what I want on my boat when doing video 's ( one a week at least ) . FAST , EZ , scene changes and angles . I have tried it all and TIME is always of the essence.I 'll still give it 5 stars , even though I thought the & # 34 ; flex & # 34 ; part would swivel 360 degree 's but it doesn't.I 'm ordering ANOTHER ONE !	1
We mount our GoPro to the roll bar of our Caterham , and I got tired of having to unscrew the roll bar mount to remove the camera every time we left the vehicle unattended . I thought this , which has a quick release mount at at both ends of the neck , would be a better alternative . I learned fairly quickly that removing the camera from a quick release mount is n't quick at all if you use the anti-vibration tab , so removing just the camera , leaving the mount in place is not a quick alternative . However , it 's easy enough to take it all with you . You can use this item with just the jaws or if you need it higher , you can leave the neck on . For us , mounting the camera directly to the jaws is perfect . The jaws hold firmly where you put it , but a firm squeeze and it all goes with us . This is a much quicker solution to the roll bar mount that screws on .	1
Most used accessory for GoPro right now . Can clamp pretty much anywhere .	1
I bought this arm for a trip to Anguilla . It is quite simply the best accessory to date . It is long enough that you can use it instead of a pole and I liked that . The clamp is very strong and the bendable arm is very solid as well . Aside from snorkeling and boating with this thing , I installed it to our rental jeep at various points and it was awesome and sturdy . It never came loose and although the roads were bumpy and uneven , it held tight.Love it !	1
I 'm always trying to take pics or video at the beach with my GoPro camera . The only thing is , if you do n't have it mounted on a tripod , it 's a pain in the ass to be in the picture or the video due to the underwater housing , and the complexity of some of the mounts . This Jaw Clamp mount comes in handy just about anywhere . Just clip it on anything , ( chair , tree limb , railing , etc ) , then move the head around to the position you want , and start the video ! It 's not very expensive , and it solves a lot of issues when it comes to taking video , or pics !	1
This Gopro rig is just very handy if you want to clamp onto something . I would highly recommend this rig for videos while stationary . The item was delivered in a timely fashion .	1
I remember seeing something like this on Kickstarter after it finished , thinking it was a good idea , and wished I invested in something like that . I guess luckily I missed it , because now of the official GoPro version which actually includes some helpful features the Kickstarter version did n't have . I like how this has the ability to stick on something as thin as a pencil with the help of the inside belts within the clamp , as well as the Gorilla Pod like structure so that it can shoot from any angle . I also love how it includes GoPro 's quick release clamp to easily use the top portion as a GoPole .	1
Got the camera for xmas and was wondering how I was going to keep it secure on my daily adventures.. This allowed me to clamp it to my motorcycle handlebars as I ride . The extension ( bendy thing ) comes off to which allows direct clamp install of the camera . Very secure mount for all my needs so far . I am looking into the helmet mount also .	1
I have this case for almost all my devices , it 's minimal and has saved my phone from small drops . The buttons are cut out , while I do n't prefer that it works for this case . It does n't add too much bulk either , plus it works on my Qi charger without having to take the phone out of the case .	1
Everyone loves the little droid on the back ! I was unsure at first if I would or not . I knew I wanted a TPU case cause they are my favorite , but the Droid kind of grows on ya , and people love it !	1
Fits perfectly , cut outs alignment dead on . Just enough protection but phone still looks and feels slim . Nice feel in hand , non slip but not sticky , slids into pocket or purse easily . Love design with Bugdroid . Case was reasonableprice and shipping was prompt .	1
Best case I have purchased in 10 years . Fit is excellent , protective and stylishYou can not go wrong and the price is good	1
Does n't add much to the size of the phone and has a good feel in hand . Just enough protection to save minor falls ans scrapes .	1
Fits the Droid Maxx great and allows increased phone protection from drops , bumps and bangs . Also does not add much by way of size or weight and still allows my 13 year old daughter to carry the phone in her `` skinny jeans '' .It 's not as energy absorbing as something like an Otter Box , but it also does n't turn your light weight and thin phone into a brick . It 's a fantastic compromise between protection and thin profile.I would absolutely recommend this product .	1
I love these TPU cases from Cruzerlite . They are very high quality , light weight , dont add much bulk and really do a good job of protecting the surface of your phone . They have the best fit of any cases I have tried and work better than any other case too . You do not need anything more than this to protect the body of your phone , hard cases and bulky cases do not do as good of a job as the Cruzerlite TPU cases	1
Love this case . It is not cumbersome it is very light and it does not prevent you from swiping from the edge of the screen . Easy to clean also .	1
Good fit , does n't add a lot of bulk , the Droid pattern on the back looks cool , nice semi transparent plastic . Adds just the right amount of bumper on sides to allow you to put the phone down on its screen without having to worry . All buttons and ports easily reachable . Very well done case .	1
I love the fact that this little case is so rubbery and yet smooth at the same time . It slides in and out of my pocket very easily , which is really important to me . I hate it when my case gets in the way and I ca n't get my phone out in a hurry . The rubbery feel of it tells me that it gives that little bit of shock protection , unlike a hard case . ( Just my opinion . ) My only complaint is that the fit is the slightest bit small . Like the edges are just not quite snug . But it is almost not even an issue . Really , the fit is almost perfect . Just not perfect . But not enough for me to not buy one like it again ! Did I mention how adorable the owl is ? ! It even has subtle sparkles in it ! ! Oh , one more thing ... .this thing shipped from China and it only took 3 weeks . Not bad .	1
I got this for my wife and she loves it . I would recommend this product . It fits good and great price too !	1
I purchased this case for my girlfriend iPhone 4s , she absolutely loves owls and this case fit her phone perfectly . She is totally happy with it .	1
I love this case.. it is so cute and i compliments every where I go ! It shipped fast and is super sturdy ! ! ! ! !	1
Looks just like it does online ! Great and protective case . I would buy it again . Its very sparkly and I got lots of compliments .	1
I love , love , love this ! it is so adorable and cute , and it came in when it stated it would	1
Nice case . Plastic case that surrounds the entire case .	1
It is to cute I love it ! Just a little lose on my phone from one side / :	1
This product is a STEAL at $ 13 . Fits the GN 3 PERFECTLY . SUPER EASY APPLICATION . I have no complaints at all . Great job Bear Motion .	1
it is so clear that you can not feel anythingEasy to apply and install , best of the best screen protecter you can get !	1
The tempered glass screen protectors are the best thing ever created . Easy to apply . Protects great . No plastic feel when using your screen .	1
I have always been against the plastic film screen savers . I always hated them , and have an iPhone since v1 . Since the iPhone 5 , I opted to not have any screen saver whatsoever . I felt Apple 's screen was made well enough to go without . But then a year ago I dropped my phone outside on the concrete and it fell just right and cracked the entire screen . Had to go into the Apple store that night and get a new phone . But I still did n't use a screensaver even after that . Then the other day I was looking at my iPhone 5s ' screen and noticed a few tiny hairline scratches . If my phone is n't in my pocket , it 's on my desk . I keep it very safe and rarely drop it . But then I read about tempered glass screen protectors so I investigated and purchased the Bear Motion one based on reviews and the thinness . I wanted the thinnest one possible and as of this writing , .2mm is the thinnest.I received it today and immediately put it on . After I took it out of its packaging I said to myself , & # 34 ; this is glass ? & # 34 ; It seemed to thin to be glass , so it must be plastic , right ? Nope . It 's not . Amazing . I cleaned up my iPhone 5s using my own microfiber towel and the hot air from my lungs , then used their microfiber cleaning cloth included with the packaging . Peeled off the back and using four fingers , slowly lowered it down onto the glass of my phone , positioning it just perfectly.To my amazement , my placement was spot-on perfect and not only that , to watch it magically adhere within 1 second blew me away . I mean ... you could see it clear the air and adhere on its own . I did n't even have to press it . down . Nothing short of magic here , folks . No bubbles . Perfect alignment . This was , by far , the easiest screen saver I have _ever_ installed on any device I 've ever owned . Still not convinced it was that easy , I pressed down everywhere on the cover just to make sure . It seemed futile , though . It was already on there.Mind : Blown.So here 's the wrap-up so far . I 'll update my review as I continue to use it : Pros : - Great packaging ( does n't need much to be honest ) - Easiest installation EVER- Magical self-adhering- Thin as can be . Do n't get anything thicker than .2mm or you will regret it- Does not interfere with any cases I have , including my Mophie case- Clear as can be . Does not reduce the quality of Apple 's screen or touch/gestures- I can no longer see the hairline scratches in the iPhone 's screen that I noticed before . It did a nice & # 34 ; coverup & # 34 ; Cons : - As thin as it is , my home button ( Touch ID ) still seems like a deeper press . My finger hits the edges of the glass every time which is a bit annoying . However , the Touch ID works fine . Just feels like I 'm pressing into a deeper hole because of the glass on top.- The edges of the glass do n't seem smooth as I 'd like them to be , including the home button cutout . The outside edges do n't bother me much here ... it 's the home button 's edges that need to be smoother . Perhaps this just is n't possible with glass this thin ? I will continue to update this as I spend more time with it . These , so far , are just my initial thoughts on this product . If all goes well I am going to buy 2 more for the other iPhones in my family .	1
Great items , cheaper than MIME or Spigen but does the job . Not as think and the package is not as nice as MIME or Spigen . A good value buy , no issues .	1
It 's a good product , cleaning the screen before applying is the hardest part but they do give you some tools.It fits good and lines up perfectly.It 's definitely not smudge proof though so if you 're expecting that go spend more money elsewhere . For $ 13 it 's a steal.Would buy it again ( and I did because I was n't happy about the first time I installed it ) If you ca n't afford to shell out $ 30- $ 40 bucks , this is definitely a great alternative !	1
I bought two Bear Motion glass protectors from Pro Ebiz ; one for my wife 's iPhone 5s and one for my Note 3 . Both were shipped promptly , turned out very we 'll and can honestly say that they 're well worth the price . Installation was straightforward . If you 've done screen protectors installations before , these are just as easy or even easier to install . I used the bathroom with the hot shower trick to minimize any airborne dusts . Once everything settled , it was just a matter of aligning the protectors with the phone 's screen and dropping them . Squeeze a little and your done.The Bear Motion glass protector is .2 mm thin and is definitely thinner than the other .4 mm glass protectors . I compared it to my old Bodyguardz I used on my Galaxy S4 and my wife 's iPhone 5s . What I really love about them is how they feel . The Bodyguardz did not have the same oleophobic properties as the Bear Motions protectors . These BM protectors are also very smooth and slippery , even more slippery than my Note 3 's screen . I can really feel it when using the s pen . Also , because they 're so thin , there 's no need to use button stickers to raise the home button on the Note 3 . They are almost flushed . On the iPhone , the button is not as deep as with the Bodyguardz protector . In addition , the rounded edge of the BM screen protector makes it easier to handle the phone specially on the iPhone . This allows a more comfortable feel specially when using the fingerprint scanner . In comparison , the Bodyguardz screen protector felt like you 're going to cut your skin when using the fingerprint scanner.I almost bought the Spigen glass protector because I also bought their New Hybrid case for my Note 3 . I 'm glad I tried the Bear Motion protector for half the prize and thickness . I most definitely highly recommend this screen protector .	1
I am so impressed ! I thought I would try a tempered glass protector , and I do n't think I will ever go back to anything else . It is so smooth , feels very nice , and if anything , I think my screen is even more responsive ! I had some concerns with the protector , and checked it carefully before placing it on my phone , looking for cracks or other defects . finding none , I carefully cleaned my phone and placed the protector on it . It was truly the quickest job of fitting a screen protector I have ever had , and no air bubbles . Then I noticed a line crossing my camera lens , it looked like a crack , and a bullseye distortion at the bottom of my screen . I contacted the seller , who advised me the bullseye was likely a bit of dust on my screen that did n't get cleaned off . They offered to send me a replacement , and I received it very quickly ! I just wish this company made these for the nexus 7 ...	1
I tried this after a Bodyguardz protector that had bubble issues.I installed this with a Seidio SURFACE Case with Metal Kickstand.Pros-GREAT price compared to other-Good clean quality and perfect cut glass-Easy to install-Fits perfectly level with the Note 3 bevel , which allows for installation of a good case-NO bubblesCons-Directions page was small print , but I did n't even use itNot sure how it will hold up to impact if I drop it , but I trust that is tempered glass and will do the job .	1
I was very impressed because I never bought anything from this brand b4 . but the glass fits perfectly and is very easy to put on . first try I got it right with no bubbles . it very clear and people wont notice you have screen protector on . I have used it with several cases with no problem however . I have n't used with any real bulky cases cuz I do n't have any . Just make sure you follow the directions .	1
I have installed many screen protectors in the past and this one is an easy one to installed . It took me 2 minutes to put it on perfectly . I like this glass screen protector because I like the feeling of glass rather than plastic film . The price of this is cheap too . This is a very thin glass screen protector compared to other ones . When i installed the screen protector , I saw many small moisture deposit 's that are only visible under light . That is why I took off a star . It is still a great screen protector and hopefully those moisture deposit 's will disappear after a few day . I recommend this screen protector.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation , and I promised that my review is fair and honest .	1
I have a much larger charger for my living room , TYLT Vu Wireless Charger for all Qi Phones - Retail Packaging - Black , but this smaller charger is AWESOME for travel and using next to my bed ( takes up a small amount of space on my nightstand ) . When going to bed , I can simply lay my phone down without searching for a plug or worrying about if the phone is charging . When traveling , this takes up no more space than my phone itself and it 's very lightweight . Works just as quickly and easily as my other Qi-enabled chargers ... and this one was at a great price point . Recommended !	1
Man I can barely remember those dark times before wireless chargers . This thing has been the best tech buy in a while for me . All I have to do is place my phone on the pad and bam when I wake up my phone is charged . Since I use my phone as my alarm I no longer have to worry about yanking the charger out of the wall or damaging my phones usb port when I start my series of snooze pressing .	1
I have been using this for about a week now and have had no issues with it ! The lights on the front are not very bright and do not disturb me at night.Device has made NO noise since I have been using it . ( Which is great ! ) Phone does not have to be super perfectly aligned . ( But I think this is more determined by the receiver in your phone . ) Very thin and easy to slip in a bag for use at the office.Made the girlfriend jealous that her iPhone does n't have Qi charging !	1
Just bought this Qi wireless charger for my Nexus 7 FHD and Galaxy S4 . Bought the S4 receiver as well and it was a simple installation . The wireless charger works flawlessly with my Nexus 7 and my S4 . It provides a low affirmation tone when it 's charging the phone or tablet . I 'm glad it does so that I know it 's charging without having to look at my devices.I 've been using the charger to charge overnight so I ca n't comment on how quickly it charges , but my Nexus 7 is fully charged in the morning and it 's usually drained by the night before.Definitely a great buy , especially for the price . Been using it for about a week now and have had no issues . I 'll update my review if I run into anything in the future .	1
The Techmatte Qi charger is compact and works great with Smartphones that have Qi back . I use with Samsung Galaxy S4 which has aTechMatteTM Qi-Standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV . The charger has a red LED light on the mat . There is a beep sound when the phone is placed on the mat . The Samsung S4 also indicated a pop up box , that wireless charging is in effect . If the phone is switched off while placing on the mat , the phone has the wireless symbol in addition to big battery icon.I did not test with other devices but Qi is an industry standard and works with any phone which has Qi compatible back . The device is seld contained and comes with usb cable as well as power adapter . My phone was charging even with the Sungg fit S4 case . Just take the phone out and place on the mat . Very convenient and highly recommended ! I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review .	1
This wireless charger works well with the Nexus 4 . It is easy to set up ( just plug in to wall ) . Then , just place your phone on the pad to begin charging your phone . It is that easy.This wireless charger will do a good job of charging your phone over night , if you want to keep it on your nightstand . However , the best use that I envision for it , is at work on my office desk . If you just keep your phone on the pad while not using it , at the end of the day , you will have a full charge without having to plug your phone in and out whenever you need to use it or walk away from your desk.So , consider this charger a convenience item that also protects one of the most fragile parts of your phone ( the power/USB port ) . On many smartphones , the power connection is the first thing that will give out , and then you are stuck without being able to charge your phone . This wireless charger will reduce wear and tear on that plug , so that your phone will last longer ( as long as you do n't break the screen or drop it in the toilet ! )	1
It 's a really nice , full-featured and good looking charger . It 's made of very good plastic ( I really love to touch ! ) , scratch resistant and not slippery ( good to put on the nightstand ) . Charger has a very tiny light diode ( will turn to white during charging but the light is n't annoying ) . Also , charger makes a soft `` beep '' sound on start charging - it 's very useful and helps to adjust device properly , very good feature ! I 'm using this charger with my Google Nexus 7 ( 2013 ) tablet and very happy , can recommend to anyone !	1
The delivery was on time . The case looks exactly same as pictured and I like It because it fits very well my nexus5 and feels nice in the hand . The back of the case has a nice look . You can tell that the material the case is made from will absorb the shock if you drop the phone .	1
I got the black case for the T-Mobile version . Its a pretty decent case with a very good tight fit . The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I feel the value for the price I paid is a little bit lacking . It protects the phone to a fair degree and also feels good while holding it.Probably one of the better cases for the G2 at this price point .	1
perfect for me . just what i wanted	1
This case gave me great protection on my VZW G2 . I was concerned the thickness or fit would be off , but this fit great . The cutouts are perfectly spaced around the camera and buttons and actually help in locating the buttons . There 's no issue with blocking any mic , IR , or speaker slots.The only issue I have is that the USB port is slightly blocked , but I suspect that has more to do with extra-wide cable heads than the case size .	1
The case has a nice feel to it . Dirt and lint do not stick to it like some other cases I 've had . All openings align perfectly.If I was to be a bit picky , I noticed some very minor mold issues on the bottom left corner . ( but you can hardly see it )	1
Very solid case . Slim profile with some protection . Nice buy . Nice textured back and fits snugly on the phone . Offers good grip .	1
I bought the blue color and the tone is great.It gives a great feel to my phone . Even though the case has a slim profile , it provides great protection on the back and front of the phone.If you have an screen protector , you 'll bee seeing bubbles on the corners , however they 're not really annoying.I highly recommended	1
Bought these for my wife and daughter and they both love them as do I . The texture is just right , color is spot on , cut outs line up perfectly and the gradient texture design is the perfect amount of style without being too obnoxious . If you only buy one TPU case for your device make it this one .	1
This is an awesome case at a great price that offers grip and protection for your G2 . I highly recommend it .	1
it fits the phone like a glove ( LG G2 ATT ) but doesnt look good with the white version of the phone . Cant put my finger on it i usually love black cases on white phones , just looks weird . Good quality though..	1
This case looks good , fits perfectly , and provides adequate protection for how I use my Nexus 5 . Unlike the first case I purchased for this phone , the power and volume buttons work as well with this case on as without it . There is just enough texture to provide good grip and feel to this case as well . Nice job TUDIA !	1
Bought this for my husband . He 's using this one instead of the suber bulky Otter Box . Works like a charm , no complaints . Grips well .	1
This is an awesome case . It provides additional grip without being too grippy . It 's entirely matte finish inside provides a quiet fit ( no squeeks ) .	1
It 's very thin and does n't add much bulk to my slim phone but still does a great job protecting it . I 've dropped it quite a few times and the phone still looks brand new , I do n't even bother worrying when I drop it anymore , I know it 's safe . On the downside , I was hoping that the material would be more abrasive . It does add some texture compared to the extremely slippery surface that the phone itself has , but not a lot . Overall : good price and great protection , good case !	1
A perfectly adequate case that works just as advertised . It has enough of a lip that it will protect the screen if laid down on the face . It is not a grippy back , but it is much better than the stock back of the phone.It adds very little bulk to the phone but you will obviously sacrifice durability in that case.the IR blaster and all other ports are open and work well .	1
I have had many different phones and phone cases but I must say this is the best fighting phone cover Ive ever had . doesnt cover anything it shouldnt . Great product !	1
Just got the case today and it seems to be as advertised . Material is plastic but seems firm and made well . I like how it does n't make the phone seem larger as some cases do . I am not a fan of the military Otter box cases and prefer my phone to be the size the manufacturer intended . One word of caution however ; I had a Zagg screen protector on mine and when I put the case on it pushed up the bottom which caused bubbles and it wo n't lay down all the way but I should have realized it was going to be a tight fit and used some caution .	1
Great fit , color , texture and protection.I have received compliments on the case from others as well.No issues so far .	1
I like this case a lotPros -Good weight , not super light , but flexible and soft enough to get your phone in an out easy.Perfect fit on my Verizon Lg G2.The case just covers the side bezels so all you see is screen and very little bezel on the phone.The soft case is grippy , and the design looks goodCons -I have never been a fan of glossy finish on anything that I have to touch because it leaves fingerprints . The gloss spots on the back get them but you do n't really notice them , but I do find myself wiping the sides of the case for fingerprints though ! Overall-Definitely a great fitting case that provides enough protection to protect you from an short drop and scratches . I looked at the other cases and I also believe that this is the best looking case in the ~ $ 10 range .	1
Great simple slim case . Most people do n't think I have a case on at all . Provides just enough protection and grip without adding too much bulk .	1
Spectacular case . Mine came today and I could n't be more pleased . It gives the phone a real elegant look and pop to it and since the G2 is slippery this really helps . The case also provides a little bit of a lift to the front of the device so if you lay it face down it should protect the screen .	1
Good case . good color . good price . perfectly covers the cell , it feels good to the touch , not dirty , good buy	1
SO what can i say about this case . I picked up the black model and it looks great ! I would n't mind if it it came in a clear or smoked transparent version since the t-mobile plastic back looks amazing as well.. but this does a good job of replacing the view.Good : Very SnugGreat DesignMultiple colors ( black for me ) Cut outs are good.. almost completely perfect if you 're difficult about this sort of thing ( 9.5 ) Protection - raised bumper off the screen so it should sustain a decent dropBad : No transparent version ! : PWould buy again and will recommend to friends !	1
Great item ... fits snugly , but not too snug . Forms perfectly to the G2 phone . Color is true to what you see ... I got the purple and love it .	1
I bought both of the popular , cheap case options : Diztronic and this Tudia.Prefer this one ( Tudia ) because the sides are less slippery ( better grip ) .Fit is perfect . I 'm not crazy about the appearance and actually prefer the more subdued looks of the Diztronic , but I need a case I can grip , and this one will do .	1
I used the other , more rugged tudia case for a couple weeks because I wanted a very protective case . After a while , it was just too thick to hold in my hand , although it was a great case otherwise . I ordered this slim case , and I love the grip , buttons , etc . It is very easy to press the buttons on this case , yet no worries about it pressing on by itself in my purse . My only concern with this case is the camera protection because for some reason , the tpu covering the top of the camera is very minimal . Also , the dull part on the back of the case shows scratches even though I have never placed it on any abrasive surfaces .	1
The TUDIA case appears well made of a semi-gloss soft-touch material that fits the Nexus 5 securely.The case back has a textured surface and , combined with a grippy case material , offers a secure hand-hold.I like the TUDIA case and would recommend it to friends .	1
A decent silicon case . With the color , hard to misplace . Fits the phone well and all the holes are accessible . Plastic is malleable so it was easy to put on . Not sure how much protection it offers , other than protecting from scratches .	1
Very easy to get on ( took about 5 seconds ) , and looks good . You can barely tell it 's even there , but it does make it easier to hold , offers decent protection , and looks nice . It provides a bit more grip , but is still slippery enough to get in and out of pockets with no problem . I would n't mind if it were slightly more rubbery , but it 's almost perfect for me .	1
This is a decent case for the price . I like that it protects the screen some by extending out a bit . The texture on back makes it easy to grip your phone , too . Buttons , charging port , headphone connector , etc . are easy to access . The case is not bulky but still gives good protection .	1
I liked the feel , it was a go to case . I love TPU cases because you can take the phones out of the case very easily , but their still snug and safe inside them .	1
I like the minimalist feel of the case and the back design of the case . I only wish I could get this in an orange color . The case does n't impede operation of the device or accessing the buttons or ports .	1
this unit fits very well and looks nice . However the plastic material that it is made out of is a little slippery . my wife likes it and we have not replaced it . But I 'd prefer for it to be a little more grippy .	1
This case is exactly what is says it is and fits perfectly . I 've had it since November 2013 and it has not broken , scratched , or become loose . Keep this case clean though , once it gets dirty there is no going back . I 've tried cleaning it with soap , water , and a sponge and it is still dingy from dust on desks and tables .	1
Absolutely great entry level case . The case fits snuggly . Its just the right amount of grip , not to rubbery that it would n't easily slide into a pocket or make it difficult to pull the phone out , and just enough that it does n't go sliding around when on uneve serfaces . All of the cutouts are in the right places . And the one thing I noticed is that it became easier to locate the home button on the back of the phone because it creates a datum from which you can easily reference which button protudes the farthest .	1
Fits my Tmo G2 like a glove . really perfect fit . like the rough back for grip and the glossy front to blend in with phone . It fits really tight , taking it off can be a pain , but rarely need to remove it . would recommend .	1
i sent this case as a gift and she loved it . she said the color was amazing and it fit perfectly . All ports accessible .	1
It 's hard to find cases to fit this particular phone , but this case fits like a glove with all openings just where they 're supposed to be . Particularly like the extended lip that protects the phone when laid down on its face . Pretty good textured grip too . Have received several compliments on this cover . Good design , only thing I would change is that I thought & # 34 ; holes & # 34 ; on case in back were open so original color of phone would show through . Turns out these are textured & # 34 ; dots & # 34 ; and are just recessed , not open , so phone back does not show . Reviews advised against buying the white cover so I bought a black cover for my white phone . I was thinking this would look very stylish with white polka dots on back , but now I have a black phone ! Lol Actually , I suppose it would be next to impossible to keep your phone clean if it had open areas on the back , so guess I 'm the stupid one ... Anyway , I researched many covers and this looked to be the best design and best price . It did not disappoint .	1
A nice and slim case that seems to provide a good level of protection . Mind you it 's not an otterbox but from a TPU case it 's well made . Has all the proper holes ( including one for AT & T ) . Grippy and comfortable to hold .	1
This case fits my phone really well . It 's a great buy.I was apprehensive about getting a case because I already dislike how huge cell phones are getting . Oh well . Anyway , this case is definitely as the title describes : slim . I like the design on the back of the phone because it is textured , keeping my phone more secure in my hand or in my back pocket ( of only a couple pairs of my pants . The phone wo n't fit in the front pocket for sure )	1
Fits well . Adds little weight or bulk . Aesthetically attractive . The price is right . But , the rear surface does not provide as secure a grip as I would have desired -- it 's a bit slippery .	1
The TUDIA material is thinner than I expected . It does not add much girth to my Nexus 5 . It fits tightly ; so tightly , in fact , that it pushes up one or more of my screen protector 's corners . All the buttons and ports are accessible without difficulty . I give it 4 stars because of the screen protector issue and because it 's thinness means it probably wo n't offer much protection against a corner impact on a hard surface like concrete .	1
I purchased this because really , the phone is a slippery monster.I like that all the ports , microphones , camera , back buttons , flash LED and the IR transceiver are accounted for with appropriate cut-outs ... It adds very little weight and size to the device . I can confidently handle it now.I like that around the perimeter of the front , there is a tiny lip that extends a little bit above the screen surface of the phone . I can now feel comfortable ( if I choose to do this ) to enable gestures / actions that activate if you turn the phone onto it 's face.FWIW : the black does n't look exactly like the photo ( the styling indents on the back are not tinted silver or grey ( which I think looks pretty cool ) , but are instead uniform glossy black . I think the picture might mislead someone . But personally , I think the black case looks great .	1
nice case . easy to use and works well . i would like more colors though .	1
Great case for my LG G2 . Protects all sides and is a snug fit . I just wish the material was a bit less slippery when holding it at the gym with sweaty palms .	1
Good slim case that protects well for a cheap price . It has a nice feel and doesnt add too much weight .	1
This is a very nice protective case for my husbands LG-G2 . It fits perfectly and offers secure and safe drop protection . Very satisfied	1
My wife loved this case , it fits snug on the G2 . The purple looks way nicer in person , and wont add to much bulk . great buy worth the price .	1
Since purple is my favorite color , that was a good start ! I had no trouble putting this on my Cell and when a friend dropped it on the cement Garage floor , I was in shock that it protected the Cell ! So I do feel it was a good investment ... .	1
My daughter bought this for her new Tab 3 . Perfect fit , looks great and seems very well made . This is an incredible deal for the quality ! Definitely recommend	1
The material on the inside is incredibly soft and helps to keep my screen clean . The outside fabric esy to grab and hold and the look of the cover is very attractive . It fit my Galaxy 7 perfectly and I like everything about it .	1
I was searching for a very unique look for my tablet cover ... this fit the bill . It looks high-end , though very affordable . Anyone can be vanilla or chocolate . I prefer to be tiramisu .	1
I really like this case .I brought this for my tablet and I must say very please and it fits just right.I wish they had this for my phone in the same case..I would love to see a case like this made for laptops	1
Love it , i ordered the wrong size , returned it and it fit nice , great value just wished i hadnt got the wrong size in the first place . Has a nice feel to it , ports are were they shoild be , it shipped out very quickly	1
i bought this product for my daughters new tab 3 and it looks amazing and fits great would recommand to anyone .	1
I love it ! Took a little getting used to , but once you are then the other cases seem hard to hold . I was very please that I received my shipment in a timely manner ... the packaging was stress-free ( I dislike having to fight packaging to get to my products ) ... all-in-all I am thinking about purchasing more of these to go with the children 's tablets ( if their inexpensive units will fit ) ... I will try to remember to give you an update in a few months ... that way we can see how this case holds up over time .	1
I purchased the Note 10.1 and case for my wife as an anniversary present . I like the case and she likes it too , except she wishes that there was a holder for the stylus .	1
Love this for my new Galaxy 3 tablet.. easy to use and very protective.. great price also for the quality of product .	1
I received this item and it fits my tablet perfectly . One issue , is that the case does n't have an opening for the IR beam ... .. I solved the issue by looking for instructions in youtube how to crack hard plastic ... Carefully and Safely I made the little opening and now it is perfect , it stands well , sometimes it is flimsy on one side to hold with my hands but I flip it around and it is steady again . The round hole helps the grip . Overall I am happy with it .	1
I really liked this case . The colors are out standing . I was a little disappointed that the skin did not look more crocodile ish . But in all I like it a lot it goes with me to church every Sunday .	1
I have been using this case everyday since receiving it , the screen protector is really cheap and suggest getting the glare and smudge proof , but other then that I can not complain , love it .	1
Bought this for one of my granddaughters . She really likes it . She likes that it will stand on it 's own when she wants to just look at things .	1
Very Solid case . My wife loves it . It is listed as having a crocodile pattern , but this paticular color is n't textured like the others which is probably a good thing . I think a croc texture with the & # 34 ; tribal & # 34 ; patterns would be too much . It came exactly as described , with a stylus and screen protector . I like that the back of the case allows the camera to be exposed . The case rotates easily , and feels like a book when held . Fantastic product .	1
I was told she really likes this case so that 's what counts . It swivels and acts as a stand so it is helpful .	1
I love this case for my tablet . It is stylish , looks really nice and High quality.It includes a pen .	1
After ordering several cases this one is the best . The kickstand is a little wobbly but I do n't use it very much .	1
I like this case not just because of it 's great color but it is a fun piece . The stand is very convenient for my 5 year old who loves to play and watch things on my tablet .	1
Fits great on the phone . Protects the back and sides from any damage . Great product for the phone ! Recommend it highly	1
Case fits perfectly was a little hard to get the rubber bumper off . You have to drop the stand in order to remove the bumper .	1
This order plus the last 5 orders from Spigen have been riddled with late shipments , and no responses to emails . I keep telling myself that this is just a one time thing , then oh they failed on the 2nd order , it 's okay , then the 3rd time my senses became dull to getting lied to.I am done with Spigen for now . I may try them again later on if I hear they care again.The least they can do is send an email saying there is a delay or sorry guys etc . Bad service .	-1
I like the fact that you have the S-View option with this case , primary one of the reasons I bought this case . But this is my second Slim Armor View case I have went through . The first one broke in the exact same spot my second one did . The hinge of the Front Cover splits causing it not to stay on the hinge for the case around the phone . I feel like this is a design flaw and Spigen on honors their 90 day warranty if ONLY bought on their website . Since I purchased this through Amazon , I have no warranty . I will contact Amazon to see about their returns . I really do n't think this deserves one star , if there was an option for no stars that would make me happy ! Looks like I 'll be buying an Otterbox , with no S-View !	-1
They shipped almost 2 weeks later ! Case for most part is sleek . One big flaw ! ! The opening for S-Pen is a little too narrow and hard to remove it . Have to jam pinky finger all the way in to remove the pen . ( I wo n't use a sharp object . ) Bought mostly because of lower price at time ( $ 13.99 ) . Would NOT pay/be satisfied if paid full price ( return ) .That being said , build quality is great . This is NOT a cheap feeling case at all . Some like the smooth back , some do n't . For me , anything OTHER than that faux leather back ! ( What was Samsung thinking ? ) Anyway , there is a nice lip around the screen edge which helps keep the screen glass from rubbing when face down . I am using a Ghost Glass `` tempered glass '' screen protector . I am NOT using the Spigen brand one this time around . The tempered glass protector fits fine within this case . Note , I highly recommend using a button jelly with this case ( and definitely is using glass screen protector ) as the HOME button is just about flush with the protector installed . A jelly over the HOME button to raise it would make pressing a little more easy .	-1
The case seems to do it 's job protecting the phone but I have n't drop my phone to see if it does . I do n't mind what other reviewers say about the flip case digging into the hand , you kind of expect that just because the way it was made . The reason I bought this was for S-View functionality and protection . The S-View feature it 's supposed to do only works some of the time . You have to kind of & # 34 ; trick it out & # 34 ; by either removing your phone and putting it back into the case or doing a phone reboot ... .or a combination of both . It 's too much of a hassle and if i just wanted a phone where I do n't need the S-View feature , I can just buy a regular flip ( or wallet ) case for a cheaper price . I 've purchased 3 Spigen products and sad to say , I 've returned all 3 . So three times a charm and I will no longer purchase from Spigen again . So if you want S-View functionality , just get the Samsung OEM flip case . It works like a charm and it looks sleek as well .	-1
Protection is decent . Style is pretty good . Why the 2 star rating ? The inner liner on my case is so botched up when on the phone . With or without a screen protector , the very edge/lip of the inner liner looks as if it has been cut in sections . It does not lay flat on the screen surface at all . Makes it appear as if there is something stuck underneath it or little flap are still tucked underneath . For the issues involved with this case , from the price jumping around , to the super long delay in shipping , delayed tracking info , I was hoping that at least I 'd get a flawless product worth the hassle . Was not the case , no pun intended . No idea if seller has fixed the issues . Tried contacting but got no response . Will not buy again from Spigen until this issue is resolved .	-1
Wow lately Spigen has been disappointing at every turn and this case just adds to it 's downfall.I used to be a huge Spigen fan and always recommended their cases and screen protectors but lately all I have are issues with the protectors and the cases and this one so far is the worst.Here 's what I like : It 's like a sophisticated otterbox case for your note 3 that will protect your phone from falls , even those nasty corner drops.-The s view does work but it lags and you may need to apply a bit of pressure.-Case is actually assembled in 2 parts so you can remove the door and the plastic that holds it together to have a silicone cases that is not too shabby-Camera hole is the perfect shape and does not allow surfaces to touch so the lens is always protectedWhat I hate : -Your phone will be protected but the case will not survive the falls especially the door bc its made out of cheap plastic-The s pen is a pain to get out-The headphone is not easy to access-You have to remove your phones original back to use this case ( otherwise s view will not work ) -The s view windows does not always work and may at times cause your phone to be stuck on s view lock screen mode-The door hinge is poorly made and will not last long-Since the case is assembled in two parts , expect the plastic portion to break-The door does not open as easily as you would expect-The s view door home button sticks ( it will turn on many times when its in your pockets ) -Matte finish so fingerprints and smudges will remain and give off a wear and tear look within months ( gloss always leaves fingerprints but its easy to wipe off ) I preordered this case and it took a while before I got it due to supply issues but when I received I was very happy and pleased . Unfortunately that did not last . The part of the case that holds the door and the hinge together snapped off and essentially the case came apart.Luckily for me Spigen announced that they would cover this cases for an extra 2 years or so with their new cases and I was told on twitter that it also applied to their past cases ( I forget exact coverage years ) . I was able to get a replacement by sending them photos via twitter and email and I honestly expected to get brand new case but no . What I got was a replacement door . I contacted them again and sent them better photos and told them that the door is not the only thing broken . They apologized and sent me the plastic cover that holds the hinge and door and goes over the silicone portion of the case . At this point I just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked ... for a month.That same plastic part of the case broke and the door continues to pop out now but they have not responded to my twitter complaints and frankly I am tired of their slow service so a negative review it is.I have never dropped my phone , banged it or let if take any damage . All I do is put it in my front pocket and attach it to my car dock that is all and yet the case does not last .	-1
This case is absolutely gorgeous looking . I feel that it would also provide a good level of protection for the GN3 . The lip around the screen is not very high though ( not like an Otterbox Commuter ) .The thing that I really do n't like at all is the texture of the hard plastic outer shell . The colored shell is very slippery . Because of the slippery nature of the colored plastic , the phone is very hard to grasp securely . I 'm always afraid that when I go to pick the phone up , after it has been sitting on a desk or table , I am going to drop it.This case , for me , does not instill a feeling of security while holding the phone . The colored hard outer shell needs to have a rubber grip along both sides below the power and volume rocker . This design would provide something sticky rather than slippery to assist grasping the phone when lifting it from a table or desk - or even while holding the phone during use . I would then give it 5 stars.Let 's face it , unless you are buying this just to change the appearance of the phone , it is supposed to provide protection for your expensive device . Why would any manufacturer make a case that could actually help you drop your phone.After I removed this case from my phone , I felt that the naked phone actually had more grip than with the case.The Spigen & # 34 ; BOUNCE & # 34 ; or Otterbox & # 34 ; Commuter & # 34 ; are both much better cases if you want something that feels secure and grippy in your hand.Because a case is supposed to help protect your phone , not help you drop and damage your device , I can only give the Slim Armor Case 2 stars . It looks really nice , but grippyness is lacking .	-1
First the good . The case is beautiful . Good solid feel . I have confidence that if I dropped the phone it 'd survive intact . The only part that 's a fingerprint magnet is the view port . Which leads me to the bad ... The bad . The software is just about as quirky as can be . WIthin a few seconds of running the software glitches and the call/message notifications may/may not work . I do n't know if it 's the case magnets or what , but the screen for the software pops up even when you 're not using the viewport.I 'm hoping that Spigen/Samsung work on the software issues or Spigen makes their own software at some point . I 'd buy it again if the kinks were worked out.Edit : Also , there is no LED cutout to see notifications and the headphone port is too small for many headphone connectors .	-1
The front case doesnt always seem to work . Have to open and close it several times . It is very annoying . Have contacted seller for exchange I hope they dont give me problems . Not worth $ 60 .	-1
I did n't realise this case was going to be so cheap looking and feeling . I do not use as it looks cheap .	-1
It is a well built product and looks very attractive . It seems to protect the phone well against accidental drops or water splashes . It replaces the original battery cover of your Galaxy Note 3 , but it is impossible to open the flap with one hand , the latch is too hard to push open with your thumb . The other problem I have with mine is that the flap does not turn off my screen . When the flap is shut the phone is supposed to display a smaller image through the window where you can answer calls or take notes etc . Mine stopped doing that after a few uses and never turned back to normal . I tried resetting the phone by taking the battery out and putting it back in , but did n't help . My older Samsung leather cover works fine with the screen , so it is not my phone . If I was n't using my phone 40-50 times a day , I would have lived with this cover , but not being able to open the cover with one hand and not being able to answer without opening the cover , I will give it a low rating .	-1
I was excited to get this in the mail but I was n't too impressed . I was debating to get this or Samsung brand SView case but being a huge fan of Spigen I decided to buy this one . Overall it add way too much bulk . It 's a Fingerprint magnet and the flip cover hing is cool to help keep it from flapping but when open , it feel awkward and uncomfortable . If looking for a flip cover case I would n't go with this though it offers serious protection for the phone	-1
I do n't like this ... ... ... ... ... ... ..Yes , it does protect the phone . I really like the option of having the Auto Sleep/wake feature but to start off I had to pay for the App on my phone . It makes the phone extremely bulky . The case makes it impossible to have a conversation without it constantly trying to put the phone in sleep mode . Also the smart chip did n't come with the double-sided tape that was suppose to come with it . Not a real big issue but for the price it should have been included . Made adjustments just to get the case to work as it should . Wish I could return it but waited to long ... ... ... ... ... so I 'm stuck . Bought cheaper versions that have the same feature plus a lil something extra and I LOVE them .	-1
This case has an annoying habit of twisting , preventing my phone from lying flat . The twist has a memory to it too so it 's permanent .	-1
gave me problems the multi window I worked 30 minutes and then was turned off , I had to remove the liner to reactivate it . also stopped working when the window of the pencil note 3 left and also working out and put it back in the lining everything was returning to normal for 30 minutes ... really left very unhappy with this case coming from me like otterbox SPIGEN but I unfortunately did this happen and I go back to otterbox ...	-1
To begin with , I am reviewing the soft black S-View version of this cover . Amazon has intermingled the reviews for S-view and non S-view versions , so make sure the review you read applies to the case you want to buy ! I was concerned about reports of problems using these cases that may or may not be associated with the kit kat update . My phone is not yet on kit kat . I absolutely loved the similar Spigen case for my Galaxy S4 , so I went ahead and bought one of these , ordering it ahead of time so it would be on hand when I became eligible for a subsidized phone upgrade ! Just like the S4 case , this one looks to give reasonably good protection to the phone . To get better protection than this , you 'd have to go with the Otterbox Defender or a similar massively bulky case . Even this case adds a small amount onto both sides of every dimension . I still can fit it into my front jeans pocket for easy carrying , but it is n't as instinctive to slide it in as it was on smaller phones . The soft black has a soft , fairly grippy feel that makes my grip on the phone feel good . This is an excellent choice , not quite as good as the coating on the Seidio cases I 've used , but very usable . I handled a white Spigen case for the S4 that had a much slicker feel , and would n't have made me comfortable for fear I 'd drop it , I assume that the white Note 3 case is the same more slippery material.To my relief , when I removed the back cover of my phone and inserted it into the case , it worked perfectly . None of the reported problems . The next morning , I was disturbed to find that the auto-on and auto-off features of the case were now NOT working ! I took the phone out and reinserted it into the case , and everything was fine . I 'm hoping that is the end of the matter , but uncertainty makes me give the case four stars rather than five . If I go for a few weeks without more trouble , I 'll try to remember to come back here and upgrade my rating to five stars.ADDED LATER : unfortunately , I had two more failures of the S-View feature to work within 24 hours . Removing and replacing the phone in the case seemed to fix the problem , but this is unacceptable . I lost confidence in the place and have asked for a refund . Back to Amazon it will go . I used the case for a one more day until I could get a replacement regular case , and found that it works unreliably . It is unfortunate , because I love this case on my Galaxy S4 . I have changed my rating from four stars to one star .	-1
The s-view cover WOULD NOT work . Very disappointing , at least the return was painless . My only negative experience with this brand . Will not try this model again . Lacking customer service when there is an issue .	-1
I just got this case today and when I first put it on it worked great , since then though about every couple hours I have to remove my phone from the case and reinsert it to make the smart case functions work again . I 'm going to give it a couple more days to see if it gets better but I think the metal pieces that go on the back are just not connecting well enough .	-1
If you drop your phone a lot or work in a place with lots of dust or dirt , then you need something like this . For working in the office , this cover does n't give me quick access to my phone . It also caused the phone to be heavier and bulkier in my front pocket . I tried the Spigen with just the back cover and that one is a keeper .	-1
i would not recommend this case to any body i paid 60 bucks for that was not worth it . the s view do n't work and that was the reason why i wanted this case . boo big disappointmentkeep your money	-1
the sleeping wake functions I really do n't understand the clear plastic part on the front where you shoulda put your finger and swipe it really does n't connect to the phone that well and the button on the front of the phone which is supposed to light it up and bring up your home screen when you want it does n't function at all the case might be sturdy but other than that not impressed at all	-1
I did not like this case due to it being 2 pieces . I prefer only one piece for my cases .	-1
The hard plastic cover is extremely hard to remove . I need to have access to phone to replace battery on trips and micro SD card . Every time I try to take of the cover I need to use some sort of tool and it is so hard that I am afraid to break the phone . I have received another case by Spigen & # 8211 ; Neo Hybrid and it is much easier to use and better quality so I will keep it.I am returning this product .	-1
These things do NOT stick to anything at all ! Not sure why the manufacture was expecting these to be able to do -- but a screen protector it is not	-1
I applied just lie the instructions said and peeled the first layer off , applied the screen protector , peeled the second layer off , but the screen protector itself felt sticky . I could hardly drag my finger across it or click on anything with it on . When i removed it , it left my screen feeling sticky . Also was not clear . Left rainbow looking places all over my phone	-1
This case does not even come close to fitting the Galaxy S4 . It is way too big . It might fit if you had the larger batter backing on the phone . But with the standard back , it does n't fit.Does n't say that it is intended to be used with the battery back so if it is , it should be more clearly stated in the title .	-1
I guess the product was ok . The package I received was bent and the screen protectors would not lie flat on the screen because of a crease in the film . 2/3 were bad so I just threw them away . The last one was okay and seems to be holding up so far . Definitely not satisfied with the shipping/handling of this product . I contacted Amazon about it and they credited me the amount for the product . Later to find out they re-charged my credit card because I did not return the bad product . Well , 2 were already thrown out because they did not work/fit . And the other one was on the phone so kinda hard to send it back . Was n't worth the hassle to send them back . I wish Spigen/Amazon would make good on this product order as the quality of it seems to be very good if its undamaged from delivery . If I get a replacement pack of these protectors , I would have NO problem putting the review to 5 stars . The product is precision cut and lines up EXTREMELY well with the phone sensors/camera/etc .	-1
the 3-pack screen protector i received all has creases on it . installed it and one part of the SP does n't stick on the screen and appears like a bubble with a crease in the middle . will think twice before buying again	-1
tried and retried for over 30 minutesscreen loaded with bubbles and looks awfulstylus feels great on it tho	-1
Hard to put on ! the item was made to fit the exact front size of the note 3 ! any little nudge will leave the side with bubbles so u need to be very careful and accurate ... after wasting 2 of the pack the 3rd one worked though i had to cut a bit of the edge to avoid removing it and getting bubbles in it .	-1
This has to be one of the most difficult screen protectors to apply . I have tried using gloves , medical mask the whole nine yards . Nevertheless , I always get some lint underneath as well as air bubbles at times . Furthermore , one of the issues I have is the way the adhesive side gets peeled off which is from the top instead of the bottom which would make it much easier to apply considering how inflexible it is in the process of applying . I hope the manufacturer reads this and changes the adhesion peel to the bottom instead of the top . The product seems well made but I wo n't be content until I get it on perfect especially when it is protecting such a beautiful screen .	-1
Had high hopes , but install turned into a nightmare . I used the hinge method , google that on Youtube ... it uses 2 pieces of scotch tape to hold the item even on your phone screen . Anyway , do this in the bathroom with the shower on because it does dissipate dust particles in the air . When I put it on a small piece of dust must have settled on the adhesive side of the Glas.tR and it adhered to it onto the phone screen . That was the end ! If you need to redo it , you ca n't so just remove it and throw it in the garbage . There is no second chance . I wound up going to Verizon Wireless Store where they have the same tempered glass and they installed a new one for me $ 18.74 . It was $ 24.99 but I got a discount for being a customer ! Installation came out perfect by a professional and was half the price ! You live and learn !	-1
This company practices deception . It has n't always been like this.For preorder products and in stock dates , they are always late . Not by days , but by weeks and they never inform their customers.They will give you tracking info and not ship your item for days or weeks . So bad and against Amazon policy.Product quality control has deteriorated over time . Cases no longer fit well and items come damaged.They are too big to care anymore . Time to boycott Spigen .	-1
For me , cases serve 2 key purposes : ( 1 ) protect the phone , ( 2 ) make it less likely that I will drop the phone . While I am reasonably certain this case would have served purpose # 1 , it would have failed miserably on purpose # 2 . In fact , I can say with certainty that my phone was MUCH MORE SLIPPERY with the case on it than it was before I put the case on it . Even if the case protects the phone when it hits the ground , anybody who has dropped a nice case will tell you that the case is pretty much shot once it hits the ground . Unless you want to walk around with a $ 700 phone that looks like it has been dragged behind a pickup truck , you will toss the case and start over . I am saving myself the aggravation and returning this case immediately . I did find a very nice Speck Candy Shell Grip CaseSpeck Products CandyShell Grip Case for iPhone 5 & 5S - Retail Packaging - White/Blackat my local club store for a price that seemed quite fair . It is n't as pretty as the Spigen , but it will serve both of its purposes well .	-1
The case looks nice but the edges need to be rounded out . This case hurts my hands when I grasp it . After awhile I got fed up with that sharp plastic plate and put another case on instead . It was a waste of money in my opinion .	-1
This is the first replacement I bought . The first one did n't last 4 months . This one did n't even last 2 ! Snapped at the bottom near plug in area . Both broke in the same spot . I really liked this case . It was thin and got a lot of compliments . But a waste of money .	-1
Order this thing and have no clue what its , will not return since it 'll cost me more to ship it back . This thing will not even fit my phone , stay away from it .	-1
I love the look of this case and it does protect my phone but since i have to remove the case every other day to replace the battery ( i have multiple batteries ) it always ends up braking where the micro usb connection is	-1
First , let me start by saying that these cases are awesome and great quality if , only if you do n't change batteries very often . If you do , then the case will not last at all . I have four batteries so I constantly change batteries during the day and after having these cases for a month the cases broke from the bottom part where the charger goes in . I already broke two . If you do n't change batteries then you 're good .	-1
The plastic around the charging port is entirely to thin and is prone to snapping if you have to take the case off for any reason . It 's just part of the design ofcourse , hard to reinforce a area like that . I broke 2 of the frames and then moved on to a ultra fit Spigen case . If you do n't have need to remove the battery or the SD card often then this is the case for you , if you do have the need , be very cautious during removal or you will end up ordering more frames l	-1
Overpriced , I have had to have three of these frames replaced from spigen due to bubbling of the clear coat and paint flaking off . This is not limited to just the red color either . These frames should be priced $ 6 at most , the polycarbonate frame is extremely flimsy and does not give you the feeling that your phone is protected at all . The TPU that this is meant to go around also warps over time due to heat from the phone , within three weeks of usage , which again the description specifically states that it will not warp due to heat from the phone . If you ask about the bubbling and flaking they are going to tell you that they have addressed this issue and this no longer occurs . If they priced the whole case at $ 15 and the frames at $ 6 this may be more excusable but with how they are currently priced this is definitely not .	-1
Well here I am on my 3rd one of these and my phone is 1 year and 17 days old , and my first case was not a Spigen . When I finally got the Neo Hybrid I got the first generation released which broke even easier . When it broke I immediately bought this slate colored one to replace it and started talking to Spigen which at that time had released a & # 34 ; redesigned & # 34 ; version to deal with durability problems . It took much arguing but they eventually replaced the outer ring . The replacement silver one they sent sat in a case until about a week ago when this one ( the slate one ) broke . So now I have the replacement silver one on and will have to decide what to replace the whole case with because I just cant endorse a company that puts out a product with this short a life cycle . Thank god I have never dropped my phone because I just cant imagine the damage I would have done .	-1
The case is get scratch to much and slip on my hand and is to shine to much finger print caching	-1
IT says original however , I am not sure if it is Authentic , coz within less than a month the battery would start loosing its regular uptime . I started to like it initially but then as time passed by it was of no use just like my original battery . My search is still on for a better replacement .	-1
I received this battery in the mail today , so the shipping was quick . However , since my battery was almost dead I put this new one in . It said 90 % when I turned my phone back on . I have been using my phone for 10 minutes and it is now down to 82 % ! I should have known better , the damage detector has pink xs on it when it should be white . Damaged before I received it . What a waste . I ca n't believe I spent $ 6.80 for something that is for the most part useless . I do not recommend anyone purchasing this item .	-1
It worked better for about a week , and I may get an additional hour of life out of it . The price was n't bad , but I expected better results.I would say it 's not worth the money .	-1
Worked great for about 2 months.Now the USB port works but the wired charger doesn't.Size is compact enough but would 've like to see a more flush version .	-1
After the first time it stopped working . When I plug it in it 's as if I did n't plug it in at all . Do n't have time to deal with returns . Really annoying	-1
Junk . Worked once and that was it , wo n't charge from the USB port or the built in cable . All my other Anker products have been top notch . Low price of the unit does n't make it worth my time or shipping cost to return .	-1
After about 2 months of using it , the mini USB connector stopped working . It did its purpose for the time that it worked .	-1
worked great the first few days and then the product began to blow my acc socket fuse out . i went to my Acura dealer and the Anker charger was a fault unit , giving me a scare believing my car has a electrical fault.i was highly disappointed i have bought many Anker products in the past and never had this problem .	-1
Stopped working after a month .	-1
Pro's:1 . Charges2 . Extra USB portCon's:1 . Spiral cord is very poor who ever picked this cord for this product should be fired this is the biggest flaw with this charger . Its very springy , stiff so extending it any further than its original length pulls on the plug in your phone and makes it impossible to use your phone while plugged in.2 . Extra USB port does not supply 5v , I have a device which uses USB for power and its noticeably dimmer vs using my cars USB port.3 . USB plug at the end of the wire is designed terribly , Since the spiral cord is stiffer than it should be it pulls on the micro USB cable and since there is n't any strain relief the micro usb connector is failing prematurely.I 'm not sure why this charger has so many good reviews , when another other popular car charger ( moto ) is miles ahead of this one .	-1
I read a ton of reviews before pulling the trigger on these guys . I use headphones primarily for running and I 've always been a fan of the around-the-ear style . The price was certainly right on these headphones , but apparently you get what you pay for.I tried every single little ear fitting that came in the package and no matter what I tried , it sounded like I was underwater and this pressure built in my ears to the point that my head was throbbing . This is partly due to the sound isolation ( which is n't exactly ideal for use while running ) but I 've tried other headphones with this feature and never did my head hurt like this.The & # 34 ; memory wire & # 34 ; cable is a joke . It 's basically just a coating around the cable that you loop behind your ears , but it does n't stay in place while you 're wearing the headphones or after . The little button on the cable was difficult to use and had limited functionality.The best part of the whole thing was the armband that came with the headphones . Fit my big arm perfectly and my iPhone 5s fit comfortable with room to spare.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks and get the Polk Audio Ultrafit 500 , especially if you 're a runner .	-1
I 'm very concerned about the safety of my phone using this charging pad.It works well as advertised but the problem is how hot my phone gets after a short while . Because of the nature of a wireless charging pad , it takes quite a while ( 5 hours ) to charge my phone.I do n't know if this heat is going to damage my S5 . Here 's how I use this : I have a thin Spigen case on my phone.I use the usb cable that came with the charging pad.I use the wall charger that came with me phone.Has anyone else had this heat problem and is it normal ?	-1
It 's plastic . And I Just did n't like it . The sparkles are n't good and it had a cheap feel . Immediate return	-1
Got this for my daughters cell phone . It looked sturdy enough to protect her phone . It IS sturdy and will protect the phone BUT ... the blue part is blue paint on white plastic . She has had the cover for 5 days and the paint is already chipping and peeling off on the corners . This would be a great cover if the plastic was colored plastic and not painted plastic .	-1
Cheaply made , did n't last long at all . When plugging in two devices , the power is greatly diminished , makes sense I guess . But , after only a few times using it , it quit working altogether . Lasted about three weeks .	-1
The gorgeous sparkling cover is what kept me from giving this one star . The openings did n't line up to be able to use the buttons on the sides , and the charger would n't stay connected to charge the phone . Looks are n't anything if the phone is unusable . Not a good purchase choice .	-1
Beware , phone will not be able to find service once this case is on it . As soon as the case is removed , you will have service again.Completely defeats the purpose of having a case on it . Yes , the case is pretty , but what good is it if you ca n't even use the damn phone ? -. -- a VERY dissatisfied customer . Never ordering from you people again . Shove it .	-1
The charger had only one ( 1 ) pin to contact with the battery . This indicates to me that the quality control is not in full swing . This required me to have to perform a product return with Amazon . Due to this being a third party transaction it was not possible to simply do an exchange but to do a return along with the need to place another order to get a replacement.So far this replacement came with two ( 2 ) pins but I am concerned as to how long it will properly perform over time . Will a pin or pins fail and the charger become useless ? Only time and use will tell . Would like to believe that the first unit was an exception and not the rule for these products . The hope that the products are inherently good is why a replacement was ordered .	-1
I did not read the fine print so did not realize until arrival that these screen protectors did not fit the Xperia Z Ultra . I recommend that the seller change the name to separate the Ultra Clear from the Xperia Z like ( Xperia Z - Ultra Clear ) or some such , to eliminate the confusion . There is very limited selection of screen protectors for the Z Ultra so some other shoppers may be misled by the product name.I have no idea of the quality so do n't mistake the rating for a knock on their viability for the Xperia Z .	-1
I ordered this , the first one had a broken spray bottle , amazon sent me a second one that worked but I 'm not thrilled with the screen protector . The original bubble went away but it already , after less than a week , has a few dings in it . I know they are little and do n't go all the way through , but aesthetically , it kinda bugs me . We 'll see how it holds up over time , it does seem to be working well and went on pretty easily.EDIT : Changed this to two stars because I 've only had it a week and it 's getting all warped and bubbly and there 's a ton of dings in the screen protector already . If this is Military Shield then I feel bad for the military because they 're screwed.EDIT # 2 : I 'm downgrading this to 1 star because it is AWFUL ! ! ! ! I 've had it for a few months and the screen protector has a zillion dings and bubbles that never went away , the sensitivity is awful and I often find myself banging on my phone to get it to work , even though I have the increased sensitivity option on . Do n't waste your money on this .	-1
Wrong size . I needed the one for another galaxy phone . I was happy with the customer service and the right size one and gave a glowing review .	-1
Did not work well . Did not look good on my galaxy s4 . The scratches are very visible on screen cover making the screen look bad .	-1
didnt use this & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; and am afraid to try it & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; needs water or something like that & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; dont like disclaimers & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ;	-1
i received the item and when i opened the package the part that goes over the button it had a rip . i was really dissappointed .	-1

these little battery backup Chargers will charge a phone 1 time and it will not charge a iphone so if you just getting it to charge your phone on the go well I recommend it to you but if you looking for a backup battery charger that would charge up your iPhone your Galaxy s4 s5 our recommend a ten thousand 14000 megawatt backup battery charger	-1
Purchased this for my mom for her android phone , discovered days later that if you charge the charger all the way it turns blue which is cool . However it only charges the phone for 10-20 mins and never to a full charge . It wo n't even charge my iPhone 5 since after 10 seconds the phone will say the device ca n't be trusted .	-1
This cheap little block takes forever to charge completely and barely adds 30 % to my Nexus 5 device . I 've also tried this on my iPhone 5 and it went from 20 % to 55 % before dying .	-1
I wish I could give zero stars . iHandy Mobile sold me a fake iContact . It does n't even last enough to charge half of my 2100 mAh battery on my phone . It does n't include the iContact logo which means it 's a fake knockoff . iHandy should be ashamed . iContact should be appalled . Amazon should be ashamed for allowing so many fake knockoffs to exist on their site . Not sure I want to keep buying on Amazon .	-1
This is one of the worst transmitters money can buy ... it should be given away in $ 1 bargain bins at places like Big Lots . Its construction is far too poor to be given serious consideration . Mine lasted about two and a half weeks , if even that . The power button feels absolutely awful ; I mistakenly though it just needed to be & # 34 ; broken-in & # 34 ; a bit , but , no , it 's just that bad . It was n't left in the car during inclement weather such as extreme heat/sun or cold , and it did n't only last me that long because I broke a cheap piece off of it or anything ... no , instead , it actually just cut out on me one day while driving and using it -- did n't even touch it . It would n't turn back on after that ; it was as if it had no battery power despite being charged . Then , about four days later , I attempted to turn it on again , and it came right on , displaying 2 out of the 3 bars for battery percentage.I am keeping the micro USB cable it came with and tossing the actual device in the trash . Whether it cuts out and dies on me again or not , it 's still made of complete rubbish and is a prime example of the age-old saying , & # 34 ; You get what you pay for & # 34 ; . I am not too upset considering it was a fittingly cheap cost to my wallet for being such a cheap product . : - )	-1
Got this item for a roadtrip , tested it out , it worked . Day of roadtrip came , after the return period of course , turns on , will not transmit .	-1
First you can now buy google glass direct from Google . It is now in the OPEN BETA phase . The cost is 1,500 $ U.S.D They only ship to USA also tax is involved at 100 $ USD to make them a total of 1,600 $ USD . Now if it is TRUE that these are UNUSED why would some one buy them not open the box and activate them then sell them here and take a $ 150 USD loss in money ? ? ? Something is not right here . I do not care if this person has over a 90 % positive rating . No one is going to spend 1600 $ USD not open the box or send them back for a refund and instead sell them here for 1,450 ? ? ? this makes no sense at all . If you want the link to Google Glass PM me and I will give it to you . This person has to be running a scam . Just think about why loose $ 150 USD when if they arrive all you have to do is refuse it and you get ALL of your 1600 $ USD back ? ? ? This has to be a scam . I will bet these are used . they can say `` oh I only wore them 3 times or something like that . BUT for a FACT RESELLING these VIOLATES the EULA you have to digitally sign with Google before you can buy them . Not only that if google finds out your pair is resold they can turn them off for ever and you just blew 1.450 $ USD . and you will never see that monies again ... These are the facts if you do not believe me go to google glass and read the EULA your self ... They may look like a bargin but to me its not worth risking that much monies over just to find out one day google shut your google glass off for ever and nothing you can do about it ...	-1
When I made the decision to spend $ 1593.75 ( including shipping ) on Glass II Explorer last November , I had expectations for what I could use it for . Here is a report on what those were , what other uses I discovered , and how Glass fared in regard to each use.A better action video camera ? I had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $ 50 bullet camera with better battery life , better image quality ( because of the wide-angle lense ) and better operability ( because I see what it records and can pause it etc ) .The verdict : Glass fails in this category . The battery life is even shorter ( 30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger ) . I can wear it under my aero-helmet , but not without feeling pressure . This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs . The low-light capability is not great , either , and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.It does not fit under or over ski goggles , and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles ( too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds ) .An in-vehicle or dashboard camera ? A camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great . Glass is promising , because it captures my field of view , including the rear view mirror , but it is not reliable and can not record continuously . When plugged in , the battery life would be no issue , but there is currently no app that records continuously ( and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out ) . Also , the display is always on when it records video , which is bothersome at night.With a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds , but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.My verdict : I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software . Currently it is limited.A better run/ride tracker ? I saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order , and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.The verdict : Glass fails in this category , but my reasoning requires explanation , because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass . Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone , and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired . Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate . When I started a `` Run '' on Strava while walking the dog , it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on . I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.In addition to issue with GPS accuracy , I do n't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat ( or rain water ! ) to enter the device.A better headset ? A resounding no here . The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear . Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable . The sound quality is moderate at best , and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions , to a point where I can not understand the other party . I keep my Glass clean and protected , so I am not sure what causes the distortion . Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.The ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me . Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you ca n't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket . Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter . I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.A hands-free smart phone controller ? Being able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature . If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively , you are being well-served by Glass . You will be alerted by and can read instant messages . and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.I do n't seem to be able to create emails from scratch , only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts . I do see emails in my Gmail inbox , though . They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass . This is pretty cool.The verdict : Unfortunately , I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts , and I frankly do n't get Hangouts . I can not access emails on my company 's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass , and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone , I only see 14 contacts on Glass . This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.A better navigation device ? I really like the way navigation works . I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System . In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all , and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions . This works so much better on Glass.My verdict : Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product , in the car as well as on the bike or on foot ( even though Google Maps lacks trail data ) . Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines , it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe . I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn , but I do n't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.A better music streaming device ? With access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches , Glass offers yet another compelling use.My verdict : Exciting possibilities , but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling/wiring of ear buds . The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is , well , mono only ; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $ 85 , and my ears are n't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway . They tend to hurt and fall out , and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass . Voice search appears to be mostly broken . I have close to 20,000 songs on Google Music and searches only randomly find stuff . Is it possible that the songs have to reside in the phone 's cache for this to work ? Overall , I am somewhat indifferent about Glass ' current usefulness as a music streaming device.Other uses ? Glassware can be installed from the phone or the computer . The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited ( I just counted 35 ) , which I find surprising , given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.My verdict : The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small . I am confident that this will change . Still , no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.A mature and well-tested device ? I run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out . Examples ? *The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly . I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis . I just disabled this feature entirely . *The `` Ok Glass '' command stopped working on the 3rd day . I had to do a factory reset to get it back . *When I did a factory reset , it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again . Glass would just not get into pairing mode . *Currently , phone calls or navigation do n't work while on a Wifi connection , even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5 . There is no way to `` disable '' the wireless connection temporarily . You have to make Glass `` Forget '' the connection to make a call and then recreate it . The phone reports the Bluetooth profile `` Phone Audio '' , not `` Headset '' as one would expect . *I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass . I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides . So far I added 5 contacts . When I want to make a phone call , I am presented with 14 contact choices , though , the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google . With half of them I have had no contact in years and I do n't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.My overall verdict : The head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future . But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline , comes with a high price tag , and that non-techie consumers will struggle with . The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.I no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month . It still works as a conversation-starter and that 's pretty much the only thing I use it for .	-1
I can definitely say that I do not like this case . I received it and it was cracked near the top where the camera is located . I had n't even taken it out of the plastic yet and there it was . The picture quality of the design itself is n't great much at all . I do n't really recommend this case . Save your money and keep searching for another one . : )	-1
2/3 did n't work upon opening , 3rd one broke a few days later when used minimally ... Save your cash and buy one good one !	-1
***see edit at bottom***I am a bit shocked by all the bad reviews for this product . I received a set of three cables and all of them work great , and they look to be of a good quality . Did they change how they are being made ? One of the biggest problems I have with the standard IPhone cables is that they are too short . I do not want to have to charge my phone `` under '' my desk because the cable is too short . I want it sitting somewhere convenient . These cables work perfectly for that goal.I also have one in my car . It comes in handy when driving and the kids in the back seat need a charge . I can have it plugged into the front outlet and the cable reaches all the way to the back seat so they can use their IPods while they charge . ***Edit*** After 1 month , one of the cables stopped working . Then after 2 months , a second one stopped working . Now 3 months later , the third cable also stopped working . While they started out working just fine , all three stopped working within 3 months .	-1
I have iPad3 , iPhone4 , iTouch4 all with which these cables should work . Not ONE of these cables work with a single device .	-1
I am skeptical that these are truly Apple-certified , because two of the three did n't work right off the bat and the third worked weakly only for a short amount of time . Disappointing .	-1
All three cables work . Sometimes they disconnect but immediately reconnect . However , I can tell they are cheap . The purple cable is assembled or marked incorrectly . The rectangle that marks the top of the plug is backwards . I have to turn it upside down to fit the port . But the length is great , and the colors are fun . They are affordable , so I ca n't complain yet . As long as they work . **UPDATE**The casing around one cable broke and another cable disconnects and reconnects constantly . I really like the color and length , but these are not working properly . I will be returning these and shopping for long cables again . I have removed a star due to these reasons . I want to like them but I want them to work more .	-1
These work but not that reliably and do n't seem to have much longevity . I received this product free in exchange for a review .	-1
i spend 2 week using it and i decide to put it away , the white part becomes dirty right away .	-1
Bought it for my wife . It broke quickly . It is cheaply made and does not protect phone . Not good .	-1
It 's ALL PLASTIC and the plastic buttons require some force to use . I would have never bought this case if the reviewers had mentioned that fact.I can not recommend this case .	-1
Initial reaction : the cut out for the ringer switch is so deep that it 's impossible to switch it with a finger and I must use a pen or pencil . Unacceptable . Also the bumper is not rubber but rather smoth plastic with tiny divots . Slips out of my hand . Overall this products feels cheap and will likely be going back .	-1
The battery cover fit snugly , but it widens the phone and now none of my cases fit . Nearly ripped the paper thin leather just trying to get it unwrapped . Some the the teeth on the backing also broke off when I was taking it off . Not worth the money , or the time waiting for it to ship to you . Spend $ 20 on a real wood case and you 'll be much happier .	-1
Its low Quality soft material . My Galaxy 4 no funtion whit this cover .	-1
So the Tylt has the following gimmicks which are supposed to set it apart from the crowd of bluetooth speakers:1 ) 3 colored rubber wraps that tilt the speaker for some unknown reason - i.e . : this is not specified on the packaging why this is unique . Does it make it sound better or louder - NO ! 2 ) Aux output to another Tylt speaker - why you want another one of these speakers behooves me3 ) Device charging via the USB jack - I guess this might be useful but not likely a high use function consumers need nor want.Other than that , it does sound good for its size.This speaker needs a serious price drop ... like half for it to be competitive with the other zillion bluetooth speakers out there of this size.Oh forgot ... the hard plastic case retail packaging is ridiculous , unnecessary , and adds cost to what should be a much cheaper speaker . This difficulty in unpackaging really set the tone of being annoyed with this product .	-1
For the price and fancy packaging of this product , I was expecting great quality . Unfortunately , I am not impressed . The Bluetooth and NFC work fine with my Android phone , pairing easily and creating a NFC shortcut . The sound quality is less than expected , however . Bass-heavy rock-and-roll music sounds OK , enough for background music in a small room . Higher frequency music , such as womens voices or smaller instruments sounded distorted even at moderate volumes . I have bluetooth speakers that cost less than half as much that sound better than this . I also have speakers that cost about the same that sound much better ( admittedly larger in size ) . This product would be OK if the price and thus consumer expectations were much lower , but I can not recommend it at the $ 150 price point .	-1
Okay , first , I was quite impressed with this speaker . Packaging made it look like a super fantastic mini-speaker , and upon inspection it seemed like it would be ! - I thought it was silly to allow for the three different interchangeable silicon bands , until I quickly changed mine out for black and appreciated the option.- Bluetooth setup was easy and fast for both my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 . I 've used other Bluetooth devices that once you 've connected one device , is like pulling teeth trying to pair with another one . The TUNZBK-T paired easily . You can pair it with up to 8 different devices ! And I did n't know this , it 's on their website , but you can get two of these things and connect them with an audio cable to boost your sound -- not something I need , but thought that was really cool.- Sound is really good for your basic needs . I have basic needs , so this works great . Oddly , the internal start up volume is way louder than the bluetooth volume coming from your phone or iPad . Curiously strange . UPDATE : Sound is decent , for movies the sound seems a bit weak.- Size and style are a big plus , you can really port this around town with little space . It 's also a battery charger . As well , it did n't seem to take long to charge.- Buttons could do better to be backlit . They 're difficult to find in a dim-lit room , but they 're tactile and feel like brail so you know you 've found one by touch , but which one ? After a time it 's easy to memorize , there 's only 4 buttons.- Battery life indicator is kind of cool . Touch Bluetooth and Phone at the same time and a loud voice comes on to tell you the level.- Turn it on and it pairs instantly.Okay ... now for the reason I 'm rating this 2 stars ; START UP . Let 's talk about this for a minute : What idiot thought THAT was a good idea ? Seriously . I kind of imagine some college kids created this speaker and one of them came up with that obnoxious-pulsing-loud startup sound and declared , `` Dude ! This is so coooooool . '' It gives me a headache every time I hear it , and my 4 1/2 year old said it hurt his head and scared him . It 's troublesome because if I want to turn this on and use it , I ca n't do so quietly -- do n't use this in your office , or when you 're kids are sleeping . I looked all over and could n't find where you can turn this feature off , or lower it . As it is , when you turn the device on the speaker does this loopy sound from low to high volume with an annoying kick at the end . When you turn it off it does the opposite . Every time you connect your device a very loud female voice comes on to tell you , `` PLAYING MODE ACTIVATED . '' When you pair it , she says , `` CONNECTED . '' Was their a reason we needed this at the highest volume setting ? And sometimes , I do n't know why , it beeps loudly -- like when it was on and just sat there unused for a couple minutes . A reminder to not fall asleep with it on , or do n't dare `` Walk away from me . I 'll scream at you to come back . `` If it were n't for this problem , I would have rated this device 5 stars . As it is , I do n't recommend it . I think it should go for around forty bucks with a cautionary clause.So , Tylt , if you 're reading this , you need to fix this feature . Thanks .	-1
First off , let me say this : I can put my bare Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , with either an after market charging coil in the original back , or the genuine Samsung charging back on the VU wireless charger and it will work flawlessly.HOWEVER , if I put ANY type of folio case on the phone , with EITHER back , I have problems.It seems that every folio case I try , and I have tried 4 from 4 different manufacturers , is too thick and keeps the phone 's charging circuits just a tiny bit too far away from the VU 's charging coils . One of the cases is so thin that I am not even sure that it offers any protection , but it , too , is too thick . About 3.32mm , as measured by my digital caliper.The symptoms are really obvious : Put the phone , with any of my four cases on the VU . The phone screen turns on , full brightness , it vibrates and puts up a notice that indicates a wireless connection and the VU indicator light changes from red to green ( good ) , then , the screen dims partially.Then , a few seconds later , all that repeats . And , a few seconds later , all that repeats . And , a few seconds later , . . . . Just try that at night . All the incessant flashing and blinking and buzzing is enough to make you want to throw the whole mess out the door.Another , more important problem may be what it is doing to the battery , but I am not sure . I have an app that gives me a lot of information about the battery , including charge level , voltage , and temperature of the unit.I used the app without the VU for a good while before buying the VU . The highest temperature that the battery EVER reached was just over 100F . BUT , with the VU , it frequently reaches 120 degrees , or higher . Now , I do n't know at what temperature battery damage starts to occur , but such a jump , about 20 percent , is a bit alarming , at the least.I have TWO VUs . Same problems with both of them . I am most disappointed . I do NOT want to remove my phone from the case EVERY time I charge it . It is easier to just connect the wired charger.If TYLT corporation wants to take their VUs back and reimburse me I would be glad to oblige them..	-1
I purchased two of these ... this black one and a red one . They both worked great the first month , but the 2nd month they both started heating the phones up like crazy . My wife and I both have Nexus 5 's and mine would only charge to 83 % and hers to 91 % . It was n't the battery because if you plug up both , they would charge to 100 % quickly , but these chargers are worthless after a period of time . Definitely not worth what I paid for them ! The only resolution is to get them replaced by the company TYLT as getting a refund does not seem to be an option . BEWARE ! !	-1
Only lasted one summer and the are where the & # 34 ; coil & # 34 ; is holding the suction cup completely fell apart from the heat , I had it on the windshield not the dashboard as it will not hold it position on the dashboard . The other areas of this product work as advertised but they need to fix the quality of the suction cup area .	-1
These cables felt well made until I plugged them in . I bought two , one for iPhone ( 4S ) and one for iPad 2 . One stayed plugged in slightly better than the other , but only marginally . Both easily fell out when my devices would get bumped or if I picked it up . I need to know my devices will be charged when I need them , so for my peace of mind these cables would not do . I liked the length and the color , but function was key reason for purchasing .	-1
I have bought lanyards from Amazon before ( 5 in a pack-black ) http : //smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F77Z9C/ref=wms_ohs_product ? ie=UTF8 & psc=1 and I 'm using those as a basis of comparison . These lanyards are smaller in length by a couple of inches and use thinner material . For a child these would be ok , but they seem to small for an adult . I prefer the lanyards I mentioned above . They are a bit more expensive , but worth the extra cost .	-1
Arrived quickly and works good as a back up battery . I think my dog got a hold of one of the 2 batteries and it exploded ( dog is okay - but burned a hole in my carpet ) due to him biting into it . Down to one back up battery ( which isnt a big deal as my GN3 rarely consumes a full charge in a day ) . Edit 12.25.13 ... .. 2nd battery bit the dust today . Went to put it in the phone and the bottom edge of the battery is missing making it too small to fit the battery cavity or the charger . Very disapointed with this purchase . Merry Xmas Hyperion ! : ^ (	-1
I am very disappointed with product . When I had for Note 2 it was ok , but for Note 3 it was really a piece of crap . Same as the battery for Note 2 , one of the batteries just got & # 34 ; bloated & # 34 ; and stopped working , and the other one ( for Note 3 only ) the plastic on the edges fell of . Not buying anymore .	-1
These batteries do n't last as long as the real battery after they are charged . But , I guess it 's okay for the price .	-1
Two batteries that are pretty close to having the same endurance of the Samsung oem battery along with a charger ! This is a no brainer . I love having a spare battery in my bag . There is a level of freedom of not having to worry or think about if I have enough juice in my phone to go through the day and night if necessary . I highly recommend them.EDIT - At some point about a month ago i stopped using one of the hyperion batteries because it was losing its charge a little too quickly . kept the oem battery in the phone and have n't had the need to swap a battery since then . today i decided to charge the hyperion batteries to keep one in my bag just in case . i noticed that one of the batteries is distended and warped . this is probably the battery that was losing its charge . this is very concerning to me . i do n't know if charging the battery with samsungs usb3 cable is too much for it or what , but this is not good . i ca n't in good faith recommend these batteries anymore . too many questions . buyer beware .	-1
I got these a couple of weeks ago . Switching between both of these Hyperion batteries , the battery life seems to be somewhat shorter than OEM , but overall good performance . One thing that bothers me is that the batter is slightly smaller than the OEM Samsung battery for the Note 3 . So my OEM batter wo n't fit into the included charger.Also I 've noticed that sometimes the Hyperion battery is n't making a complete connection in my Note 3 due to it 's smaller size . Sometimes when I put a Hyperion battery in , I have to push it around a bit to make sure it 's making contact to the pins inside the Note 3 . If not , when I push on th power button , the phone wo n't turn on.A couple of times , I 've placed my phone down on my desk and it will turn off . Probably because the Hyperion battery shifted and disconnected from the pins inside the Note 3 . I then have to take the back cover back off and move it around a bit , then try turning it on again.I with Hyperion had taken the time to make sure this was the same size as an OEM Samsung battery . ***Edit 3/7/14***After continuous use , the Hyperion batteries continue to bother me by being loose and causing my phone to restart . Sometimes it 's when I place my Note 3 down on a hard surface , other times it will happen even if my phone is sitting still . The charge is about the same as before , but the build quality is a serious problem.Also the plastic bottom complete came off on both of these replacement batteries . I had to use some Superglue to stick the plastic bottom back on one of the batteries . I lost the plactic bottom on the other.I do n't have any of these issue with my stock battery in my Note 3.I have to lower this from a three star down to a two star rating .	-1
It takes longer to charge the batteries via the charger than it does through the phone . The batteries dies out in a matter of hours . You will be changing batteries constantly .	-1
I bought these excited to have more battery life and they did n't even last a full 4 hours right off the charger either of them . I would say try buying the original or a different brand . I have the Galaxy Note 3 from Verizon running android 4.3	-1
The battery does not fit . It is too Wide and wrong shape at least for my AT & T Samsung Galaxy Note 3 . All of them I have seen so far are like mine and that battery would not fit in any of them .	-1
I 've bought many Extended batteries before and not once have I encountered a backplate as creaky as this , it has give in any position you hold it and disappointingly so , it makes my premium phone feel cheap.There 's a certain level of confidence you get when you squeeze or hold your phone , knowing its built tightly - that feeling is taken away by this backplate.The battery performs as it should , doubling my battery life and it charges fine . But I want to just remove it everytime I hear a squeak out of my Note 3 , this is NOT PREMIUM .	-1
After opening the box it came in there where no instructions which was odd to me but the unit looked pretty straight forward to use . Iv had it for about 3 weeks and learned the button sequences double click for flashlight on and off gold button in to shut of and click once when plugged into phone to charge but one problem the charger shuts off and dies randomly Evan at a full charge I 'm lucky to get it to charge my iphone 15-20 % before it shuts off and is stuck in a & # 34 ; no battery left state & # 34 ; then 5-10 min later suddenly the device remebers it has 3/4 or more charge leftCould be mines defective but I 'm not happy with it and bought a different one I thought the smaller size would be nice and the flashlight a nice little bonus but in the end I got what I paid forJunk	-1
My unit came defective so I had to return it . I should have been able to get at least 2 full charges into my phone with this battery , but I could only barely get 75 % of 1 charge . Sometimes you can get good quality for a great price , but maybe not in this case . Luckily Amazon 's return policy is so awesome , so I did n't really loose out .	-1
Pros : - Easy to install- Very clear- does not leave residues- Good priceCons : - The protector edges does not stick right . The edges are very open which will give it very short life . See the photo posted .	-1
1 . Good thing they 're inexpensive and come in a 6 pack because I did n't get it right until # 4 and I 've put on my share of screen protectors , I 'm not a novice.2 . If you have to lift it off to reposition it does n't stick back down all the way around the edges.3 . The card they send you to smooth out the bubbles bends too easily so was useless and the cloth is too small.4 . But the worst part is the fingerprints that do n't want to come off . 'Nuff said . | Deb	-1
They say no additional cutting is needed well for the note 3 the button is round so the screen protector should have a round cutout not a square one . Also the screen protector is too long and the top of the screen protector is patially on the ear piece . Would not order again as there is too much cutting that needs to be done .	-1
Cheap screen protectors.. I know they are cheap but do not get them ! The screen protector is stiff . If you bend it in half it will crack that 's how stiff it is . Cant use it on my phone either.. Just a huge waste	-1
every screen protector came with small dust on the screens . and left bubbles . will not buy again and waste of money	-1
Unless the manufacturer of this product , in the future , provides easy & proper instructions on how to apply these screen protectors on your phone without getting air bubbles underneath it , I advise you to get something else . Too frustrating to apply without getting multiple air bubbles underneath film .	-1
six of these come in a pack . a friend of mine just bought the same phone as me ( note3 ) so i figured i 'd get six , so i can give one to him for his phone as well.my first attempt was n't too bad , however looking at my home button , you could see it was a little crooked , so , with having so many more , i peeled it off and tried again.the second one was even worse , crooked and had a bunch of dust under it.i gave up , and figured i 'd try again later . i gave two to my buddy , who told me a few days later , he failed miserably at putting it on , and gave up.oh , and yea , i followed the directions to a T , and so did he.so , today i gave it another shot , and again , failed miserably . a little crooked , so i peeled it back up to straighten it , then there was a little spec of dust on the screen , so i peeled back up to remove the spec , but in doing so it smudged the protector , so it was ruined . the last one , i cleaned everything really good , got a bunch of bubbles , so i peeled it back up a little and then got a spec , and same thing happened.i wish i would remember the company that made the screen protector for my note 2 , that was so simple , first attempt , boom , no problems . two of my coworkers had a note2 as well , so i brought the other two ( three pack before ) to them , and they both nailed it first time , and looked perfect.tl ; dr you get what you pay for , spend the extra buck or two and get something better	-1
Mine peel off and no matter what you do you get air bubbles and dust specs.I can deal with a few bubbles and dust specs but not the peeling off	-1
Its ok. Its not all I thought it would be . I ordered it after ordering another case almost like it . I would never order this one again .	-1
This item has not arrived . The case that arrived isa for Galaxy Note . It may have been swapped one for Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 .	-1
I have not yet to received this case that I paid for about 2 months now , I received a message saying the warehouse burned down and so I decided for them to send me another one from another place and I still have not got it , I am yet to understand	-1
it smells really bad it came with a ear cut off i contacted them they said they would send another one it never came it was a gift to someone and they were waiting for it but i never got it i wouldnt buy from them ever again	-1
Its a cute case but when I got it smelled weird . Also I can take pictures with the case on .	-1
I did n't know how to rate this , there should be an extra rating star for undecided or something , however , I ordered this charger for my daughter-in-law and she said it did not work with her phone . I did not try it with any other phone , I just took her work for it . I ordered it because it is cute and I like the price . I hope this does n't hurt the seller .	-1
worked perfectly with the first charge then after instead of charging my phone it would do the exact opposite and kill the battery quicker . I learned to spend a little more to get a better quality charger .	-1
None of the 5 enclosed screen covers would stay on . The edges would unstick and then the rest of it peels off . Also , the product I received was not in a labeled package like the one in the picture . Very disappointing .	-1
I had just gotten my new LG g2 and want to protect it so I ordered the screen protectors so far I 'm disappointed I 've ordered same ones for different phone with no problem , but this time I put them on they look great but when I add myphone case they peel or bubble out of the 5 pack I used 4 and still have the same problem I either have to leave the case off or use no screen protector . so for now living with the bubblesca n't someone make a screen protector that works with a phone caseon ?	-1
Even though I followed the directions there is still a lot of bubbles on the screen . Not happy with it.There has to be a better way to put on the Screen Protectors or a screen protector that you can get the bubbles out . I guess I just have to find it .	-1
With all the hype about this being a premium product the last things I expected is to receive my screen protectors out of the Paper Packaging with absolutely no protection during shipment . Now all my Screen Protector are bent and unusable ( ALL OF THEM ) which includes 1 5-pack for iPhone 5 & 2 5-pack for Note 3 .	-1
These are basically the stolen idea from a Kickstarter campaign . These are almost a waste of money.Pros : They come in fun colors and they can be used if you 're desperate for a stylus and they come 5 in a cheap pack.Cons : The pens are leaky and run ink . The pen is small and uncomfortable . The tip is not very responsive and skips a lot .	-1
Known Echo problem with this Samsung phone model and some other Samsung phones . Hopefully Android 4.4 will solve problem . If not , it 's a piece of junk . Will not buy Samsung phone again . Purchased because of removable battery , large battery and water resistance . Should have just got a water resistant case .	-1
Before and after I bought this cellular phone I asked the seller ( FGS Trading ) several times about real compatibility of the 4G bands . They give information that at the end of the day , was not true . Testing the phone with some operators outside USA I realized it did not work as expected and was far from being & # 34 ; an international versi & oacute ; n & # 34 ; .In fact , this is a common limited 4g device that only cover some bands in some part of the european continent . Do you believe can ask for a change or reimbursment ? Simply forget it . Seller will give you a cold answer because time has passed and even though they took weeks answering with incomplete information , the 30-days period of changes is over.Now I have a beutiful piece of technology that ca n't be used in the way that 600 dolars make you to dream on.So , are you looking for a real international version ? Forget this one but especialy , do n't trust FGS Trading provider .	-1
battery barely makes it to lunchtime when i use this for workmight be waterproof when it comes out the box , but the cover for the charging port does n't last over timegood camera though	-1
The sound quality is horrible , it sounds like the music is passing through a can . The ear piece sticks out of the ear too much . If you are wearing only one side the other drops off and pulls the other side , making it very uncomfortable . Wanted to try this product because my LG Tone 700 broke and wanted to try another one . But will be returning this one and getting the LG Tone 700 again ( did not like the 730 ) .	-1
Lousy . Slips off of the neck . Almost lost them twice in twelve hours . Unless you 'd like to use a foolish looking and uncomfortable clip . No thanks . Earbuds are bulky and unwieldy . Controls are limited to 3 buttons which have a number of combinations that are supposed to control everything . What a pain ! I never did get them to do half of what they were supposed to .

The headphones are really , really good . Sounds great , comfortable and easy to control.However the case is a BIG FAIL . How they could get the headphones so right and the charging case , which is so simple by comparison , so wrong I 'll never know . It 's near impossible to get the cord and headphones in the case and close it ! BIG FAIL ! I suggest you get the headphones without the case ( hopefully it comes with a simple pouch ) and get a separate standalone charger battery pack .	-1
the concept if very good . the earpad is heavy , the ear cushions is hard and hearts the ear . It is very hard to keep the earbuds fitted in the ears . sound is ok , but miises bass ! the battery life does not last for a day .	-1
Not very comfortable . Make my ears a bit sore when wearing . They stick out a bit as well . Sound is great but too uncomfortable to wear . Also when you run you hear the thump of the cord as it bounces on the back of your neck .	-1
Disclaimer : I am reviewing a pair that I received for free through the Vine program.Well this seems like an excellent pair of Bluetooth in-ear earbuds ; does everything you 'd expect from such , pairs instantly with Samsung Galaxy Exilarate [ sic ] Android smartphone , recharges fairly quickly via microUSB , has good responsive controls , work with the voice dialing etc . commands from Samsung , ... except I just ca n't stand in-ear earbuds ! I tried , I really tried , I tried all the included 3 different sets of cover thingies , wiggling them around , wiggling the strap/adjustor plastic loop thingie too , but they all just feel awful , hurt my ears , make me feel like I 've got an ear infection , and I just could n't stand wearing them for more than a minute , each time I tried.so IF I could stand earbuds I 'd definitely be interested in these . They do everything that a Bluetooth earpiece does re controlling the phone & audio , but they 're also stereo and do n't look as dorky as the mono earpiece outside the ear does , and they do seem to sound pretty good ... . for earbuds ( in my brief attempts at testing ; again IF I could only stand wearing them for more than a minute ) ... .I 've tried other pairs of supposed good quality high-fidelity in-ear earbuds before ( though never wireless Bluetooth ones until now ) and I just always have the same problem , that they just hurt my ears so much I just ca n't relax and listen to the music .	-1
When the only thing holding the speaker in your ear is your own ear wax ... it 's not going to work.I purchased two sets of LG 730 Bluetooth headsets and I am so damn happy now I could just spit . ?	-1
The prosSyncs easilyTells you if it 's synced , turns on and turns off.Pretty nice looking3 different size tips to choose fromSound is pretty good for a bluetooth headsetThe consNot comfortable with any tip sizesA lot of playing around with the stabilizers to make the earbuds stay in your ear.Reception is pretty badThe band sticks to the back of your neck so when you turn your head , it pulls the earbuds to whichever way your head is turningMic is pretty bad . The person on the other end could barely hear me.The holes on the tips are too tiny and it some times gets muffled in my ear due to my ear blocking the holeThe reason why so many have problems with these ear buds is because they do n't know how to use the stabilizers because there are n't any directions for it . It took me a few hours to figure out how to adjust the stabilizers so that they would keep the buds from coming off . You need to anchor the stabilizers to the bottom of your ear going towards your back . Use your finger tip to press on the stabilizers so they 're anchoring the buds . This helped me and it kept the buds from falling out .	-1
I owned these for two weeks . The design is decent . Size , fit and sound are good ; not excellent , but good . The problem is the battery life , after a week of use , all I could get out of them was 60-70 minutes of music listening . That 's just unacceptable in this day and age , when most Bluetooth headsets , are getting a minimum of 4 hours talk time . Everything else works fine , but an hour of use - really ? I exchanged these on Amazon for the Jaybird Bluebud X. I have n't used them for more than a day . But , I have talked on the phone on them for a solid hour , and the battery is still showing green , which supposedly means `` Well Charged '' . So , I 'm impressed . Yes , they 're 50 % more expensive ; but the Plantronics unit with an hour of battery life is a joke . The other big plus on the Jaybird - if you use it during workouts , as I do , they have a wire management system that allows you to wear them over the ear and the wire can be fitted to be snug to the back of your head , which means no wire flopping around while you do your workout . Very nice.I 'll update this on battery life and other impressions on a Jaybird item review once I 've spent a few weeks with the Bluebud .	-1
Bought them at a big box ... a rare occurrence.Pros- good sound quality- easy to pair- clear verbal responses when performing actions with the controlsCons- can not get right fit even with built on stabilizer- wire is tacky and sticks to neck and clothing causing ear plug to fall out when turning head- the case is stiff and it feels like you are stuffing the set into it such that it may cause damage- the controls are difficult to manipulate without dislodging the ear plug ... may be more of a fit problemAll that being stated , the biggest complaint is fit . I just can not find the right set of wireless headphones that fit and stay in my ear when working out ( except for big , bulky , over-the-ear headphones ... makes me feel like a 70 's throwback ) . The other cons I can deal with , but without the proper fit , they are just additional deal killers . The wire could use a croakies-like soft cover and the bag could use a softer , more pliable material .	-1
Its good but the problem is that it doesnt stay in the ear and most of all the charging case died the second time i used it it wont charge anymoreThe button to change music is to complicatedit keep turning off and turnin on byitaelf battery dies quick i wish i can get my money back	-1
For me personally , these were too bulky and did not stay in my ears well at all . On top of that , the volume , even when turned up all of the way , was not loud enough to hear my audiobooks while riding my bike . These are great in theory , but for me at least , they did not perform well at all.I ended up going with the JayBird BlueBuds X Sport BlueTooth headphones , and LOVE THEM !	-1
I bought these when they were new on the market back in early August 2013 . The charging case was due to be released soon . Now Plantronics has no ETA for the case . YOU CAN NOW BUY THESE CHEAPER WITH THE CASE THAN WHAT IT COST ME WITHOUT THE CASE ONLY 3 MONTHS AGO ! They wo n't stay in my ears , the sound is decent at best , people complain about the mic quality when I 'm on calls.Thankfully though , Amazon helped make it right through their always supportive customer service . This is why I spend so much money with them .	-1
I was really excited to get these bluetooth Wireless earbuds . I have used a plantronig device in the past and was very happy with the quality . Also loved that this came with a charging case to add a little extra juice to keep your earbuds going a little longer . The sound quality of these is awesome . THe problem is they are very weird shaped earbuds and will not stay in your ears . My wife and I both tried these out and had problems with them . I also let some friends try them out . Out of 7 people that tried them they would only stay in the ear of 1 of the 7 . I just think that Plantronics should have spent a little more time on making sure they would fit and stay in a persons ear . Would definetly not recommend these at all .	-1
Honestly & # 8230 ; These are the worst sounding head phones I have ever tried.They went straight back to Amazon . Really buzzy , no base sound .	-1
I am a Plantronics user since 20th century , when bluetooth would be a simple blue stain on our teeth . Since the first cell headset I purchased Always felt a fantastic quality . I was using a backbeat 903 , which not only delivers a very good quality sound but also has a bass booster ( when you press and hold the & # 34 ; play/pause & # 34 ; during playback ) which could make sound even more enjoyable for the higher sound quality enthusiast.On this backbeat go 2 version , Plantronics improved on certain issues like opereating buttons , which are more at hand and the structure , which was a bit easier to break on the 903 version . I took me 30 seconds to decide to return it ( I had to pay shipping , as that was n't Amazon 's fault , of course ) .Sound reminded me of na old mono radio squeaking with no lows at all . This version was a major strike out .	-1
I love bluetooth headphones for working out at home and on the road . The Plantronics Backbeat Go have very good sound , and played my music and podcasts well . The microphone is fine for occasional phone calls while listening to music . They are sweat resistant and can charge from a USB cable.My main gripe was the fit . The cable and built in remote dangle down from the earbuds , and I found that if I was jogging or jumping around , I could not get these to stay in place , no matter which earbud attachment I used . For a workout , I 'd much rather have an over the ear headphone like theJabra SPORT , which is more likely to stay put .	-1
I purchased these knowing that Plantronics has never let me down , , , till now . These are the most awkard ear budsI have ever seen . I have the LG HBS730 which are ok but living in florida makes it hard to wear due to the heat . I also have the SBH52 which I like but there are times that I do n't want to clip anything to my clothes . So I started looking for another pair and came across the Backbeat Go2 and I liked the flat wire alot because it wo n't tangle up and it a thin wire . In any case , these buds did not fit at all and it had nothing to do with the buds itself , , , it 's the entire ear bud that was made for much larger ears than mine. Can not write anything on the sound since I was not able to keep them in my ear long enough to listen to music , so I returned them .	-1
Lived up to expectations for battery life and sound quality . Very disappointed how easy they fall out of your eas .	-1
shoulda returned it while I could.. thing 's a disappointment . it is not very comfortable and looks silly , the bluetooth keeps needing to be re-paired . the battery does n't last very long and its constantly on the verge of being lost .	-1
After reading all the glowing reviews of this product , I was happy to pay the fairly high price , expecting a very good listening experience . I do n't mind picking up my phone to answer it -- I want Bluetooth so I can listen to my music while I work , shutting out a little of the noise around me.I found two fairly serious problems as soon as I unpacked and charged the unit ( and the battery case ) and tried them out . The first problem is that even after trying all three sized cushions , I was unable to get these to fit properly in my ear . No matter how little or how hard I pushed on them , they fit poorly , did n't block outside noise , and were very loose . I 've used dozens of ear bud products , both Bluetooth and wired , and never had this problem before with any buds , wireless or wired.The more serious problem was the very tinny sound . There was no way I could get any bass out of the units . When I compared this product to several pairs of the wired headsets I have laying around , I concluded that either this product was defective or it was just not designed for music . I considered calling the manufacturer 's customer support line and working on the problem , but I just did n't want to get into all of that . I have worked in manufacturing and consulting quality control for years , and recognize that customers do not really want good customer service -- they do n't want to need it . I returned it after trying every combination of music app and equalizer I could download on my Galaxy SIII for two days . The wired and an old Bluetooth headset were giving me great sound , but this Backbeat still sounded tinny -- as though it were intended only for phone conversations . I wanted to like it , and felt at the price I could expect to like it -- but I shook my head , re-packaged it and sent it back . I 'll always be grateful for the amazing Amazon customer service . It 's really the best available .	-1
... they just do n't fit in my ears . These would be the best BT headphones out there if they could copy the iphone 5 buds . But like some of the other reviews I 've read , if the different rubber plugs do n't create a seal , you wo n't hear any bass . I could n't get any of the 3 sizes to fit properly . Only way they sounded right was pressing them in to get the seal . Kinda defeats the purpose . They 'd have a winner if they redesigned the buds . Unfortunately , as is they do n't work for me .	-1
Unfortunately , under a rigorous gym workout , the ear pieces did not stay in . When I benched the buds came out and fell on the bench . I used them for four 2 hour workouts and out of the four there were four workouts where the device just disconnected from my phone three-quarters of the way through the workout . Once I had to reboot the phone because nothing displayed.The charging pouch is nice , but the product just did n't cut it .	-1
First the good news . The sound quality is excellent.But I got this for a tech savvy friend whose standard iPhone ear-buds were dying , so she was really motivated to get it to work.But we never got it to work for her . The instructions were n't very friendly or intuitive . The system , with the charger and wireless part were klugey and not as convenient as the blue-tooth single-ear devices I have . I 'd talk to her and half the time there were problems , so , eventually she discarded them as more hassle than they were worth.I really wanted this to work . We were disappointed it did n't . I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
I purchased these for my teenage son who prefers using Apple 's earbuds to listen to music , and I wanted to get him something that was wireless . I noticed him trying to get these to fit properly but he could never get them to sit comfortably in his ears ( which is amazing to me since I can not get the Apple earbuds to sit comfortably in my ears ! ) I do n't like earbuds at all , so these went back .	-1
These were a disappointment to me . They did n't fit my ears at all ; even with the smallest buds , they kept falling out . Excited when I first got them but the sound quality was below par at best . It sounded a little crackly . The sound from the left ear kept going in and out . Maybe I got a defective pair but did n't want a replacement of these . I quickly returned these and ordered another wireless pair from a different manufacturer . Hopefully they will fair better with me .	-1
Let 's just say there 's tons of room for improvement for this model , as I went through countless pairs of them . ( However , Amazon was GREAT when it came to sending them back for a replacement set and reimbursing my shipping . ) As far as this brand and model # is concerned though , after going through at least 3 sets , and having nothing but trouble with them , learn from my experience , and go with the more expensive JayBirds ... & # 34 ; you get what you pay for & # 34 ; .	-1
Maybe I have a faulty case , but it appears as though the clasp is backwards - not impressed . Fast shipping however , but the case seems be be cheap ( I normally do n't give bad reviews ... however , I do n't like this case )	-1
I must be the unlucky one . Either it 's the design or the craftsmanship but the product is totally unusable . Even without inserting any credit card or cash , the cover does not close properly . That means the iPhone remains on , with screen lite . Even if you configure to automatically shutdown in 1 minute , it turns on as soon as the case is touched.Very very disappointed ... and frankly surprised encountered this problem . Returned for refund .	-1
Love the case ! But the protective film attached to the case was torn halfway off..it fits the phone nice , and love the color .	-1
This screen protector fits the phone without a clearance on the edges , so because of that you ca n't clear the bubbles from the edges and they tend to get larger . if this screen protector was a little smaller it would have been perfect .	-1
THis is a great screen protector but I wound up going somewhere else due to I never could get the shield in the correct position without getting bubbles all over the screen .	-1
Cheaply made . Can not push power button , silence button an does not snap together well . Gapes open so would not be waterproof .	-1
Cheap . Buttons too hard . Gapes open . Cheaply made and just a disappointment all aroun . Most define tilt not water proof .	-1
NOONE COULD HEAR ME .I DONTT THINK THE HOLES LINED UP RIGHT .ENDED UP BUYING A LIFE PROOF CASE MUCH BETTER BUT ALOT MORE MONEY	-1
DOES NOT FIT ON GALAXY S4 ACTIVES ITS CLOSE BUT DOES NOT FIT SO DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IT WILL NOT FIT	-1
I had to return this item due to the fact the case that surrounds the phone is rubber . It was stretched out and did not fit my phone snug . I returned this item and bought the Otter Box case instead . Otter Box more expensive but was exactly what I was looking for . This case need to dump the rubber cover and it would have been perfect .	-1
About a month or so ago , I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active . I was trying to find a case that did n't break the bank , looked appealing , and was functional . This one seemed to fit the bill and had great reviews , so I ordered it . I went from an iPhone 4s with a case that had a hard/soft shell so getting the same type of case for my new phone seemed to be like the best thing for it . I loved my OtterBox Commuter and figured this kind of seemed like the same thing , only cheaper . When I finally received the case , I was really excited . I thought I got a lot of bang for my buck : hard/soft case , kickstand , plus a belt clip ( though I would n't use that part ) . Unfortunately , as soon as I put the case on , I was disappointed . The soft part of the case was really loose and did not fit the phone well . Even after putting the hard shell on , the soft shell moved around and just felt inadequate . This case is also not low profile and just felt extremely bulky in my female hands ( even though I do n't have tiny hands ) .Although I thought the idea of a kickstand would be cool , I never actually used it . When I use my phone , I 'm usually sitting in my bed or on the couch and do n't have a hard surface to use the kickstand . If you use your phone a lot at a desk or something , this might be a great thing for you . Unfortunately , it just did n't do anything for me . I also liked the idea of the added belt clip and that part I did actually like , although as I said before I did n't use it as I put my phone in my purse . The case would slide screen side down into the belt clip and it was well protected and snug.Overall , I just did n't like this case . It is a great idea with the low price and many added features , but it was not executed well . For me , it was too bulky and had features that I did not personally utilize . I ordered the TUDIA Ultra Slim Melody Series TPU Protective Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 Active I9295 ( Purple ) and I enjoy that case much more . It is simple , protects my phone , is low profile , and easy to hold in the hand . Just what I needed.If I were you , I would look elsewhere for a case .	-1
Really solid case but too bulky for me . Also it barely fits in the holster because the fit is too tight , almost take the case off pulling it out . Again it 's a great design aside from the thickness and fit . I wanted a slimmer case .	-1
Number one , the photo is misleading . I thought the case was black . I would send it back , but since it is not under the Amazon return guarantee , it would not be worth my trouble . Second , it is poorly made with the & # 34 ; gems & # 34 ; unevenly spaced . Third , it is cheap , cheap , cheap . But I guess I should not be surprised , as it was cheap . I will use it until the gems fall off and then throw it away . Or maybe I 'll just throw it away .	-1
Thought it was black because of picture . Absolutely disappointed . Super cheap product not even worth what I paid . How pathetic that they provide nail glue to glue back on the gemsWould return but too much trouble to deal with . Noth buying from this seller ever again . Beware super cheap case .	-1
The case looks alot better in the picture than it does when it 's actually on the phone . Kind of makes the phone look cheap . I trashed it .	-1
the cover is very cheaply made . It is not made to protect your phone at all . The plastic is that hard brittle , non flexible type that feels like it is going to crack when you put it on . I do n't recommend this product . The only reason I gave it two stars is because it has bling and it is cute on the phone ... just not practical .	-1
This is awful , it 's not what I expected the manufacture did n't comply with the Oder . They gave an half done item Iam very disappointed with this item , it 's not what you expected to look like and whole different product.We	-1
I never had a chance to use this since after the delayed shipment , the package came with a large puncture through the shipping package , the taped together box ( this was suppose to be new but appeared used/returned previously ) , and the film . Great job GMYLE , I will never purchase anything from you again due to your shady attempt to sell used as new and send something with such poor packaging .	-1
I found a video on youtube that explained how some retailers can rip you off because the charging coil used is made of cheaper process and materials so phone never charged properly . I found out this was made of a copper coil instead of a printed circuit board and was hard and a tad bulky	-1
I specifically purchased this charger due to the & # 34 ; High Speed & # 34 ; 2 amp rating it allegedly has . I play Ingress a lot , so that means I drive around with my screen on a lot of the time and this charger ( on the 2A plug ) wo n't even charge the phone fast enough to keep it at a steady level . Thats right , with the screen on my phone ( Samsung Galaxy s4 ) actually experiences a decrease in battery level . I went back to my name-brand charger that I got from Sprint and even though its only rated at 1 amp , it still actually charges the phone with the screen on . I would n't recommend this charger to anyone . It is also much larger and sticks out much farther than i expected .	-1
It came to me 4 months later then the shipped date ! Cracked and broken not in good shape at all . Definitely was a waste of money , thought i would love it but the condition of the case was horrible and very poor quality .	-1
still waiting on arrival of product id have to say from thew picture its great but been waiting over a month for it and still no show so id have to say bad product , do n't waste time or money	-1
Very badly fitting the mobile , larger than the size of note 3I advice no one to purchase this caseI regret to write such a comment but this was a fact	-1
I THOUGHT THIS CASE WOULD BE THE PERFECT CASE FOR MY NOTE 3 BUT THE SIDES IS LOOSE AND NOT SNUG SO IM SENDING THIS BACK FOR A REFUND	-1
I was hoping this case was made out of soft plastic , but its hard clear cheap plastic . Make the phone look ugly because you can see all the scratches . I can not recommend this case .	-1
I did not like this one .The body is plastic Which is easy to crack .I did like the bling on it .	-1
This is not working all the time with my iPhone 5 , sometimes I get the message saying this accessory can not be used	-1
This car charger looks sturdy but more times than not , it doesnt connect with my phone and charge it . The red light is on , indicating that it is connected to the car , but does not seem to connect to the phone , even after playing around with it . It is inexpensive , but unreliable .	-1
Did n't work after iPhone software update . So I had to throw it away . It also used to heat my phone while charging .	-1
This has a cheap quality to it . Quit charging my phone within weeks . i would not suggest anyone waste your time and money on ordering this item .	-1
I have n't tried the other battery yet , but one of the two batteries was definitely defective . When my phone got down to around 20 % charge , within a few minutes it dropped off to zero and turned off . I know it was a problem with the battery , because when I put the original Samsung battery back in , it worked fine . I would highly recommend paying the extra money and just get the OEM Samsung battery.May 29 , 2014After 7 months of use , the remaining good battery swelled up and went kerblooy . Adios battery AND cell phone .	-1
The batteries are already coming apart and they do n't keep a charge . I 've had issues with the batteries losing more charge than they gain while having the phone plugged in .	-1
I ordered this item from Amazon , and received it the following day . Kuddos to Amazon on thier continued ability to complete orders in a outstanding manner . Nevertheless , the acutual charger unit is defective . I plugged it into a regular wall socket , and it charged the first battery with success however , after placing the second battery into the charging unit and allowing it time to charge , the charging unit just quit working . I moved the unit to another workable wall socket to no avail . I am not sure of the quality of the Anker 's batteries , but I do know from this experience that Ankers either makes a subpar charging unit or orders them from a company that makes subpar charging units . Buyer Beware !	-1
I received this charger and it looked good , but I never actually tried it because I really only needed it for camping trips . When I went to try it for the first time I noticed that although the battery held a charge fine , it would not charge any external devices . I tried multiple USB cables and phones / tablets and nothing.I contacted the seller about replacing it and was told since I had bought it more than 30 days ago , I could only get a pro-rated refund . Apparently the & # 34 ; 12 months worry-free product guarantee for every purchase from Poweradd & # 34 ; does n't mean they 'll actually get you a working product . This seems to be a rebranded product offered by multiple sellers so I would recommend purchasing it from someone with a better warranty and hope you get lucky with a functional unit .	-1
Got this for long camping trips . Followed directions exactly . Tried it at home , seemed to be working fine as it charged up quickly with direct sun and then charged several cell phones with no problem . The first time out in the field it would n't work . The lights lit up and it looked like it was working but it would n't charge anything . Even after trying several different cords , it would n't charge . Returned it and got a different brand.Update 7.10.14 : Received a poorly worded email from Poweradd offering me a new device if I would remove my negative review . I think not . Too many others had the same problems as I did and I do n't want to be in the field with no power . In the meantime I ordered from a different company and the new device works perfectly .	-1
Works well when charged , but similar to other solar charges the 'solar charger ' is more of a gimmick than anything . to actually charge a 10,000mah with teh solar panel would take days.the main criticisms i have are A ) weight- it 's heavy for throwing in your backpack , and B ) the battery depletes itself over a couple weeks of non use.. this was annoying as I normally throw in my bag and only take out for emergencies , then when the emergency comes it is dead .	-1
Love this product and hated to return it , but it only worked about 25 % of the time . With a full charge , most of the time , it would charge my phone for a minute and then the LEDs would go out and my phone would stop charging . The only way to reset it and get it to work again was to put it on a charger.A lesser issue , but annoying is the plug used to recharge the device is set so far back in the orange plastic case that the micro USB cord would not click in . So , charging the device in the car was impossible because of the device getting jostled slightly.It is very cool and if I had more patience , I would have exchanged it . It will charge even with clouds . Very neat . Sadly , I think it 's just poorly built and I had little faith it would work more than a month or two if I had a good one .	-1
These are really small at the most 2 inches by 3 inches . These are more like disposable . What a riff-off .	-1
I like the design but the cradle does not fit my Samsung Galaxy 4s Active . It 's not off by much , but enough to keep it from fitting securely and interferes with the volume button . I like the fact that the case protects my screen but if my phone does not fit securely , I am looking for a replacement .	-1
I loved how it looked an felt but it came apart after 3 days and I took good care of it	-1
The plastic cradle that snaps on to the phone is way too big , so that the phone slides inside . Very hard to reach the side on/off button .	-1
i fell in love with this type of case a year ago , the one i had for my SG3 fit like a glove ... this one does not ... my phone barely fits in the case and it does not snap in , also the magnet is horrible it will not keep the case closed if there is too much inside , its alright with just an ID but if there is anything else , especially money it will not say shut	-1
I returned this because my phone would just fall out ! It was a nice looking and fairly well made & designed , but I 'm guessing that there 's more than one size for the Galaxy S4 phones , because my phone would n't fit at all ! If when I was purchasing this case , they Name ACTIVE was present I think I would have ask is there a difference ? I have yet to find a case for my phone , because all the cases are too big or lager than my phone !	-1
It 's cheap.. but hey you get what you pay for . The quality is cheap and it will not last very long .	-1
They are much smaller than I anticipated but they do work . They look and feel cheap though . Good for the price .	-1
I bought the Spigen Tough Armor case based on what I now believe are phony reviews . This case is compact but provides no protection for the front of your iPhone . Compared to an Otterbox it provides a quarter of the protection needed to secure your phone and does not give you confidence that your phone is safe.Big thumbs done on the Tough Armor case ... .	-1
It 's like all the employees at Spigen posted some lies about how & # 34 ; awesome & # 34 ; this case is . Here 's why this case gets 1 star:1 ) The quality is terrible for a $ 22 dollar case . It 's been a month and the edges are already coming off on this 2 piece construction.2 ) I received mine with scratches all over the colored back side . After a month I noticed this case scratches easily.3 ) The fit is terrible with the phone hanging over the edge which means it 's prone to damaging the iPhone.4 ) Do n't believe all the hype from these B*S reviews posted here . This is not a premium phone case . It 's worth about $ 2 at a night market ...	-1
I think this product has fake reviews . This case is super cheap . It does n't fit snug on my 5S . The plastic backing plate is just toy plastic , nothing more . Easy to scratch too . As soon as i put in on my phone , i took it off and back in the box . I guess that 's what i get for buying an unknown brand . I actually bought the same style for my ipad mini . Returned both .	-1
Nice but did n't allow my cell phone to work in an already weak signal zone that I am in in made my problem worst . Perhaps for those who have full signal strength this works better for . The metal made my signal drop . Too many dropped calls to no calls with this cover . I opted for something else .	-1
Nice looking case but the lock button at the top fell off and I ca n't use the actual case now . Not worth even the money because it fell off in a few weeks	-1
2 stars because the back piece scratches very easily . My phone goes from a nightstand , to a car dock and then it sits on my desk all day at work . This case became noticeably scratched in a very short period of time . Spigen charging $ 10 to replace these backplates adds insult to injury since these pieces of plastic scratch so easily.I 'm overall disappointed in this purchase . The case is designed well and offers a lot of protection , but if you 're looking for a case that will look great for the long term without having to replace pieces I strongly suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
Bought direct seemed ok for 30 days . The TPU started off tight , and about 3 weeks get a little play . Also noticed the colored frame got scratched up very easy . NEVER DROPPED AND JUST PLACED ON COUNTERS ! ! Spigen support took weeks to respond and said this was normal . So normal is low quality material . I will stay away from cases that do n't have a honorable 12 month warranty .	-1
Cheap , and broke 2 minutes out of the box . Made of cheap plastic and not held together well at all . Stay away from this..	-1
The i9190 supposed to have two sims ... this phone does not have 2 sims ... must be some other model ... . We decided to keep it though for its great resolution but disappointed same as with most phones now ... ..You have a great phone till 3pm ... .	-1
This case feels incredibly flimsy and looks cheap . After using it for about two weeks , it is already very scratched up . I feel like it provides very little protection , if any . I dropped my phone once , and the case came flying off . I think I 'll be sticking to my Speck cases .	-1
Short Summary : Too Gimmicky . Lack of design function , too much form consideration.My ideal battery pack is as follows:1 ) Lightweight2 ) Economically priced3 ) Small footprintIt 's a support product for your phone . Function should be way over form for this . If you want to look at something pretty , get a nicer phone or tablet.Anything additional addon or design to the battery back is impractical . It serves more of a distraction than being useful . As consumers , we will end up paying more to have these `` features '' that we do not need.Features ( 1/10 ) : We want functional features on our products especially a support product for battery , not gimmicky features.The Shake to Wake function serves more a gimmick than any practical useFirstly so call shake requires a considerable force . Not many people will be willing to throw their arms frantically to get this awake . Can get this slipped out from your hand and there goes your battery.Since the shake function is gimmicky and serves zero practically , it 's simple to say we are paying more money for useless feature while having motors inside to make the battery pack weight more.Performance ( 7/10 ) : Performance is less at what a regular external battery does.There 's a simple math formula to calculate power conversion.In my one week of trial , I 'm able to get 2.2 recharge on my Galaxy S3 which is 2100mAh . This means in actual fact this is 4620mAh after efficiency conversionThe Wh claimed here is 9A*3.7V=33.3Wh33Wh/5V ( 5V from USB ) = 6.6A*1000=6600mAh is the expected Wh without circuit board inefficiency for a 9000mAh battery pack4650mAh ( from actual use ) / 6600mAH = 0.7045 equals to 70.45 % power conversion efficiency through their circuit board . Average total energy conversion rate ( TECR ) on average circuit board is rated at 80-85 % from reputable brands.This equals to around 10-15 % less energy efficient than your typical reputable brand with the same battery they are using.3 problems can cause issue:1 ) cheap battery used2 ) cheap board design causing inefficiency3 ) cheap material used on circuit board reducing TECRNowadays , consumers are very easy to get fooled by having some good battery cells used and stick in one or two mediocre ones . It allows manufacturer to earn some margin on selling mediocre battery packsCheap board design occurs when manufacturer uses poorly made board or power inefficient chips . This caused lose of energy and greatly reduce TECR.The 10-15 % energy lost can be a little bit of the 3 problems.Price ( 2/10 ) : Price for this battery pack is not cheap consider the above performance result . At literally 25 % more than other comparable brands , this manufacturer is making a huge margin and justify adding more cost by:1 ) putting gimmick features on board2 ) possibly using mediocre battery cells3 ) possibly using cheap material or poor board designThere are cheaper alternatives out there with higher efficiency . With more choices out there , it 's hard to find reason to pay this much for a battery packDesign ( 3/10 ) : The overall aesthetic of the battery is nice to look but not entirely practical . People need to remember that for backup battery pack , function is far more important than how it looks . Concept of design requires a good balance between function and form with polarized products such as a backup battery pack , it requires much more function over form.I say this because you will put this device in your pouch and will not take this out at rare occasions . When you are recharging the battery pack you will most likely leave it in the pouch provided . If you are looking for something with better form , go get a better looking phone that this device supports.In the case where you will hold this with your phone or tablet , the rounded surface leaves your phone or tablet unstably positioned . As a product of support , it 's simple to say this is not struturally supportive at all.Many people such as myself prefer not to use the pouch included as that traps heat and as your chemistry teacher will say , heat is a big no-no for batteries . When it is out of the bag , the back battery charger serves absolutely no purpose except to look good on its own.That itself is a design failure and lack of consideration to user experience.Conclusion ( 2/10 ) Let me put it this way . In this economy we probably want something more practical , more functional . Some aesthetic is great on some products but as a support product , this has too much glitter and glamour but none of the practical stuff you really need . It 's a support device for your phone and it is the phone where the glitter and glamour should be . However , it 's not acting like a support device at all with its subpar performance and its rounded surface.I 'll run this in another week and hope at least the performance improves . If it does n't , I 'm sending this back for something that serves more purpose . [ ... ] Thanks for reading !	-1
I ended up sending this back . It took FOREVER to charge and would not charge the phone completely even overnight . Plus it got VERY hot while charging . I ended up getting a different model for a little more and it is fast and does not get nearly as hot.UPDATE : The company was very good about contacting me directly when they heard about the issues I had with the charger and offered to replace it . I had already purchased a new charger ( different model ) , but I was happy to hear that the company was standing behind its products .	-1
I had to use my phone charge in order to charge it over night.When charging the light was RED so I unplug it after 24 hours and put my phone on top of the charger & nothing charged . This item should take a full charge and I should be able to use it not pluged in correct ?	-1
I chose this wireless charger because of its size and thought it would work well . However , while charging my smartphone ( which is Qi-Enabled ) , I checked to see how much the battery had charged when I discovered that my phone was getting too hot , which made this charger useless since I decided not to use it again . Therefore , I returned it due to the overheatinng problem .	-1
I used it to charge my Nexus 7 . On the 2nd night that I used the charger , it fried my Nexus 7 . The Nexus never came on again . The previous night my Nexus only charged to 40 % after 8 hours on the charger . My Nexus 7 was only 2 weeksold at the time . I cried , and then returned it to Best Buy for a new Nexus 7 . Nexus 7 users use caution when tryingto charge with this device .	-1
It 's advertised to fit both the 2014 MacBook Pro w/ Retina and the MacBook Air . Well , it does n't . My brand new Pro would not fit . The packaging is only advertised to fit the Air , not the Pro . I sent it back for a refund .	-1
Had to return it ... stopped working but returned in time and they refunded my money	-1
I soak in my whirlpool tub every evening to ease my psoriasis and arthritis pains . So many times I 've thought how I 'd like to listen to music in there but did n't want the risk ( or hassle ) of moving a boombox into the bathroom . Tried listening to music on my iPhone , and even when placed in a supposedly-amplifying shallow bowl , I still could n't hear it over the sound of the whirlpool jets.When I saw this waterproof Bluetooth wireless speaker , I thought my wish had been granted . Ordered it , charged the thing up and synced it with my iPhone without a problem . That first night I listened to an hour of the Brandenburg Concertos and thought I was in heaven . As I finished bathing , I drained the tub and started getting out , at which point my foot knocked this thing into the tub ... at which point I realized the suction cup does n't work very well . Not a problem , I figured , I 'll just have to move the thing further from the edge of the tub in the future.Well , the next night I tried to use this speaker again and it did n't work . It would n't even go on ! Maybe the battery only lasts an hour or so ? I took it back to the laptop ( there 's no wall charger , just USB ) and tried charging it . Nope . It would n't charge . It would n't even turn on . For all intents and purposes , it had turned into a round , pink brick.Now , there was LESS than 1 inch of water when I 'd knocked it into the tub , and it had landed suction-cup side down , so the speaker itself never even got wet . It was less than an 18-inch fall ( broken by that & # 60 ; 1 inch of water , at that ) , so it was n't a hard impact that would 've dislodged well-made electronics . I 'd even immediately retrieved it and dried the thing off , so it had n't sat in water . In other words : there is NO REASON FOR IT TO STOP WORKING , and yet it did . After just one use.As far as I 'm concerned , if you 're going to advertise something as waterproof , it better be able to handle such little water , and certainly such a split-second exposure to it . If you 're going to put a suction cup on it , that suction cup better work . And if you 're going to sell it for use in places notoriously full of hard-surfaces , it better handle an 18-inch fall and still work.What a waste of money .	-1
I got this for my sister and it worked great for 4 days . You could n't tell that water was running while she was on the phone with it , and the sound was great.4 Days later , it would make popping and crackling noises and would n't play any music . It was never submerged in water . Ended up getting a refund and going with a different speaker .	-1
So my co-worker told me about her bluetooth speaker for her shower . I thought I would try one ! my other bluetooth speaker ( non-shower variety ) does have a volume control . Sometimes it 's hard to tell what level of sound you need to be on for the melody to rise above the steaming shower . I like having the speaker there and it really sticks to our shower surround ( I believe it 's fiber-glass ? ) But the battery does n't last that long , and there is n't a volume . I 'm not overly impressed with this item . I think I would use it more otherwise because I LOVE my music !	-1
This only stuck to the shower wall for about a minute . It fell three feet and broke right away .	-1
Let me start by saying I bought the official Fresh E Tech version , so none of that & # 34 ; it 's a knockoff & # 34 ; nonsense , supposedly.Pros : * It does in fact work , as far as it goes.Cons : * Proprietary charging cable . Yes , it 's USB on the other end , but it is not something like Micro USB or Mini USB on the device side - so do n't lose or break the cable , or you 're done . * Way too quiet . Like way , way too quiet . I bought to use as a shower speaker , but even with a loud podcast at maximum volume , this guy is n't loud enough to be heard over the bathroom fan and running shower . That means it 's pretty much useless to me - I bought it for one purpose , and it fails at that purpose.I did n't want to give it one star since it does work , and it seems like the sound is high quality , etc . - it 's just not loud enough . I 'd send it back but that 's not worth the hassle . Maybe a friend will want it or something .	-1
Not impressed by this product , first it was not loud enough to hear audiobooks over the water and fan , second the little rubber cover for the power socket came off after like two charges , eliminating its waterproofing . I ended up passing it on to a friend .	-1
The concept is cool but the execution was poor . The sun tigon cup is n't capable of supporting the speaker and as such it fell of in the first 5 minutes of me sticking it to a glass window and it did n't change after reapplying it several times not to mention the battery cables are tightly connected and broke from one fall off the window . I quickly returned it .	-1
This item is one of those that you get what you pay for . It is cheap plastic , not cut properly for the charge connection , ear buds and such . Does not fit snug at ALLSave your frustration and time	-1
Do they work ? Yes..Do they look like the ear buds that come with your Galaxy ? Yes ... Are they OEM ? ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! ! I 'm fine with promoting your product as a & # 34 ; look alike & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; similar to & # 34 ; but do n't advertise its OEM when it 's not ! ! ... they sound hollow and are pretty much worth the $ 5.99 I paid for it so it fulfills the old adage ... .see the pic I uploaded so u can see how I knew they were fake ... Ya think the legitimate SAMSUNG quality control would allow the misspelling of their manufacturer name ? ? ? ? ? Uhhhhhh yeah I do n't think so ... ..	-1
Within the first use I noticed that I have to twist and turn the plug of the headphones for me to receive the proper sound . Sounds like there is a short in the in wire . The cord itself is flat however is it not as thick and wide as other flat wired headsets so i do n't get a feel that this wire is more durable than the original headet . With that said i will be returning back the headset as it seems to have a short in the cord and is defective .	-1
ok.. I have small ears for a guy but yeah they do not stay in and they dont have other size buds with them	-1
The headphones I received were not OEM headphones , as both the low end sound as well as the highs sounded cheap and tinny .	-1
they suck . first if all , they broke , and I 've only had them for about a week . the right ear piece just broke off , horrible quality . and even before they broke , the headphone only worked when I turned the headphone in the input to get it at a certain angle to work . the quality of the sound also sucked . so do yourself a favor and look somewhere else please .	-1
Knowing that this is not the real thing I bought this because it was really cheap and good enough for the gym . Upon arrival the up volume button was already busted and the sound quality was crappy as expected . If you want purposely pay for a shoddy product like me then go for it . You 'll hate it , but it was only six bucks .	-1
These are ok for the price i guess , ive never had earphones come without extra earbuds . The earbuds that came with them were way to big for my ears , who do they think ears are that big , i had to get smaller ones to put on them . The sound quality is ok , but hey what you expect for the price .	-1
Protectors fall off upon installation or within a week after . Would not recommend to anyone , cheap price and cheap product . Company wins .	-1
Impossible to apply . Added rubbery feel to phone & no application card included . was very disappointed in the product	-1
This is a piece of junk ! The magnet in this thing is horrible ; almost non existent . Does n't stay closed . Phone sits in it nicely but the cover is a hot mess . I tried and tried to give it a chance but it does n't work . If I had n't of tried to mod this case to help it not being pathetic I would have returned it . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! Maybe I 'll cut the baby magnet flap off or set it on fire on my next camping trip . Either way it would be better .	-1
Pro : Style is great . Cons : Very cheap quality . Ca n't wipe dirt off the clear plastic on flip cover . The magnet on the back of phone cover came off after 2nd day of use . Got a free replacement , but the shape and fit of it were uneven , had to get a 3rd replacement , but somehow never received it , so got my refund at the end . All the inconvenience was not worth it .	-1
One of The top clasp broke on the case as soon as I opened it . So did n't even get a chance to test it out to see if it would work .	-1
wont let you take pictures ! ! ! ! !	-1
Bought five of these cables and it is obvious that they are not OEM.The cables are flimsy , the material is stiff and cable keeps the bend . The USB side of the plug is difficult to plug ( in any device ) and the micro USB side fits loosely and does not secure when connected in many devices ( such as Nexus 7 2013 tablet for example ) .I could not recommend these cables to anyone .	-1
I selected this cable because it shipped and sold from Amazon . I had put faith in Amazon carrying genuine accessories ( especially ones advertised as such ) . However , this was a typical , cheap Chinese knock off.Upon opening you 'll find a cord much thinner and frail feeling . When I attempted to charge from my 2 amp port and use my phone at the same time I lost battery . I tried the other 2A port as well as both 1A porta with the same results . Returning .	-1
The front portion of the cover feels loose . It looks very cheap . The original version I saw at Best Buy was very solid quality .	-1
This Lasted 2 months before I got a product incompatible message and then it refused to charge my iPhone.Ca n't recommend .	-1
K leme try to do this without swearing ... ... . MY girl LOVED this yo . THANKED me EVERY DANG DAY SOLDIER ! ! ! WORE MY JOHNSON OUT for this EXCELENT charger . SAVED me some JEFFERSONS TOO . ( because we all kno it 's all about the benjamins yo . ) SHE has an iPhone 5. one day she woke up PUT on her makeup . SHES OUT THE DOOR and calls me all UPSET . & # 34 ; TA FUDGE BAE YOU GIMMIE THIS CHEAP SHEEZY ? ! ? ! & # 34 ; I calm her down . Calmly wipe the connectors on the battery pack with a bit of 99 % isopropyl alcohol , in hopes that doing so may save her beloved charger but alas . no F'n dice . Thanks a lot knips . Hittin em up for that refund now yo , best believe'dat . as aziz ansari said ; & # 34 ; if this was a drug deal i woulda shot hotel luxury linens in the face & # 34 ; I & # 34 ; M LOOKIN AT YOU NIPS OR KNIPS OR KINPS HOW EVER THE HEAL YOU SAY ITYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED : It may , or may ... or may not SHeeZ out on your external phone chargin ' gamblin ' @ zz ! AINT no f*n joke .	-1
This Kinps case is not really a battery case for the iPhone ; it is a battery in the shape of an rather bulky and heavy iPhone case . The distinction is important . As with any battery case , the iPhone slips in for charging , but the Kinps case offers absolutely no protection for the top third of the iPhone and little for the rest.Accordingly , carrying the iPhone around in this case is not recommended.Unfortunately , slipping the iPhone into and out of the Kinps case for charging means completely removing and restoring whatever case is used to normally protect the iPhone which is impractical.The Kinps case is well priced and has some good features including a USB port out , high capacity and the ability to charge simultaneously with the iPhone using the Apple cable.We assume this is a decent battery and it may work for someone who wants to carry around the Kinps case and occasionally recharge an unprotected iPhone , For us , the concept does n't work , and we have returned it.Not recommended because of bad design .	-1
When i received it it looked original sealed with labels but i noticed the cable is shorter than original what i have..Do n't waste your money an this item is not going to work ... do n't charge my phone at all ...	-1
Case is too deep for stratosphere phone ... texture is nice but case makes it difficult to turn on and adjust volume	-1
After 1 month on my phone , I dropped the phone , shattered the face , took it to be fixed , and the tech broke/wore the tabs so the back would not stay on . Called about a replacement , was told there is a 1 year warranty with the manufacturer , did n't keep the package , so no idea where to send it , no invoice other than the one online , seller was rather curt with instructions on return , referred me to the packaging that I no longer have ... wo n't order from this company again ... or this cover , either ! Now my partner 's cover is exhibiting the same problem ... one clip wo n't hold , only a matter of time before his falls off too .	-1
