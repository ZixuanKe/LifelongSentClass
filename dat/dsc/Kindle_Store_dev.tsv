When I first started this book , I thought wow I cant believe Laurie is willing to go along with what Jonah asks . He is a virgin and wants Laurie to teach him all about sex . He makes up a story about having a boyfriend that was pressuring him and he was n't comfortable with that , he just wants to get his first time over with . The truth is he 's had a crush on Laurie for years . What he does n't know is Laurie feels the same way . He 's Jonah 's brothers best friend though , and he does n't want to ruin that friendship . He 's honest and talks to Jonah 's brother who trusts Laurie to do whats right . This really was a good story , I liked how they start out as having an arrangement , but soon end up in mutual attraction .	1
Not exactly a coming of age story , but close enough . Jonah is old enough to know what he wants and Laurie already knows too . It 's short , sweet and fun . We should all have it together at that age . Well done .	1
I truly enjoyed reading this book . I can relate to it so closely . I knew I was gay as a child . My neighbor was my friend n lover . It was a great experience n hot sex . Read on .	1
Good free short story . Enjoyed the characters . Nice plot . Hot sex . The jerk gets what he deserves . And the main characters resolve their conflict with an HFN .	1
I really loved to read about their progression . I also bought the second role play book to see more about them . I would love to see what happens to them in the future . Good job	1
This is my first book by this Author , but it wo n't be my last ! I enjoyed the inner play between the brothers and the best friend . I like it when love does triumph over the problems and the story has a happy ending . I ca n't say much more since 98 % of the other reviews agree with me ! Would be nice of this author took this short story and expanded it into a full length book , there is so much more that could be told using these great characters . Please keep up the great work !	1
A very good book . I would of liked it if it continued further . A nicely written love story . I felt like I was right there with them . I will look for more books like this one .	1
I liked their relation ship and it seemed different than other books . If you are interested in something different , this will be for you .	1
I remember this story . I am unsure how long ago I read it but apparently long enough that Amazon did n't give me the warning that I had already bought it . Maybe it was published under another name in the past . It is still as satisfying little read . Sweet .	1
My Review : I loved this little novella . It probably falls more accurately under the New Adult section because these are young guys ( one just finished high school , the other is in college ) , but it did n't have the angst those books normally have . What it did have was a truly heartwarming , sweet , romantic story . This would be the perfect read while sitting at the edge of the lake one afternoon during the summer . It 's one of those books that works in that setting and just leaves you with a feeling of peace and happiness.Jonah has crushed on his older brother 's best friend , Laurie , for years . The summer before he goes to college , he comes up with a plan . He asks Laurie to take his virginity ... under the guise of that he does n't want to go to college as a virgin and he 'd rather his first time be with someone he trusts . The truth is he just really wants to have sex with Laurie and he wants his first time to be Laurie and only Laurie . Laurie is actually okay with this ... at least in theory . He 's been aware of Jonah too , but this is his best friends little brother . There are boundaries with friendship that makes this a bit awkward.I enjoyed the way this all played out . I liked all the characters ... even Marc , the older brother and friend . Like I said , it would make a great quick summer read . It 's short , but I do n't think it lacked for anything . There was great character and story development and I loved watching these guys ' relationship develop .	1
I really liked the way it was written . how steamy it was just full of emotion . anyone who likes homosexual short stories will love this .	1
There is nothing sweeter than an unrequited love being fulfilled between two phenomenal people . Bring the heat and it 's on . I was happily surprised to be so drawn in by this story since I 'm a straight female . True sign of a great writer , attracting unsuspecting fans .	1
I love this Series , I love the family dynamics that flow through these books . A truly touching love story that Kurt never saw coming . It 's not so far out there that you can actually see this happen . I loved that Leanne was a real person , she was n't perfect cookie cutter mold . Which made her perfect to me . These two just fit . Leaves you smiling when you finish . Can hardly wait for more about all these friends now ...	1
Wow , another one that I just stumbled upon by accident and let 's just say I could n't put it down.I sometimes think I 'm becoming a speed reader ! Once I get wrapped up in one of these books that grabs a hold of me I just ca n't put it down . A true keeper	1
I love reading about this family also . As long as she keeps them coming , I will keep reading . I hope there are more to come .	1
I loved Read , Write , Love . I loved everything about it ! Kurt and Leanna are so completely opposite of one another that it really does remind me of that saying & # 8220 ; opposites attract & # 8221 ; . While they are complete opposites , they completely balanced each other out . Where Kurt was organized and tidy and his home was down right bordering sterile , Leanna is a chaotic mess , but a free spirit who knows what she wants although she doesn & # 8217 ; t fully realize it yet.I loved that we were able to catch up with some of the past characters that we have fallen in love with while watching the love grow between the characters of this book.I definitely look forward to hearing more about them in future books !	1
What an amazingly sweet yet sensual romance about a man who & # 8217 ; s organized and a planner , and a woman who & # 8217 ; s not.The most appealing aspects of this story are Kurt and Leanna . If ever there was a perfect story written about two complete opposites who manage to make their relationship work despite having such different personalities , this is it.Kurt & # 8217 ; s nose-to-the-grindstone approach to life is disrupted when he meets Leanna . She & # 8217 ; s unlike any other woman he & # 8217 ; s ever met or known & # 8211 ; honest , open , and living without much of a life plan . And who doesn & # 8217 ; t love a free-spirited heroine , especially one like Leanna ? She talks nonstop , is who she says she is , and might have finally figured out what she wants to do with her life . Maybe.Leanna becomes that splash of color in Kurt & # 8217 ; s life , while Kurt becomes the anchor in Leanna & # 8217 ; s. She might distract him from his writing with heated kisses and promising embraces , but she doesn & # 8217 ; t pull him away from what he loves to do . He encourages her to pursue what she wants , exhibiting patience and understanding as she & # 8220 ; grows up & # 8221 ; without ever making a decision for her.The physical attraction was obvious . The emotional attraction took time . That moment when their relationship became more than just about sex was awesome . Yeah , I grinned like an idiot when they realized how they felt for each other because it was so cool to see.Perhaps the most poignant scene was when Kurt and Leanna had to make a tough decision about their relationship . It was a tough scene to read . Emotions ran high and I knew one or both of them would end up unhappy.But it doesn & # 8217 ; t end there . Ms. Foster doesn & # 8217 ; t leave you hanging with & # 8220 ; What the hell ? & # 8221 ; running through your head like a broken record . Nope . She shows how compromising brings fulfillment to the relationship as a whole , and how everyone wins because one or both are willing to make a sacrifice.~~~ & # 8220 ; Right this very second I can see your face . I can hear your voice. & # 8221 ; His voice was sweet and patient . & # 8220 ; This moment is anything but sucky . You know what & # 8217 ; s sucky ? Losing the person you love. & # 8230 ; & # 8220 ; You are my moment , Leanna . If you & # 8217 ; re here , I want to be right here with you . Every minute of every day. & # 8221 ; ( Kindle , Loc 3622 to 3951 ) ~~~	1
This might be one of my favorites in this series . No overt drama . Just a straight hot steamy love with humor thrown in . Seriously , Melissa foster 's books only get better as she writes and she was already fantastic at writing . Already pre-ordered the next books available . Not a bad book in any of her series .	1
I 've not read the others in this series , but I do n't think that matters much as I could follow this just fine.Its a story where opposites attract , yes , it does happen . And it can be done.Writing whilst sitting on the deck is one thing , writing a thriller on the deck with your top of ohhh wweeeeee who could n't notice that ! Loved the book , love all of Melissa Foster 's work .	1
Okay , for whatever reason , this book has probably been my favorite Remington book . I do n't know if it was because I could relate to Leanna and her awkwardness , but her honesty was so refreshing and relatable . Not to mention Kurt embracing it all ! Their love scenes were filled with both tenderness and sheer sexiness ! ! Love love loved it !	1
Kurt Remington has always been somewhat of a loner spending the majority of his days in front of his computer writing suspense thrillers and is a bestselling author . He & # 8217 ; s also neat freak and likes things organized , he has a schedule that he follows every day and like to be left alone in solitude and silence . Kurt is the last of the Remington & # 8217 ; s to find love but then he isn & # 8217 ; t looking for love anyway . Neither were any of his brothers or his sister . Love just found them , it was fate.Leanna Bray has spent her summer at the Cape since she was little girl when she and her family would come . Now that she & # 8217 ; s grown , she & # 8217 ; s comes by herself with her dog Pepper . Pepper who is untrainable and never listens or behaves . She & # 8217 ; s a free spirit with no organization skills at all and talks nonstop . She & # 8217 ; s Kurt & # 8217 ; s exact opposite but you know what they say , opposites attack.This was by far my favorite book in the series so far ! I absolutely loved Kurt , who was not at all like I thought he would be , and Leanna was perfect for him . I loved her free spirit and the way that she never tried to get in the way of Kurt and his writing as much I loved Kurt taking time off to spend time with her and trying to squish her insecurities . The side characters were great as well . Bella , Jenna and Amy where the perfect lifelong friends that everyone wants to have . Friends that even though you only see them a few months out of each year , you can catch up and it & # 8217 ; s like you were never a part . This is the latest in a long line of the Love in Bloom series and while it can be read as standalone , the series is amazing . This series is what made Mellissa Foster one of my favorite authors and I can & # 8217 ; t wait for the next book !	1
Overall Rating : 4.5 Rockin & # 8217 ; & # 9733 ; & # 9733 ; & # 9733 ; & # 9733 ; & # 9734 ; Kurt Remington has a well-planned , peaceful , structured life until one day he meets a & # 8220 ; free spirit & # 8221 ; named Leanna Bray . He finds his life turned upside down and inside out and knows that it will never be the same again . Kurt rescues Leanna & # 8217 ; s dog from drowning and he finds himself unable to keep from thinking about her . This is not usual for Kurt , he is a planner and sticks to a schedule . Leanna can not even find her cell phone ! She can & # 8217 ; t stop from admiring the beautiful man that rescued her Pepper.How was he supposed to concentrate on writing a dark thriller with a wet dog and an insanely sexy woman in the room ? Her clothes clung to every curve of her womanly body , and it had taken all his focus to look away . And she was cute , too . Damn cute , the way she fought him to save that & # 8230 ; dog . Pepper.Two people that are unlikely lovers find themselves unable to stay apart . She owns a & # 8220 ; Happy mobile , & # 8221 ; a VW van and he drives a Mercedes convertible ! He is a clean freak and she just lives ! & # 8220 ; I mean , look at the thing . Can you really look at it and not smile. & # 8221 ; He couldn & # 8217 ; t look at her without smiling . & # 8220 ; No , I guess I can & # 8217 ; t. & # 8221 ; It doesn & # 8217 ; t take Kurt long to realize that he want Leanna in his life . Even with her disorganization and carefree ways , there is so much joy within her that he is drawn like a moth to a flame.Three words lay on the tip of his tongue , and he held them back . Trapped them in his mind like butterflies under glass , where they flapped and fluttered , trying to set their magnificence free . They hadn & # 8217 ; t known each other long enough for him to even think the three words that , when strung together and spoken from the heart , were the three most significant words in the English language , & # 8230 ; Kurt wants all of Leanna and he knows that she feels the same way about him , so what is the next step ? Move in together , attend a family wedding together ? Will Leanna & # 8217 ; s new business adventure keep their dream of being together from happening ? Kurt and Leanna must make some decisions about their future. & # 8220 ; I & # 8217 ; ve written less , but I & # 8217 ; ve never enjoyed my life more than I have this past week with you , Leanna . If this is what it feels like to live in an upside-down world , then I never want to be right-side up. & # 8221 ; Hero & # 8211 ; Kurt Remington : 5 starsHeroine & # 8211 ; Leanna Bray : 4.5 starsSteam : 4.5 starsPlot : 4.5 starsCliffhanger : NoWould I recommend this book : Yes ! This story will make you laugh , cry and just feel good . It is a great read ! As usual Ms. Foster entertains with a wonderful story of the path to true love.Would I read other books by this author : Yes ! Each book , that I read by this author gets better and better ! ***Received an ARC of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review***	1
This book on the Dukan Diet does a great job showing you what the Dukan Diet is and what you can eat while on the diet . The only negative bit about the book is the length , ended way to quickly ! !	1
Wow , what an easy and to the point read . I love how it & # 8217 ; s written , this is definitely one of th & eacute ; books to have on Ducan Dieting . I & # 8217 ; ve read a few books on this subject but only this book seems to grab my attention and convince me that its possible in only 30 days . After reading this you can & # 8217 ; t help but feel confident that it will work . Overall , a great guide I highly recommend reading .	1
My rating for this book is top notch- A Five ! ! I Love this series- complete dread started swallowing me up whole the closer to the end I got , I fell in love with ALL the characters , I was on edge throughout this whole story as the author does her job that well- taking you on a wild trip of ups an downs of unknown paths and just when you come to a spot to where you can breathe your left to take on something new and unknown and the group that Sang is involved with tightens itself into your heart and mind even more leaving you like an addict on the edge wanting more ! ! What saddens me here- I thought I had the whole complete series- I was EXCITED thinking I had just that to be so DISAPPOINTED learning that this IS NOT the case ! And that it leads to more- But does that deter me from wanting to read the rest of their story ? ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! I want more ! I would read ANYTHING this author writes AND LOVE IT ! ! Prepare yourself to be hooked once you start reading you 'll too be hooked and lost like Alice following the rabbit through the rabbit hole to an unknown destination- 5 stars for sure & lt ; & lt ; & lt ; & lt ; & lt ; 3	1
At the risk of sounding ungrateful for all the time and effort put into creating this story and publishing it ( since this was released today ) , I just have one question : & lt ; b > WHEN DOES # 6 COME OUT ? ! & lt ; /b > & # 62 ; . & # 60 ; You are killing me Stone ! Just killing me with this awesome story with these awesome people with the not so awesome cliff hangers ! I mean , if anyone could write a perfect cliff hanger , that would be you hands down , no question . However , I do n't like to have an awesome story interrupted . Some might mistake me for being impatient ( which I am but that 's not the point ) but this story has way too much good stuff going on for it to just end like that and put me on hold . Now I know that sounds like a personal problem and I should just deal & lt ; b > & lt ; i > but & lt ; /i > & lt ; /b > when its convenient ( for me of course ) , I have a way of shifting the blame and not taking responsibility ... that means that this is entirely YOUR fault ! So I am begging you : PLEASE ! FIX THIS PROBLEM ! aka CAN-I-HAVE-THE-ARC-TO-ANY-OR-ALL-OF-THE-BOOKS-YOUR-WRITE-SO-I-CAN-FIND-HAPPINESS ? At the very least , will the releases of each book be monthly ? Semi-monthly ? Ah , well , I 'll just continue to re-read all 5 until Your Awesomeness will bestow upon us ( obsessed ) fans any more awesome ... ness ... hmmm , seems I need another adjective . Suggestions anyone ? ? ? Just to be clear : THANK YOU C.L . Stone for this series and the effort put into getting it published and released at all ^.^ You are a very talented author and just in case you missed it , I & lt ; b > ca n't & lt ; /b > & lt ; b > & lt ; i > wait & lt ; /i > & lt ; /b > for more !	1
Great series ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This book was everything plus some ... ca n't wait for the next book and also the new series that starts in February	1
I really like the academy series and just ca n't get enough of sang and the boys . I get lost in every adventure and just keep wanting more any one who reads the first will want to read everyone . Ca n't wait until the next one .	1
This book was finished in one sitting . You ca n't stop and do n't want to ! I can not wait for the next book to come out in this series ! ! There are suppose to be around 20 books in this series and I will definitely own them all ! !	1
This ties into the previous book and has a great story line . I was never bored or unhappy , I love this series and I CAN NOT wait for the next one !	1
This series is seriously addictive and I loved this installment as I have all the previous ones ! The dynamic in the group is changing , emotions surfacing . Sang 's role is getting more active , new threats are introduced . OMG I ca n't wait for # 6 .	1
I am reviewing this book and I am at 80 % . I do not want this book to end . C.L . Stone has a story line and characters that suck you into the story and make you never want to leave . Sang May not be an Academy girl yet , but after five books the Academy is still a mystery . It amazes me that one book can be so full of action , fun , New experiences for Sang and the boys , and still keep you interested . I have had this series come up on my recommendation list for a while and I almost dismissed the series and I am so glad that I actually decided one to to take a chance with a series that is not in my fav genre . A must read ...	1
I loved this book ! This is a great series ! ! I am dying to know what happens next . Hurry up and release the next one please .	1
I ran across this series while browsing and it is the best thing i did in months . Once i started reading i couldnt stop . I stayed up two nights because i was so intrigued ! I love the storyline and the characters are brilliant ! This is a series i will devotedly follow until the end !	1
It was non-stop action with twists and turns and a drool over hot guy on every page . I LOVE , LOVE , LOVE this series . You will not be disappointed . It 's a totally original story idea which that in itself is one of the best things about it . but it is also really well written with wonderfully developed characters in each book and they each continue to grow and mature . I can NOT wait for June to get here so I can read the next one .	1
So is book 6 out yet ? ? ? I can not wait . I stay up way to late to go finish the book because I can not put it down and have to know more .	1
This is absolutely my favorite series of books . Entertaining , wonderful characters and interesting storyline ... I never know what to expect from the boys . I was a Twilight fan and still am . However , this series is every bit as good and maybe a bit better . Would love to see a movie series of these books . Great job !	1
I have been watching and can anyone tell me if she is going to write another book in this series ?	1
I loved this one as much as I loved the others . Not a disappointment . Ca n't wait to see what 's next !	1
Each book in this series gets getting better and better . Its hard not to like all the guys and just choose one as your favorite . But this series hooks you with intrigue , hot guys , and all the secrecy . Totally recommend it . Plus the first book in the series is free so nothing to lose .	1
Three days , that is the time frame of this fast-paced story which to a certain extent has the adrenaline thrill of a Jack Ryan thriller and the cerebral excitement of John LeCarre.To fans of the series , I do not want to spoil anything and just say that Victor and Gabriel are the main guys here . Everyone gets screen time of course . But there is more character development for those two.There are also surprises coming from Mr. Blackbourne and Dr. Green . And as always Sang is at the center of it all.For those who are picking up the series for the first time , my advice is to start from the beginning . This is book 5 . I believe the first book is still free here at Amazon as of this writing . Oh , you can still enjoy this book without reading the rest of the series . But you will miss the nuances and the richness and texture of the brotherhood , friendship and developing romantic love among the characters.Rated M for Mature due to violence .	1
Omg I love these books . I ca n't hardly wait for the next book to be released . Stone is so great with the way she brings along the characters and you ca n't help hoping for them all to fall in love inspire of what is considered the norm .	1
In this book we see a new & # 8216 ; villain & # 8217 ; although I & # 8217 ; m not entirely sure he is a villain per se . Volto , named after the venetian mask he constantly wears , is incredibly smart , manipulative and out to warn Sang to stay away from the Academy boys for some unknown reason . What & # 8217 ; s weird is that he doesn & # 8217 ; t hurt sang when he & # 8217 ; s alone with her , in fact he even helps her when she & # 8217 ; s in a bad situation.However , he does plant seeds of doubt in Sang & # 8217 ; s mind , hence the book & # 8217 ; s name.We don & # 8217 ; t see Sang & # 8217 ; s stepmother or McCoy which was a shame . Yes they & # 8217 ; re both horrible , but they make the story much more interesting ! I felt for Gabe in this book , he felt so neglected and then ends up getting injured in a fight . Poor thing , hopefully he has a happier time in book six.Book five was significantly darker than the previous books , probably because of the constant threat of Volto trying to kidnap Sang . There were a few fun scenes like the spa date with Victor and the finger nail painting , but there was an underlying current of seriousness behind it all.Overall , loved it ... now where is book six ? ! Favourite Quotes : & # 34 ; The Academy wants me to quit . They encourage giving it up if I 'm not happy . We do n't always get to do what we want , but the Academy is built to work on your strengths and your passion . You do n't make it far if you do n't at least enjoy some of what you 're doing. & # 34 ; ( Victor ) & # 34 ; I have to share you with the guys , & # 34 ; he said . & # 34 ; I do n't want to share you with the world. & # 34 ; ( Victor ) & # 34 ; Could n't someone just scale the wall and walk in the front door ? & # 34 ; & # 34 ; They would n't make it over the wall . The only reason you got in was because you were with me. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; What if I scale the wall ? & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Please do n't scale the wall , Princess. & # 34 ; ( Victor ) Before I had told them I did n't feel part of their group . Now it was like I was suddenly cast into cold bath water . It was n't just me and my small Academy family facing off the world . It was the world out there , and me in an unknown place with the Academy hovering over me with secrets . I suddenly did n't know who they were any more. & # 34 ; She wo n't stop crying , & # 34 ; Luke said . & # 34 ; Someone make her stop. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; The crazy girl has nerves of steel until you tell her the show 's over , & # 34 ; Victor said .	1
This one clears up a bit of Nial and Bastian 's story before Winter . How and why Nial changes Bastian and what it meant to break his promise ...	1
Oh , , this supplemental story totally touched my heart ! Nathanial , Sebastian and Winter all express . some very human emotions , and stole my breath away . Thank you for this treat !	1
This was the first book I read from Tracey and I am totally hooked ! ! It was well written - and is a completely different take on the paranormal genre - not what I 'm used to and I loved it ! ! Characters were easy to like - and I could n't put the book down . Loved the M-M-F relationship - it was amazing ! ! !	1
This book is better than the last two . Although there are a few new characters , it was a good read .	1
A very refreshing take on the typical zombie story . I read all 3 and probably will again some day . I will be reading more Tom Calen .	1
I always know that when I buy one of her books I am gon na enjoy the story . Clara Bayard never disappoints .	1
I always like it when a new book comes out . I have been reading this series of books from the beginning and I 'm hooked . I like the characters , the hot rockers , and the love that develops . These books are my guilty pleasure .	1
Being on the road has been stressful for the band & Julia . They are bucking heads and not agreeing . Follow along to see where it all leads .	1
I loved this series totally for the first 9 books because I loved the couples , but the last 2 and this the 3rd the story of Rick the drummer and his girlfriend who is the opening act for Sole Regret and is also a former child star.In the first book they hate each other and fight , the second book they start to understand each other more and things heat up , the 3rd book which is this one , they finally admit to love but sadly it left so many questions open that there will have to be another book to answer them and to be honest , I wish I would have waited 2 or 3 years when the price would have been lowered or the stories bundled like I think the first story of Joe and Lissa are.At 2.99for around 60 pages , it just stinks . Although I totally love the story of the band and I love the other couples love stories , specially Joe and Lissa and Dex and his girlfriend , I figure by the time I buy every short story , I will have paid about $ 30 maybe more.If all of these were included in one book , it would be less than 500 pages and would cost between 5.99 and 7.99 . So this really kills me.And whats even worse is that I want to quit buying them because I feel like Im being ripped off but the stories are really good and the writing is really good and Im hooked on the story and do n't want to wait years till the price goes down.This is the conundrum that these series books are.Ggggrrrrr ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
In the previous two books we have followed the story of Rick and Julia . Their up and down romance is n't any different in this book . I love to read about their struggles with each other , neither one wanting to admit how much they mean to each other as they try to keep their relationship under wraps as well as the bands all together . Their struggles are n't easy and we learn more about Rick and his past . Will they be strong enough to survive ? Clara Bayard hits another one out of the park with this next installment in the BBW New Adult Rock Star Romance series. [ ... ]	1
From the very first page , this fantastic romance had me hooked . Audrey 's life is falling apart , and it only gets worse from there . Thankfully she 's able to escape to Florida , but then life gets even more complicated when steaming-hot and inked-up Liam enters her life . It takes a natural disaster to for her to realize what life and love are all about.This is truly an inspiring novel , one that was nearly impossible to put down . Having had my share of terrible , traumatic relationships , and now having one that is bliss ( most of the time - ha ! ) , I could not only relate to Audrey but loved the strength that built within her through the course of the book . Highly recommended !	1
If you know anyone who has ended a bad marriage and gone on to find love again , you & # 8217 ; ll definitely find inspiration in Audrey , the heroine of this wonderful romance . I found myself rooting for her from the very first page and couldn & # 8217 ; t wait for her and Liam to get together ! This is a steamy romance with hot sex ( wowsa ! ) and a moving message about self-discovery , overcoming past pain and taking a chance on love . The story is unique , the characters felt real to me and I enjoyed the author & # 8217 ; s writing style . Highly recommended !	1
I bought this book for my granddaughter who is doing an assignment at school on whales . How perfect ! The information is easy enough for her to read and understand ( with a little help from Granny ) . The photos are fabulous . I found the information interesting myself - for example that whales sleep in a vertical position and that a blue what could weigh more than 40 Africal Elephants ! Wow ! That puts their size into perspective ! A really informative and interesting book .	1
I got this book on whales to share with my grand children . We love animals of all kinds and are so excited about the chance to go whale watching this summer so I thought this might be a great introduction before our trip . I was right because this book is a great introduction to many species of whale and is filled to the brim with all sorts of whale factoids . And there are loads of great colorful pictures too.I highly recommend this wonderful whale book to children of all ages . If you want to learn more about whales of all kinds , this is definitely a great place to start your whale journey !	1
All About Whales is an excellent guide chalk full of awesome practical and educational whale facts . Not to mention the very cool pictures ! ! My kids were literally mesmerized ! The tips and tidbits of information throughout the book helped to get the point across loud and clear.My recommendation is you give this book a read and let the author know what you loved ! Great book !	1
This is a wonderful introduction to whales . I loved the colorful pictures and straight-forward language . It 's a great book for kids who are interested in learning about whales .	1
It has very interesting pictures and descriptions of whale movememt ( a diving sperm whale . ) Discusses many different types of whales . Lots of great pictures . A good book worth getting , but a bit wordy for early readers . I suggest editing to tighten up the wording by removing unnecessary words in the next version .	1
The stories in this bundle deliver not just good plot lines and interesting characters , but *extremely* hot sex . From the inexperienced Stephen seduced by his young step-mother in My Other Mother to the eager Kira bent on seducing her step-father in Awaken , to the discovery by Davis that his entire ( step- ) family was enjoying each other on sly in Like Father Like Son , there & # 8217 ; s something for everyone in this set of stories . I thoroughly enjoyed this bundle and definitely recommend it .	1
This book starts off as a beautiful love story and continues to more , mAybe . You must read the next book to find out what .	1
I read this book in one day , enjoying the story line , characters , and the way the story progressed ; however , the end was surprising , and not what I expected . The only way I can get to the end of the story is to purchase Volume Two , which is 86 pages and would cost $ 2.99 . Now I am left hanging and do n't the spend the extra money for Volume Two because of the ending of the first volume .	1
Excellent read , and continuation of her wonderful characters ! ! Thoroughly enjoyed this book . And I agree , it will keep you turning the pages ... .. my family is lucky I made dinner ! ! Looking forward to reading the next book .	1
I loved her first 3 series ' and this one is no exception . A wonderful book following Malcolm and Anna . I look forward to the next book in the series !	1
SJ . West is seriously still a fairly little known author but I must tell you I can not figure out why for the life of me because she 's freaking fabulous . I have read every book she puts out and they all come highly recommended by me . Malcolm and the Redemption Series is no did n't . As with most of her books you really need to pay attention to the order of the books and make sure you read them in their correct order to fully appreciate the world she had created that I personally LOVE to live in and visit frequently ! Malcolm absolutely draws you in and hold on tight . But fair warning ! It WILL keep you up until the wee hours of the morning DYING to know what happens next . I can not wait to read anything and EVERYTHING she comes up with , including the next installment in this series . I love her so much and continuously & # 34 ; pimp & # 34 ; her books all over the East Coast and will continue on in hopes that eventually everyone will see what an amazing writer and person she is and give her the notoriety she deserves ! Read her books , you will not walk away disappointed .	1
So we now have a book about Malcolm and it was amazing ( just like the rest of the series ! ) I have never been the biggest Malcolm fan , but I never hated his character either , he has always just been a character I never really got to know and was just always around giving some comic relief . This book has made me a Malcolm fan ( eventually cause I was kinda mad at him through some of it ! ) We start with the birth of Anna , Andre has agreed to raise her as his own and Malcolm wont even look at her calling her an abomination . Andre takes her to a city in the clouds called Cirrus where she is betrothed to the future emperor . We all know ( from Caylin 's story ) Anna is very important to the future and God 's plan . I loved the suspense of wondering why Anna is an abomination and who her father is . I also loved how head strong she is and reminds me so much of Lilly and Caylin , but was still so unique in her own personality . I felt myself rooting for her and Malcolm throughout the whole story and cheering her on to break down the walls Malcolm had built around himself . All the while letting my heart break for both of them , while she was feeling rejected the whole time , I felt Malcolm 's pain from his past and his love of Lilly.The Watchers have always been a storyline I have loved and to be able to grow and love all of these characters and how all the stories are tied in to the previous ones . In a way I guess that makes me a little like Malcolm , growing to love all of these heroines and wanting nothing but greatness for them . While he is a little more extreme is his protectiveness off them I can only sit back and watch.All in all this was another great book from S.J . West and I ca n't wait for the next book to come out this spring ! !	1
I fell in love with Malcolm in the FORGIVEN book so this was iceing on the cake . This book was fantastic , great characters , wonderful story . I love the way this arthor writes . More , more , this is my kind of reading . Thank you S.J WEST for another great book .	1
Malcolm is very mysterious throughout this series , as well as other series . This book allows you to better understand him . This book is great , and sets the stage for the next book in the series Anna , which is awesome as well .	1
I love every book written by SJ . but , this really might be my favorite book so far . Getting to know stubborn Malcolm better is great . Another must read by this author ! !	1
I 'm so excited with this series of always loved Malcolm and I 'm so glad he will finally have a happy ending . Even Lucifer deserves to be happy again . Such a great book ca n't wait for the whole series to be out	1
I 've been a huge fan of the entire Watchers Saga , read them all . I find SJ West 's vision to be so amazing , the way she makes you root for Lucifer himself to get over himself and his hatred . They have all been huge cliff hangers but this one ; man it takes the cake . Malcolm has always been one of my favorite angels in the series and I 've been waiting for him to wake up and quit obsessing about Lilly she found her soul mate well before she passed on to heaven why he could n't let go always perturbed me . Then he goes and gets some sense knocked into him right at the 11th hour . I sure hope SJ is writing the 2nd book to this right now because I 'm not sure I even want to read something until then . I 'm still hungover from the effects of this book , finished the 500+ pages in a few days . Now I 'm chomping at the bit and nothing sounds good to read in the interim .	1
This book is a continuation from the previous works The Watcher series ... ... ... I highly recommend reading the previous books before reading this one.Malcolm and Anna shine in this book , the journey Malcolm has to take to get where he will finally find his soul mate and find the happiness he deserves , takes you a thousand years into the future , while you do get a glimpse of how Malcolm was asked to wait until he gets to the point of fulfilling his promise to help protect Lilly 's family line it just shows how much Malcolm loves and wants to everything he can to feel as though he has finally done what he has to do to receive his father 's forgiveness . Anna 's journey is filled with secrets , she has no clue as to what is expected of her or why , for her to be able to start to understand she is thrust into a fight to save not only her world , but countless others as well.While trying to figure out how she will fight this war , along with trying to win Malcolm 's heart , she is forced into a marriage , traveled to a world she has always wanted to help but had no idea as to how to go about doing so , loses her father , and starts to unravel secrets as to who she really is and where her family comes from.The book kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end , although it ends as a cliffie , it was still a very enjoyable read for me ... I ca n't wait to continue this story with & # 34 ; Anna & # 34 ; .	1
Oh my word . What an amazing and exciting novel . This book kept me on the edge of my seat . I hunger to read the next in this series . Again a fantastic must read .	1
Only on Valentine 's Day is delightful short story . The only thing that would make it better if it were longer with more character development . I would have liked to know more about Dani 's family and the Hawaiian culture .	1
Kane our hero returns home after many years . He was the bad boy type , that was always in trouble . Annie our heroine is now a widow and is in trouble trying yo hold on to her ranch . The story is set in Hawaii , and it includes many references to the culture and familial relations . The plot was interesting and an easy read . The basic romance was good also .	1
I enjoyed this collection enough to buy the Forever Yours set . The characters in The Islanders are predictable but entertaining . Each episode involves characters from the other Islander episodes and I enjoy keeping up with them . It makes you feel part of the family . I like the setting . It is what I think is authentic Hawaii , not the wealthy resorts . The glimpse of Hawaiian culture is great . Enjoy !	1
This book was great story about a couple . The author knows how to keep me reading to get to the finish !	1
& # 34 ; Saved By You & # 34 ; was a very enjoyable read . Interesting and diverse characters . I 'm looking forward to reading more books by Helen Conrad .	1
I enjoyed the book but not as much as some I I have read through Kindle . I enjoyed the characters . Kane was the bad boy but Anne had liked him as a boy . The author brought them together in a nice way . Bart turned out not to be what Anne thought . It was a nice turnaround . in the story . I believe the book is well worth getting .	1
I really did enjoy this book , from the begining there was chemistry between the two main characters . The storyline reminded me of the movie Pretty Woman , except this woman is sexier , educated and talented in a business scense . He is a rich but he also scorned with a need for someone to love him for just him.As the relationship continues on , there are the bumps and bruises of their reality , that must be conquered , and only time will tell.I would recommend this book to my fellow IR readers for them to enjoy .	1
I enjoyed this book , they found love in one of the most unusual place , but who says you ca n't find love anywhere , looking forward to reading book 2 !	1
Brian continues to expand on the Powder Mage saga . This is a rip roaring fun adventure . There is a sense of Fun that I think is becoming his trademark.The only quibble I woud have with Forsworn is how easy the choices are for the main characters . I did n't feel a lot of weight to the massive issues they were encountering . This is minor though , I had a great time reading Forsworn.If you have n't read anything Brian yet I am jealous . Buy this and everything else he has written . Get in on the ground floor .	1
As a big fan of McClellan 's Powder Mage tales , I was pleased to see this new novella . Basically , the story is a chase , an effort to deliver a young girl across a country border to protect her from being killed for the crime of being a powder mage . There are plenty of thrills , some cool battle scenes , and enough details about the setting to intrigue a reader . As I await the next novel , The Crimson Campaign ( due out in May ) , this is an excellent appetizer .	1
I 've been seeing a lot of snippets of stories sold as shorts . This is one , but it is also complete enough to be a story in its own right and was a nice addition to the setting the author is developing .	1
All I can say is OMG Julian is soooooo HAWT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Really good book worth the price I paid for it .	1
I would not use this as history of the alamo , but if you want a good well written story with some historical accuracy , this would be it .	1
Definitely A Texas Saga ! Texas Glory by Robert Vaughan is much more than a wonderfully well told story of the men and women who fell at the Alamo during Texas 's battle for independence from Mexico . Nice job Mr. Vaughan .	1
texas glory was a good book i enjoyed reading i like robert vaughans books i 've read a lot of his book	1
& # 34 ; The Loving Husband & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; The Debt & # 34 ; are weird , a bit psychologically disturbing tales . When the first story , & # 34 ; The Loving Husband & # 34 ; , was plain stupid ( and by that I do n't mean the concept behind the story or writing , I mean the main character 's train of thought ) , & # 34 ; The Debt & # 34 ; was in conclusion devastating and heartbreaking . My mouth dried when I had finished & # 34 ; The Debt & # 34 ; , and this still comes back to me with its horror , although I finished reading the collection while ago.The two stories were well-written . The both main characters ' motives behind their actions were explained and followable , but I found that with the second character , Del , I could sympathize more.If you are into dark and twisted weird stuff , then these short stories might be for you . * Note that I received free digital review copy from the author in exchange for an honest review .	1
I really enjoyed this story . I felt like I was there as a voyeur . Looking forward to reading more stories .	1
My mom has been dealing with Acid Reflux for quite sometime so , since she is of Polish descent and does n't read much English , I thought I 'd gather some information for her.This book gave me all the information I needed to educate her on Acid Reflux and how she can prevent it from happening . I appreciated that it thoroughly explained what Acid Reflux is , why it happens and how to treat it with both medical and natural and alternative solutions.I thought this book was very well written and extremely informative . I would recommend it to anyone that suffers from Acid Reflux and is looking to prevent it.Thanks for this great little book !	1
This book has great methods and information on how to treat acid reflux all naturally and quickly . It is very informative and I have found several easy to do things that have really made a difference ! If you are having pain from acid reflux , instead of running to a doctor for solutions that may not work , try some of the time tested solutions that are all natural and healthy ! I would definitely recommend this book .	1
My younger brother has a very sensitive stomach which has bothered him for years . After reading this book , I have come to learn about a lot of foods and daily habits that are most likely the underlying reasons for his pain . I suggested several of the cures and foods that are in the book and have already seen some positive results . It 's a wonderful book and very helpful . If you have acid reflux issues , you must read this book . It will help you for sure !	1
So far , this is the best book I 've read about acid reflux . It deals with various versions including the not-so-well-advertised & # 34 ; silent reflux & # 34 ; and how to improve with a change of diet and/or supplements . Gives a good , clear explanation of what causes acid reflux , and presents an easy solution for those who suffer from it . In addition to the diet and exercise recommendations , there are few quick , easy things you can do to decrease the episodes .	1
Hot story line with twins cowboys who have a tough up bringing . And a love that grows through the years . recommended to all to read .	1
Loved this book . I wish she would have just told her parents about their relationship as soon as they returned home . it would have saved heart ache for Colt .	1
Just loved this story . The McReed boys were always protective of Eva , but they never realized it was love until they went to the city . Colt , North and Eva were just perfect together . She was the light to their dark and it was just a perfect mix . A wonderful ending , but could be continued . Maybe Stacey will come up with more of these three one day .	1
When it comes to getting rid of stress and body aches , Reiki is a quick and natural solution . This book shows how to properly use the powers of the reiki to handle your energy , to improve our organic system , and ultimately to improve your overall wellbeing . To heal our body and our soul is very , very important ! The author did an excellent job in this book . I really enjoyed reading and doing the exercises . I feel a lot better now . Thanks Daniel Amos ! !	1
This book explains the ancient Reiki method about meditation and De-Stressing . It takes a different view and has great information . It 's definitely worth the read . Recommend	1
I was curios to learn more about Reiki , that is why I downloaded this book . And I was totally satisfied with the book 's content and writing style . The best part of Reiki is that you can learn it at any age . So do n't be lazy and grab a copy , it 's definitely worth the price !	1
I bought this book for my husband who is very interested in Reiki but I could never understand what it was . I decided to read it myself so I would know what he was talking about . I did n't think i would , but I really enjoyed it and what 's more..I could understand it . I feel as though I know so much more about stress and illness and more importantly , how to get rid of it without turning to pills or other not so healthy ways . I am looking forward to doing some of these stress release activities from the book	1
I love to travel all the time and I found this ebook to be incredibly helpful . This is a complete guide thatcontains everything you need to know about traveling abroad for free . Great tips on hotels , airlines , car rentals , etc . This book is great for both frequent and infrequent travelers , and it & # 8217 ; s full of up-to-dateinformation and tips I never would have thought of . The books I laid out really well and is organizedin a concise and logical format . I also found the link and resources at the end of each chapter to besuper helpful . I would definitely recommend this book to all travelers .	1
I really enjoyed reading this travel guide.Sadly , I have n't had the opportunity to travel much in recent years , but when I do again , I will definitely be referring to this Ebook for some great tips on saving ( and in a big way ) on all sorts of travel costs.Author Thomas Reed has provided all sorts of tips for saving big on transportation , accommodations , taking a working vacation , being a hotel reviewer and many other helpful topics . Some are n't completely FREE ideas but those are certainly low-cost.I appreciated that he included MANY links to travel sites that he refers to , I love that in an Ebook.this one will be on my kindle for years to come . recommended ! Geraldine Helen Hartman	1
At first I bought this book with a bit of scepticism . How to travel anywhere for free ... What ` s this ? But the book turned out to be one of the best books I ` ve read on that topic . You will be introduced to a few great strategies that you can implement to travel the world for FREE ! Yes , that ` s right ! The author even shows you how you can write your own travel guide . I highly recommend this book , you can certainly travel for free !	1
This had many great examples and recipes . There are many that are very unique but ones that I would be willing to try .	1
I have gained so much for organization books in the past and this book is no exception . Angela uses her experience as an organizational specialist to lend her expertise to your kitchen . She teaches the reader how to look at your kitchen with a new eye , how to clear it , how to set it up again with a good organizational structure and then helps you manage your time more effectively and create systems so that things run more smoothly from now on . If you 're haphazard in the heart of the house or could just do with some tweaking , I recommend this book .	1
The kitchen has got to be one of the biggest sources of stress for most people . You get home from work , you 're confronted with a disaster zone and you 're hungry - what do you do ? Well , if you 're like most people , you just give up and get take out . Not exactly good for the wallet or health . If you are brave enough to tackle the kitchen , you probably waste heaps of time and get severely stressed in the process of trying to make an ordinary meal . Either that or you just add to the avalanche of mess ! This is an area we all need help with , so Angela ( AKA the Unclutter Angel ) has come to the rescue with this great little book . She walks us through getting the kitchen organized , and then goes on to help busy people even more by providing advice on time management and menu planning.If you 'd like to eat healthier food , prepare stress-free family meals and have a kitchen you can be proud of , then I highly recommend this gem !	1
This book presents the information and a quick and easy to follow format . Great starting point for anyone who is overwhelmed in the kitchen .	1
This book does an exceptional job presenting the current research regarding dyslexia . There is a lot of valuable information in this book for children , teens , and adults . What makes this book exceptional is how it presents the positives associated with dyslexia . The author talks about well known people who have become successful with dyslexia . I recommend this book for anyone who may have a dyslexic child or loved family member .	1
If you are seeking a book to help you in the prevention of heart diseases then this is the one you are searching for ! This book is full of all natural and inexpensive things you can do to keep your heart healthy and strong ! This book will help to give you fresh insight into one of the most deadly killers , heart disease . A must read book for some great strategies and techniques for keeping your heart healthy and strong .	1
I was really surprised at the amount of information in this little kindle book . Most of the kindle books I have read are sorely lacking in any real information.The parts I particularly liked were the sections giving information about ( a few ) of the medications used in heart disease , but I most especially liked the section on natural and herbal methods for lowering cholesterol and managing heart disease . Some of the information was surprising ( in a good way ) , and would be surprisingly easy to incorporate into your life . I will be using a couple of the suggestions myself .	1
Loved the couple . Love this series . Can wait to read the rest . Started reading them out of order but was able to keep up .	1
I read romance as time fillers and as a distraction for very stressful medical situations . This book was a good entertaining read with a nice HEA . I would recommend .	1
Snowed In by Melanie Shawn , book seven of The Hope Falls Chronicles Series.Another incredible read in the Hope Falls series ! Nikki and Mikes characters were so well suited and came across perfectly . The chemistry , affection and attraction were through the roof ! With a touch of drama lots of smouldering action this story is one not to miss !	1
I absolutely loved this book . First of all the brothers were yummy . I mean , who would n't want two hot alien brothers at once ? And the appendages and how they worked.. Wow . so creative . Some people have mentioned they thought there was too much spanking . OK , for some maybe . For me ? Not so much . And Skylar obviously did n't mind it either . Keep in mind people that this is a work of fantasy . It is fiction . Nothing real about it . So just sit back and enjoy the ride .	1
OMG , Breanna managed to take every spanking fantasy and put it into a fabulous , entertaining and enjoyable story that i will read time and time again . The characters were lovely , fun , realistic and left me wanting more and more . This book made me want to watch the sky and wish for my very own hot aliens to come take me away and conduct some 'probing ' of their own ! Is n't FANTASY wonderful ?	1
I found this story to be a lot of fun to read . I noticed some reviews complained about the characters being & # 34 ; over the top & # 34 ; but I think that 's part of the reason I loved this story . Maybe it 's all those Star Trek reruns I watched in the 70 's but I found the accidental interaction and the potential impact to be reminiscent of those episodes . And goodness I can just imagine what some alien would be trying to come up with if they used the books on my Nook to come up with an idea of how to care for me .	1
this was a very different type of romantic erotic play LOTS of spanking , a wonderful story line very detailed I loved this book it was a great read	1
Once again Breanna has outdone herself . Not only is this well written as always , but something fun and different and very hot ! Love love loved it and would highly recommend reading . Could not put it down ! Just sayin ; - )	1
I ALWAYS ENJOY A GOOD READING WHERE PEOPLE SEEM NORMAL , EVEN THOU THE MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENCES WITH WHAT IS CONSIDERED NORMAL IN OUR WORLD . THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN THEIR SEARCH BUT KEEP BEEN THEMSELVES .	1
This started slow for me but it picked up . If you like to read books with a lot of sex then this is the book for you . It turned out to be a good book . It was a lot going and things I did n't expect . Ca n't wit to read more from Renee .	1
I normally do not like erotica . There are a lot of reasons for that . It may be a guy thing . It could be a lot of other things . But I really liked this book . The author seems to have mastered the art of erotica taking us on and to the point of no return . Our minds are into the story and the sex seems to be very much needed and very much a part of each and every detail . The characters are well developed and the story flows at a smooth and steady pace . The author gives it to us and she is not shy or apologetic at all . The book is steamy and very detailed and descriptive . A good job well done . I know we will be hearing a lot from this young passionate author .	1
This book is hot definitely a page turner ! ! It had me at the end of my seat keep up the good work	1
Very good read from beginning to end , you have to be careful and mindful of others , or things like that would not have happened , all in all I enjoyed the book	1
Victoria had her secrets but so did her husband . Once the betrayal was revealed . All hell broke loose . Boy there are prices to pay and no remorse ! ! !	1
There is a difference in porn and erotica . One of the hardest things to put in words is & # 8220 ; Orgasm & # 8221 ; J.. Author Sarah seems to have passed in this test.. Very very well written ! ! Excellent explanation skills , with putting right words which reader is looking for.. Truly amazing book to read ! ! Looking for more to come from Sarah . Every human being would enjoy it , I believe !	1
Plenty of stories to keep your senses tingling . Among my favourite is the episode at the bar . Just could n't put the book down once I got started .	1
thank you for a wonderful book ... I like when it does not beat around the bush and gets to the nity grity lol ... I hope there be more of this trilogy.. keep up the good work	1
This is a fantastic short read with very hot and steamy erotic sexual tension.Alayna a women who has had her heart broken and makes an appearance at her best friends wedding finds what can be the best choice or worst choice ever ... Alayna hasn & # 8217 ; t been in a relationship after things ended with Michael , and that was two years ago , but the bride is set on trying to set her up . After meeting one of the groomsmen , Damon Lear , Alayna is rethinking swearing off men . But it isn & # 8217 ; t just that she wants Damon , he gets under skin , his arrogance is too much , but something continues to draw her in . Will Alayna be able to continue to fight her feelings for Damen or will she give in ? One Urge is told in the dual POVs of Damon and Alayna . I love books that are written in dual POVs . One Urge made it more enjoyable to read with the two POVs .	1
Great Novella Series ! If you are looking for a fast and sexy read then this series is for you.I loved the fact that Damon is a dominate and controlling man by nature , but his passion for Alayna has him breaking some of his rules and thawing his heart.Book One will ignite the spark for you as the reader and give you a glimpse into what may be if Alayna returns to the cityBook Two will fan the flame of the passion and intense feelings that Damon and Alayna have for each other if they can only overcome both their stubborn personalities.Book Three will ignite you as their relationship progresses and you learn the past that Damon and his family have fought so hard to hide.The story unfolds over these three books and had me flipping the pages and reading each in one sitting.I loved the fact that even though Damon is a Dom my nature in his past experiences that we see a vulnerable side of him . He and Alayna both discover the kind of kink that works best for their relationship and her limited experience in the BDSM world.The story line is very well developed throughout all the books and leaves you clicking for the next book to find out how this relationship continues to develop !	1
Loved the fact that it was n't super long , and once I started reading I did n't want to put it down . I immediately went on to the next book . Loved the characters and definitely recommend reading .	1
This book gets right to the point ; once I started reading it I did n't put it down until I was finished . I really enjoyed getting to know Alayna and Damon.Alayna first encounters Damon at their friends wedding . Damon is very much an alpha male personality and Alayna is just coming out of a bad relationship and not looking for a new one.You can see from their first encounter that they have undeniable chemistry . That they both are trying to deny . That being said there were times during the book that they were utterly frustrating . Alayna is nervous and afraid of what she is feeling around Damon . Damon is taken back by not having the ability to completely control Alayna from their first meeting . He is not used to being told no , but Alayna does just that.This book kept my interest and left me ready to read the next book to learn more into what will come with Alayna and Damon . The end is definitely a cliff hanger , which meant I wasted no time in beginning book # 2 One Plea .	1
The LR books by Briers and Lee are standalone and have at least one HEA . After reading the fifth book in another author 's series that ended with a cliffhanger , I was craving a LR to get back on track . This book aptly filled that need.When a fae and a Lycan hook up in a bar , all either expects is a night of fun . But when the beta wakes up the next morning and finds the fae is gone , he realizes he has misplaced something precious-his mate- whom he marked in a moment of drunken passion . Then he tries to find her and learns she was just traveling through town and has already headed back home . It takes a week for him to locate her and he does , along with a bathroom floor littered with plastic wands , all complete with two pink lines . He is overjoyed , but she has locked herself in her bedroom and refuses to talk to him.His alpha , who accompanied him on the trip , recognizes the green eyes of a fae he saw leaving the bar a week earlier . The eyes of his own mate . Making the decision to take their mates home with them meets unexpected resistance , but ultimately they pack up , leaving the women 's roommate , a third fae behind . None of them realize , however , that a protective spell cast toward a former boyfriend has unraveled , placing the roommate in grave danger from a near rogue wolf.I have found Briers ' books to be entertaining and engaging . Some are better than others and often the bickering is overdone , but most have been worth the time and financial investment . This one is no exception .	1
Love this author	1
I read all of this author 's books . I love lycan stories . Wolves are my absolute favorite . Yummy . I always finish these stories within two hours of buying .	1
I was not sure what that means & # 34 ; OBAMACARE & # 34 ; until I read this book . Political discussions are difficult to understand . The author uses a language that I understood . Now I understand what is behind this issue .	1
I do n't really need to stress the importance of understanding the implications of the new Affordable Care Act . It is making huge changes in our health care system and I feel like most people do n't even know how it is/will be affecting them . Kind of ridiculous in my opinion . This book breaks down into simple to understand pieces on how the legislation changes things for different sections of the population . Very well researched and put together . Highly recommend to everyone really .	1
Dealing with a Depressed Person has a direct approach to helping you identify depression and get the person help . I liked that the book explained what depression really is ; the signs and the types of depressive disorders that there are . It humanized the disease . The book also gives you the tools to identify what you are dealing with and how you can modify your behavior and reactions to help a depressed person through their crisis . In no way is this book substitute for professional assistance but it makes assisting a depressed person not such a battle ; especially when you understand that you have to depersonalize what a depressed person says to you and take the role of a support person more strongly . I think the clear cut approach of the book and style of delivery of the information makes this a very handy book to keep when depression is in your environment .	1
Good book on self help . If you are stressing out on life then this could certainly change the way you think about the things you do . In fact , we are tuned to do things that we should not be doing in the first place and the book sets you in the right direction . Its not rocket science to take control of your life . The book is an excellent resource to change your life for the better .	1
I was glad to come across this book recently . It provided a unique perspective on living your life at it 's best . The author shares some interesting insight into letting go of stress . The tips provided were very helpful and allowed me to understand exactly how to implement the steps given . I do wish I had found this sooner to help me deal with the overwhelm I sometimes experience as a solopreneur . It 's a good book that can help anyone take back control of their life .	1
When I first ran across No Work , No Problem ! Stop Working , Start Living ! I was intrigued , but hesitant whether it could actually offer me anything of value in enjoying my life and my work . However , I was quickly proved wrong as Dr. Andrew M. Goodman took a unique and thoughtful approach to introducing the idea of taking pleasure in your life and work ( no matter what it is ) , and just how to make it happen . The book is a casual yet informative guide to & # 34 ; stop working , start living & # 34 ; ; it 's straightforward , easy to understand and easy to apply to your life .

Overall , this was a beautifully unique and thoughtful book that gave me a lot to think about and a great deal of advice on just how to stop working and start living .	1
Self improvement books are not normally my thing . I prefer to & # 34 ; play as I go & # 34 ; sort of . But when I ran across No Work , No Problem ! I was amazed at how much this book helped me . I 'm one of those people that seems to be working harder and longer hours these days to & # 34 ; keep up & # 34 ; with all I want and need . This book made me take a step back and realize what I 'm doing right and wrong at the same time.Great book and great lessons learned .	1
This is a Series that will be in my heart and in my reading library for a long time . This is about two brothers that will find their happily ever after but most importantly they become the family that they should have been from the beginning.Book 1 & # 8211 ; Running to YouI have to start off with how funny this story was and how I was able to relate to the setting of the story . I know how pharmaceutical representatives have it with providers . I work at a clinic and I know that they have it tough when they need to speak with providers . I know from experience that in order for a rep to talk to them they need something in return and it & # 8217 ; s usually food . But there is so much more in this story than only that.In this story you meet Alexandra & # 8220 ; Alex & # 8221 ; Morrison and Dr. Grayson Brooks , two people that have this chemistry that is explosive . These are two people that will go through hell and high water in order to have a happily ever after . You have Alex that that is a very independent woman that is self-efficient and have never relied on anyone . She also has a dramatic experience that has halted her from furthering her relationships . Then there is Grayson a man that has trust issues and also has something against pharmaceutical reps . There is something happening between him and his brother and you know that it & # 8217 ; s going to be gut wrenching when that comes out.Just when you think that they have their happily ever after something traumatic happens to Alex and Grayson is out of his mind.Book 2 & # 8211 ; Two Sides of a HeartbeatNow this was an amazing , intense read from the beginning to the very end . It starts off where Running to You left off but the emotions that I experienced for Grayson and Alex were fear and sadness.In this story it & # 8217 ; s about the journey of Alex and Grayson in adjusting to the devastation that happened . I was happy for Harrison and Grayson to finally talking about the past and it seemed that they were able to resolve their past . I was happy that she was able to have a good relationship with her father and step mother . I totally loved the wedding in Bora Bora but just when things seem to be great something always happens . Grayson needs to learn to be open with Alex , I don & # 8217 ; t think he learned anything from what happened in the past.Book 3 & # 8211 ; My ConfessionIn this story we finally get to know twin brother Harrison Brooks and the woman that has left him hollow inside , Monica Green . From the moment that I started reading this story I knew that this read was going to have me weeping.Harrison Brooks in this story makes a decision and that is that he needs to change who he is . He has been hollow instead from the moment that Monica and him separated but we have to remember that if they are meant to be they will be together . I love that he loves a great concept and that is paying it forward . His way of thinking , doing showed me that he was a marvelous man with a HUGE heart . Harrison has lived a hard life and he deserves the best . Monica Green is a woman that works non stop . Her heart was broken when Harrison thought she was cheating on him . He would not hear her ; she truly did try to let him know everything that happened . When they meet again just by coincidence things are rough but soon it seems that the world is aligning and soon they will also have their happily ever after.These book by Ms. Roberts are beautifully written . The amount of emotions that the characters convey is evident in Ms. Roberts writing . Her writing is wonderful , it & # 8217 ; s descriptive and always gives so much that I actually feel content with the ending even though I don & # 8217 ; t want the stories to end . Ms. Roberts words in the stories flow beautifully and captivated me from the beginning to the end but most of all I love that I feel as if I & # 8217 ; m living the characters lives , it & # 8217 ; s like everything that is happening to them I going through it also.If you haven & # 8217 ; t pick up this box set , what are you waiting for .	1
The series will have you so into it , you will have a hard time putting it down . I felt like I was there an could see it all . I love a book that make me feel like I am there . It made me LOL an cry a little . I love DeLaine Roberts books .	1
Emotions run rampant throughout the book . There were so many things that happened to Alexandra that it almost made it hard to believe anyone goes through that much . But life teaches us differently . Grayson was not afraid of her issues and stood by her from the moment he touched her hand.Then you have Monica , who also comes with excess baggage . She knows that Harrison wants babies , which she can not give him.Harrison 's whole life changes after Grayson , his twin , beats him up for a woman who is not who they think she really is . He becomes more aware of his life and goes for the better . He donates time and money to kids . He makes it possible for Charley 's granddaughter to finish school , he pays her tuition , he lends his condo and gives her his car . He buys the bar and lives in the upstairs.Nadia lands in the bar , badly beaten and abused , with no money and no family and here as an exchange student . She gives him and Monica the ultimate gift .	1

It was going to be a marriage of convenience : a temporary marriage of convenience.Sam needed to provide the perfect family picture to a judge in case his ex-wife , Jasmine , decided she did n't like the arrangements she had agreed to in the divorce . Rosie needed a cash influx for her business so she would n't have to face her ex-fiance , Dean , to obtain a new loan . Each had a need . Each had a solution . Easy , right ? Not when you throw in dormant feelings , exes who want to cause trouble and secrets too dangerous to be shared . Then anything can happen.Stories with characters all living and interacting in the same small town are some of my favorite books to read . I really enjoyed this very romantic story of long time friends who started with a relationship in friendship that slowly morphs into love . The story unfolded at a steady pace , fleshing out the main characters . This is the first novel in the Sweetwater Springs Series . Although it is a standalone novel , the characters for the next novel , Her Unexpected Family , Claire and Travis were introduced and mentioned throughout the book.This was my first time reading works by Carol Burnside , but it definitely will not be my last . Looking forward to more novels in this series.I would recommend to all romance readers.5/5 stars From friendship to love is sometimes be a bumpy ride , but so worth it .	1
Sam Moreland offered to lend his friend money to save her business in exchange for a fake marriage that would keep his daughter out of the clutches of an unfit mother . He never dreamed it would turn into more.When Rosie Baxter agreed to accept a loan from an old friend she & # 8217 ; s had a crush on forever in exchange for a temporary marriage pact , she never dreamed she & # 8217 ; d find her happily ever after.I thought I would take a quick look at the first chapter of this book on a weekday in preparation for a weekend read . That didn & # 8217 ; t happen . Before I knew it , I was more than halfway through the book and the only reason I finally quit reading was because my Kindle battery died . I admit I came home from work the next day and finished the story . This book was well worth the sleepy morning.A Suitable Wife has it all . Passion , friendship , a villainous ex ( or two ) , picturesque settings , heart touching back-story , dedicated family , and some great love scenes . Sweetwater Springs is a place where anyone would feel welcome . Carol Burnside has created a community that I hope to visit often . I can & # 8217 ; t wait to read the next book in this series .	1
Unusual story about a pair of pants that changes the men who wear them . I found it different from the norm and sometimes even funny . Check it out for yourself !	1
Jack Laskin is just an ordinary man ; he has a girlfriend , looks after his mother and runs the family hardware store . When , one day his mother gives him a pair of his grandfather & # 8217 ; s pants , he doesn & # 8217 ; t really want them , but she insists they & # 8217 ; ll be perfect for him.Being a good son , Jack dutifully wears them , then he discovers things change , suddenly those around him treat him differently , it & # 8217 ; s almost as if he & # 8217 ; s become someone else ... As the magic continues , he discovers family secrets beyond belief , and when a ghosts from the past come wriggling out of the woodwork , he find himself committed to solving a mystery which spans generations.This story is fantastic ! It is totally different to anything I have read before . As the storyline unfolds , it is sexy , humorous and very entertaining & # 8211 ; absolutely brilliant !	1
While I found this creative fictional work both hiliarious and seriously action-packed , woven within the pages are the internal struggles acted out externally . As mother passes grandfather 's pants to son Jack her desire and his decision to wear them would attract individuals and situations like never before . Both father and grandfather 's & # 34 ; rotation & # 34 ; with women shared by his eccentric mother and friends to son Jack , would add to the fire three enticing women she would boldly introduce to him , testing his affections to the limit despite his love for girlfriend Connie.Jack 's mother Claire and her distaste for her sister Olivia Wells will unfold in a series of actions involving revenge , blackmail , and a quest for a keepsake that once obtained does not give the satisfaction desired . As Olivia Wells ca n't forget the past and move forward , Jack on the other hand vacillates from trying to break the traditional grip of multiple lovers , while battling how he can still be alive physically but on paper lose his life and business.As you perhaps identify with the dysfunctional aspects of relatives and acquaintances hold on tight to the steering wheel for mom 's friends Stella and Harriet will take you on a wild , hiliarious ride . Connie 's promising brother Robert 's fate will change due to an unruly mishap on his part . It will however bring out the devotion Connie extends toward him and how boyfriend Jack would literally fight on behalf of both of them.Author Maus will deeply make you feel the inner struggles of Jack between Connie and Gabriel . Discover if he will follow in the same footsteps as his grandfather and dad or break free and devote himself to one . Though you can physically get rid of grandfather 's pants , it may take a bit more courage to shake off propensities that easily desire to ensnare . It reminded me fully that we are what we think and perhaps our & # 34 ; thinking & # 34 ; needs a little refining.Not only do I recommend this book as it is 5 star quality , but too do I recommend Author Maus fantastic science fiction delights . An Author with hopefully many more works on the horizon , I rate his creativity to be extremely high .	1
Review written for mmgoodbookreviews.wordpress.comThis is the first book I have read by this author and I can say she shot straight to my favourite authors list . This story starts out with a bang and keeps that tension going throughout the entire story . WARNING : have some tissues handy.I love a good character and this book is full of them , both good and bad . Emory Joe is a young man and a ministers son . He knows he is different , and knows it & # 8217 ; s wrong , but he is sure he is safe since the small country town he lives in there isn & # 8217 ; t any other like him he knows of . He is a very loving son and he and his father are very close.His Father Charles , is the town minister and a pillar of society , he too comes across as a gentle loving likeable man . His devotion to his son is admirable . Then one day Glory Lands comes to town to perform with his family and when he and Emory meet , sparks fly . Glory also is a charming character.The town Sherriff is a very bad man . The front of the book said he is based on a real man and that makes him even scarier . This character is evil reincarnate and the mention of his name gave me cold shivers.This story is beautifully written with charm and a very classy style . I felt like I was right there in that little country town and back in that time era . Vastine paints a lovely picture with her words . The story is poignant , both happy and sad . I will definitely be looking for more of her books.If you love historical fiction , stories based on real people , scary , evil bad Sheriffs , abuse of authority , charming romance and an all-over intriguing story this is for you .	1
Once again , I am floored by the beautiful writing style of Vastine Bondurant . Vastine has a gift for capturing the era her stories take place in and describe it so well that you feel like you are actually there , back in that time . Glory Lands is another example of her wonderful writing . I also love how she writes from the points of view from her main characters.The story begins in 1922 with an event that happened in real life , but sets the tone for the bad guy in the story . A young Emory Joe and his father , Charles , witness the innocent murder of Othello & # 8220 ; Ted & # 8221 ; Jones , a black man , by Deputy Elihu Bishop . Fast-forward to 1931 , when Charles & # 8220 ; saw something in my son , my darling Emory Joe , and wondered how I & # 8217 ; ve been so blind all of his nineteen years to have missed it ; & # 8221 ; the day that he and Emory Joe met Glory Lands . Elihu Bishop is still the law , but is now Sheriff . No spoilers here , but have some tissues on hand . I highly recommend this story .	1
This book was wonderful and is highly recommended . I only wish it had been longer ! It is well written and beautifully edited . Looking forward to reading other works by this author .	1
How to discover yourself ? It & # 8217 ; s a very difficult question to answer , isn & # 8217 ; t it ? Fortunately , books like this one make the answer much more simple . This is a very nice read for everyone who is looking to embrace their own personality , ultimately discovering who they really are . We all have different goals in life ... yet not all of us are aware of what we want in life . This book would help you to discover exactly that ! It 's short and powerful . I definitely recommend it to everyone .	1
This book will let you look at yourself . It will make you reflect on what is most important in your life so you can set goals and can work your way into achieving them . This book is an eye-opener , everyone should read this !	1
It 's never easy to discover yourself . I know over the years I 've had plenty of difficulty with it . Luckily for me a guide such as this book exists . I took the tips and tricks this book had to offer and tried to apply them to my life . This guide taught me how to change my own views on people and life itself as well . It 's been a few days since I finished this book and I have seen differences in myself . I wish I came across this book much sooner .	1
It 's a really simple , quick read , and is filled with principles that to me felt intuitive , but that I maybe had n't seen put into the form of a law . It 's a good overview for how to live your life on a day to day basis : reducing your judgment of others , minimizing struggles , and increasing happiness . The principles in the book definitely resonated with me in a big way , and I believe anyone can get a lot out of it with an open mind .	1
The Wild Side continues the story of Val and Wes 's relationship . The plot thickens in that feelings are FINALLY admitted and both want to see where it goes . Although , the divorce is still up in the air . There 's a part of Val that wants to tell Wes how she truly feels , but I am hoping that will come with time.Val gets an offer she can hardly refuse , but that means she will also be working very closely with Max . Sigh . He irks me . He just wants what he ca n't have . I am anxious to see how this plays out . He seems to have a scheme or two up his sleeves to attempt to make Val his.Wes . Sweet , wild , sexy , Wes . I love him more and more as the series goes on . Not sure if I can get enough . He is a romantic at heart . He found love in a place where he least expected it . As the story continues we get to see Val and Wes as a couple , and how he genuinely adores Val . There are some sweet and sexy moments between Wes and Val in this installment . Their connection is beyond anything that either one of them expected . I love where this story is going and am excited to see what happens next .	1
Great job . Enjoyed the book VERY much . Could n't put it down before l Finnish it.I 'll like to read more books by this rather.Jewel EDWARDS	1
this is a great series to read . I love the clean suspense books !	1
About the same as all the other hero series by Mr. Rau ... .that is to say A GREAT READ ! Seriously , if you enjoy the super hero genre the this is the man for you . I just wish he would not tear one heroes cloths and give another a mild concussion every series . Still , withall , I will continue to read this series and look forward to each iteration as I did for comic books in my youth .	1
& # 34 ; The Ultimate Guide To Asthma Relief & # 34 ; by Derren Jones is an informative and competent guide to Asthma.I am unfamiliar with the disease myself and found the book a very good introduction and guide to the illness , its triggers and the types of remedies - short and long term.This is a good guide with sound advice with well structured and concise information . This is a very helpful and compact book that everyone should read to understand the disease better .	1
This book had some good info in it to help sufferers breathe easier . I found one or two typos , but was able to contact the author and he is already making the necessary changes I think .	1
& # 34 ; Warm My Heart & # 34 ; is the kind of novel that sweeps you up in strong dialogue , authentic characters , heartfelt emotions , an inspirational look at deeper faith and a compelling plot . Tessa Stockton has a gift for writing that marries faith with love and romance in a incredibly evocative story , one that is vivid with imagery and vibrant in a way that just shines through the entirety of the novel . The romance between Sarah and Mitch is sweetly captivating as the two overcome the struggles of love and faith that have pulled them down through life ... leading them on their own journey to Africa and each other . The development of their relationship was wonderfully paced , letting the two get to know each other and fall in love in a real way that very few author 's nowadays take the time to explore . I felt completely swept up in this inspiring look at not only the struggles of finding real lasting love in this world , but coming to a place of deeper faith in God that provides a solid foundation through the ups and downs of life . Overall , this was an entertaining and heartfelt novel that captured my attention from beginning to end .	1
Loved this cover and wanted to learn how to connect with other people more easily . It contained numerous suggestions that could help in what otherwise would be difficult social situations for me . Thanks	1
If you are feeling lonely and it is getting bad then is time to seek help . If you do n't want to talk about it with someone then this book will be really good for you . You will get a lot of information that will either be helpful to you from the start or at least distract you a little bit from your pain . I read it and found it very interesting and while I still feel lonely , I still believe that what I read from this book has helped me even if a little bit to deal with it and has set me on my way to overcome .	1
Are you really lonely or what ? Try to understand it first , and after that , take a massive action and help yourself.It is not that difficult as you imagine.Work on yourself and build the relationships that really counts.Feel comfortable with people and do n't push them away.You will understand that it 's worth it.No more loneliness any more ! Recommended !	1
This is a great guide that can help parents , teachers , or counselors explain why their kids/students suffer from loneliness even while being surrounded by other people . I really appreciated that the author explained various kinds of loneliness , the causes and the cures . I liked all the quotes from famous authors at the beginning of chapters that make the whole concept of loneliness feel easier to understand and resolve . I also appreciated that the author pointed out that social media can not cure that problem -- so many kids today do n't seem to understand that , and that 's exactly where they look for cures . Good short guide !	1
Like an introduction to the principles of overcoming depression , it is short and easy to read , with some clear actionable keys that you can put to use straight away .	1
This is the third short story I 've read from Mr. Love . He is poetic in everything he writes , beautiful descriptions and quickly flowing story line . He even makes me laugh with a witty thought about his tie blowing in the wind . It 's a quick read that will keep you smiling and guessing if he ever talks to Florence .	1
City Solipsism is a short story , about a brief moment in time between a man and a woman . It centers around the man 's thoughts on the woman , and his analytical mind as he tries to predict/plan what will happen next . Honestly , I laughed throughout the read , because they were all thoughts I 've had before . Mr. Love 's ability to describe the setting in such a way as I actually feel like I 'm there is awesome . I 've been to New York once , twenty years ago , and now I have found an author that effectively transports me back there for brief visits .	1
Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest reviewZack Love has a unique writing perspective in both this novella and Sex in the Title ! He is witty , comical , and bold.You will get an intimate perspective of what a simple subway ride could mean to a stranger and what it might not.Book Flirts by Jessi	1
Quirky , very well-written short story detailing a NYC man 's thoughts as he rides the subway one morning . His neurotic musings , centering around whether and how to speak to a young woman as they share the same path for twenty minutes or so , resounds with humor and provokes us to wonder about the strangers we all come across from time-to-time . Perfect length for a subway ride or a doctor 's office waiting room .	1
What an amazing short story ... Mr. Love has done it again ... a for sure read everyone ... to think this is what could be in the mind of someone so close to you that you do not know ... .public transportation will never be the same for me..in a good way ... and the end ... OMG ... .YOU SO NEED TO READ THIS ! ! !	1
I do n't normally go for short stories as I like to get my teeth into a good chunky novel but this is Zack Love we are talking about , debut book Sex In The Title ( which should be made into a film btw ) so I just had to buy it . Zack Love is like no other author I have come across , his writing is just awesome . In this short story we enter the mind of Jack a New Yorker ( I love a New Yorker ) who travels on the subway with his eye on a beautiful young lady . This journey transports him back ( in his mind ) to a previous journey with a similar encounter but with a totally different ending - Zack Love you are a tease ! ! ! ! ! Go on , buy it , you wo n't regret it : ) Sitting with foot tapping and fingers itching for the next masterpiece ! !	1
Having already read Zack Love & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; The Doorman , & # 8221 ; the excellent writing in & # 8220 ; City Solipsism & # 8221 ; was no surprise.What *was* a surprise was how interesting and entertaining it could be to hang out in a man & # 8217 ; s mind during his morning commute . Like Tom Hanks in & # 8220 ; Castaway , & # 8221 ; Mr. Love & # 8217 ; s narrator/protagonist , Jack is so compelling , there & # 8217 ; s no need for interaction with other characters to keep things moving . The brilliance of Mr. Love 's writing is that Jack 's near-total lack of human interaction isn & # 8217 ; t a lack at all ; it & # 8217 ; s the antagonistic force that drives him to change his thinking and test his belief in Fate.I really enjoyed this one !	1
Zack Love has already established his writer 's voice in Sex in the Title and shown that he can deftly handle humour , irony , love ... and pulled us in to the emotional lives of men and their take on love.Now with his short story , & # 34 ; City Solipsism , & # 34 ; Love goes for a more introspective take -- going into the musings of a man on the subway and the woman he encounters . What starts off as idle thoughts takes a more philosophical turn . At turns brooding , while also maintaining a good balance without ever becoming maudlin , he pulls us into the narrator 's thoughts as we traverse his morning subway commute in the Big Apple.This is a beautifully written story . Zack Love is a talented writer and he delivers again and again .	1
Have you ever wanted to climb in someone else & # 8217 ; s head and find out what they are thinking ? Been in a situation where a random meeting provided so many fantastical possibilities if only one person would strike up a conversation ? City Solipsism provides a male point of view of just such an encounter . It is a complete internal dialog of one man & # 8217 ; s morning commute to the office as he finds himself in close proximity to another commuter . The body language of the other commuter causes the man to let his mind wander is so many different directions . The reader is allowed to enjoy a voyeuristic perspective of how he believes and wishes the situation to play out.City Solipsism was the perfect lunchtime read that finishes with such a flourish that surprised me in the most pleasant of ways .	1
There was a moment of eye rolling - first paragraph - before I remembered the title . Who thinks such convoluted phrasing to oneself [ the quotes around the narrator 's thoughts make it a verbatim recounting ] without preamble ? A self-absorbed ass , that 's who ! Perfect.As he layers so much detail on his dissertation of trains and timing , I wondered if he was bored from circumstance , or responsible for it ? Is his recounting of European travels evidence that his world is newly small , or has it always been ? Is he exaggerating past laurels , or mourning real ones ? It becomes a coin toss whether broaching a conversation with Florence will promote his cause or prove his tediousness . And yet , his fantasy of her is sweet rather than lascivious , and I want to root for him.The ending - in general terms - was expected , but I eagerly read all the way there to learn the detail [ no spoiler ! ] ; on the way , I was treated to some great observations . The narrator is an egotist , yes . And it is displayed in perfect phrasing and structure . In all , an awesome read ; a real treat . [ And I 'm laughing at myself because it took me longer to write the review than to read the story ! ]	1
Summer 's Book BlogWe really loved this novella . It was short , yet sophisticated and entertaining . Zack Love writes amazing story lines that are not just fun but intellectually stimulating in all the right places ! He has a way with telling a story that you fall into his books and befriend his characters.Have you ever been on a train , bus , metro/subway -- or any other shared space with strangers -- and started to wonder what that person right next to you is thinking ? Did you ever start to think or hope that maybe your temporary neighbor was somehow sharing your thoughts and/or desires ? Ever sensed some sort of romantic connection or sexual tension and wished you could get into the individual 's head , to know for sure ? This story starts out with Jack who is riding on a subway in New York City . He notices a beautiful woman ( Florence as he calls her ) riding so close that their hands almost touch . He begins to reminisce about a past life in which he feels nostalgic for when he had another beauty for a brief moment and is comparing his encounter with his former flame to the woman riding next to him . He wants to build up the courage to talk to her , but is afraid . As he is riding , he tries to think of her next move , and ca n't figure out where she is going . Is it fate that they get off together ? The ending is definitely not what you think will happen but it done in true Zack Love fashion ! We ca n't wait to read what 's next !	1
Quick and Sweet ... this is Jack 's POV about his short encounter with Florence one morning on the commute to work . Seeing her on the Subway and trying to get her attention , all the while wondering if she is thinking about him . Its a humorous short story that was quick to read yet quite enjoyable .	1
The story opens with an alien spacecraft approaching Earth . The World 's governments and scientists are struggling to communicate with the spacecraft ... This is the first episode of the Earth Dark episodic series.I found it to be a smooth read , flowing from one event to the next with a steady pace.The suspense in this episode was palpable.I am glad that I have episode two ready to begin reading as soon as I finish this review as I am excited to get back to the story .	1
I really like all the different varieties of smoothies offered in this book . From proteins smoothies , to breakfast smoothies , traditional fruit and vegetable smoothies , and much more . Some of my favorite recipes were the banana nut butter smoothie , the energy breakfast shake , and the greens , fruits and nuts smoothie . If you like smoothies , you 're sure to find a ton of great recipes in this book .	1
The secret guide to making money with investments is definitely one of my favorite investment books ! It does n't lie to you , or get your hopes up ! It just gives you the information straight up !

It also has some great advice on how you can start investing straight away in a fairly safe way and still have great returns ! Must read for would be investors !	1
I 've read books about investment and making money , but this book tops it all because of its well-researched information and proven strategies . Definitely a must-have for those individuals who want to get hold of hard-earned money .	1
I usually try to stay up on what is going on with the investment world from time to time because I like to dabble in the market . This book was pretty awesome as it just clicked and made sense to me . I really thought it was well written and offered some good ideas that I will have to try . pick it up !	1
& # 34 ; Weightless & # 34 ; by Michele Gorman was a cute and whimsical short story , ( 64 pages ) . There were a lot of twists and turns that I did n't expect and that 's what I liked most . The end surprised me a lot , making it anything but predictable . Annabel 's ( Christy 's ) character was very well written and I liked her quite a bit . Jack 's character was also very intriguing , up until the very end . ( Nope , no spoilers ! ) If you 're looking for a quick book that you can read in a few short hours , & # 34 ; Weightless & # 34 ; is the book for you . Michele Gorman is a very talented author and I can not wait to see what she comes up with next ! I give this book 5 stars !	1
I love this short story . It had romance & humor things that go hand in hand . Annabelle gets the chance at her crush from high school . Though lies may be told the story has a happy ending . A great read before bed .	1
What an interesting storyline . Different than usual . I was surprised at the last chapter . The story made me smile . Wish I 'd someone like Annabel to help me when I was a teen .	1
Annabelle reluctantly attends her 10th year reunion dreading the possibility meeting the girls who made her school years miserable .When one of the more popular boys mistakes her for the classes most popular girl she decides to play along .Then the impossible happens . Mike falls for her . Afraid to tell Mike the truth , Annabelle continues living the lie . Suddenly another classmate spoils everything . Mike walks out .Will they reunite ?

I was skeptical , to be honest , because I 've tasted green smoothies before that really were n't that nice . However , this author really knows her stuff - every single one I 've tried so far is absolutely amazing . I 've been won over ! Thanks for the book !	1
This is a wonderful book that shares really creative and unique recipe ideas . I 'm starting to adapt the new healthy lifestyle and this green smoothie book is perfect ! I 'm looking forward to trying out the & # 34 ; monster detoxer & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; iron booster & # 34 ; and list goes on . Ca n't wait to start !	1
A nice collection of & # 34 ; Green & # 34 ; smoothies . I like doing fruit smoothies mainly , but this guide takes the & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; angle and the smoothies are more about detoxing and weight loss . Great collection if you are looking to get these benefits .	1
This marine life bundle of 3 books about whales , sharks , and my favourite - dolphins , were all a pleasure to read .

Highly Recommended !	1
Children will love reading this book about the cool and sometimes funny information mixed with facts and interesting info that will help them learn a thing or two along the way . Learning about marine life is great fun . Highly recommended .	1
Mysteries of the Red Coyote Inn by Lorraine CareyI received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.Mysteries of the Red Coyote Inn is a fantastic story full of adventure and stimulation.Instantly the writer drags you into the opening pages and keeps a hold with the wonderful play with words and technique . The book has a supernatural basis of ghosts , strange and eerie events nears an Apache Trail by the mountains . The reader is hurled into a thrilling world full of suspense as Dean receives his outer-dimensional gifts for his journey that he has inherited.Carey writes in a descriptive hand with is nicely executed throughout the pages of the story . Red Coyote Inn has spooky but warm feel , full of secrets , fear and bravery for Dean . The tale will keep the reader glued to mystery during this addictive page-turner once told about the legend.There is a strong spiritual feeling to the author 's work that will leave you with a warmth within.A lovely example from the story , is this section : 'He could see a strange glow , and it cast its reflection in the mirror on his dresser . He grabbed it and clenched it in his fist , feeling a strange tingling surging through his veins . He became so hot and agitated that he just blacked out in his bed'.Highly recommended.Certainly an author to look out for in the future.An adventurous 5*****	1
Another great book from IP Factly ! If your child is asking you questions and wants to know more about volcanoes then share this book with them ! Do they have a school project to write ? This book is a great resource . Great pictures ( photos and diagrams ) and information.Learn about the different kinds of volcanoes , how they work , where the word lava comes from , what active , extinct and dormant means , famous volcanoes , volcanoes on other planets and so much more ! Did you know that pyroclastic flows can be hotter than 1,832F ( 1000C ) ? ! How about that the explosion of Krakatoa in 1883 released energy equivalent of 15,000 nuclear bombs ! At the end of the book there is a link to the videos on their website . They have put together a group of 12 videos on Volcanoes . We use these books and videos as resources in our homeschool . It saves so much time not having to search through YouTube yourself but parents please be vigilant around your children as sometimes the Google & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; ads that appear on the bottom of the screen are not appropriate for kids . When we are watching I quickly click the X to get rid of it ! Great resource and highly recommended from our house to yours .	1
One of my pet peeves about Kindle book authors is that they do not include pics.This book on the other hand is amply illustrated with pics and illustrations.This book is a definitive book on volcanoes and I too learned much about thedifferent kinds of volacanoes and more importantly where the bulk of themare located . Great job guys on a great book that I enjoyed reading.Do n't miss the volcano videos at the end of the book . These are trulyawe inspiring and a free addition to the book	1
I do n't know about my kids but I learnt a lot from this very informative book . I knew they shot lava out of the top but I was n't aware that the land could rise by 100 metres or more prior to an eruption and I did n't know there were so many of them . Being in the UK it was interesting to read that one of our most famous castles is built upon the site of an extinct volcano , have a guess where me and the kids are visiting next time we are in Scotland.All in all a very good book .	1
5***** this is yet another fantastic book by Lisa Hobman . I only discovered Lisa as an author when her publisher was looking for a few reader to review one of her other booksI am so glad I took that opportunity to read her first book because I feel in love with her writing and her book characters . This book is no exception it is amazing how Lisa can bring her characters feelings out and make you feel them . This book made me laugh and cry but it was yet another amazing story and one I would recommend .	1
The Girl Before Eve is a story of friendship , loss , healing , self discovery and unrequited love . It & # 8217 ; s different to Lisa & # 8217 ; s other books , I loved that about it . It takes you through many different emotions . When I started reading I did n't know I & # 8217 ; d laugh , cry and be sucked into the story like I was . Adam and Lily childhood best friends and that & # 8217 ; s how their story begun but nowhere near the end.Adam is n't only Lily & # 8217 ; s friend he & # 8217 ; s her protector , you can & # 8217 ; t help but feel the connection they share from the beginning . You & # 8217 ; re immediately laughing along with them . Lilly is energetic , funny , bright and full of life . They go off to University in Edinburgh together and they can & # 8217 ; t wait to start being adults . Lily meets Eve and introduces her to Adam . There & # 8217 ; s a instant attraction and they can & # 8217 ; t take their eyes off each other . Eve is beautiful and everything Adam wants . There & # 8217 ; s questions about how platonic Adam and Lily & # 8217 ; s relationship really is . Surely a man and women can be just friend & # 8217 ; s right ? Excerpt-The aroma inside the bakery made her stomach growl loudly and the few customers in the shop all turned . Her cheeks heated and Adam burst out laughing . It was the most wonderful sound she had her in a long time . She felt good that it was her that brought that out of him ... well , her grumbling belly anyway.I loved how Lisa put the music playlist into the book at the start of every chapter there & # 8217 ; s a song it sets the mood for the what & # 8217 ; s to come , I felt more connected to the characters listening as I read.You do know how much I love you , don & # 8217 ; t you ? And that you & # 8217 ; re the only girl for me ? You & # 8217 ; re the one I want to wake up with , the one I want to share my body and my life with.The Girl Before Eve makes you feel and want to keep turning the pages to see what happens next . The writing I feel was Lisa & # 8217 ; s best work yet , I loved it and a must read for me . I can & # 8217 ; t wait to read what she writes next .	1
Great book for kids . You do n't have to put on a act and pretend to be better than everybody else . Just be yourself . Your friends will care about you just as much if you are yourself . Do n't be snobbish .	1
Little Kitty couldn & # 8217 ; t understand why no one wanted to play with her . She wants to play and yet as the animals came one by one to answer her meow to play the Puppy-dog , Froggy and Rooster too , she was abusive , conceited and snobbish just downright mean . No one wants to play even when lonely Kitty tries once again and still no one wants to play with her.A wonderful unique way to approach a children & # 8217 ; s book & # 8211 ; I love it ! I love how Anat leaves the story in order for parents to teach little ones valuable lessons on friendship , love , caring and respect . Excellently written and beautifully illustrated . I can & # 8217 ; t wait to read more from this truly gifted author who has a way with teaching kids & # 8217 ; life & # 8217 ; s & # 8217 ; lessons . Outstanding storybook with lessons that adults and children will enjoy reading over and over again that yes I highly recommend as a must read .	1
The essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson had it right : & # 34 ; The only way to have a friend is to be one. & # 34 ; Unfortunately for Kitty , she was arrogant , abusive , and condescending to the other animals , so they did n't want to be friends with her any more than she wanted to be their friend . Some people learn from their mistakes , but unfortunately for Kitty , she never got the message , so she remained lonely and spent most of her day whining.The story stops there , and it asks kids who are reading the story ( or hearing it read by a parent ) to think about why the other animals do n't want to play with Kitty . The story offers parents a good opportunity to discuss friendship and what it means with their children . It 's a valuable lesson for youngsters to learn at an early age , and Kitty 's story illustrates very graphically why friendship is so important .	1
The author , Anat Umansky , has written a children 's book with a special message . Anat Umansky is an author from Israel , who is widely known for her children 's books . She feels her children 's books are the best way to communicate with children . She particularly likes to write about emotions , to help children thinkKitty is beautiful , white long fur , that she likes to clean with her tongue . It appears that Kitty knows how beautiful she is , and she does tell all of the animals she meets . She wants to play , and she goes looking for friends . However , each friend she meets is not up to her standards , and she turns them down . What is Kitty looking for ? Why Is this happening ? What a wonderful book for parents and children . This is an important subject to talk about . What could Kitty do to make friends so that she would have someone to play with ? We have all been lonely at one time or another . What do we do to find friends ? The book is written in verse which is fun to read aloud or alone . The illustrations by Vladimir Solop are beautiful and colorful , depicting Kitty , her friends and the environment so well . This is a wonderful book to go back to frequently , so we can all remember how to make friends.Recommended . prisrob 01-23-14	1
Hello Miss T.T ... .. you have done it again . I have you up there with Ms. Billy London- drop a book and I buy- no questions asked , no review required . I devoured your Alaska Princess Trilogy books and barely survived waiting for the final installment . Now I 'm wondering if I can make it a year for your next trilogy . But at least I know I 'll have your books to look forward to . However ; please feel free to drop 2 or 3 books in the meantime . I know life can sometimes mess up schedules but I just wanted to let you know how much I love your books . I have devoured , enjoyed and been captivated by each and everyone of your books.Wolf and Soul is the last book in this Trilogy and is part of 50 states series . This book does not deviate from the title . It introduces you to the Soul of the Hero and Heroine and leads you to feel their pain , their love and share their joys and laughter through out the entire story . Tu and Grady 's story is so emotional due to the years they spent apart , grieving over loved ones and blaming each other . But when they come together , it 's beautiful . READ the trilogy , if you have n't already done so , and share your love of her books with other readers .	1
I 'm not going to spoil it so I will make this review short and sweet . First of all , I loved how Tu 's character was redeemed . It was nice to see that even though Grady has a disability , it does not detract from him alpha status . Nice ending/intro in regards to future books in this series . I am honored to be the first to review this book . As always Theodora , I enjoyed the journey .	1
Ms. Taylor , great book ! Loved all of it ! Maybe my fave out of the three . Great job ! More on the way ... .yes ! ! ! ! ! ! And Grady is bomb !	1
The story was a nice conclusion to a engaging series . Tu and Grady were a two broken pieces that helped each heal beautifully . I rooted for them the entire way.Now , if we can only see some wolves transported from places and times other than Old Norway and to states other than Colorado ...	1
I so LOVE this series ! The scenes were hot and the writing style made you feel and root for the characters . I just ca n't believe the next book for this series will be in 2015 ... WHAT ! ! Please do n't make us wait that long..sigh ... though I 'm sure it will be worth it ! ! I am eagerly anticipating Ms. Taylor 's next book !	1
Totally fantastic ! I loved this story . From the previous books , I kinda knew Tu would be the troubled sister . Her story was so heart wrenching . I actually almost cried , and Sexyme does not cry reading books only watching movies = ) . Read this book , you will not regret it . You might want to read one of my favorite feel good ebooks by josette jackson next . You will love her books too .	1
The conclusion of the Whale Hunter Series . I enjoyed all three books . In this one Sunflower now 20 is the healer of her village . She is called to another village where a plague has hit . She is too late to fine a cure and the village blames her . She flees for her life . Later Grey Owl who is her sister-in-laws estranged brother shows up planning on forcing her to go to his people . A lot of action in this one including a large battle between the tribes . I consider this the best of the three books .	1
I so enjoy Karah Quinney 's writing .	1
Very interesting book first I have read like this Kristin keep writing its your passion I will read all to come	1
Do you like sweets ? I love a good dessert or a chocolate candy bar , but only once in awhile . I had to learn my lessons like everyone . When I was seven I used to love pink marshmallow sandwiches , until one day I had this sandwich with asparagus soup , whoops , learned my lesson.Jimmy , the little bunny loved sweets . He wanted to eat them before dinner , for dinner and after dinner . One day his mother called all the boys for lunch , Jimmy had two older brothers , but , Jimmy decided he wanted sweets instead of the wonderful meal his mother had prepared . He brothers declined , and tried to talk him out of the sweets . So , Jimmy went by himself to the kitchen . He found the spot where he thought his mother had put the sweets , where up there , high up on the shelf . He got up on a chair , but that did n't work , got a pan to put on the chair , but he still was not able to see the sweets . He found a cookbook and picked that on , and then ... ... well , Jimmy learned a big lesson , and I 'll let you read about his adventure.The author , Shelley Admont , is a mom , and loves her children . She makes up stories for them , and now , she has written a book for all of us . It is a wonderful story with a good lesson learned . The story is lively and well told . The illustrations by Sonar Goyal and Sumit Sakhuja are vivid and colorful and depict Jimmy the little bunny and his friends in all their glory . This is a fun book to read , and interesting conversations can be developed on the lessons learned in this book.Recommended . prisrob 01-28-14	1

At this developemental stage we all know it 's hard to get our children to eat anything nutritious forget fruits and vegetables ... Children run the other way ...

I know someone who has this kind of addiction . He used to hang out with us , but now we rarely see him in weeks , because he was addicted to gambling . I figured out that he wanted to cure this addiction , and i helped him out by giving this book for him to read . Weeks later , he thanked me for it . Thanks Anderson ! Good book .	1
Admitting you have a problem is the first step to solving that problem . This book is a great first step . It is detailed and offer many practical ways and technics to overcome any type of gambling problem . It is a very easy read and can be applied to almost any gambling addiction . So if you have or suspect you have a problem , please read this book and use it as a guide to your freedom .	1
My experience of gambling comes mainly from a friend of mine - MW - who learned a so-called secret system in roulette . She lost her university savings , ran up huge bills and ended up as an escort ( I kid you not ) to pay off her debts . She was left ashamed , broken and really a different person . She had been addicted to the roulette table , to the high she got when the chips piled up and the obsession she had when they vanished to try again . I am sure if Robert Anderson 's book had crossed her path her life would have been different and I recommend it for this reason . If you are an irresponsible gambler , really , the only gamble worth taking is acquiring this book .	1
A very good book with a lot of information for people suffering a gambling addiction . The author clearly knows what he is talking about . I highly recommend it .	1
My ReviewThis book quickly pulled me in from the prologue . I could n't put it down . I know Mrs. Kaye was probably ready for my review but I simply told her I needed to drag it out a bit longer , that was how good it was . Have you ever read one of those books that just did n't want to end so you try and try and try your best to read slowly and stretch it out ? Well that is what I did with this one.This book starts out with Chloe finding out some devastating news about her fiance which ends with them calling off the wedding . Now what is she suppose to do ? She has no place to go . Her boss quickly finds out about what happened and has offered up his home to her . You learn they have known each other for a while and are actually really good friends . What they do n't expect to happen is all the Hot Pent-Up Sexual tension between them . She finds herself feeling much better having Garrett around . She quickly makes herself at home and Garrett rather enjoys having her around . He 's known for not doing relationships at all . This is such a wonderful romance . You really feel what both characters are feeling . I felt like I was right there with them . And let me tell you there are some very Steamy scenes that kept me very happy . They really tried to fight the sexual tension they had for each other . But once they stopped fighting it , they realized just how right it really felt . I loved being able to watch both Garrett and Chloe really grow together . The emotions and the ups and downs had me reeling , but in a good way . I laughed and I actually cried a bit at some parts but they were tears of joy . The twists and turns in this book and actually love and feeling the characters themselves will leave you wanting so much more .	1
Maggie Kaye know away to a girls heart . So Right With You is every girls dream . How could you not fall in love with A man who wants nothing more but make you the happiest girl alive in every way possible.Chloe is down and out , she finds her fianc & eacute ; cheating on her , has know where to live and given up on love . That is until her boss of three years Garrett comes to her rescue , like knight in shining amour and this start to turn around.This book sizzles and you can feel the electricity these two release when they are together , they are so right for each other but they do n't see it.I loved the wittiness through out the book . I laughed and I cried throughout . This is not a book you want to put down when you start . You will want to plow through it till the end . I did.The supporting characters where fantastic and the under story regarding Kali balanced the book well . Most of all you will just fall in love with Garrett he is every girls dream . You can see why Chloe fell in love with him he is so different to Trevor , who you just want to slap so hard.I ca n't wait to see what Maggie has for us next and I know it will be just as good . So if you love happy ever afters than is is the book for you .	1
First of all , I & # 8217 ; ll start by saying that I loved this book and this is not your typical love story . Also , get comfy because once you start reading this - you won & # 8217 ; t be able to put it down . You & # 8217 ; ll laugh , you & # 8217 ; ll cry but in the end , you & # 8217 ; ll love it as much as I did.So Right With You is a story about Chloe . Her heart is broken when she finds out her fianc & eacute ; Trevor , is cheating on her . Since they live together she realizes she has nowhere to go . Chloe & # 8217 ; s sexy boss , Garrett , overhears her conversation and offers her a place to stay at his ranch.One of Chloe & # 8217 ; s rules is - never date your boss . Garrett is & # 8230 ; well , let & # 8217 ; s just say & # 8211 ; he & # 8217 ; s every girls dream come true . As their relationship builds , they become more and more attracted to each other and the more time they spend together the harder it is NOT to break that rule . The chemistry between them is smokin & # 8217 ; & # 8211 ; that rule definitely need to be broken between these two & # 8230 ; just sayin & # 8217 ; .The supporting characters are great , easy to relate to and in my opinion , play a major part in this book . I liked all the characters , especially Kali and Josh . There & # 8217 ; s so much more to Kali then meets the eye . The special bond that Kali and Chloe have is amazing and heart-warming & # 8211 ; it & # 8217 ; s what true friendship is all about.I ca n't wait to see what happens in Maggie & # 8217 ; s next book but I guarantee you it & # 8217 ; ll be fantastic ! Thank you Maggie for a wonderful read & # 61514 ; : )	1
If you are looking for a fun , hot , steamy read with little angst , then So Right With You is a great choice.Chloe walks in on her fianc & eacute ; cheating with her best friend . In their condo . I know- real nice . Left with nowhere to go , her boss Garrett offers that she stay with him at his ranch . They have worked together for 3 years and although it is not the ideal solution , Chloe agrees planning to keep things professional.Things start out that way but they develop feelings for each other and you can see where this goes . I have to say that I don & # 8217 ; t blame Chloe for falling for Garrett . The man is a doll . Not only is he sexy and hot as h*ll but he is a total gentleman and he is so protective and caring . He takes care of her in every way , in and out of the bedroom , which is f***ing hot . And it is exactly what Chloe needs after what her a**h*le fianc & eacute ; did to her.And speaking of Garrett taking care of Chloe , let & # 8217 ; s talk about the s*x in this book . There is plenty of it and it is hot . Maggie definitely did a great job writing the scenes.There & # 8217 ; s more to the story than just their romance . It does get emotional but not too much ; I promise you will enjoy it . In addition to the great main characters in this book , there is an amazing cast of supporting ones as well . There & # 8217 ; s a ton of family and friends that play a part in this story and they all are written well . In fact , the next book in the series is written about one of them , Leighton , and I can & # 8217 ; t wait to read her story ! For more reviews , go to [ ... ]	1
I absolutely fell in love with this book from the first chapter . This story has it all ; heartbreak , new love , friendships , sex , and so many heart felt moments within the story . This debut author has a way with words and the story flows really well . Garrett and Chloe 's story touched my heart and I ca n't wait to read about the mystery trip Leighton took to Australia and see where that book goes . I will definitely be buying many more from this author . I could say so much more but do n't want to ruin the story for anyone .	1
Ive seen all types of paleo books these days , and Ive read quite a few in the past few months as I am trying to get in better shape and ofcourse feel better . This is one I woud recommend because its a simple read for beginners and the recipes are good ( Ive read quite a few that DO NOT taste good )	1
A very nice book . To the point , aptly describe the list of Paleo ingredients with quick tips to search the right one . And as a bonus it gives you 10 yummy recipes .	1
This is a great basic guide to Paleo eating . There are a lot of & # 34 ; can'ts & # 34 ; with Paleo but this book helps you focus on all the & # 34 ; cans & # 34 ; and puts it in a form that is easily digestible and easily maintainable . Even if you are n't eating Paleo this is a great basic cookbook that teaches you how to combine basic proteins , vegetables , and spices for a delicious meal . I highly recommend !	1
This is the second novella in the Love at Pemberley series by Reina M. Williams , a spin-off romantic love story of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen . While I enjoyed the first installment , Most Truly , I enjoyed this story even more.I have only read these two novellas by Williams , but her writing style is very leisurely , spare , and sometimes lyrical . This is a quiet and pensive series , which is rather odd since Jane Austen & # 8217 ; s Pride and Prejudice is Austen & # 8217 ; s most lively and spirited novel . Described as & # 8220 ; light and bright and sparkling & # 8221 ; by the author herself , that is not how I describe Miss Darcy Decides.The title has some promise , as it sounds almost gothic and fantastic , and there is an enticing element of the illicit in the story , but it is still a very sweet Regency romance . In fact , I thought Most Truly had some sexual tension while this story pretty much skips that emotion , and I found myself wishing for more.Especially since Sir Camden Sutton , the hero , is a rogue . He & # 8217 ; s rusticating in the Derbyshire countryside before he intends to take control of his neglected estate and , at the invitation of his friend , Colonel James Fitzwilliam , stays a few days at Pemberley . He meets Georgiana Darcy at a neighbor & # 8217 ; s cottage for tea . Intrigue makes a promising appearance when we discover that Miss Wilton is an unmarried pregnant woman living with her kind aunt . Camden is a reformed rake whose cousin & # 8217 ; s reprehensible behavior left Camden extremely regretful of his own dissolute life.I really liked that Camden felt he could reform and become a better person , instead of feeling completely unworthy of a future of love and romance . He is confident in his own skin and knows who he is and what he wants . Camden represents what Willoughby ( from Sense and Sensibility ) might have become , and I really like how Williams presented his character.Georgiana , Fitzwilliam Darcy & # 8217 ; s youngest sister , was almost ruined at fifteen by George Wickham . She is a quiet , sensitive , young woman , fearful of disappointing her brother again , but now she desires love and romance and finds herself attracted against her will to the enigmatic and dashing Camden . Her attraction confuses and excites her , but she is an old soul , a very mature young woman , and almost too serious for her own good . She & # 8217 ; s also a worrywart . Williams & # 8217 ; descriptions of Georgiana & # 8217 ; s emotions are lovely to read as you see her thought processes . Georgiana also recognizes that Camden needs a friend and is lonely ; she & # 8217 ; s very astute and attuned to the feelings of others.Darcy does not like Camden and makes his feelings quite clear . There are some nicely portrayed scenes where they confront one another in tense moments . Elizabeth sometimes acts as a diffuser , but Georgiana also speaks up for herself in a lovely moment.The descriptions of both the English countryside , landscape , and food are vividly and beautifully written and there are also several personal appearance descriptions , something Jane Austen herself rarely wrote . & # 8220 ; The fire played shadows against the far wall , and the canary silk curtains were drawn against the chill summer eve. & # 8221 ; ( p13 ) I would say that , except for the characters and setting , this does not feel like a Jane Austen novel , but I don & # 8217 ; t think the author intended it to be.There is some mention of God and faith , which felt out of place and , again , Jane Austen rarely wrote of spirituality , as devout as she may have been . It felt a little jarring and out of place in the story.As in Most Truly , characters from Austen & # 8217 ; s most popular novel make appearances once again : Anne de Burgh , Mary Bennet , the nasty and vindictive Caroline Bingley , Charles Bingley , and of course , Darcy and Elizabeth . And Kitty and James are just beginning their married life here.Memorable moments : & # 8220 ; It was past time to honor Sophia and all his family and friends who could no longer do as he could & # 8212 ; live with honor , with kindness , with love. & # 8221 ; ( p24 ) & # 8220 ; 'I can not undo my past . I can , however , live differently , and that I intend to. & # 8221 ; ( p41 ) & # 8220 ; Miss Bingley was just the sort the Comte liked & # 8212 ; well-bred , sharp , beautiful , with a vein of ice. & # 8221 ; ( p52 ) A genuinely pleasing and satisfying Regency romance that even Jane Austen purists will enjoy . *A modified version of this review first appeared on The Romantic Historical Reviews blog .	1
This was a great read ! It was a true woman meets man ... man and woman falls in love , but refuses to admit to their love for one another . True love with sex , but the sex did n't over shadow the storyline .	1
I would like to say this is a good read . Now the plot moves fast and quick with April and Mitch . I felt they moved to fast and did n't communicate with each other about what they wanted . That is why they had problems . Now for the bad part , I hate the way the book ended .	1
In a romantic relationship ( or a relationship of any kind ) trust is one of the most key elements that must be present for a healthy couple to thrive and grow together . If a relationship is a plant , trust is the sun that it needs to grow properly . Without it , the relationship withers and dies.I enjoyed reading this book because it explains with personal tales and great examples of how trust can be so easily destroyed , and why couples have such problems developing trust in a relationship once it has been broken . On both sides of the relationship , the people involved have to be mindfully aware of the things they say to each other and how they behave , because sometimes something so innocent as being late all the time , can cause a person to lose trust in you . This is only one example of what is talked about in this book.What I liked most was the way the author explained different ways to build trust within a couple . Even if things are going great in your relationship , this is a good book to use as a refresher in how to keep a foundation of trust strong in your relationship .	1
This book probably at first glance you may think siginificant other trust issues . But if you 're in any kind of relationship rather it is friend family or whatever this book is good at helping you resolve trust issue . I have learned to not only learned to trust in relationships with partners but relationships in my day to day life from significan others , to friends , family and even co workers .	1
If you are struggling with your relationship with your mate then this is a great book for advice about recognizing trust issues and how to deal with them . The book clearly shows you ways to build healthy trustful relationships or repair , rebuild , or restore a relationship where the trust has become an issue . You should be open minded with your partner and use your own judgment when situations of trust come up . Communication is the key to maintaining your healthy relationship and you must accept and give forgiveness when necessary to make your relationship work . You must accept the fact that you will be vulnerable and that some resolutions are painful and uncomfortable .	1
Trust seems to be a touchy issue now a days , between friends and most often with lovers . Robert really opens up his heart and past to help show us how trust can be violated . He then goes on to show his journey into a new a relationship , and just how to dis-spell those trust issues.I was impressed by the advice given , as we seem to forget the small things like remembering our significant others when we go out . I also enjoyed the section of getting rid of emotional baggage , because even though I am in a loving relationship I still carry mine with me . I did n't even think what kind of possible mental turmoil it might cause my partner when I cling to things that should n't matter anymore.The books flows well , with one idea leading straight into the next . Robert Rain really speaks to the heart with his great advice and information on how to work on trust issues . Whether you have current trust issues or feel your relationship might be headed in a direction you do n't want , I would give this book a read . Its a definite inspiration to start your new year off right .	1
This story was so good . However , it was very poorly edited and the spacing was way off . The premise is great and the ending was a twist for me at least . I would encourage you to give it a try if you can overlook the editing issues .	1
It is good to have a second chance . Sweet story that would have had five stars , but there were too many misspellings that interrupted the flow.I hope Noah has his own story printed soon .	1
I admit it , I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases , because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn . He is , in my opinion , one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building , intricate plot , and edge-of-seat action . His Thrawn and Conqueror 's trilogies were incredible , Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging , and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent . So I figured this would be too.First off , when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud `` Huh ? That 's it ? ! '' I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else . It is a really short story , barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales ' Star Wars series ( and those books have several of them ! ) . It 's also , I must say , a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I 've seen Zahn write . It 's not terrible , but it really is n't that great either- there 's no twists and at the end you 're left wondering where the other half of the story is . The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable ( as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops ) and though there is quite a bit of action , it kind of reads like a ( short ) movie or videogame script.Overall , not worth paying for . In fact , it should really be free if you ask me .	-1
Somewhat of a disappointment . The articles were all there , but I missed Pepper and Salt and the list of declared dividends , currency exchange , weather . These were the small things that I would like for travel , the whole stack of paperes was waiting for me at home . This was just a stop-gap for travel abroad where the WSJ was not available .	-1
1 . Costs more than delivered to your door paper and online version combined.2 . Very confusing to read . Not intuitive.3 . Layout is a nightmare4 . Cant find anything like in the paper or online version.5 . Price went up even more.I cancelled until they get it right just like everyone else who has tried it . Big let down .	-1
This is it , the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle . You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this . This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle . It only lets you view the content on the Kindle . No printing articles , no emailing articles to a friend , no using it in presentations . You are stuck . Very evil is it not ! So , if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend .	-1
This is an update of my original review ... The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered . There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that 's ok because it 's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web . The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome . Graphs , photos , and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format . It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access . WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible . Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete , you have to put up with ads ! Considering the new cost of $ 21.62/month or $ .072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies . I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update : I have canceled my subscription .	-1
ten days into my trial subscription and i have decided to cancel . have read the wsj for 30 years and i guess i have one foot in the digital world and one in the analog world.i wo n't repeat all of the other comments , i can concur on the difficulties of making the transition to kindle reading . if i was still in a job that had me traveling alot it might make sense but since i pick up my wsj of my front porch it just does n't work.the one thing that really baffles me is how to cancel a free trial . unless the magic button is hiding right out in the open , i ca n't find a website or kindle method to cancel . i had to call into customer service and yes , it got taken care of but i was disconnected three times before i made it into the queue , the fidelity of the call made it almost impossible to understand what the person was saying , and the english of the rep was spotty at best . not up to the usual amazon quality .	-1
I have not received one of my fourteen free copy of the NYT so please end my non subscription at this time , meaning I 'm not agreeable to any charges being placed against my account for NYT . Thank you . Douglas	-1
I am not from Washington , but enjoy good media . Unfortuntely , the Washington Post is mostly about politics , or the Redskins and other local stories pertient only to Washington DC . Whereas the NY Times is more international , and the Wall Street Journal is very business oriented but at least national , the Wash. Post is very narrow . I unsubscribed .	-1
I got about two pages into this before giving up . The style is clunky , the internal monolog does n't gel with the character we know , and the story starts at the end of a chase scene that probably would have been really interesting if the author had bothered to write it .	-1
Sigh ... What can I say ? This is more of Karen Traviss ' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty , infallible , infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians , who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It 's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual , Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story . This book is pointless , as the whole premise is flawed , based on a non-canon idea , and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars ( which trump the C-Canon ( soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon ) ideas in Traviss ' books . ) Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying , uninteresting , boring , obnoxious , mary-sue characters ever written . She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett , and turned him into a character who just Would n't Shut Up . She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive , lost , dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy , into a clan of dancing , singing , Mando'a speaking , boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And do n't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is . If you want to know every tiny , minuscule , stupid thing about a character , just turn to Traviss ' books . You 're lucky if she does n't tell you how , when , and where Boba acquired his underwear , and what they 're made of.Suffice it to say , I 'm not a fan of Traviss ' work . I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly 's disastrous efforts . Read this only if you 're a huge fan of Traviss , or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books ... Because this one ca n't stand up to scrutiny .	-1
He does n't need my recommendation but since you asked , unless you are into thorough reprobates , give it a miss . As the wag once put it , Mark Twain shows promise .	-1
Never realized the fairy tales we have heard all our life were based on such horrible tales . I thought this was a good book to have on hand for my grandchildren , but I would not read or allow them to read this .	-1
I did n't care for this story , others may like it but it just not for me , I just could n't keep reading . Too much good stuff out there to keep going with this one .	-1
Admittedly , I only read the first few stories . They seemed disjointed , did n't flow , or seem to have a point . It was written as if it were & # 34 ; I tripped as I walked down the street . The bus went downtown . The end & # 34 ; Perhaps they just did n't translate well , or maybe they put the worst stories in the beginning .	-1
It was not like the in-print edition . It was printed like a word document . Not what I wanted . I did n't want to pay for that .	-1
Try Reuters international for $ 1.99 per month and leave the liberal opinion pages to the drama seekers . You pay $ 9.99 for more left wing political opnion pages than news .	-1
I LOVE BELLE ANDRE ! ! ! ! Let me start by saying that I truly truly enjoy reading Belle Andre books . Yet this one fell short . Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening , I 'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more . The story just did n't make sense to me . I had a really hard to time getting into the characters . It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus . This one not so much .	-1
I like the Nation magazine , but I zoomed as much as I could and the type was so tiny it was not readable for me . I have great difficulty reading small type , it makes my eyes ache and gives me headaches . For me , this was not a viable option for reading on Kindle . I was glad I purchased just one issue , rather than subscribing as I intended to do . Others might not have this difficulty , but for me , it just did n't work .	-1
Since NYT began a paid service to view articles online I can now RARELY clip an article to view later or save . A message appears that the article is no longer available.Guess NYT and Amazon wants me to pay $ 20/month for a full subscription . I 'm cancelling this blog .	-1
I should have know by the cover it was a bit out of my taste for books . It started out good , but i got bored before i finished.mary	-1
Within minutes of meeting each other the two main characters are having sex , graphically . And then it gets worse from there.The plot could have been good if it was n't turned into a porno . A naive young woman meets a dashing knight who rides a dragon . The woman has the unique ability to speak to dragons and joins the companions at their new base of operations.The main characters happen to be married within weeks of meeting after numerous sexual encounters between her new husband , his dragon and her other new husband . The narration then documents the continual mating of the dragons and the humans over and over and over again.This book is not appropriate for teens and I would recommend any squeamish adults stay away from it as well .	-1
Not very romantic , and not very steamy , with the distracting element of one of the characters being psychic . Very little actually happens .	-1
It was free , or I never would have even considered this book , just by the title and the little I knew about it . I should have gone with my gut - if I would n't pay money for it , then why waste my time reading it ? ! ? There was barely a plot and it amazed me how `` into it '' she was . I mean , this guy was her new boss . MAYBE I can let some of this slide and go along with that she was madly in love/lust with this guy and so she was up for anything with him . But his friend , Wade ? ? ? Give me a break ! Just the description of the guy made me want to gag , much less the things she did with him.This is truly a case of `` you get what you pay for '' and in my case I paid nothing . For those of you who do actually spend money on this trash - know that it takes less than an hour to read it , so even if you do end up enjoying the book , think about how much you are willing to spend for an hours worth of `` entertainment '' .	-1
First of all the back description throws you off a bit and the book went in another direction I didnt expect which was a disappointment . Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war , he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation ( plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he 'll be an Earl due to an inheritance ) . So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father , he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children . They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness ( Yea , I wasnt buying that ) . During the next few weeks , St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home . I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away ( but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing ) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero 's protest , at some point you need to get some back bone . Which came too late , she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away ? What ! ? I wanted to slap her . Then the story is like a soap-opera , now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father . And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it ? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste . I skimmed alot so I can not in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset . And I was left wondering whatever happened to the children of the duke ? why bring them in the tale if you hardly mention them ? The hero/heroine were likeable but not enough to save this book .	-1
The summary seemed cute and interesting and the story is ... until you meet Stacy . This is a heroine you want to like after you hear of her past and her heroic actions but then it 's near impossible to like her.Gina Wilkins had potential in this story but it gets weighted down and just plain eye-rolling when it you have an extremely Stacy not even trying while Jake is giving and showing just how nice of a man he is.Ms . Wilkins emasculates Jake Hinson completely turning him into Stacy Carter 's new dog ... simpering , whimpering and pleading for Stacy to throw him a bone . Oscar the Yorkie disappears and Ms. Wilkins makes Jake his replacement in a quick transition.I definitely wo n't ever read another Gina Wilkins book if this is the way she writes her men .	-1
I kind of take the reviews with a grain of salt , it 's subjective to each person 's viewpoint . I liked other books by this author like Collision Course and No Souvenirs . I thought ok it 's a short story , it ca n't be that bad . I was wrong , it ended at 1109 locations , 66 percent . The ending was so abrupt , it was n't just having a few questions . It was almost as if the story stopped in the middle , I expected to get the next chapter when I turned the page and all of a sudden I am staring at the author 's bio and I ca n't figure out what happened . I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong . Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck . I have read many stories by this author , some I liked and some I did n't . However , I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now . I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well , but there was hardly any relationship development . Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry . If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great . Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story . I hope she revises and republished this story in a way longer format . I want to know what happens . Trust me , I have read short stories that had the perfect plot line that it could be told in a way that the reader was happy at the end . This definitely is n't it . Save your money , do n't make a mistake like I did .	-1
First of all I should mention that I could n't bring myself to finish this book . I stopped after ca . 40 % .I like fantasy , werewolves and vampires , in general . For some reason I just do n't seem to be able to like this genre in mm-literature . Especially werewolves , because of the `` mating '' . Two guys see each other , and suddenly they 're supposed to live and love each other for life . No build-up , nothing.Well , I wanted to give this genre another try . ( AndLone , for example , was n't that bad , after all.. ) .This one , however , is the most boring and unimaginative story that I 've read/started in this genre so far.This is , in general , what happens in the beginning : [ Be warned , the beginning might be too exciting for some of you . I really do n't intend to cause a heart attack or something ... ] Laine : `` Hey , you 're my mate . `` Dev : `` Seems that way . `` *Both start having sex . *After that ( next morning ) the 2 characters make plans for family introducings etc . for the next day.No build-up . No suspense . No tension . Nothing ! Well , that 's exactly what happens , there are more words in the book of course , but that does n't really make it more interesting.Whatever happens next ( I gave up on it before ) , it might get a tad more enthralling , but I 'm already too fed up with the beginning to really believe that it 's going anywhere near `` great '' , not to mention `` sublime '' ..But do n't let my opinion scare you away from it . If you happen to like a werewolve and mating plot in mm-books and have no problems with immediate mating/falling in love , with no build-up whatsoever , who knows , maybe you 'll like it ...	-1
Great story line ... .but that is all ! Penny our heroine is BI POLAR ! Could have done a whole lot better . Characters needed developement not candy land .	-1
This not a book ; so lets call it a not-book . '' It starts by claiming that it is against the Constitution to hide information about UFOs.The cover is not only at the beginning but in 2 other places.This is the first not-book I have gotten from Amazon . The 3 covers AND several reader comments ( can we spell advertisements ) made the experience of this non-book just about worthless.I can understand when an author states that this is the beginning ( James Patterson comes to mind ) of a book to encourage a reader to buy the rest of the book ; unfortunately Mr. Wilkenson did not say that.I would not recommend this non-book to anyone because the lack of material and using reader comments as advertising . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Some M/M fiction is plot and character driven , with a spicy romance in there somewhere . This is the writing style that interests me.Other M/M fiction is just a series of sex scenes hung on a flimsy plot . `` Court Appointed '' is an example of this type . I did n't even find the sex scenes compelling , since neither the characters nor their interest in each other were skillfully developed . I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale . Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious .	-1
These stories were just not on a par with the original , TWILIGHT PHANTASIES , and I was so disappointed . Now this is just my take on this . Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley . I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me . Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they do n't have as many skills . Also , they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright . Just off somehow .	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . Not Christmassy at all . In fact with the explicit sex , perhaps it should have been titled Porn for Christmas.The writing was ok , but the plot very predictable . Mercifully , this book was very short and I 'm glad I got it free .	-1
I downloaded this book free for Kindle . I read the reviews and was thinking I would enjoy this book . Boy was I ever wrong ! I was so bored with this book because it did n't seem to move out of the bedroom once the main characters made it there . I decided that was enough for me and I was done . I finally deleted this book withoug ever finishing it . I only rated it one star because I could not rate it NO STARS !	-1
I am a great fan of Gena Showalter and this series but this was awful . I am convinced she did not write this book . A big waste of my time ... Now I see why they HAD to make this book free .	-1
Despite the negative comments , I read this book as a prequel to the Lords of the Underground series . I am now reading book 4 of the series and I am not sure what help this book gives to the series ? ! ? The story was pointless and there was a very thin line connecting this story to those of the Lords . Read it , I guess because its free . But it does n't impact the series at all .	-1
a very basic love story that is so boring and not believable.ca n't believe jane wrote this.disaapointing and not her best	-1
This book had a real weak story behind it . I really could n't absorb the characters since the story was how they frequented sex due the strong physical attraction they have for each other . Despite the heroine 's past issue it was difficult to get into them later in the book .	-1
A cutesy love story , and somewhat predictable . The bedroom scenes were pretty bland . All in all , a little vanilla for my taste ...	-1
Could n't resist the potential of this plot . It started out O.K. , but went downhill from there . Way too predictable to the point of lame . Could not drag through another page , so I gave up about halfway .	-1
This book nearly put me to sleep . I love learning about laws of other cultures and the forerunner of our current system of laws but it was very dry .	-1
the story was boring . the hero was boring . when he saw sarah he did not visit his dead fiance 's grave . i did not like the heroine because she was willing to fall for the worse without trying anything else .	-1
I admit that at first I thought I was reading a factual history book . Later I found it to be a novel based somewhat on facts . Although someone pointed out that some of the book bordered on slander as far as the Pope and the Catholic church are concerned . I was put off by the sex scene by the German Colonel and his mistress . It would be enough to say they had sex without going into detail .	-1
I would not have bought this book but by the description it sounds interesting . The book jumps around past to present , it makes no sense until the last three chapters . I had to turn the pages and turn because I kept waiting for some thing to happen and for it to make sense . I would not recommend this book to anyone	-1
Time travel and pirates - I thought I would like this book because they are two of my favourite themes in the romance genre , but alas I was wrong.I thought this was meant to be a romance book but all it was about was sex . Some of the scenes even made me cringe , such as the one with the candle and the paerls . Ick . Just porn , no romance , and not very good writing .	-1
This book was just ok . I was really looking forward to reading this one because it was a different take on the menage story . Instead of coming in on the part of the couple 's story when their relationship was just starting we come in on the middle where it 's on the verge of ending.I 'm beginning to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my taboo or erotic reads . For a romance I expect likable characters for the leads , characters that even if I do n't agree with what they do that at the least I 'll understand why . Both of those factors were missing in this book . Logan the alpha male in the threesome was all alpha and not at all likable . Usually I am the first one to jump up and root for an alpha male , but in this case there were very few redeemable qualities to be found in Logan . As a reader you understand Catherine loves him , but why ? Rhys was better than Logan in that at least he was likable , but that was it . There was nothing wonderful about him.To me the story would have been better if Catherine had stuck to her resolve even once , made them really work for something . It just seemed that at every turn Catherine was giving in and going along with what they wanted . In the end I found myself just skimming the last few chapters . I 'd recommend skipping this one.Stats : Ebook pages : 118 of actually storyGenre : erotic , menage romanceRe-Readablitiy : NoneSteam Factor : Hot	-1
Story line moved to quick you didnt get a chance to connect or even care about the characters . She met him he left and at some time she had a baby . You did not find out how she handle trying to find him or the hardships being a single mother . Too fast of a story line	-1
The version I downloaded is in a font that hurts my eyes . I have no idea what the story is like because I ca n't read it .	-1
I thought that the hero was very annoying at first . He wanted the heroine and then went back to give his ex another try because he felt he owed it to her . The heroine then met his controlling , jack butt of a cousin when she was vulnerable from the hero and married him . A year later , her husband left with the heroine 's money and best friend and the hero was no longer engaged to his ex . The hero could have saved them both a year of heart ache if he would have just stayed with the one who gave him the 'spark '' he kept mentioning , but nope , he had to go back to the woman who was good for him in a robotic way . It was his fault entirely that she lost her `` fire '' because his cousin drowned it out and she would never had went to the cousin if the hero did not reject her the next morning ! ! !	-1
Gave up about half way through . Too much repetition , too much that did n't make sense and was hard to follow .	-1
... I find the preaching very intrusive , ruining the whole novel , although as a story it would still only merit maybe 3 stars . It was not well-written or tight enough in the action sequences , dragging on and then switching to another thread . Also for an experienced submariner it is hard to understand why the author had to distort so many facts like ships ' speeds . I am glad I only borrowed this .	-1
I 'm sorry I bought this book . I should have borrowed it or tried a sample before buying . It jumps around too much and definitely overdoes the submarine layout . I got partway through it and decided I did n't care whether I finished it , so I moved it to the cloud . I may bring it back and try again , but not soon .	-1
also too religious-based but that 's just me . I wo n't be reading this author again . I 'm a sucker for a sub book , I had high hopes ,	-1
I decided to buy this book because I had seen come up a few times on my recommended author list . It was just too short , too boring and did n't really capture my attention . I guess there was n't enough heat between the two main characters and the 'love ' seemed shallow . I was disappointed .	-1
This is not up the usual quality of Ally Blue . It got so predictable , I put it down before finishing it .	-1
Accidentally , I ordered a Kindle version of the book . Either the author or Amazon Kindle has dropped the last 4 chapters in the kindle verson . This was a good book . M. L. Rhodes , in the beginning , wrote some excellent novels , then she switched to , my personal opinion , the `` crank out mode , '' probably due to greed , shortened her books , raised her prices . I now refuse to read anything with her name as author .	-1
I ca n't say I liked this one , just not the type of story I care to read . It was , in general , well written ( save a few very odd metaphors ) , but I found it to be awkward . The two MCs do n't have much depth and they sort of stumble together and they did n't have a connection that I saw , and they just ... ..are there.I also found some of the plot points odd . ( Small Spoilers Follow ) : Brock , who is the down on his luck model , made a sex tape with his heiress-celebutant ex-girlfriend . This apparently ruins his career . Hmmm . That seems unlikely given that Kim Kardashian has made an entire career out of having a huge butt and a very well distributed sex tape ( Thanks Mom ! ) . So ... .I did n't get the big deal . The sex tape is described and it 's not as though young children or sheep were involved so I 'm just not seeing it.There is no HEA either , always a downer for me.Overall I just was n't invested in the characters and I did n't buy the plot . It just was n't for me .	-1
This starts out with M/F and M/F/F scenes that are not mentioned in the description . The actual M/M section is so juvenile as to be unacceptable . It 's difficult to accept that this author has had any kind of sex with any kind of person . I returned it .	-1
I did n't finish the book as it 's written in the lengthy-description and ponderous style of the lat 19th and early 20th century . Not nearly as fast-paced or involving as Sherlock Holmes -- but good fair mysteries .	-1
After reading Volume one , I was really looking forward to becoming re-acquainted with Dr Thorndyke . Whilst the first couple of stories met my expectations , this volume contained stories where the character is completely absent and one where he plays only a peripheral role . What a disappointment !	-1
This was not at all what I had thought it would be , Matter of fact , I did not get very far into it before I decided to delete it .	-1
Really just a collection of memories written by the daughter-in-law in the woman 's own words . Not enough structure to keep me interested . I should have sampled it , then I would have known that it just was n't what I was looking for .	-1
I can see this being a great read for family members and acquaintances , but for me at least it just could not hold my attention . That 's just my opinion for what it is or is n't worth . Sorry .	-1
To rushed . The story skips ahead to fast . Things are not explained properly . To many details are left out . And it is the details , after all , that make a book a book and not a movie .	-1
All 5 of these short stories are in the public domain + can be gotten separately for FREE on Amazon or Gutenberg.org . They have quite possibly been stolen from Gutenberg.org . Why pay more ? CAVEAT EMPTOR !	-1
What a dead end book ! I not only struggled to read it as it was so boring yet forced myself to finish it to get the most ridiculous ending possible . It may be free but don & # 8217 ; t waste your time as you & # 8217 ; ll never get that back I sure wont . To make it worse the female lead was a split personality that went from a battered , scared introverted woman who was petrified of her husband to an independent , confident woman who could take on the world from the smile of a complete stranger she immediately fell in love with . The silliest book & biggest waste of my time & don & # 8217 ; t expect much Native American storyline added in , the name and cover were about as good as it got	-1
The comparisons to Bridges of Madison County drew me to this book - comparisons I now recognize as being overly generous if not completely insane.This story is poorly written and whomever edited it should find other work .	-1
The story is okay but the book has so many errors that halfway through it I started another book . I am not sure who did the proof-reading on this book but they did not do a very good job . It really messed with the flow of the story .	-1
This book was not the kind a reading I was looking for . It was hard to get into and after SEVERAL BORING CHAPTERS I through the towel in . Beware to others .	-1
Really ? I usually like Lorelei James , but this story was just plain distasteful ! ! ! ! Trashy , trashy , trashy . Better to have a great love story with just Billy .	-1
The story was n't too bad - what little there was of it . HALF the download was ads for other titles . I felt my money was completely wasted .	-1
did n't like him . barely liked her . no sympathy for either character ... plot totally undeveloped ... just scene after smut after scene . DO NOT waste your money !	-1
I got this one for free . It was too short . The characters were not developed , and the storyline was iffy at best .	-1
This is the first book I read by Sami Lee . It 's not much I can say it just is n't a story for me .	-1
I bought this after seeing an ad on facebook , reading the review posted , and seeing that it was only [ ... ] s. But I did n't finish it , which for me almost never happens . My main problems were poor formatting of the book ( paragraph tabs were inconsistent ) , poor grammar ( its/its 's mistakes among others ) , and that I just did n't care anymore . The characters really never grabbed me , and it was pretty much impossible for me to suspend my disbelief at the plot ( no ozone , and the US government has created basically a doomsday device to save the Earth ) . If you are a heavy-duty reader , this may be worth [ .. ] to you ; unfortunately , the book is certainly not worth much more .	-1
I know that some very good books can have unexpected endings , but this was just strange . It was as if someone just chopped off part of the book .	-1
Lately , I have been devouring Laura Lippman novels ; I think her stand-alone books are outstanding examples of psychological suspense . So , I was mighty pleased when I saw I could download one of her short stories for my Kindle ... for free . And , now that I 've read it , I 'm shaking my head and wondering , `` Did I miss something ? '' I actually flipped the page when I got to the end , expecting the story to go on ( and no , I did not expect a novel , but maybe a twist or at least some kind of resolution ) . When it did n't , I felt cheated . The set up was great , the characters artfully drawn , and the story itself had great potential . But from where I sit , it seems Lippman abandoned the potential and just stopped writing , rather than going to the effort of finishing the story in a satisfying way . The sad thing is , her publishers probably released this short as enticement to buy THE BABYSITTER 'S CODE . I fear it will have the opposite effect .	-1
Too complex for little ones . Maybe a book for 6th graders but not toddlers . I did n't like it at all	-1
The idea of this story was interesting but I disliked the writer 's style . The storyline was confusing to follow , all of the characters seemed similar , and the descriptions seemed very stilted and dry . Also , it was annoying that the author had one of the characters repeatedly pondering the relationship between two of his colleages but never seemed to come to a conclusion . Everytime , it came up in the storyline I was thinking , did n't he already go over this ? Usually when I read great story I become so immersed in it that it 's like watching a movie , this book was a struggle to get into . Sorry for the bad review but I just did n't enjoy .	-1
Normally I love books on shifters and was eager to start this one . And though the author had some intriguing ideas about werewolf culture , the book had one fatal flaw that I could n't over look : artificial conflict.I ca n't stand it when the conflict in a story only comes as a result of the characters making stupid choices and putting themselves in unnecessary danger . After promising multiple times not to put herself in danger , the heroine does exactly that the very first chance she gets , and willingly gives herself to the bad guys . Plus , I do n't think it was explained well enough about why the heroine was changed in the first place or why the bad guys wanted her so much.And the relationship between the two main characters progressed too quickly and unbelievably for me . I found myself doing a lot of skimming while reading and ultimately gave up before the end.I gave the book 2 stars for the interesting bits of world building at the beginning . I really , really wanted to like this book ( and the hero had an interesting back story ) . But I just could n't get invested in the story enough to really feel connected to the characters or worry when they were in danger .	-1
I downloaded this book as a Kindle freebie . I liked the title and thought it would be a light story about an encounter between a delivery man and one of his customers . It is n't . This is the product of 1,000 monkeys banging on their typewriters and flinging poo . Have you ever been watching TV with a friend who keeps flipping channels ? That 's what this book is like . The author stays on one storyline for a few paragraphs before switching to another . It 's very awkward and will give your brain whiplash . A few chapters in I was starting to wonder if the author just cut and pasted several different snip-its from drafts that she had on her computer . There 's blatantly obvious editing errors and inconsistencies . Then there 's the `` ick '' factor - a husband telling another man to `` do '' his wife and a swimmer fantasizing about a `` golden shower '' ? Gross . If you 've clicked on this page , back away slowly , return to where you came from . There 's better options .	-1
I downloaded this as a freebie , I would have been seething if I 'd paid for it . Bad writing , no plot , ridiculous characters and cringeworthy dialogue all add up to a book you can well do without .	-1
I pick this story because of the great reviews it got . Honestly ; the only thing it was worth the money was the cover , and I still got jeep when the cover did n't appeared on my Kindle . The story could had been better . Obviously this was not for me .	-1
I should have stopped reading when I read Keep on Truckin by Al Green . ( Eddie Kendricks was the singer ) . This book was full of inconsistencies like that . The music says one decade but the clothing and cars give you a different decade . And then the ending was totally disappointing . The story line does n't match the title .	-1
I paid for this book & all I got was approx 10 pages & there was n't even anything interesting about it . VERY ANNOYED	-1
buy a speed reading book by Evelyn Woods and your better off.the author does not deliver what he promises -- o else I missed the boat.I still find it interesting -- but i would not buy it .	-1
Nice story thoroughly spoiled by mis-spelling and poor editing . It was a an effort to get through every page . Real shame	-1
The story line was OK , the characters interesting enough , the only problem was that about half way in they start praying for each other and asking for prayers . This prayer thing was inserted very randomly in there and had absolutely no rhyme nor reason.I did finish the book but cringed every time the prayers were thrown in . It was a free book which was good , I will however make sure from now on to read the reviews before hand . I guess I am not a fan of Christian fiction.To summarize : story line is pretty good , it is a decent read if you do n't mind the random God and prayer inserts.I would NOT pay to read it .	-1
The predominant issue with this book is the editing . Just about every sentence is a run-on sentence . I tried to ignore them , but reading them is the literary equivalent of tumbling down a hill . On one page , the average sentence was five or six lines long -- all joined together with commas and very difficult to follow comfortably.Putting aside the editing issue ( which I know the author is aware of , but has n't yet fixed ) , the novel would be 2.5 or 3 stars . The basic premise of the book -- retired police chief from Wisconsin helps solve mysteries in Palm Springs -- is n't bad , but the actual mechanics of it leave some questions . I need more back story to help me understand why a small town police chief would have the ability to be especially good at solving these mysteries ( the story of him just being a `` natural '' at profiling and even doing freelance profiling for the F.B.I . did n't ring true ) . We never really saw Henry being good at figuring things out or having special insight into people . He just sort of talks to people and the mystery solves itself . It was kind of like watching your grandpa solve a case -- not a detective grandpa , but just your regular grandpa.I also had lingering questions about the plot . The device of the autographed pictures did n't make sense . I do n't understand why somebody would be more likely to buy a house if there was an autographed picture of a celebrity in it . . . either you 're an easy mark for that sort of scam or you are n't . What was the picture supposed to convey -- that the celebrity had left an autographed picture of themselves before moving out ? It also did n't make sense that nobody on the police force wanted to solve the crime because they 'd heard rumors that the victim liked to have sex with teenage boys . Detectives ca n't just opt out of murder investigations -- they may do a halfway job , but they ca n't just call in a local volunteer.I give the author credit for attempting to create some characters that add life to the book . Wayne and Henry were too alike to be distinguishable -- they need to be able to play off of each other better if this is going to be a successful series . Charles was actually an good character and I can see the potential there . It was jarring to have him continually introduce himself with `` Heeey , '' when no other dialogue had any sort of spelling alteration to imply dialect . It was distracting and unnecessary . The character of Amit was interesting in that you could see the author 's attempt to surround Henry with characters who were very different -- Amit was young , of a different race and nationality , technically savvy , and very different in personality . Like the vast majority of the dialogue , Amit 's did n't ring true , but with more work and development ( in dialogue and character ) , I can see this being a solid group and am hoping maybe Amit is being set up as a regular character.This has the potential to be a good series . It is n't there yet , but I would check out future books if I felt the author addressed the editing , tightened plots , and focused on characterization . I think there is room in the mystery world for a detective like Henry .	-1
Can you review a novel that you did n't finish ? If so , I found the writing extremely & # 34 ; wooden & # 34 ; . Sort of what you might expect from a freshm , an in a school of journalism.I did n't feel that it would get any better after the first two or three capters , so I stopped reading .	-1
This book is a sequel to Derrico 's first book , Right Ascension.I gave Right Ascension 4 stars.This is a sequel , but not quite a sequel , it is a more of a `` let 's get it over with '' type book.Too many characters doing too many things , too quickly , in too many places all at the same time.It is hard to follow and the `` resolution '' is totally unbelievable .	-1
An interesting idea , but I would not recommend this book to my friends . There are some errors . I 'm not sure if they are from bad formatting or from author/editor error , so I wo n't fault the author on that . However , I do fault the author for not being able to decide if he was writing for an adult audience or a YA audience . I wish he had made up his mind . I 'm not sure how to explain it , but sometimes it felt childish and other times it seemed a bit 'too much ' . YA-lit is a tough thing to write . It 's always a fine line between being too watered down and being over the top.Also , everything seems 'too easy ' and 'too convenient ' . Everything the kids need falls in their laps . They want to build a better shelter - a guy from a logging camp shows up . A girl is pregnant - they find a nurse . It would be interesting to see how the kids had handled the birth of a baby with no medical help . It would have also been nice to see the kids fail once in a while . I know there were bad guys around and they killed people and caused problems , but I 'm not talking about that kind of thing . It would have been nice if one of the kids ideas had not worked . `` Lets make this ... Lets build that '' and every idea works out perfectly . That 's not realistic . It 's ok to fail at a task . People learn from their mistakes and people can learn from reading other people 's mistakes too.I 'm all for supporting new authors , and I do give the guy credit for coming up with a good idea . I just wish he had proof read a little better and did some re-writes to fix parts of the story that do n't flow well . Also , the first chapter could be dropped completely and it would make the story flow much better . The first chapter sounds like a scifi novel from the 50s , then the rest of the book has a totally different tone .	-1
I love Gena 's Lords series , but this one is not for me . I was n't captivated by the world og the buildup .	-1
I quit reading when I realized that this was n't a full story in itself . I have read series before that at least held their own story for that book and continued in others . But I was half way through this book and quit . I just found out the story line when I was half way through . That does n't bode well for the ending . It will be a huge cliff hanger for sure and I do n't go for that when reading . At least it was free on Kindle since I would have to pay alot to continue the story if I chose to .	-1
The book was quick reading , but I was n't impressed at all.The story line just seemed to be a rip off of the hulk story with some twists to it . Evil hulk ( Trent ) with a religious cousin ( Jonathan ) who has the same power . All created by a mad scientist ( Trent ) who was infected ( along with Jonathan ) in a accident with the formula.There you go , that 's the story . That 's it.The good , the book was cheap.The bad , the story equaled the price of the book .	-1
I loved the first chapters and had a good laugh . I specially liked the enchantress behind the scenes and her self made mutt ; and admired the courage of Beauty and her quest to get her loving Beast back after finding the grass is always greener in the human side . Her early misfortunes and encounters with other famous story book beautie were original and funny , but alas ! the enjoyment soon faded soon turning into a noir overload . I like dark humor , satire , noir etc . but in moderation . One by one , the beauties that Beauty encountered , from Snow White , to Cinderella , and without an exception they were all damaged and incapable of being nurturing , loving , caring , and unable to have a good relationship . Besides their beauty , they were endowed with few reedeming qualities and doomed forever after.. Beauties be aware , there is not a happy ending unless you are NOT ! !	-1
Beauty 's Beast became a callous , unloving fop when he lost his beast form , and Beauty sets out on a quest to turn him back into the Beast she loved.While the story idea itself was n't bad , the execution was awful . Ditchoff mixes tenses and flashbacks without regard to the poor reader trying to follow the storyline . She confuses words , such as `` bridal path '' for `` bridle path '' - both useful but NOT interchangeable . When a couple of dwarves come to Beauty 's aid and accidentally uncover her `` ta-tas , '' I could n't take any more .	-1
I was doing a puzzle , and accidentally turned the page , then a new game appeared . That made me mad . All the puzzles are the same thing . If you do n't listen to me and think you want it anyway , try the sample to see how bad it REALLY is . Do n't listen to those that give it five star reviews . Try the sample , and see for yourself .	-1
The plot of the story was very promising . The first several chapters kept me interested and I could n't wait to see what happened . But that was where the problem lie . I felt like a waited and waited and waited to see what would happen . About half way through the book the dialogue became utterly boring and I did n't think I would ever reach the end . When I did reach the end , I felt let down . The grammar was pretty bad so if you are not able to overlook errors you might not want to even try this one .	-1
This book is written with zero chemistry between the two main characters . The punch lines were cheesy and I do n't even think that the author seems to like or respect women very much .	-1
I was so disappointed with this book , it had so much potential but didnt really go anywhere . The characters were shallow , the plot was predicatable . Very disappointing . I imagine this would be a good read for younger audiences or those new to the fantasy genre or who want a `` lollypop '' version of the middle ages , but if you 're serious about your fantasy/sci fi fiction , do n't bother with this book . You 'll find it too chaste and shallow with no depth or realism . Not for serious fans !	-1
the editor should be sued ! there many spelling mistakes grammatical errors and word usage and tense usage mistakes . basic premise ok. this stinker should have been offered free ... six wasted dollars . shame on me !	-1
it was a quick read and did not have enough depth . liked the idea of some f the punishments , but it was rushed . and some arts were confusing . I should retread a section of a story for one reason only , it was hot and had to read it again because ... wow ! um , read some lines again because it was kind of confusing . but like I said , liked the idea though . will read their work again , I liked their writing style , next time more to the story . that magic stuff was unneeded fluff or nt fluff enough .	-1
The early stories are quite well done , but later in the book there are many I gave up on because they are revoltingly violent and/or not very interesting . I would have quite liked to read more stories featuring the Jack Daniels character .	-1
This author receiving two stars was more than generous . Stealing Innocence 1 & 2 was garbage ! I guess for the price , you get what you pay for ... ..NOTHING !	-1
This is a nice read . It 's not Tolstoy or anything , it 's fluffy entertainment . I liked it . What I do n't like is it 's super super short . And the other parts are not free and equally as short . There are 3 other parts to this book , totalling 4 `` books '' . When you add up the price , you end up paying for a full novel , which all these stories put together do n't equal . All the stories put together would equal the size of a little Harlequin paperback . There are excerpts of other books added , so even the KB size is misleading . Such a rip off . You 'd be better off buying a full novel . I 'd recommend Backstage Pass and Rock Hard by Olivia Cunning . GREAT read and worth the price and time , in my opinion . U can buy old paper backs for cheaper and get just as good a read . They really need to re-evaluate this .	-1
It is very frustrating to see authors/publishers loading part of a story for free and then selling you the follow-up pieces . Free books should be free . If you want to give me a free sample of a book , then be honest about it in the description . This `` book '' ends right in the middle of a conversation.It is n't even very good . Jane Porter takes a vow of celibacy after finding out that her `` master '' is married ( I put that in quotation marks because that is what she calls him , but she seems to be very unfamiliar with the lifestyle later in the story - it was difficult to figure out exactly what her experience level was ) . After a year , she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner . This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic . First of all , a guy was throwing it for his half-brother . Who throws a party like that for a sibling ? Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do . It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like `` You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene ? '' Well , if that 's the case , then maybe try talking about what she wants , what she is looking for in the scene , what is n't on the table for the session ? The whole reason Jane got into a bad situation in the first place was because she did n't talk to her `` master , '' but she 's going to get right back into that same mistake again ? This was like somebody 's poorly thought out fantasy , not anything close to how this would play out in real life .	-1
You will not be getting a whole story here . Although a good start , you will have to purchase several other books to get the whole story .	-1
I did n't enjoy this story . It was so drawn out and , at times , downright boring ! I really could n't get a feel for how these characters looked -- -the author did n't paint a vivid picture for me . In addition , I felt that the story was n't well told . So many details were lacking , especially the history of Sydney and Tyler 's relationship . What happened for them to break up ? Had he always been crazy ? How did she not see this before ? For her to be such a feisty girl , why could n't she have dealt with Tyler better ? I was not impressed with her hiding from him and nearly allowing him to rape her without much fight : `` At least she would n't be awake for it . `` Now , let 's talk about chemistry in the book . The chemistry is quite tepid . Sydney and Tyler kiss a bit , she gives him advice , they flirt , then they 're headed to his hotel for sex . What ? ? ? I really would have preferred the book without the ONE sex scene . It was horrible . The lackluster description of the sex is so vague I had to read it twice to be sure I was actually in the midst of a love scene ! This is definitely what I was expecting from a Wild Ride story , but then , I thought this author was comparable to Cat Johnston and Lorelei James . Boy , was I wrong . Even more frustrating , at the end of the book , I was surprised that Levi wanted a permanent commitment to Sydney . Why ? There was no chemistry , mundane sex ! Overall , poorly written book that left me desiring a REFUND !	-1
They are the Economist and they are not priced well ? Maybe like Geithner they can say the software did it . I find their articles a bit facile in tone , and I think they are in danger of becoming a relic by their digital Ludditeism .	-1
Not only the premise is unreal . The characters are superficial and hard to care about .	-1
Awful . I wanted to delete this garbage just after reading first 100 or so pages . but thought it must have some redeeming qualities ... wrong . main female character unbeliavably unsymphatic . Justin should have told her Buh..bye in no uncertain terms . Waste of money and time .	-1
Downloaded the sample , and at page two of chapter two the grammatical errors began . I will no longer pay writers for poor work on amazon kindle . The lack of attention so called professional writers pay to their work here is tiring , perhaps in their haste to 'get it out there ' ? And this writer said he had proof read this after comments ... Proof read chapter one perhaps.Thumbs down .	-1
The first thrd of this book is taken up by very lengthy discussions of technology and maths . I could not get a hold of the hero at all . He did not capture me and I could not identify with him . He was a techie and was naive and shallow and had a teenager outlook . This is fine as he has spent his whole adult life cooped up with a smart computer and his maths problems . However he just did n't cut it for me as the hero . I found him frustrating . The next books in the series are not so fixated on the technology and IMO are better for it . PS the author replied to my review and so I encourage readers to write as he seems to care about what readers think	-1
What a basically `` blah '' story . Neither of the characters are especially interesting , the violence is n't at all effective ( and of questionable reality in certain areas ) , there 's no motivation for what 's going on and basically just not much here to like.This story perpetuates one of the great myths of serial killers ; that they love doing what they do and will snicker about how gloriously EVIL they are while doing it . We have two serial killers who like doing their thing through the medium of hitchhiking ; one as a driver and the other as a passenger . When they meet up , it 's like `` Frankenstein vs the Wolfman '' , only even less interesting . I also find it vaguely amusing that the violence is quite graphic , but the sexual content is glossed over quickly , as per the usual for American audiences.There 's some real potential here as a plot idea , but the execution , as it were , is terrible . I have no interest in reading anything by either of these authors and if I 'd not downloaded the story for free , I 'd feel quite ripped off .	-1
I read the whole story , and I must admit the horror and sex both made me feel very uncomfortable while reading it . While that may have been what the authors intended , it really was not for me.Best wishes , Dave Wile	-1
The `` novella '' started promising enough and what a great premise ! I 'm not sure if it was because two separate authors collaborated via email to write this piece or what but the ending was a let down . Too abrupt , almost predictable . I probably could have done a better job.I 'm just glad I did n't pay anything for it .	-1
The premise was interesting , and the concept was adequately executed , but the potential was overshadowed and ultimately stripped of any redeeming quality by the vulgar and gratuitously graphic descriptions of violence and sexual acts . I am not weak stomached , or a prude , but this book was literally nauseating in parts.I would not recommend this book to anyone , and I deleted it from my Kindle immediately upon finishing it , which I was only able to do because of it 's brevity . Had this been a full length novel I surely would have given up on it well before the end , and I came near to deleting it in the first or second chapter .	-1
Not only was this a very short read..took about 15 minutes to read it , it was also boring and a bit too gory for my taste . I was surprised that this book ( short story ) offered so little , I did expect more .	-1
Ya know , I really have to quit falling for the marketing gimmicks being used with books like this . I was getting bogged down in a history book and was looking for something quick and easy to read as a sort of mental palette-cleanser before jumping back into the second half of a rather long history book . Viola ! There was Serial , a quick-read about a killer who preys on hitchhikers and a hitchhiking killer who preys on drivers and the mayhem that ensues when this unlikely pair meet . Toss in some hype about how each of the authors wrote a chapter featuring one of the serial killers , then collaborated on the final chapter in which the killers meet and it sounded like it might be a promising story . So I downloaded it . After reading the story in about 20 minutes I can definitely say this is a book that was worth every cent I paid for it.I guess I should n't complain because it was free ... but even so , I got the feeling that Serial was less about a unique collaboration between two action/horror/thriller authors wishing to share their experimental fiction with readers than writers finding a new way to foist rejected first drafts on readers . Other than the authors competing to see who can come up with the most gross-out scene , there 's not really much to recommend the story . Do n't expect any character development or insight ... just prepare for a story that could have easily been told with sound effects : Screech , thud , smash , scream followed by slurp , clang , thump , bump , scream . If you like your reading to be all action and no introspection , then by all means go for it.Oh , and as a postscript , I notice that Amazon is now selling an `` extended version '' of Serial . That 's a $ 2.99 I think I 'll keep in my pocket .	-1
I wanted to like this book , as it had a clever premise , but I found it pretty convoluted . The main theme was so obvious that I wanted to smack the main characters ' heads together for being so stupid . I ca n't believe all the scrapes they kept getting into for just a short trip.I might have enjoyed this book more had the layout of the book not been so distracting . It downloaded on my Kindle in huge paragraphs without a break in between , so it was hard to keep my place . Then at a few points , the paragraphs went all clumped together down the middle of the page with poor punctuation and little delineation between scenes . I do n't know if this was the fault of the author , but it was very distracting and kept me from being able to concentrate on the book itself.The basic idea of the book was interesting , I just did n't think it was very well-written , on more than one level . And whoever tagged it as Christian romance was hallucinating . For that matter , I would n't have called it erotic romance either . The male character just did the same thing to the female character a couple of times . Whoopee ... .	-1
This short story took me about 15 minutes to finish and left me wishing i had those 15 minutes back . The Sith are the dark side of the force but there was nothing dark about this story , it is hinted that the characters do have the force but do not indicate why they may be considered the bad guys . It also has a cliff hanger and than starts up again 2 years later without filling in any of the blanks . I am sure this was meant to be a teaser and the complete book will go into greater detail but even for a free kindle book i felt like i was ripped off .	-1
Got about halfway through , The book seems to try and rely on gore and not enough on story . I also prefer the traditional Zombies , these were a little ridiculous	-1
Gore filled if that is what the reader wants but unbelievable zombies that think , are smart and snack on toddlers .	-1
One of the worst zombie books I have read . The writing is , at best , high school level . Amazon is great at giving opportunities for talented writers to break through , but this is not one of them .	-1
It was ok . I liked the way they included the view of the zombie along with the view of the survivors . It was original .	-1
First of all , the grammar , spelling and punctuation use ( or lack thereof ) are all terrible . I think this needs a serious going over by a professional editor.Second , the characters are bland . They have no substance to them at all ... .nothing that makes them special . Also , the swearing is excessive and mostly unnecessary.Third , zombies are de-evolved creatures . When infected humans die and then get up again as zombies , the brain has been wiped clean except for a few basic skills such as walking/running/other basic motor functions and the instinct to kill . Therefore , instantly having zombies with problem-solving skills , cunning and such right off the bat is a bit of a mistake . If you want to have evolved zombies , build up to it as the series goes on.In conclusion , I do not recommend this book .	-1
I read one other slave narrative and enjoyed it . During the depression the government sent writers out to interview former slaves so we would not forget . I enjoyed it and finished the book . Interesting to read about slavery from former slaves/ There was not one person who claimed any abuse from former owners in this book .	-1
After having Read wolf creek series , I was really ready for Tri Omega mates ! The first one was pretty good , but the second one Forbidden Desires could have been left unwritten . Ryland was an immature fool who did n't deserve any mate let alone two . Once a tri omega found his or her mates he or she could not live without them as the needed the additive his mates carried . I found myself wishing Gregory could have found another mate besides Ryland who was tri omega and Viktor who was the second mate . At least the books were cheap so I do n't feel too bad and I 'm hoping the other two are better but this one I would not recommend to anyone ! It 's a bad relationship when one person has to do all the compromising . Ryland and Viktor were HORRIBLE characters , Ryland was a backwoods slut with a sugar coating , no wonder his family tried to kill him -sorry they missed ! Not a good on a bad day !	-1
I got this as a free download , and usually score them more generously , but even free , something 's are not worth my time ... I have to finish the book to give it 3 stars , and I did n't , so it gets 2 . 5495 locations.Jim Richards is 60 years old , has only one friend and drinks 6 beers a night ( he prefers to drink 8 but he 's unemployed now ) and he also lives with his parents , but they did n't seem to have much personality or input . But it was n't his character so much as the simple way that the story was told that lost me . When pondering on who the killer might be Jim thinks : `` Honestly , I would n't know what a killer even looked like . All my crime books left that to my imagination . On TV , they were the last person you would suspect , not very outstanding looking '' - and that 's about the level of all the writing . It was too banal and I was n't engaged . I let it go.Edited to add - I immediately received a very curt comment from the author and looking at the other reviews , I can see a trend of bullying of any negative reviews , which puts me off the entire matter . I would never read anything by Bob Coates again ... Bob Coates has since deleted his comment , but the issue of his rudeness and attempts of intimidation are still true and I will keep this review up .	-1
The main plot of the story was n't too bad . The part that was confusing was the age of the character . Although the main characters were over the age of 60 a lot of times I found them acting like people my age ( 37 ) or younger . Also , I am somewhat tech-savy , but was a little put off by references to outdated gadgets . I actually had to Google what a Palm Treo was . This book is probably best for people over 60 . I also found it to be a very hard hard . It seemed to take me forever to get through it .	-1
I struggled to give this book two stars . The author holds our policemen in such low regard that I found the story distasteful and ridiculous . No police force could be as dumb as the book suggest . And it was not entertainment . It was so unrealistic and the love story was so silly that it totally distracted from the main storyline . Will not read any more books by this `` author '' .	-1
this book was just silly and made no sense plot was not good enough for me . I expected more and it was a short novel	-1
I found this story to be dull and lacking in charisma . It was missing the excitement of the first book . This second book seemed to have been written as an afterthought . I did not even care about the characters in this story.The CONSTANT paraphrasing of dialogue seemed to be just plain , lazy writing ! Hopefully , the third book is more interesting ...	-1
I bought this after downloading the first book for free . I am pretending that this was free because it was n't worth the money . It lacks the pizzazz the Classmate book has . I have n't been able to finish it -- too boring .	-1
Unfinished ? ? ? ? I agree with the other reviews about this book beimg umfinished . The story line was pretty good amd just when it started getting good , BAM over . I hope this is a series or there is a follow up or that is just a bad for the author .	-1
SPOILERS IN THE REVIEWI actually think that reviewer Lasha described perfectly what I think about this book , but instead of just commenting on her review I decided to make it my own review because this book is a perfect example of why I think GFY trope could be so very offensive in my opinion . I think it can be beatifully and sensibly done too , just not in this book in my opinion . I was ready to scream more than once when I was reading it indeed and not just about who pitches and who catches . I was ready to scream when author made her characters say over and over AND OVER again how they do not want to do REALLY gay stuff , whatever that meant for them in any given moment . Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts ? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual . If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on , just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let 's not forget the `` he has gay friends '' thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique , contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on . Yes , sex is hot , no book in my view is still horrible.And those are smart boys , yes ? Studying to be pharmacist and another one is supposed to go to prestigious Ivy League business school ? One would think their vocabulary would be a little bit more diversed .	-1
You will find more depth to the characters in the Dr. Seuss books than you will find in the characters in this book . Kron Darkbow the hero is supposed to be this tough warden from the prisonlands . He is constantly falling for traps and just blundering thru the story like a bull in a china shop . From the very first scene , he has supposedly achieved his goal of killing the man that killed his parents , the thing that haunts and drives him . Only to find out this was not the guy responsible for their murder but just a lackey . He then sets about trying to discredit the bad guy in a manner only the great Maxwell Smart would be proud of . But thru the events , he completely drops his life 's quest to run off after another bad guy that just seems to be a bigger threat . Please , you could have at least let Kron decapitate the guy he was after before switching to the new one.I read the first two thinking well , it might get better , sorry the same mindess dribble carried on from the first .	-1
The characters are very one dimensional and easy to predict . As such the book was a straightforward easy read , and for the price on the kindle I am not horribly unsatisfied . Characters are littered throughout the book who are brought to life through the entire book only to serve some minimal purpose at the end and then the characters are removed . There are budding relationships that are awkward and seemed forced . All in all , worth the price , but I would n't read it again nor recommend it to another with all of the low priced novels available on the kindle currently .	-1
After reading all the glowing reviews about this book I bought it . It sounded so wonderful & about all the things I like to read . I was disappointed I 'm sorry to say . I found it slow going & a bit boring . I finally did finish the book but personally for me it was n't worth it .	-1
This book was extremely disappointing ! I feel cheated having taken the time to read this book in it 's entirety in the hopes of some redeeming quality . I do n't care that its free , this book was disaplontingly horrible . The heroine just automatically accepts she is an untriggered wolf and that the hero is her mate . A little scepticism and a believable amount of time are needed in order for two life altering revelations to be accepted and dealt with ; not the couple of hours given in the book .	-1
I decided to try this book since it was free on the Kindle . I did n't realize how short it was . I think I read it in an hour and a half . The description sounded like an interesting take on a tried and true storyline of girl wolf meets wolf mate -- has a few issues , threatened with death , but lives happily ever after . The different take was that she was mute . Except she 's not mute . She can speak a bit -- ok , there are mute people who are able to articulate somewhat , but our girl can speak with an Alpha voice and force grown , mean , desperate wolves to lay down and show their belly to her . Yeah , right.Other than a short plot about figuring out she was a wolf -- and that took her only a few pages to accept -- and a short threatening scene which she handled with that Alpha voice , the rest of the book was about sex . In fact , I 'm pretty sure that was the entire reason the publishing company chose to publish it -- as a soft-porn venture with a little , very little , plot thrown in . The company is Samhain . They do have an amusing website . Apparently you can get anything in romance that you desire . They list categories of romance comedy , contemporary , fantasy , gay-lesbian , historical , horror ( I ca n't imagine a horror romance . ) , inspirational ? ? ? ? , interracial , suspense , time travel , and western . Everything that is except a well-written book ? I plan on checking publishing company names and avoiding anything from them in the future .	-1
UNLESS A BOOK IS PART OF A SERIES I DO NOT LIKE WHEN THEY REEL U IN SO U MUST BUY THE NEXT ONE BIG TURNOFF FOR ME	-1
I really liked the idea behind the book , but got really bored reading the book . Even if I had read the `` real '' book instead of the excerpt from the Kindle Download , the way she wrote and what she wrote just really bored me .	-1
I read the entire `` book '' which is the only reason I did n't give it one star . Apparently this prequel to other Rachel Vincent books in this same genre is supposed to explain some of the backstory and entice the reader to want to read more . If so , it does a terrible job because nothing is really explained and I had zero desire to read any further in this storyline.I disliked the teen girl protagonist 's attitude throughout the short book , although I think she was a reasonably accurate picture of the extreme egocentricity , wild mood swings , annoying sarcasm , and lack of rational thought exhibited by many teenagers today . I 'm the father of two female teens so I 've got quite a bit of experience with them . She may have been accurately portrayed but she was n't sympathetically portrayed and as a result I could not care less what happened to her .	-1
More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ http : //littlepiecesofimagination.blogspot.com/I jumped into this series without knowing that much about it . People were gushing and raving about this series everywhere and I just could n't look pass it anymore , so I had to see what it 's about.Kaylee is at the mall with her friend Emma and they 're trying to figure out a revenge plan on Kaylee 's ex as well as shop for homecoming . Then all of a sudden Kaylee feels the urge to scream the heck out of her , because she sees shadows creeping upon a child in a wheelchair and when she starts , she does n't stop . The next time she 's conscious Kaylee realizes she 's been commited to a mental hospital . How did it happen and how , when and if she can leave is up for you to find out.The first half of the prequel was intriguing , but I could n't read more than 5 pages tops every night . My eyelids grew as heavy as rock and I felt like this book did n't attract me at all . I found this whole situation rather confusing and this mental institution just pushed me away even more.However , after complaining about it on Goodreads , I gave myself a promise to finish this ASAP in order to finaly start the real book . I was glad I did , because as soon as I started reading it got interesting all of a sudden . The last ten pages were fantastic and I 'm anxious to find out more . If it 's anything like the second half of the prequel I 'll read it with pure pleasure !	-1
This book was bad on every level.The plot was pretty much nonexistent . There was a small thread of `` escape Bedlam '' that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way . From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes ( really ? hours after meeting a filthy , epileptic crazy man she is `` tiddling '' on the floor of an insane asylum with him ? really ? ) interspersed with , well , not much more.The hero was a sniveling , blushing `` genius '' with no real depth . If he blushed or `` brushed away a tear '' again I might have had to break my kindle . The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze . Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met , not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay , for a cheap kindle book , but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read . The H & h 's soliloquies of `` love and devotion '' were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through . We get it , they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other . There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending . I know there were tears and `` happily ever after '' with the promise of more to come -- -not for this reader though ! -- after a silly chase scene where it all `` came together '' and all made sense to everyone -- -not ! The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains -- -none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad , but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it .	-1
I was disappointed . At first the book was too full of raw brutality for my tastes ( man eating parts of a woman while she is still alive and restrained ) . As I was about to quit and started skimming over the story it turned around somewhat . It is not sophisticated writing , nothing of the quality of a Stephen King , just raw animal brutality that turned into a simple B-movie type story . Half way through the book the story ended . I would guess this is maybe a 30-minute read , if that . The rest of the book that I paid for was an interview with the author which was just advertising for the rest of his books . A very long advertisement I must say , that should have paid for this simplistic story . I 'm sorry I paid 99 cents for this and will remove it from my library , the fist time I 've ever done that with a Kindle book that I bought .	-1
I downloaded this title when it was offered as a Kindle freebie . Unfortunately the free offering could n't even get me through to the end . I found the writing to be a cross between a bad Disney channel sit-com and a bad porno movie . The description mentions cheesy - yes , it is.I realize that Samhain titles are steamy and if a title is marked as erotica it will contain sex scenes . That was n't the problem . I 've read some good erotica and sensual romance . There are plenty of well written titles to pick from . This was n't one of them.Vivi Andrews has a few other titles that are getting much better reviews . I will give her another try .	-1
In a sort of Romeo and Juliet spirit , Sydney ( Juliet ) , from a hunter family , falls in love with Jason ( Romeo ) a werewolf . She has dreamed of him over the years and meeting Jake in person , she falls in instant lust . They consume their relationship pretty quickly and he bites her , therefore starting her transformation into a full-fledged werewolf.Meanwhile , her father keeps trying to get her to hunt and kill werewolves.The hunters , who know full well the wolves they are trying to kill are human , are shown as uneducated rednecks , whose collective IQ is less than 100 . The werewolves are not much better . Why they would want to run wild in the woods when they know they 're in danger is never quite explained . One would think that they would have leaned to control their instinct in order to survive . Or at least do something to stop the hunt ( politics , law-making and media relation anyone ? ) But there 's worse . The relationship between Sidney and her father is unhealthy and made me cringe . She 's an immature little girl looking for Daddy 's attention and he does not listen nor takes her feelings seriously . Pathetic.I did not find anything funny about this story and recommend you skip it .	-1
I really like James ' books . I think I 've read them all . This just was n't as interesting . It felt flat without as much characterization .	-1
I hated the characters , a whining virgin who after being chased and almost forced does a 360 and has a threesome ! One guy is a bully and the other is his `` honey '' . You get what you pay for	-1
It felt rushed as if there was no time for them to actually get to know each other . Plus , only a few sex scenes which failed to impress . A bore .	-1
I understand it 's religious fiction but it was condescendingly preachy . If any religious zealots know of a girl pregnant or with a child out of wedlock this is the handbook they would give to them to make her feel as low and bad as possible about her big bad 'sin ' . She feels the need to publicly confess her sin . Just give them the avenue they need to stone you Vivian . That is ridiculous ! Billy is a nice man but he 's too preachy . Lessons about God can be given without copy/pasting scripture . As a Christian , this book made me sick and ashamed like I am when I see people who claim to be Christian and do nothing but judge and judge other people . This is the nauseating type of Christian.Vivian has a baby out of wedlock and is always thinking she 's about to be smite down for her grave sin . The relationship between her and her baby is weird . Sure she was raised in an orphanage from 14 to 20 but still . EVERY woman knows you breastfeed a baby . How she never clued in that the baby needs to be breastfed is ridiculous . Billy notices but never mentions it.She did n't act like the baby 's mother and she even mentions having a friend at the orphanage who was good with the babies . Well , Marie sure did n't tell her anything about babies because even monkeys have better natural parenting skills . They say if baby is lost in the jungle a monkey would be the best protection for them . But Vivian does n't even have monkey sense as a mother.That and WAY TOO PREACHY . If you want a great religious novel about forgiveness and coming to terms with your past and realizing that God loves you READ Heart of Stone : A Novel by Jill Marie Landis . It 's religious but not preachy . THIS is preachy .	-1
This book sucks . Save your money . If you purchased this book like I did can we join together & sue for pain and suffering .	-1
I really enjoyed the first book in the series , but this entry just fell flat for me.I felt as if I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened . Tanner and Maddie just did n't have the chemistry that Charlie and Brittany had . The sex scenes were a bit rote and their conflict was very easily resolved . I 'm not ready for love . Oh , you want love ? Okay , I 'm ready to love again ! ) .I 'm a fan of Erickson , so I 'll continue to read her work -- I think was just a case of this not being the right book for this reader .	-1
Just as I said with One and Only , the first book , this was a short read . However , unlike the first book , I suffered through it . I was done with it about halfway through and only finished it because it was short and I felt that I needed to get to the end in case there was something there to redeem this series for me . Sadly , I did n't find this elusive redemption.Same as One and Only , I think that if you read the synopsis above , you can just skip the book , unless you want to read about some vampire sex . For me , because the character and story development was so lacking , I could n't get into the sexy parts ... I did n't really care , because I could n't feel the connection . They were each others ' destined mates and so everything was pretty much instantaneous for them , just like Atticus and Lissa . As soon as they had sex they knew they loved each other and that was that . No struggle or anticipation . And , honestly , the lovey parts read like this to me : he was all like `` I love you ! '' and she was all like `` I love you ! '' and he was all like `` I love you more ! '' and she was all like `` I love YOU more ! '' And I was all like `` shut up and ... [ you 'll have to see my blog in order to actually see what I said here , cause it 's not appropriate for amazon - haydeereviews dot blogspot dot com ] . There were promises for dark delights that Marc was going to initiate Kelly into , but aside from a light slap on her ass nothing really outlandish happened.Okay , I have nothing against people proclaiming their undying love for each other . I really do n't . I just wanted to experience their love , not be told about it . That 's why we read these books - we want to feel something and aside from some mild irritation I ca n't say I felt much . I wished for some more struggle , more action , more passion ... just more.Let 's talk action . This is where I ask , what action ? ? There was supposed to be this big challenge with a rival , but again , if you read the synopsis then you read the details of the challenge and the fight . It was completely glossed over . I was disappointed . Which is pretty much how I felt about the whole story.To read more of my reviews go to haydeereviews dot blogspot dot com .	-1
If you enjoy M/M action , then you may like this book . Me , not so much . I truely wish the book descriptions were clear on this . I have a few Delilah Devlin books on my keeper shelf , but this is not one of them . I love her paranormal Immortal Knights series , but she seems to be expanding her story ideas . Male on male is so not my thing ! And the repeated image of ( how do I say this nicely ? ) two men in one hole has me cringing . Unfortunately she has been using this scene/act in a lot in her other books as well lately . Sorry Delilah , sexy it is not !	-1
I 'm a fan of Ms. R.G Alexander 's work . Ms. R.G Alexander is a talented author with a fruitful imagination . I purchased this book shortly after reading her `` Children of the Goddess '' series . Although i did n't have many reviews available to me before purchasing this book , I expected great things . Unfortunately i felt this book was a waste of time . I was less then impressed on the character development in this book . They just felt `` flat '' . I kept reading it expecting it to get better . The plot also left much to be desired . I was uninvolved as a reader and did n't care one way or another about Charli and her men . I would characterize this book as trash . The only reason i gave it 2 ( 1.5 not available ) stars was because i like the amazing race idea . It 's a shame the potential was never reached .	-1
This is a pretty nasty book . Honestly , I think some orifices are not meant to be filled.I came back to read the description to see if I had inadvertently downloaded a book that is clearly porn . Not the case . The description does not foreshadow the nastiness within . Rather it suggests it 's a run-of-the mill romance .	-1
I enjoyed the story up to a certain point , but when plausibility took a nose dive so did my interest . It was too much of a hackneyed deus ex machina plot device when what amounts to an invulnerable ground-skimming flying attack vehicle with everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink was introduced .	-1
Do n't get me wrong . I like a lot of Stormy Glen 's book but this one is definitely a miss for me . Sasha was suppose to be a mischievous and lovable character , I found him annoying at best . His sarcastic and cute attitude was did n't sit well with me . The sex was too damn much , it was in every page . I could n't finish this story .	-1
Usually , this type of book is right in the sweet spot of work that I love . It is a shame therefore for me to say that I just did not get this work . The book did not capture my enthusiasm either in terms of characters or the universe that was being portrayed .	-1
I love Andre Norton and to me she is the Queen of Sci-Fi . That being said , this is one of the first books I purchased for my original Kindle and I did n't realize that this book was a compilation of public domain novels that are available on Project Gutenberg . Knowing that these books were recompiled public domain novels , later I repurchased versions of these books that were properly edited and also looked at Project Guttenberg 's book list.As far as the stories go they are great but I was disappointed to find incomplete series of novels presented and that it included genre other than Sci-Fi . I did give the stories 5 Stars but as far as the book is concerned I give it 1 Star . I am now much more careful when I purchase older material . I am surprised that Amazon allows public domain books to be sold in their store.In Andre Norton 's favor , I still love her work 50 years after I read it the first time !	-1
I had a hard time finding it sexy and with as much bed hoping and clownish behavior going on I some how found it all just a bit boring . I was disappointed .	-1
The dialogue in this book tends to be rather simplistic . This book would be improved if the punctuation and usage errors were corrected . The author should become aware of the difference between PIQUE and PEAK . He also should learn more synonyms for SAID . ( I read the book before it was re-edited , so I do n't know if any of these problems have been corrected or not . )	-1
Keeper of the keys I give 2.5 stars . I nice quick read.After winning the lottery and a new man has come into her life and life is good . Kai finds out she has AIDS at 32 years old with a daughter 7 years old .	-1
Ctales Publishing should hire me as an editor . My qualifications ? Let 's count them:1 . I understand the proper use of commas , colons , semi-colons and periods.2 . I understand that , when conversing with each other , people do not say `` I am '' or `` it is '' . They say `` I 'm '' and `` it 's '' . This is especially true in high stress situations.3 . When writing , I know to identify the subjects of a scene with a break in text or a completely new chapter . The writer tended to shift to new scenes by starting new paragraphs with zero indications that the scene was shifting.4 . I can frigging spell ! ! ! ! More specifically , while using any decent word processing software , I recognize the significance of the red , squiggly lines under words.5 . Notice , there are zero run-on sentences in my review.I truly enjoy post-apocalypse-world stories however , if this is what passes for acceptable writing , I weep for our literary future.As for the characters , Dora , Tim and Mary would not survive more than a week in my zombie bunker . I 'd shoot them in the knees , throw them outside and ring the dinner bell . All three would make acceptable zombie bait . Please , do n't think me cruel and heartless ; I 'd graciously end it before they turned.Paige could stay because she became an asset over time.Does anyone know what Mike 's fate was ? I lost track of him during the confusing combat scenes and run-on sentences .	-1
I have enjoyed other books written by this author but this book was n't up to par . The angst felt contrived and over-blown . I felt like screaming as the 'solution ' to ensure their HEA was so freaking obvious . Aside from that there were some minor consistency issues ( M wearing contacts one minute and his glasses falling off later in the same scene ) which made me twitch with annoyance . I just could n't enjoy this book at all . It felt too formulaic and I did n't feel the author 's passion or interest . Disappointing .	-1
This just was n't a great read at all . J.L . Langley has been a favorite author of mine since I read Without Reservations and I expected His Convenient Husband to be just as good , but it was n't . While I might not be completely into the cowboy trope like the other readers I have enjoyed it on occasion ( so it 's not that ) , but this one just felt like a cliched , by-the-numbers plot . It lacked any kind of interesting qualities and missed the sexual chemistry between Micah and Tucker by a mile . I like her other books immensely , but this will be quickly forgotten for her other entertaining books .	-1
I have never give two stars to an author before . I have given one star for badly written books , with typos and spelling and grammatical errors . I am mainly disappointed by the length of this book . I hate , hate , hate being deceived and that is what I feel happened here . I paid for a full length novel . Instead the story ended 83 % , according to my Kindle . The rest was samples of other books . Gee I can get samples for any book on Kindle for free , I should n't have to pay for a novel with nearly 20 % of samples . The story was so so . It did n't have enough angst for the MC . It was well I loved you but I left anyway but now I am back so all is well . By the way Duncan is a bad guy , oh wait he suddenly realised he not so bad but bye bye and everyone lives happily ever after . ( Sarcasm here ) I have bought 3 other books from this author , but I am going to get my money back on this one and not buy any more . Because I hate being taken advantage of when looking at the number of pages I am buying and is cheated .	-1
This was kind of off . Did n't quite end the right way . something was lacking in the character department . This was odd on so many levels.there was some points in this book that was pretty good but overall it really comld have been a lot better .	-1
This story was over before it started . The story starts off with this queen who has so many traitors in her midst and the guy is on top of that list . He quickly seduces her into a boring , too quick sex romp and then the story is over . This story took about 7 minutes , but the excerpts from countless of other stories they want you to buy took much longer , about what this book should have been .	-1
This tale left me wanting ... it turned out to be a `` wham , bam , thank you ma'am '' for the most part . The story was so short that there was no time for character building or background or rhyme or reason . I did n't really find it `` steamy '' or `` erotic '' , so other than the author 's ability to portray the time period adequately ... there really was n't much else going for this one . Sorry , but it only rates two stars with me .	-1
It had potential but never got there . I 'm glad I did n't pay for this . Just an essay so the author can promote her other books . Unfortunately due to the lack of being able to hold my interest in this essay I do n't think I will be reading anything by this author anytime soon .	-1
This is really just a political statement , albeit one I agree with . It is fraught with unbelievable characters and in the end one immorality is substituted for another . It is not a mystery , not a thriller , merely an overblown ( pun intended ) statement of a position .	-1
The story starts strong with a classic Noir set-up ( woman walks into dive bar looking for her lost sister and gets a big dose of trouble ) , but does n't proceed strongly from there . The relationships between the characters are unclear . Every character seems to be a stereotype of some sort . The realism factor is missing . The ending is unclear . With a stronger editorial hand , the author could have had something here . But it takes more than visits to dive bars , missing women in peril , and characters who live on the wrong side of the law to make a good Noir story .	-1
I thought this book would help improve on my digital skills . Not the case . The author gives a few good pieces of information ... but very few .	-1
The grammatical , spelling and formatting errors were distracting . Being new to my DSLR I am always looking for good books to help learn to be more proficient in my hobby . I appreciate the pictures to help illustrate the subject matter . This is an okay book for beginners like myself . I would give it more stars , but the author states she is a & # 34 ; writer and photographer & # 34 ; , leading me to believe she should have proofed her work MUCH better . For instance , the very first page starts with the first letter on one line and the rest of the letters on the second line . Then further down the page , there is a square at the end of the sentence . A little further , a misspelling . That 's just on the first page . The information is good , the & # 34 ; writing & # 34 ; is not .	-1
So basically this book is about a girl whose in to baseball players . She 's with 4 of them throughout the whole book then suddenly picks one of the guys within the last 4 pages of the book .	-1
Not worth the price for only 65 pages . This was my first book by this author and will be my last . The story line was so different from other books of this type , and I had high hopes , but was disappointed . Reading other reviews , I see this is a series , and the rest of the books that follow are a lot better . Unless the author offers a book from this series for free , I wo n't be taking a chance .

nothing special but nothing bad either . a harmless read when you have nothing to read and it was freeskip it	-1
This book needs serious editing . There is too much repetition and misuse of words . ( Cohorts instead of cahoots , for example . And per say ? Really ? ) I also felt the writer does not have a good understanding of the age group she is working with . Fifty-three year olds are not as decrepit as she makes them out to be and not likely to be wearing french-twist hairdos . The villains were a bit too stupid to be believed . Background information is presented in such a circuitous way , the reader has no idea what the point was . Aggie moved from England to Palm Springs to be with her daughter . No . wait , she moved with her friend Betty because of Betty 's cousin . Betty 's cousin and Aggie 's daughter both happen to be in the same place . Aggie moved and bought Betty a condo ( so she would move , too ? ) The writer needs to figure this out , write it down and refer to it from time to time .	-1
I felt that this book could have been better suited to teens and/or young adults . Not enough depth to even bother finishing it at this time . Maybe at a later date I 'll look at it again .	-1
The quick description on my Kindle made this book sound good to me . As I started reading it I got bored by a third of the way through . Every paragraph seemed to be saying the same thing . It 's as if the author was obligated to write a book with a certain amount of words and thats all it was ... .boring words . The story moved too slow . I would not recommend this book . There are others in the same genre that are much better .	-1
If this was a short story to draw the reader into the series - it FAILED big time.Nissa goes to a Vampire club because she wants sex with a vampire and to ultimately become a Vampire herself - ( maybe because she is lonely , not really explained ) . The author tells you that Nissa is drawn to the club and to Hex & Aleron . The reader is then told after days of having sex in every way possible in a menage that love now exists . At that point - all I could do was think - well , that 's nice - did n't ever feel the love but whatever.I like stories with a high `` heat '' factor but I also want well-developed plots with interesting characters and interactions.In this novella : - Dialogue was flat- Characters one dimensional- No originality- The plot is ? ? ? ? ? - not sure if there is one- Sex scenes read more like a `` how to '' book than an erotic scene- Rushed HEA - they had sex and then the reader is told that they are in love - did n't really feel itThe short story was mostly pages after pages of the three having sex but I would describe it as just graphic rather than erotic and definitely not sizzling . If you want a very short `` how to '' book on a few of the different ways to have sex - then this book is for you . Not very imaginative but it does contain some of the standard ways found in countless of erotica books that are more original and better developed .	-1
Bringing very little to the staple Vampire stories.The beginning looks promising , untill Two enters the vampire scene , but then it goes downhill and really is a bummer to finnish , because the action is slow and the vampire 's flashbacks are very tedious.I am not particularly keen on vampire boks , but , seeing that this one was for free , I thought that a guy who offers his book really would have somethinhg different to show to the world.No . My mistake.I wo n't , however , give it a one star review , because I respect an author who has no qualms about offering his work .	-1
This was odd throughout the whole story.I did n't understand what the plot was supposed to be about.The characters were one dimensional and had no personalities.The story was confusing and nothing made any sense .	-1
First off , the main character bothers me from the beginning . What a snooty , condescending woman . Her dealing with her so-called Alaskan clients is the most disturbing of all . What kind of a real estate agent ( yes , I do n't care you hate being called that ! ) lets clients sign documents that allow no inspections and free rent from the original owners for a year ? I do n't condone violence , but she truly deserves the beating ! And her hating Tiffany Reynolds for & # 34 ; screwing & # 34 ; people to get to the top ? Come on ! She does exactly the same to get her hands on that mansion ! The mystery itself is stupid ! First , you do n't get to the so-called mystery till almost one half of the book really . And the culprit and reasoning behind it is dumb ! A real waste of my time . Good thing I downloaded for free .	-1
I generally like to complete reading of any books I get but this was not interesting to me.I had to delete after three chapters , I do n't care who did it !	-1
The book was moving very slow . I finished the book because i wanted to know who did it . The book did get better about 3/4 of the way through .	-1
I really did try to take this all into context but just could n't . It was ignorance like this that left amazing cultures so broken , filled with alcoholism , lost tradition and domestic violence . This dude should have been trying to learn the sacred ways . Only my opinion .	-1
I should read the title eh ? I thought it was his works , but it was just the TOC and Index . That 'll teach me to pay more attention next time , eh ?	-1
Bought ths book and then I found out about this blog that took materials from the official church website and converted them to MOBI format . And the best part ... it 's free . If I could I would rate this 0 stars . Someones trying to pickpocket you , so do n't fall for it . Here 's the link nk : ldskindlemobi.blgspot.com	-1
I read the reviews and many of them praised the `` science '' and `` research '' that went intoPeak Erectile Strength Diet , but after reading this short , interesting tract I can find neither science nor research on these pages . There is nothing here but bold , unfounded assertions based on the typical social justice meme that seeks to perpetuate the lifestyle of subsistence farming peasantry at the cost of everything modern and everything truly scientific.The recommendations that so many people praised with such blissful closed-minded endorsement are pretty simple:1 . Exercise more2 . Eat organic foods3 . Become a vegan or as close to it as you can tolerateWhile these suggestions are indeed fitting and appropriate for the descendants of French , Indian , Chinese , and Spanish peasants , the rest of us can not survive on such meager fare . If these ideas were so very helpful to the peasants , then why did they work so hard to abandon their ancient `` healthy '' lifestyles in favor of rebellion , destruction of the aristocracy , and modern living ? A vegan diet leaves a person physically weakened , emotionally impaired , and dependent on someone else for daily guidance . In short , it creates peasants and there is a profound move through the modern world to convince you and I and everyone they can reach that we need to become peasants who do nothing but slave away in the factories and commercial farms established by the modern elitists for the benefit of the elitists.Early onset erectile dysfunction is founded in genetics . It is the result of countless generations of humanity that did not live beyond thirty years of age because their world was violent and their climate harsh . While diet may , in some cases , have a minor impact on erectile function , it will never have the huge impact books like this one are claiming it will have . The reason a starvation diet and hard exercise can , in some cases , bring minor improvement to reproductive function is because it stresses the physical animal beyond enduring and forces the genes to seek to reproduce in a younger , stronger specimen.The suggestions in this book will be helpful , but they will not transform an impotent or semi-impotent fifty or sixty year old into a breeding stud capable of marathon sex sessions . Such claims are hyperbolic at best and downright deceptive at worst . It is a pleasant lie designed to convince men to abandon their core strengths and become mild-mannered urban dwellers who wo n't argue with police and will consistently vote for bigger government and more government intervention into their daily life.If you truly want to know why your body is failing at forty , then you need to be readingThe Selfish Gene , Principles of Paleontology , andHard Evidence : Case Studies in Forensic Anthropology.The one thing the writer does get right is that replacing the candy bars and ice cream in your diet with dried fruit and dry roasted nuts will do wonders for your emotional life , your physical life , and your sex life . But that 's a far cry from abandoning your morning bacon and eggs in favor of powdered maca root/cocoa smoothies with a side of green tea .	-1
This was far too short to develop a 'relationship ' with the story . I liked the idea , saw potential for more for this horror story about what happens after death .	-1
Rgua story was ok . Was n't awful ; had it 's semi erotic moments but I felt it kind of lost its potential and rushed to finish an OK 15 min read ... But not the best .	-1
was shorter than it should have been . I liked the little I got of the characters personalities . Needed more writing .	-1
The truth is that I have not noticed this was Harlequin romance at the time of downloading . I usualy do not read romance books but since it already was on my kindle I decided to give it a try during my vacation . Well - I did finished it since it was quite a quick read . I never realy grew to like the main characters though . The female character Lorna was weak and strange while the male character James was so perfect that he sounded out of this world unbelivable . Anyway , this was an interesting experience for me .	-1
I tried this book on a free basis . It just did not suite my style of reading . It is worth a quick read .	-1
Could n't finish it . This is why I am giving it a one star review . I just could n't get into it .	-1
This story is a social farcical commentary on how the ongoing debate on abortion caused the US to fall into civil war . The storyline was consciously over the top describing the liberal and conservative path from public debate to public violence . The descent from heated public discourse into mass violence was short . The point of the author was clear , I just did n't find it very engaging . It was political/social commentary versus a future history in the model of Harry Turtledove or Heinlein .	-1
This book had nothing do with a Second American Civil war , it was mostly the writer religious view . Bad book .	-1
She never had anything traumatic happen that should make her dress frumpy the way she does . She had a car accident , that does not make you less of a woman because you think you can not have children . I think the hero , when he first decided to go for the heroine , seemed like he was playing with her for his own amusement . I would SERIOUSLY have thought this if I did not get his insight for a brief time or if he was not so caring at the very beginning . I am pretty sure he did not sleep with another woman since he met the heroine because he talks about cold showers over the months A LOT , even though he did go to events with other women . He just put her into the role of his wife and hostess without telling her ANYTHING and expected her to just know how he felt about her . Well here is a newsflash , telling the heroine that you have wanted her from the beginning sexually does not tell her you want to marry her . The heroine also changed COMPLETELY from the beginning to the end . She was a scared , easily intimidated woman at the start and goes to being a seductive , vixen type at the end . It was weird to see her change so much in such a short period of time because of a guy 's attention . I am not sure what the purpose of his friends on the yacht were . They did not have a significance with ANY decisions the hero and heroine made and they barely talked . It was all just annoying . I like this author and based on the reviews , really thought I would love this book ... .I did n't . I hate to say that but this one was not for me .	-1
Some bookswhich are advertised as Christian fiction are really not . This is one of them . The characters acted spoiled , controlling , and in my opinion just pretended to be Christians . This book was not well written and had many incorrectly used words . For example you 're instead of your . The repetition was very boring .	-1
I thought it 's a crime thriller . When & # 34 ; elves & # 34 ; were mentioned , I thought it 's a metaphor . But it turned out to be a supernatural novel with elves and a beast.There are some loose ends the author did n't answer . For instance , Izzy suspected someone was helping George to get in the building . Nothing was mentioned about it afterwards.Some plots are hard to believe . Why did the police not take the case seriously ? How did George and his car hide in a small village where almost everybody knew everybody else ?	-1
This was so boring I had to quit reading it - something I almost NEVER do . It seemed to go on and on and on and I was n't making any headway with the story . Felt like I had been reading for days and could n't get beyond the 20 % mark . Really a disapointment !	-1
Trite , uninteresting characters . improbable story line . Secret scientists who inject radioactive cells that give you telepathy mixed with the doings of the church pastor and community center ? .. send in the clowns ... there ought to be clowns ... .	-1
I read this book last week but did not leave a review at the time . I really liked the premise of it and tried hard to like the book . However , I could n't keep track of the characters and they seemed to just appear from nowhere . I felt I had missed a part earlier in the book where they were introduced and their story told . I actually went back looking for it the first time it happened . I decided to leave a review now because I just read a couple of other reviews that support my view . The similarity of character names combined with missing pieces of the story left me tired and disappointed .	-1
The novel may be missing sections in the kindle edition . Characters are put into play without clear introduction and the story jumps without transitions . On one page she is leaving to go to Gran 's , the next she is in bed having sex with her ex . I gave up a third of the way into the book . I was not interested in the characters and the story was n't engaging enough to warrant a greater investment of time .	-1
This work is a lead in to the author 's next piece in the series entitled , `` The Darkness '' and occurs after `` The Fury . '' I am not familiar with this series but after reading this piece , I have some interest in reading the full length stories . That being said , I was very disappointed over the misrepresentation of this work being a novella ( a short novel ) when it really is just a sample.The characters were interesting and the writing style easily hooks the reader and I will be looking for `` The Fury '' at my local library . I wish that Amazon would list Kindle literature more accurately since it 's very annoying to read a piece of work only to find that it is incomplete - a sample . I prefer knowing upfront what type of work I am reading ( novel , novella , sample or promotional piece of work ) . Just because this work was free does not mean it gets a free pass.I have read other lead ins ( like the one to Me , Myself & Why ? by MaryJanice Davidson ) that were Kindle freebies but were short self contained stories that prompted me to either read the novel or give it a pass . This work is more like a first chapter and not a self contained story .	-1
The story had potential but failed to deliver . The main character Elizabeth was weak , filled with self-doubt , selfish and annoying . She kept saying she was concerned about her 10 year old boy , but she constantly ignored his feeling in pursuit of her own desires . Even when a chain of events occurred that had the potential to change the course of his life . Then the one time that demanded her to be selfish she could n't make the right decision until she hurt the person she now loved.I struggled to get through it . Good luck if you decide to purchase .	-1
OMG , WTF and all the other short hand language that is used to say no . I truly hate not finishing a book but in this case I 'm ok with it . The names are wacky , the language is difficult plus the start of the book is dry . This book was drier than my sister -in-law 's turkey and she cooked it for 12 hours ( poor bird ) . If you need something to put you to sleep then this book is just what you need .	-1
As the author suggested , I read this one after I read THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS.This novella prepares the way for TAC . What it actually is , is one sexy scene after another.I did n't like Stephan in this nearly as much as I liked him in TAC without his memory.There was also the plot flaw of the children . They are barely mentioned here , and in TAC it is stated that Emily has been their mother from the day of Victoria 's birth . Not so here ... they are apparently in the care of a governess ... elsewhere.But if you are looking for a bit of sexy times , this is a good choice for you .	-1
Yet another book that is marketed as BDSM yet you need a magnifying glass to find the kink in this one.It 's a sweet little fluffy tale but so implausible that I ca n't really recommend it . If you want a 30 minute read that does n't strain your brain then this is the short for you . If you like a believable plot ; decent character development ; & a realistic development of the relationship ; this is n't the book for you . Not dreadful but definitely forgettable.Originally posted on Goodreads.com	-1
I could not make it through this book . It just did not hold my attention and I actually went to sleep while trying to read it . Thank goodness it was a free download ...	-1
[ ... ] Have a look at the link above and you 'll see that you can legally download all of these titles for free . Volunteers worked hard to transcribe all of these and whoever put this `` collection '' together took advantage of their work and added nothing to it.Any book from before 1923 is probably on Project Gutenberg .	-1
I bought this item when i first bought my kindle dx ( i LOVE my kindle dx ) after having it for a little over 4 months i noticed it cracked my kindle dx and its so not worth the $ 40 i paid for it , i had to go and buy another case for my kindle and only paid $ 15 for it and its not ruining my kindle .	-1
For the record : I like spanking romances . I 'm not one of those people who reads one and does n't know what she 's getting into.This historic novel is what is called magical realism . It is set in the real world but has magical elements . I like magical realism.I went back and forth on liking this one . I feel like a lot of these novels are really anti-women 's rights . I do not think that historic novels or DD ( domestic discipline ) romances have to disregard women as intelligent creatures so much . I do not think that BDSM , DD and all of that has to disregard feminism . In fact , in real life it rarely does and if it does it should be avoided.The fact that the main character is a strong woman who was born in the wrong time is fine . It makes sense that she would be beaten every time she expressed an opinion . It was awesome that she was so strong and capable but still feminine . I liked that she was able to earn some respect.The things that bothered me about this book were these : -The men in it were unrealistic pigs . They did not act like gentlemen would have acted at the time . A man of that time would have acted like a gentleman in public and the fact that he was chastising a woman would not have been publicized like it is in this novel.-Her brothers were abusive monsters.-The men acted like the main character was some horrible brat when all they needed to do was reason with her . Seriously , a polite explanation as to why she should n't do something would have gone a long way . In fact , some politeness somewhere , anywhere in the book would have been appreciated.-When she proved herself they still refused to allow her some leeway.-All the men were bullies except one and he did n't get the girl.-The characters were all fairly unlikable . If I 'm going to read a cheap romance novel I want to like the characters . The point of cheap romance novels is wish fulfillment . Literary fiction is for disappointment.-The men in this story at some point just decided that they would be unreasonable for no reason . The author was using those instances to get to the next spanking scene . However , it made it really hard to like the male characters.-The main character was smart but acted like a moron . At some point she needed to figure out how to act and how to get her way.-At one point the main male character lied to the heroine and tricked her . Then acted like he was in the right.-The thing that bothered me the most was that at the end the heroine tried to implement a change that would have advanced women 's rights . She was beaten by her husband until she promised to recant that move . Of all people her husband should have supported her . What she was asking for was not unreasonable and the king was willing to grant it.Anyway , if all you read these for is the sex and the spanking scenes you will enjoy it . If you actually want to read a decent story look elsewhere .	-1
The story line has been interestingly mediocre , but I have kept reading through the third book . Still , he needs a dictionary . He uses `` your '' for `` you 're '' , `` peak '' for `` peek '' , `` here '' for `` hear '' , etc , etc , ad nauseum . Get the man a proof reader !	-1
I started this book with great hopes . They were dashed on the rocks with tremendous force.This story was so predictable that I had to laugh out loud while reading . As I read the book , I could easily envision where it was going and how it would get there . I 'd turn a couple of pages and there it was ! Just the way I would have written it myself.Even the ending was so trite that I 'm surprised the friend / husband of Maria was n't named Joseph or Joe . That would have turned this into an out and out parody of the birth of Jesus . It was so close to that already it could have been written by Bevis and Buthead . The author should be ashamed .	-1
I think that this author may eventually learn how to write . I hope so because she has a great imagination . I did finish the book , which is saying something , but it was a stretch . Her characters are shallow shadows of a well developed character . They story line was jumpy and inconsistent . The ending was dreadful . I hated it . It seemed like she was out of ideas and just cut it off . The bad guy became a hero in one paragraph . I know that logic is not a strong element of fantasy but this book was worse than most in that regard . I gave it two stars instead of one because I reserve one star for books I simply can not finish .	-1
This was a collection of stories from an author I have not read before.which means I did not pick the story or writing style . This style of writing is not my preferred style to read , which is not fair to the author .	-1
This book reads like the work of a talented teenager . It lacks any evidence of writing belong a high school essay . Emotion on the part of the main character consists of getting upset stomaches . Chapter five seems to be a rewrite of a similar chapter in McKinley 's 'The Blue Sword ' . Perhaps the author will someday develop the ability to write at a professional level , but there is no evidence of it here . Others have complained of the editing . I see no issue with that in the version I downloaded . 99 cents may be two high a price to pay for this book .	-1
I bought this after I read the Fey ( which I ENJOYED ) . At first I found the characters interesting and it held my interest.I really thought I was going to enjoy the story . I was mildly surprised to see the cast of the Fey in this series . Maybe I should have guesses by the title that it was going to leave me hanging.That 's why the low rating . If you do n't mind waiting for the sequel , then it 's an OK read .	-1
This book reads like something written by one whose first language is something other than English ; awkward sentence structure and poor word usage run rampant , and this tends to further slow the already crawling plotline.What 's worse is the plausibility of character actions and events gives this novel the inescapable feel of a work geared towards children , despite any allowance for the setting being a fantasy world of magic.In short , another poor and seemingly rushed attempt to capitalize on the success of `` Harry Potter '' , and one that should be labeled 'Young Adult ' .	-1
While this book is a quick read and decently written , I feel like there was one page of story for every 5 pages of sexual scenes . Maybe I am just not into that type of novel , not to mention Vampires are overdone . Definitely will not be buying the sequels , mainly because I do n't see how this has anything to look forward to plot wise . However , if you are looking for raunchy sex scences page after page this may be the book for you .	-1
I know this is the first book in a trilogy , but as such , I expect there to be enough material to understand the basics of the story ! In this first story , I was very confused my the different characters , aside from the main two ( Zyra , Molly ) . The basic plot and understood it was that Molly had something and Zyra was going after her . This story had a lot of loose ends which were not described well enough to make sense . The action scene was written horribly , full of overly technical terminology and too much detail . Aside from the weak cliffhanger ending , there 's nothing here that made me feel like continuing the trilogy .	-1
At first , I thought the book is a good read but after a few pages , I could n't quite get what the whole book is all about . I understand that the author has his `` own '' way of writing , but this one got me really bored . The whole story is going off on all different directions , which tends to confuse the reader which usually results to loss of interest.The book is dissected in different sections , and lots of different parts that introduces one character or a single event on the book , it makes the book very uninteresting to read .	-1
I did not like the flow of this book . I felt like there was too much going back and forth . It did not keep me grounded .	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . I expected it to be written from a real life experience . Did not enjoy it at all .	-1
There was not a nice build-up or chase to this relationship . The heroine , while likable/admirable , quickly succumbs to the alpha wolf . I like the thrill of the chase ! There was n't one here and instead the author has waaaayyy too many sex scenes - too much of it makes it boring . My interest in the story actually perked up on the assassination attempts that 's how flat I found the romance . The story got really weird with the menage and the admitted orgies between mated partners - really turned me off as it cheapened the whole idea of a true mate . I did appreciate that gay relationships were represented .	-1
I have been reading PNR for a few years now , and I can usually devour a book in a day or so . This one took me over a week ... .. it was n't horrible , but it was n't good either . There was something off about it . I think the biggest problem I has was the h , she seemed to piss me off . I 'm not sure if was her attitude while she was `` kidnapped '' or after she come to accept her life . I guess she came off as bitchy through the whole book , and not in a good way.Also , I think that toward the end the book was skipping several months , then years . The whole someone trying to kill her , taken a back seat through the whole book , then was resolved in a matter of pages at the very end.The sex was a little boring ... . except the whole Ryan and Phillip scene , that was hot.This book was n't the worst I have ever read , but it definitely was worth the money I paid .	-1
I like a book with some sex . I like a book with plenty of sex . But I like the characters having sex to connect in a story before they jump into bed , or in this case the floor . I know it is a very short story and there is n't room for a lot of exposition but I can read free porn on the internet anytime . I read a book to get a connection between characters , emotional as well as sexual . These short sex stories just do n't and ca n't provide that.It is well written and if you just want graffic sex , then this might be the book for you . I need more .	-1
no plot no character just a free excuse for a couple of badly written smut scenes . not worth the time to read it	-1
Dear me ! The good points about this book is that it can be downloaded for only $ 2.00 and can be read in a little more than an hour . I see that there are two 5-star ratings that have been written . Is T. A . Chase a friend of theirs ? I found the writing puerile and totally lacking of any tension or drama . While sometimes nice endings are wonderful and there was one character ( great aunt ) you loved , this book is not even worth the [ ... ] for a download . Sugary sweet is all it is -- and I generally love gay romance novels !	-1
I really wanted to like this book . The theme should be one that I would enjoy . The problem is that the characters were not fleshed out enough and I did not care about them . It was also not believeable in nature	-1
I found this book to be disappointing and very poorly written . The characters lacked grit and testosterone . Story 's lacked depth .	-1
There is very little character development but lets face it how much can you get into 49 pages ? Obviously you can get in a lot of sex which seems rather second thought for the male protagonist . He is more concerned with punishing the female Protagonist and when he becomes aroused ... well might as well finish the encounter . There is spanking in this novella as well as a boorish Cash and a slutty Noelle . Noelle is so desperate to get sex from Cash that she will even risk it in the bar backroom where any one of his brothers can walk in and obviously they did view the event . The only nod to the holiday is the fact that Noelle rings a bell for a charity on the street corner . I 'm not likely to read this author again . Even for Free .	-1
So after reading this , I realized that this series would not be a series that I 'd be buying when they come out .	-1
I did n't get it have no idea what was going on it was like it started off in the middle of the book I needed more info . To get a better idea if I would even like the book	-1
Why bother to write at all ? this is really bad , especially when the house building stuff gets to be more interesting than the characters ...	-1
This is nothing but smut . I realize that erotic books are suppose to transport you to a different place , but come on , seriously would anyone meet a random stranger and then ( with out the aide of alcohol ) be having raunchy sex in a public place with them within 15 minutes ? And the ending of this book is completely off ! Poorly written . Waste of time .	-1
The story is about Alex , alley , and Taylor .Did not like . Just not my cup of tea . A threesome happy ever after story . Not for me	-1
I like a story with my sex scenes . This is a short that takes place in a 24 hour period ( give or take a few hours ) . No thanks	-1
This book was ok but to be honest for me there was too much sex in relation to the story . I like sex and kink but it has to fit in with the story and this I felt was sex heavy .	-1
Could n't get into this book . Sorry , maybe I will try again . Have too many other great books to read/review . I usually love the shifter books .	-1
It 's gay sex written for women who like M/M action . Things happen immediately - no one has any control or finesse . If you like that sort of Insta-Luv drivel then this might be a story for you .	-1
if there was a previous book it might have helped . i just did not enjoy the story . did n't like the characters	-1
I read all three books and they were entertaining but very slow to develop . Once you get where your being led you not suprised . I lost Intrest several times and had to leave it and come back . The good new is that it was no charge . I guess you get what you pay for	-1
Unfortunately did not like this book at all . I found the plot to be dumb , and the writing was sub-par . The ending was better than the first 3/4 of the book , but not worth the money paid . Sorry Rhyannon ! Normally I love your books , but this one should have been scrapped .	-1
