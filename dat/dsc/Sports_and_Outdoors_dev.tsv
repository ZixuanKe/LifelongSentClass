It looks and feels exactly like the one I carried in the military . Cover is a bit flimsier but this is a utilitarian piece at a good price . I 'm satisfied that I got what I ordered at a better price than I expected .	1
The Canteen is made in China . It 's just so hard to find products made in the US at a reasonable price .	1
well manufactured , nice outside pocket that you can put a magnesium fire starter in . Appears to be military spec and durable . Delivery was quick and the price was right .	1
used the pot to make a mountain house meal put water up to top rivet worked well the pot stayed hot for a long time though	1
These are perfect for trekking overnight . Light weight , carries ample water for 24 hours and the cup is perfect for cooking ramen noodles over a small camfire . Not bad at all and recommend for anyone who enjoys the outdoors	1
4 stars because of the smell from the canteen . It smelled like a petro factory . The cup was semi shiny and stamped china . the cover is insulated and snaps firm . After bleaching the canteen and letting air dry open , its time to bleach again . The side pocket is nice for adding some medilyte tabblets .	1
This is a good canteen , but it is plastic . Not sure how it will hold up , I also have a few stainless steel canteens . Will come bag and mark this down if it ends up breaking , but so far so good . Also the holder for the canteen is very sturdy and convenient .	1
Pretty good quality materials , cover is fuzzy and very warm . Not cheaply constructed . Canteen fits in the cup snugly and the cover snaps on .	1
Is advertised Correctly . Worth the money . It does the job . I do n't need anything fancy to get the job done . Fast delivery . Must buy for bug out bag .	1
I got this because carrying myCamelBak - M.U.L.E . Hydration Pack - 100 oz ( 3 L ) into church and the Movies worried people , after what happened in Colorado during that Batman movie , most think the hose is some kind of wired-trigger-mechanism for a backpack bomb . Nope , it 's just a hydration carrier.This is less noticeable , and does n't instill fear in people.It has a furry inside , an aluminum cooking cup , which I will not be using , because I do n't want to have some Aluminum end up in my body.It has MOLLE webbing on the backside , but with 2 metal ALICE clips , I do n't like them , because they pop off really easy.I 'd go withShort MALICE clips in Marine Coyote.The plastic flask is just like the one issued in the Army.The Buttons secure the jug firmly , yet pop off easy when youneed to access the bottle .	1
Great kit for the price . Not sure how long the cover would last in a SHTF scenario but it does come with clips to attach to a pack or other gear which would keep it off the hip area and from brushing against trees . The little pouch is great for fire starting kit . The cup would prove to be invaluable .	1
I left this item in the Jeep survival bag over the winter . It froze solid and I was so afraid that the plastic would split , it did not	1
Pros-Plastic is pretty thick.Doesnt leak.Seems to be pretty sturdy.Cons-I would like the carrier to be of a thicker material.The snaps on the carrier are pretty weak.It isnt military quality , but for a weekend warrior it should do the job.The carrier is the weak point.It is made of a light duty material and probably wont hold up to a lot of abuse.Also , it would be nice if the carrier was molle compatible.It comes with the old fashioned metal hook type thingy.I adapted it to work with my molle gear , but I shouldnt have had to .	1
Not much to say except a good price and works as listed ... the case does have a little insulation that would keep water cold . As it is plastic not for hot items . The cup is the reason I purchased this as it has many roles that it could be used for ...	1
I wanted an easily carried water bottle that I could attach to my belt when hiking , so this military type item seemed the logical choice . I was surprised at the quality of the bottle and metal cup and pleased with the way it attaches to my belt . It would have earned five stars if only it had been made in the U.S.A .	1
This product is made in China but it does n't seem to affect the quality . I bought one for each of my family members . These are just as durable as the one I was issued in basic training . Love the black color . It matches my VVV bug out bag .	1
Our son thought this was a great gift for his birthday , because he loves to go camping on his own and needs items like this so that he is well equipped for whatever adventures he embarks on . Thank you Amazon.com	1
I am so used to this piece of equipment . Water when you need it , hot or cold . Attached to my pistol belt , easy carry.Small pouch for water purification tablets , nice touch . Canteen cup for multiple uses , always handy . Leave it to the Military . With the canteen , pouch , and cup I will be much better prepared to eat n drink in style , plus easy cleanup .	1
Exactly what i wanted . Everything fits perfectly in its pouch . The pouch itself has a fleece lining on the inside which insulates the bottle keepin it cooler in the summer and unfrozen in the winter . The aluminum cup is perfect for boiling water . Overall it gets 8/10	1
I enjoy this a lot I put it on my bug out bag and it clipped on right away , it even has a pouch and I use it for my smith and Wesson pocket pal knife sharpener	1
This was a gift for my best friend . He is stocking up for whenever he might need items like this one.The canteen is a harder type plastic . It will not crush under normal pressure . It is strong . The cover is very nice . It even has a pocket for water purification tablets in the cover.If you 're looking for a sturdy canteen , look no further .	1
This is what it says , plain and simple . Good build , works just right . Cup is a perfect fit , as is canteen .	1
I love rothco product . always impressed by them . Not to mention a lot of it is made here in the USA . So I bought this little guy . Seems to be sturdy and will do just fine for my bug out bag . cant wait to test the aluminum cup inside . Gon na put this guy to use !	1
Exactly what you see . Works well , clean the canteen thoroughly before use . Do n't want to be ingesting plastic residues or other nastyness .	1
This exactly what I was looking for , reasonably priced , rugged , no leaks and a decent cover with no chemical smell or off flavors . The cover has a small pocket with a snap closure for iodine tabs and the cup should work well for heating soup or boiling water . Some reviewers have complained about the cover being less than stellar but mine seems well constructed and serviceable for a consumer grade product . This canteen is designed for camping and backpacking not combat and as such the cover should last several years of reasonable use , the canteen and cup should last forever sans major abuse . For the price I highly recommend it .	1
Got this for the cup . came a little dirty but overall good quality . I put it with my other canteen due to this one being a little cheap but still works good I use it as an extra one now . but over all great and would recommend .	1
The canteen is fairly solid , as is the cup . The cover and ALICE clips are a little chintzy , but I 'm not sure what you expect for such a small price ... Certainly not G.I. , but it keeps you hydrated !	1
Just as the title says you cant get anything better than this item . Water is your number one survival must have . This allows you to boil water in the metal container and store it in the canteen ... a must have and this product delivers .	1
I 've order two of theses both came . Theses were exactly like the product description said great quality and very good price . Thanks ROTHCO ...	1
For the price , it is a cheaper tin and the bottle has a strange smell to it that does n't go away . Serves it purpose and easily attachable to any EDC gear . I 'm not in love with it , but it does what it 's suppose to .	1
The case is ... ... so so but it has a Aluminum cup and a Canteen , i diffidently will suggest this . Has a weird plastic smell but wash it 2-3 times hot water and your good .	1
If you 're a frequent hiker and camper like I am this is a definite necessity . The carry-on pouch also comes in very handy . It 's very sturdy and durable as is the tin cup .	1
The way things are going with the world , there is a possibility that the economy could fall . I am doing what I can to get ready for anything , again , I hope I never need all the things that I am storing for a SHTF scenario..I got this because I do n't want to wish I had gotten one when I could have.. Besides , I camp and fish and hike a little..	1
great canteen , got it on my BOB , I do n't like the pouch for it , too obtrusive for me , and that little pocket is for what ? water tabs ? ammo ? I keep candy in it . winning	1
Really cool just what we were looking for .	1
Great price ... no leaking ... protective metal base ... no noticeable odor of flavor to the water ... decent outer cover ... got 2 of these for hiking & camping . Would definitely recommend - especially given the cost .	1
I like this set , the canteen is not as good as my issued mil spec one but it will do ( typical of made in China products ) , the cover is of decent quality and should last and set fits together well . I wanted to get another one but when I came back to write my review and order another I was shocked to find that not only was the set now fifty cents more but it is now plus another six bucks shipping so my fourteen dollar canteen is now more than twenty bucks ? Guess I wont be buying another .	1
Came fast and clean , perfect military replacement.Fits my large alice pack fine . Aluminum cup holds up to campfire cooking and water purification .	1
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the canteen , especially for it 's price . I had priced some others that were much higher priced , but this model will more than suffice . I 'd highly recommend it for a reasonable piece of equipment .	1
This is a great canteen at an excellent price point . I rinsed mine a couple of times before use and did not notice any funky tastes or smells . Cover is insulated and has some molle clips and loops . It also has a small pocket on the front , I guess for iodine tablets , which I never use , just boil water first in cup . It has worked well for me so far . The handles do seem a bit short so be cautious when removing from heat .	1
This canteen took me back many years to a less tranquil time . The cup will soon be suitably sooty but drinkable . We will be friends of that there is no doubt .	1
This item ( s ) : the canteen , canteen cover , and canteen cup are not mil-spec . However , having said that , they are of serviceable quality and are a & # 34 ; good bang for the buck & # 34 ; compared to the & # 34 ; real thing & # 34 ; .	1
I was very pleased with product , when I recieved the product it reminded me of the one I had while I was in the military .	1
for this price I expected it to not hold up well but I needed one in a rush and was low on funds ... . this product is a lot better then some of the ones my friends spent a lot more on	1
Using for my vehicle bug out bag . Water treatment tablets , coffee filters and if needed boiling should due the job in an emergency .	1
Well , its just as a wanted , and just as shown in that picture you see up there . My old man said he had one just like it in Desert Storm . He said you can even use the cup to cook over an open flame .	1
Man , When i got this , i thought it would be crap . Turns out , i been using it to replace Bottles i recycled by filling them up with water and reusing them . THis canteen , All i have to do is fill it up In the morning and most the time go all day without having to refill it . I love this bad boy and it really got a nice canteen cover and the inside is insulated , ( it aint just Cheap Canvas LOL like i thought it would be ) Keeping your water or drink cool . ITs very sturdy and the Canteen Clips onto the belt Nicely , Carried it one day quite a few months ago into walmart and didnt even notice it was there . EDC , yeah , i use it more than i realize , but the cup it comes with aint The best , it fits over the Canteen down inside the Carry case . I really like it and can not live without it as i tend to use it all the time . Get yours , You can take water any dad gummed place you please.UPDATE 4/10/2013Still in good shape . I still use it and took it with me on a hike , no trouble . It holds up and I like it alot . Still about the same as when i bought it back in november . A good canteen for replacing water bottles . But if you want to do serious hiking , Probably need a better canteen , but since i am a tightwad , I buy cheap S*** and Make it last as my Philosophy is that a Penny saved is a penny earned . EDC to carry water , Fine . EDC for the military or on a hike ? Maybe not a good Idea . And if i forgot to mention , It does not leak . I Usually down canteens that do and usually discard them . I have knocked this one over numerous times unknowingly and by the time I realize it i set it back upright but Still , No leaking whatsoever.UPDATE 11/4/2013Canteen still in Good condition . All in one piece , and Have drank water out of it since I got it back last winter . Nothing is broken , I have taken it everywhere , Done everything with it and its been by my side . I will buy it again 2 or 3 years down the line if ever I lose this one . INexpensive , and I got my moneys worth .	1
WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER FOR MY BUG OUT BAG . THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO IS THINKING . IF YOU ARE ON YOUR TOES AND ON POINT , THEN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD OLD FASHIONED CANTEEN . IT IS A MUST HAVE ... REALLY .	1
... when i was in the US Army . This looks and feels exactly like the set I carried when in the field . For the price , you get a decent product . It 's not heavy duty , but I really would n't want anything like that in something I have to attach to my BOB . Heck , even if you like to collect military memorabilia , this is for you too ! Recommended ? Yes	1
Great deal , great product . And great communication with ammo can man . Bought more stuff since. , competing company has n't a chance with these products . Very happy , and will order more stuff	1
It has all it said in the description and photos , all looks to be made of good quality and will work in the field	1
Being past military ... I wanted this for when the need arises , camping or emergencies.It arrived quickly and was packages well . It looks and feels almost like the one the government issued to me in the 80's.No complaints and I would purchase another if needed .	1
I utilize a lot of survival gear and this one is such a basic and essential piece . It is utilized every time and is one of my most used pieces . It is rugged and can put up with some serious punishment . The cup is mainly used for cooking up soups/boiling/heating . the canteen sits nicely inside the cup , which gives it added protection against blunt force ... simply but certainly one of my most used and most important of all my survival gear .	1
This was a gift for my Boy Scout . Although it is plastic , it is thick and durable . What I like is the cup that comes with it . I 've read other reviews that stated that they could not snap the holders . But , after carefully determining how to put the cup inside and the canteen under , they both fit and I was able to snap both . But , it was a bit tight . My only reservation was that it should 've had a little more room for the snaps . But , I was able to snap them both.There is a pocket for water purification tablets . I recommend this canteen . I 'm going to plan on buying another one , just for me .	1
We all need water.. and this here can hold it for ya . Couple rinses and no foul tastes . Cup is light weight , but does its job holding drinks or food , and can heat em both up on a stove or fire . We punished 3 sets of these for a few days of hiking and primitive camping and they lasted fine . The cover is also light weight.. synthetic fur/fuzz lined and the front pouch is good for a few purification powder packets and some drink packets or a single tablet bottle . If the liner is dampened ... it will help keep the canteen inside a bit cooler , but these dry out again much quicker than my old style heavy duty ones . Keep the fur dry in the winter to help your water not get too cold and/or freeze .	1
this is a good canteen I use it walk and to give my dog water walking . its built really good I use my canteen out side when it gets hot and hiking . it has pocket on the front side .I use it to carry a fire stater to heat water for instant coffee and tea . very good build cup just do ur homework . an be safe doing anything . I have been doing thing like a long time .	1
Good little product for the hiker in you . Just like the ones we used to use in the military and not that expensive .	1
nice little canteen cup . Fits in the canteen pouch with my canteen , and I can heat up water for coffee over the camp stove ... Great buy	1
This is a pretty decent cup to carry in your canteen pouch . I gave it 5 stars because as an aluminum cup it works great . It boils water well for dehydrated meals , coffe , or just purification with no problem . But aluminum does n't stand up as good as stainless steel does . So I 'd suggest going with a stainless cup for a few more dollars .	1
They are good and light and sturdy made like those made for the Army . A must have for any BOB .	1
Very comfortable , lightweight , moderately fitted & true to size running shorts . They 've been a godsend in the recent mid 90 's humid heat wave . I like the 5 '' ( small split ) inseam since it is less constricting than my other skimpy running shorts ; it allows freedom of leg movement without being limited only to running , they 're suitable for casual use . The interior key pocket is larger than most allowing for a key with or without a fob to be extracted without drama & the key wo n't irritate while running . The on seam pockets work well to carry dog scat bags while running with man 's best friend . They are unobtrusive when not loaded . I 'm 6ft tall , weigh 165lbs . with a 33in . waist & I run around a 6:15 min . pace for 4mile runs , 7 days a week . The medium fits me very well , not to blousy for my rather skinny 67 year old legs . I like the look of them on me & the ease of striding in them , I 'm gon na get another pair or 2 .	1
I use these shorts a lot . They are soft and comfortable , and the internal brief is also comfortable . The interior pocket is nice for the house key . I have even used these for short bike rides to the place I 'm going running without any problem , just do n't be afraid of showing off a little leg on the way there ! They have been through a few washes and have been soaked with sweat a few times but seem to be holding up very well and do n't show signs of wear .	1
Comfortable , fit well and provided the pockets I desired . Good length for me , not full on running shorts and not knee length baggies .	1
These are my new favorite running shorts . No chafe or binding . The key pocket is big enough to stash a hotel room key .	1
I have owned for 12 months now , comfortable , moves well with rider , good for cool weather ( 50 's ) , no signs of wear	1
The sizing was as stated and best worn with top under the thigh elastic bands of shorts . Material is comfortable and warm and makes the ride comfortable in 40 degree weather .	1
I normally wear a size 4-6 , and these fit me just fine . These can go on the outside of your bike shorts , so they are a little easier to roll down when you 're riding . The zipper is not long enough to allow you to remove these with bike shoes on , which is kind of a bummer , but overall , I still rate these leg warmers high . They are perfect for a 45 degree and up day .	1
I 'm 5-10 and 160 pounds and the mediums fit me to perfection . Nice and warm and they stay where I put them .	1
These leg warmers are a good fit and keep my legs warm during cold morning rides . The only problem that I had with this product was that the Sugoi label on the legs were peeling off when the warmers arrived in the mail and before they had been used . This had no effect on the performance but was aesthetically disappointing .	1
I would describe these as mid-weight leg warmers . I do n't think they 're designed for the coldest cycling weather but they 're perfect for my needs here in SW Florida where the coldest cycling weather is typically 50-60 degrees . They might be fine in colder weather but if it 's below 50 I use the trainer so these are untested below that . I bought size medium and the fit is perfect in both width and length . They 're tight enough to stay up but not so tight that they are constricting . The zipper at the bottom makes for easy on and off and the silicon at the top adds extra gripping which is nice . I 'm 5'9 '' and 152 lbs with long but very skinny legs and like I said , the fit is great . Interestingly , my wife wears these same leg warmers ( they 're unisex ) also in a size medium and she 's 5'8 '' and 121 lbs . They have a bend in them so you have to put them on in a certain way . This can be annoying when you 're getting kitted up in the dark while still half asleep but overall it 's a nice feature that probably makes these leg warmers more comfortable than ones without a bend . The fabric is soft , slick , and stretchy with a extra degree of softness on the inside and they look sharp . I also tried on a pair of Pearl iZumi leg warmers that were made of a thicker and warmer material that was n't as comfortable and was too hot for Florida . Furthermore , the Pearls did n't have silicon at the top so they did n't stay up very well . You had to depend on your shorts to hold up the leg warmers . That is not the case with the Sugoi . Overall , I highly recommend these leg warmers and if you 're cycling in cool weather you have to have a pair .	1
I really like the fit , feel and quality of these arm warmers . Each person seems to have their own threshold for cold weather , but I wear these in the high 40s to high 50s .	1
I bought these arm warmers for my first Ironman . The race is held Nov. 5th so the there was a chance that the bike leg could be cold and windy . Raceday morning was chilly , not cold , so I threw the arm warmers on until I warmed up . They did the job nicely . After I warmed up on the bike I still kept them on because they were n't overly warm , eventually taking them off at the bike special needs . They were small enough to stuff in my back pocket just in case I needed to throw them on that night during the run . On the run it did n't get cold enough for me to need them but knowing they were right there gave me piece of mind .	1
Build quality is excellent for the price . I am disappointed in the size . Buy a size up than you normally buy	1
SIZING : I am a slim 5'7 & # 34 ; 135 lbs , with average to thin arms , and the small fits perfectly , snug but not uncomfortably tight.Bought this to add flexibility during winter/spring/fall rides in Colorado , where the weather/temps change dramatically throughout the day . I wear a long sleeve shell during cooler rides , and put these on to bolster my warmth when the sun is covered or the temps start to drop.They are well made , with the silicon dimples on the top edge to provide solid stability and I have not had them slip down once . They are lined with a fleece like material that adds minimal bulk but definitely provides more insulation than a nylon/spandex shell . I keep these in my bento box rolled up ( small topeak bento ) and they fit in there easily , along with a cell phone and travel kleenex ( ALLERGIES ! ) .Does exactly what I expected it to do , and is much more flexible warmth than a heavier jacket . I do n't bike in less than 50 degrees if I can help it so these are untested below 50 degrees .	1
best gloves out of many that I have every had beforethey are warm and comfortable , seem durable , and wrist straps are a must ( or should be )	1
These are a pretty solid glove , with lots of features found on more expensive gloves.Following OR 's size chart the Larges fit me fine . They were a little snugger than I would have guessed but no problem at all , so if you are in between sizes go up one.Without the liner these kept my hands warm all day on the 30-40F ski slopes . I used snow seal on the leather to be on the safe side and they kept me totally dry . They are nearly impossible for me to put on and take off with the liners in , even using the velcro attachment . They seperate too easy from the fingers and get tangled up . So plan on putting on and taking off the liners independently . That was not a problem at all for me just a little annoying . I also wish the arm strap was a little longer and secured with velcro instead of the pull , as it came close to falling off a couple of times when i was quickly taking my glove off on the slopes.With the leather , palm feel was pretty good . If you have cold hands , expect to use the liner in anything under 40 degrees , as my gf tried them without the liners towards the end of the day and thought they were much too cold . ( Or maybe get the mittens . ) All in all the construction and build was excellent , and compared to my friends Hestras really seemed to hold their own , excepting the hestras better wrist cuff system and the difficulty putting on and taking off the gloves with the liner inserted . I threw some snowballs late at night in the 20 's and my hands were perfectly toasty after.The red looks pretty good in person .	1
Although I have not had the opportunity to test these for warmth , they are well built and make my hands start to get hot pretty quick . Per my commments in the title , I followed OR 's sizing guide and should have easily fit a large . But the only way I could get the outer glove on my hand was to remove the liner and have it on my hand before attempting wearing them . And even then , they were very snug so I ordered an XL that just arrived . They fit a lot better and the larges will be going back . As expected , I quickly received return information from Amazon and OR for a very easy return . I will update once we actually get some winter weather .	1
Nice flexible gloves , very light . Keeps my hands warm , note I only wear them for short durations , half hour at most , but my hands were freezing in Wisconsin cold in my other gloves . Problem solved .	1
Seem well made , warm and look great . Yes they are kind of a pain to put on as the liners bunch up but not a big deal . I got the XL 's and they are alittle snug ( compared to me Cabela gloves ) but again not a deal killer . I own numerous Outdoor Research products and have no complaints about any of them !	1
I love having the touch on all the fingers without having the stupid pads . They look like a regular cool pair of gloves but works amazingly well on touchscreens . The pinky finger and thumb is a little long but they still look and work great .	1
I bought these as warm driving/general winter gloves . They have some extra stitching loop at the tip of the finger that allows you to easily use any touch screen : from car navigation , cell phone , to tablet . Was also able to type fairly well in them on a keyboard . I love the tight fit nature of them , gives your fingers great dexterity and maneuverability for performing other tasks without having to take your gloves off and exposing your hands to the weather.I used them through an entire season exclusively . They did pretty well in the cold , wind , snow , and rain . They do n't seem entirely water proof , I 'm sure enough exposure will soak through - like most gloves . However I definitely had some fun in the snow with these without getting cold or soaking wet instantly . The only real con is they 're a bit expensive to take a gamble on , but they are by far my favorite glove I 've found so far ( usually pick up a new pair every year or two previously ) . I wore them down to temps around 0f and they were pretty comfortable , maybe with a thin glove liner too .	1
I followed the advice of all the other reviews and ordered large . It 's roomy . Maybe everyone else has a justin beiber or the hipster moptop hair-do to where they need a large . I do n't . But I still like it . I 'll probably try to shrink in the dryer or something .	1
Arrived on time , in good condition , functions as described . Does help keep the head warm , and the ear coverage is very valuable . The helmet-like fit does n't adapt to every head shape , however ( unlike a stretchy watch cap ) , so it can leave gaps that let cold air in . Certainly not a great choice for very cold days , but definitely takes the edge off , and extremely convenient to wad or fold up into a pocket . Can be worn under some types of helmets .	1
I have many hats , but really love this one due to its shape , thickness , color , and WindStopper.It is more than a thin beanie , but can easily be worn under a helmet.If you are after a hat in this form factor , get this one . I have hats from Arcteryx through North Face . The only time I would choose something other than this OR is when it 's not cold out .	1
I 've been using this hat for about ten years or so . Initially , I was skeptical , as it did not fit terribly tightly and the fabric seemed to have little stretchiness . The bottom edges are elastic and provide more of a closer-fitting & # 34 ; seal & # 34 ; ( though it is still an awfully loose & # 34 ; seal & # 34 ; ) along the edges . This adds to the hat 's ability to keep out wind and to keep ears comfy.This hat seems to have a near-ideal tradeoff of warmth and breathability . It is warm enough to wear when sedentary in a strong cold wind , while being breathable enough to wear during exertion . But if it gets too warm just take it off and put it in your pocket.I recently gave away my old Alpine and had the following experience when trying to replace it : - It seems awfully expensive ! But I found an inexpensive ( new ) one on fleaBay for $ 15.99 ( free shipping from China ) . This hat was materially different than the old standby . The new hat had an Outdoor Research tag attached to it talking about balaclavas ( which it is not ) . The sewn-in tag says that it is the Peruvian hat ( which it is not ) . The material of the new one is totally different from the material of the old one . The new one is stretchy and more soft and cuddly . The old one was both less stretchy and less plush . The new one is clearly designed to fit more tightly ( it stretches ) , while the old one was intended to fit loosely ( it did n't stretch much ) . The new one claims to have the WindStopper laminate , just as the old one did . I do n't know if this Chinese one is even a legitimate Outdoor Research product -- or is it an illegal & # 34 ; copy & # 34 ; ? Either way , I 'm liking the new one a lot too ( after only a few days of usage so far ) .	1
Excellent fit , size large fits my 71/4 sized head just perfect . It 's lighter than I expected but it also has the wind blocker material which seems to help with warmth . i have n't worn it in freezing temperatures yet but it 's worked just great for mid 40 's with windy conditions . Love the fact that it 's designed and cut to fit down over the ears . Worse case scenario I could layer this under a standard fleece or knit beanie for extra warmth .	1
as usual OR is holding its ' own , why ca n't all OR gear be made in USA ? The cut of this one IS GREAT for under helmet use .	1
I purchased the Kershaw Piston , because I was looking for a blade 3.5 '' , light weight , quality materials and made by Kershaw . Kershaw did n't have many knives in the 3.5 `` folding blade length range , that I liked but then I found the Piston.Thing I liked about the Kershaw Piston : +Light Weight+Speed Safe+Has a flipper to deploy the blade+3.5 '' blade+G10 Design+Sharp+G10 Durablity - no pocket wear and should take a beating+Kershaw Quality+Made in USAThing I did n't like about the Kershaw Piston : -Price - This should be priced more in the 45+ range-Small Belt Clip ( odd shape ) - did n't feel secure in pocket when carried ( flips and wiggles around ) .-Speed Safe - deployment seemed slower , because it 's such a large ( wide ) blade-Jimping on flipper would be nice to help with faster deploymentThis knife has a wider blade , so it 's a bulkier knife to carry in your pocket ( larger pocket clip would help with stabling it ) . Ergonomic seems off for to me to close and open it with one hand but this is n't ' a negative of the knife . The body of the knife should be able to stand up to hard daily use , due to the G10.This blade was n't the right fit for me , so I returned it . I actually purchased a Kershaw Blur which is a whole different story and review . I 've own many different Kershaw knives , but the Piston just could n't charm me .	1
Pros : Good traction on handleGood Blade MaterialFlipper DeploymentLight WeightUseful Overall Blade ShapeCons : Nothing worth mentioningFavorite EDC knife so far .	1
This is a well designed , larger , modern EDC knife with a versatile blade shape . The blade steel is Sandvik 's 14C28N , a superbly balanced all-around stainless that is a real selling point for Kershaw 's US made knives.The only thing that falls short is the thumbstuds , which are the sloped design used on the Kershaw Blur . I do n't know how well they work on the Blur , but they are very hard to use to deploy the Piston . When I push hard enough on the studs to finally dislodge the blade , I worry I 'll slice my thumb . Worse , the sharp ridges of the thumbstuds rise up close to the blade 's spine -- they abrade my thumb whenever I choke up on the knife . This messes up what would otherwise be a very comfortable grip.So , a poor choice of thumbstuds . KAI should replace them . The simple , more rounded thumbstuds on the stablemate Kershaw Knockout would work better here . Compared to the Piston , it is much easier to deploy the Knockout with thumbstuds if that 's your thing . ( Both knives do best when deployed with their excellent flippers . ) Overall this fault causes the Piston to come in second place to the Knockout , which I would encourage you to purchase instead -- brilliant design ! But the Piston is still a quality entry with many good features .	1
I realize Kershaw manufactures many of their knives in China . Such is the world that we live in . This knife , I understand , is made in America . Mine is pretty much perfect . This knife utilizes Kershaw 's Speedsafe technology for quick access via the thumb studs or the flipper . This is my first tactical knife , so take this with a grain of salt , but the blade is sharp out of the box , and appears to be of excellent quality . The handle is made of excellent material and has a & # 34 ; starburst & # 34 ; pattern on it to assist with gripping . The balance of this knife is superb . With the blade deployed , I can easily balance the knife in the middle with one finger . At 4 ounces and a belt clip , this knife is an excellent choice for EDC .	1
Light weight , slim , good blade steel , great overall design . I really like this knifeOnly cons : The assist is n't as fast as say , a Kershaw Blur , but it 's adequate . The clip , while perfectly functional , is n't my favorite aesthetically . I replaced the clip with a black one from a ZT0350 .	1
I bought this knife a little bit ago and love everything about it great everyday carry knife . Opens smooth , nice tight lockup , comes sharp and takes a good edge . Very light weight . Great deep carry clip . Buy one that 's really all I can say	1
This is a good quality Kershaw with a sharp blade . The textured G-10 adds to the gripping and also makes this a very lightweight knife for its size . It has a good heft and balance . Two minor issues that make it a 4 rather than a 5 , in my opinion : the blade has a less dramatic contouring look than in the picture , which detracts slightly from the overall favorable first impression of the knife and also there is no jimping , which could decrease the ability to use this knife for long and/or hard cutting jobs as the jimping , for me , helps with the thumb to guide and grip a knife . However , it is a good looking knife , lightweight enough to carry everyday , and sharp as heck out of the box .	1
*All measurements are from my measure , not a website description.The Kershaw Piston , model 1860 , is a great knife . It 's almost perfect . Here 's my review , with specifications ... The Piston is 5 '' closed , and weighs only 3.9 ounces . The handle scales are textured black G-10 , and there 's a sunburst pattern machined into each handle side . The texture of the G-10 is nice ; not too slick and not too rough . I was worried at first that the swell toward the rear of the handle would abrade my hand , but it never did . The Piston uses an inset linerlock , like the Kershaw Blur . This means that there are no real liners , and that reduces weight . There 's no jimping on the linerlock . Lock-up is solid . The blade stop pin could be a little larger , but it works just fine . The pocket clip is brushed stainless steel , and is held in with two Torx ( T-6 ) screws . It can be positioned in any of the four corners : tip up or down , left or right hand carry . The knife carries the same depth in your pocket whether it 's tip up or down , and the pocket clip tightness is ideal . Without liners , the pocket clip screws into steel inserts in the G-10 . The lanyard loop is a stainless steel post inside the butt of the knife . It 's held in the G-10 handles with small holes , and is friction-fitted . I think this is a clever idea , but using it as a lanyard hole is tricky . Unless you take the handle scale off , you have to carefully thread your lanyard ( in most cases , doubled-over gutted 550 cord ) through the groove in the butt , around the lanyard post , and out the other side . Also , being a small post instead of an actual lanyard hole through the handles , your lanyard will be significantly longer since it takes up less space . The backspacer on the Piston is machined Zytel , and is nicely done with a jimping pattern . If you want to take the knife apart , the two handle screws are a Torx ( T-6 ) .The Piston 's blade is made of Sandvik 14C28N hardened to 58-60 on the Rockwell scale . It 's stone washed ( not satin finish ) and looks rather nice . The blade is 1/8 '' thick and 3-5/8 '' long , with a 3-3/8 '' cutting edge . I 've found that this steel takes an amazing edge and holds it for a while ; 14C28N can be compared to VG-10 . The thumb studs are identical to the Kershaw Blur ; they 're stepped and angled in toward the handle . The blade is flat ground , but is n't full flat ground . Mine came razor sharp . A flipper is also provided if you do n't want to use the thumb studs . For me , it 's too smooth , so I used a Dremel to make a small groove in it for more traction . There 's no jimping on the spine of the blade , if you care about that . If the Piston ever develops blade play , or if you want to take it apart , the blade pivot pin screw is a Torx ( T-8 ) . The Piston uses a torsion bar for speedy opening . The opening speed is a little slow for me , even after lubricating and adjusting everything . It 's tolerable though . If you remove the torsion bar , you can use the Piston as a manual knife with no problem.So , why only four stars ? Well , the average price for the Piston is $ 70 . Even Amazon 's price is $ 63 . I think that 's a little too much for this knife . Considering the lack of jimping on the linerlock , the overly-smooth flipper , the slow deployment speed , and the average ( for Kershaw ) steel , I 'd be happy with a $ 55 price tag on this knife . It 's still a great knife though , and it is my daily carry .	1
Blade lock up is perfect . Steel is very good , easy to sharpen and stays sharp . Handle is thin with a texture that does n't hurt you fingers , but provides a good non-slip grip . It is a large knife perfect for a working knife . As for as size goes it is similar to the Kershaw & # 34 ; Knockout & # 34 ; and the Kershaw & # 34 ; Blur & # 34 ; . Really nice quality . I would buy this knife again .	1
Worth every penny . I was a little skeptical of the g10 only handle at first , but I did my homework and referred to the nutnfancy review on YouTube . I couldnt be happier . The blade is super sharp out of the box , and the thing is incredibly light for such a large knife . No wiggle of the bald when opened either . I have carried it with me everyday on duty for the last week , and I hardly notice it 's there . The assisted opening feature is just right ... not too springy , but just enough to give a healthy flick . And it 's made in the USA !	1
I own a several Kershaw knives and this one is another high quality knife for the money . Great blade design with very good steel . Fit and finish are excellent . The blade comes out of the box very sharp and will flip open in a flash.The knife has a good feel in my hand . I rotate all of my Kershaws on a EDC basis and have been very pleased with all of them .	1
Great knife . Flips a little slow for me . But good steel . Came razor sharp . 4 stars because its so light . feels like a toy . G 10 is on the smooth side but still gives a great grip on the knife .	1
An excellent knife in every way . Slightly large for an EDC , but no more so than a Cold Steel Voyager , or Recon 1 . It is superbly made , with every detail taken care of . It is lightweight for it 's size , with excellent materials used in it 's construction . The steel is creamy and tough , and the G-10 scales grippy , but not too much . The Speedsafe assisted opening is slightly sluggish , but my experience with the Kershaw Knockout tells me that this is very temporary , as it is a new knife . No jimping on the spine , but the ergonomics of the handle amply compensate for that . This is a classic knife , ideal for camping , or tactical back up . A must buy , along with it 's brother , the Knockout .	1
It 's a Kershaw so I expect it to be a good knife I bought it as a gift so I will update this review good or bad after Christmas when the person I bought it for tells me how it performs .	1
The fine textured , checkered finish and the indented curved design on the G10 handles give this knife a very hansom appearance and a firm grip and the unusual but very effective recessed lanyard hole was a nice touch . Though this knife was designed as a spring assisted opener , the blade has well-designed thumb studs on both sides that give you an extra option for opening . This liner lock knife has no liners which cuts down significantly on the weight but the knife has a high quality , rock solid feel to it . The blade material is Sandvik 14c28n , one of the very best steels available to make knives of . While the opening mechanism works very smoothly and has a solid feel , it 's not nearly as fast as some of my other spring assisted knives . However , a big plus is that this knife is made in the U.S.A. , unlike too many of the other knives in Kershaw 's line upThe one downside to this knife , and the only reason I could n't give it as five star rating , is the placement of the pocket clip ; as is unfortunately typical for most of the Kershaw knives , it is placed too far down on the handle of the knife causing it to stick out at least a half of an inch above the top of your pocket when worn inside of your pocket using the clip.All in all , this would be a worthy addition to any knife collection and an excellent choice for an EDC knife .	1
This is another great knife from Kershaw . I have been carrying this knife every day for 2 months now and love it . It is on the larger side but the thin profile and the low weight make carrying it unnoticeable . The blade steal retains a fine edge after daily use . The handle scales are made of textures black G-10 which are not slick when wet and save a lot of weight . This knife is a big version of the Kershaw Skyline with speedsafe assisted opening . I do n't regret buy this knife for $ 60 and I might buy another for good measure .	1
I own about 100 Kershaw & Zero Tolerance knives and have few issues with any of the models owned . I think the price points are typically reasonable for the quailty & innovative designs offered by Kershaw/ZT . However I find the Kershaw Piston to be over-price for the blade steel used . It is made in the USA which is a plus and it is solid but $ 20.00 over-priced in my opinion .	1
Great knife for the price . Kershaw makes some of the best knives on the market and this one is no exception . Their warranty department is second to none if you ever need a new pocket clip or lose a screw , they 'll ship it to you no questions asked.As a knife collector , I own over 100 Kershaw 's and will continue buying them .	1
Awesome blade ! Light weightSmall enough for EDC , big enough for a wide range of chores.Build quality is fantasticNo jimping anywhere , but that does n't bother me.Very good steel used for the blade , Sandvik 14C28N.I also like the nested liner , makes for a slimmer handle without compromising strength.Just a great knife at a great price .	1
I ordered another one to have a spare in case I lose or break this one . It 's currently my favorite EDC knife .	1
Liked the design , price and the steel . Did n't pay my usual attention to size and found it to be & # 34 ; hunting knife & # 34 ; size when opened . Good balance and very light for it 's size . This is not the kind of utility work knife you would feel comfortable flipping around co-workers without making them a little nervous . Actually it is about the same blade length as the blur but an inch longer handle . Lighter than the blur due to the handle material . Light but sturdy . A fine piece from Kershaw ... .for those wanting an & # 34 ; impressive & # 34 ; fuller size folder .	1
Purchased this as a gift for my father in law . The knife is built amazingly well , centered blade , solid lock up , and just feels like quality . Yes , as others have mentioned , the lack of jimping on the handle is a but of a bummer , but I think this knife flows better without them . For under $ 50 I ca n't think of a better do-all knife , except for maybe a Kershaw Blur .	1
Have tried a few different brands , different models , different ... well this is becoming my favorite knife for a number of reasons:1 . Blade design - beautiful , full belly ( overly full ) belly , reinforced tip work of knife art.2 . Blade steel - not superb , but at this price point you will not care.3 . Handle - aluminum with some neato integration of steel for the spring housing and the lock bar . Does offer some grip due to its shape . Would suck if your hands or gloves are wet.4 . Lock engagement - this is my second one as the first one was gifted away and the lock positioning is perfect - full contact about 30-40 % of the blade tang.5 . Customer service - I 've dealt with Kershaw/KAI on issues with other knives - if only all the companies stood behind their product that way.6 . Innovation - Kershaw has shown itself to be a company that does not talk much , but has been doing a whole lot lately - this knife is an example - almost perfect blade design , flipper with spring assist , four position clip , brilliant lock design.7 . Opening , yes - the opening - it really works - once you try a flipper with spring assist , you may cringe at most other types of opening mechanisms . I 've tried a flipper without a spring assist before and they do alright , but this is something else . Frankly , as a number of reviews point out , one is not sure why the thumb studs are there - they actually do n't work that well for opening this knife . Perhaps , the next iteration of this beauty could bring about a design where the thumb studs are the blade stops ( Kershaw has has a little bit of experience in this with a little-known fella by the name of Hinderer ) . That and checkered handle for more grip . A poke at Benchmade - this is a much more refined design than the Nitrous Assist ( those could and would accidentally open in my pocket - bad ) . I will give Benchmade points on the Axis Lock - pretty neat.Bottom line : aside from a slippery handle - this knife is very tough to beat for the money .	1
First things first , it shipped pretty quick with free shipping and the packaging ensured that it would not be harmed during transportation because that would be a bummer since you 've been waiting for it.Anyways , this knife is absolutely amazing for the price and quality . It may not be s30v but who really cares ? The blade comes razor sharp ready to slice things up cleanly and is a high quality steel . The handle is made of aluminum which makes it feel sturdy , however ; it does feel rather light for its size but other than that its great . The SpeedSafe opening is actually scary because it opens so damn fast it hits the stop pin and makes loud sound which is great because it ensures that the blade is locked securely in place with the cool sub-frame lock . Knife is easy to open with SpeedSafe but it also makes it difficult to close one-handed because the torsion bar is constantly trying to push the blade open and this is an sizable knife , so it 's quite difficult to close unless you have bigger hands but that 's how most assisted openers are . Overall , this knife is super amazing , especially for its amazing price . Kershaw makes high quality products at great prices .	1
Want a Zero Tolerance 0300 . Got this . Its MIA great quality ! ! Great value ! I will still buy a ZT when I find one at the right price .	1
This knife is in my pocket every day . As a shipping business owner and scout leader , this knife gets a workout on a daily basis . It stays sharp . It is easy to open and close with one hand . Of course , it looks great . The action is smooth .	1
Pros : Fast and easy to deploy . Great lock-up . Very lightweight with a thin profile . Love the wide blade , deep belly and strong tip . Perfect deep carry BLACK pocket clip..Cons : ZERO traction . There is NO jimping and NO texture on the scales . Not only does this make it difficult to remove from you pocket , but in use it could easily slip from your hands . Even deploying the blade would be easier with SOME amount of texture on the scales..Mods : Added jimping to the dip where my thumb rests , just above the axis . Added grip tape to the scale opposite the pocket clip for easier pocket removal . Considering cutting small notches into the raised swoop designs on the scales for additional grip..Of course I 'd rather not have to modify anything , but the Pros of this knife far outweigh the Cons so some minor modifications are acceptable to me .	1
This one came today , shipping was perfect , i got it for $ 40.00 was $ 50.00 but i got 10 bucks discount , what a bargain ! ! ! ! From the beginning i can say to get an Made in USA folder knife for $ 40.00 is really cool , this folder has a blade made from Sandvik 14C28CN . Sweden made steel ( , Sweden is one of the best steel maker country in the world , very well known for its high quality steel ) Very nice design for this folder , love the aluminum handle , very light , i dont think will go white during to an excessive wearing , if so can be repainted with a satin black spray paint , ( of course if you know how to do that , and if you care enough for it ) I gave to this baby 5 stars , price was such a bargain , blade is a good quality steel , very interesting design , light as weight , very discrete to be an EDC , open assisted system , is definitely my favorite , I have other expensive brands , but this is at the same level with my top ones . Good job Kershaw . very nice done , blade is cool , overall looks nice and impressive . Thank youI would suggest this one as one of the best and discrete EDC folder , period .	1
I have not received this knife from Amazon yet , it is on its way , however , I did receive it from another vendor and feel that since I have it on order from Amazon , I can review it here . This is a typical Kershaw knife , well built , sharp , made in the USA , and a good overall look . The blade is ample and the handle is made from aluminum . This is overall a high quality lightweight knife with a good heft and a low rider clip . The speedsafe feature allows this knife to open quickly and securely , when it opens and locks , you know it . All quite positive features.A few minor considerations that would have made this a five instead of a four , in my opinion . The handle , though it is a quality aluminum and adds to the lightweight nature of this knife , is quite smooth and does not provide as solid a grip that you might require for a working knife . Perhaps a textured G-10 or more machining on the aluminum would have assisted with a more secure grip . There is some aesthetically pleasing contours on the handle , but these are more for good looks than grip , in my opinion . Also , there is no jimping , which in most knives , I find to be helpful with grip and functionality , especially for the thumb which guides and stabilizes much cutting.This would not be my first choice for an actual working knife , however , it would be a good EDC if you were just going to use it for light work around the office environment , cutting twine , boxes , opening envelopes and such , or just have it for showing and admiring . More looks than functionality , but overall , a good knife and a nice addition to my Kershaw collection that currently numbers at 52 .	1
Excellent service and fast shipping . This knife is awesome.Very , very sharp out of the box.I love the light weight and big blade very well crafted , Kershaw scores a 10 on this one .	1
I have 11-Kershaw knives - but this is my favorite . It feels good in my hand , very slim handle & all my fingers fit . Easy to open with the flipper . The easiest to activate flipper of all my Kershaw knives . The steel lock liner locks up good . But with just my thumb , I can push it all the way over with ease to lock up 100 % of the blade for a super secure feeling . I know nothing is going to slip and hurt me.Then there is the blade : 14C28N Swedish Stainless Razor Steel - very easy to sharpen to a scary sharp edge . Super easy to resharpen and holds the edge well . The pocket clip is small & black . It rides so low in my pocket you can only see about 1/4 inch of the small end of the knife handle . The small clip would suggest it is a very small knife . BUY one now , keep it for a week and you will love it too . The knife is on the large size for a folding pocket knife - but I love it !	1
Pros : Very well made pocket knife . I probably will carry it for daily use.Easy to carry cuz extra thin for the size.The steel is strong and sharp . I thing it will last a pretty long time.Cons : If I have to say the thing I do not like , maybe it is a little bit tight so that I had a hard time to use the thumbstud.but most of the time I will use the flipper which works just fine.Overall nice strong blade . a good choice for under $ 100 knife .	1
Very light , perfect EDC . The footprint is minimal due not only to its weight but also because it is just about the thinnest knife I own -it melts into your pocket . Deployment is awfully fast , the blade is wide and very strong . Highly recommended .	1
nice opening , thin enough to fit most pockets , sharp out of the box , and love the sort of flat grind . i dont know if it should be a collector or a edc .	1
This is the most affordable/highest quality made in the USA knife I have found . The knife is very lightweight , lighter than my Kershaw blur and its a bit thinner too . Typically really lightweight knives have FRN handles like the endura 4 or the griptillian and that 's fine but that stuff does flex if u squeeze hard enough . The aluminum handles in the knockout feel really strong and have no give to them and i prefer the feel of metal over plastic any day . There was a little rattle if i shook the blade but that was fixed with a little petroleum jelly on the torsion bar . The knockout could use some jimping on the spine and in places on the handle to make it less slick and that 's the only knock i can give the knockoutupdate : The more i used this knife , the more i loved it . After a while you get used to no jimping and its fine , the knife has remained rock solid with no bladeplay , and it keeps an excellent edge . If i ever lost this I 'd be furious but i would absolutely buy another one .	1
I love this knife . The steel is awesome and holds a razor sharp edge . The drop point is a nice look . I wo n't even mention the assisted opening feature of Kershaws . Simply wicked !	1
NO GIMPING ! ! ! good size blade , and comes out of the box sharp . I love how thin the handle is , because of the frame lock and no internal liner . Grip could be way better , the handle is extremely smooth . i believe it 's called the & # 34 ; knockout & # 34 ; because the frame lock looks to be a separate piece - it looks like it was knocked out of the frame . The deployment is really fast.The pocket clip is great , and allows for a deep carry . initially , when the knife was open , i would hear a rattling sound within the speedsafe mechanism , like there was a loos piece of metal or something in the knife . i took the knife apart and found the problem - the & # 34 ; spring & # 34 ; for the speedsafe mechanism is just free floating . I just added tiny rubber washer to the inside of the mechanism , and that eliminated the rattle . Overall great knife , but i 'm not sure it 's worth the price tag .	1
I bought this to replace a North Face 3-in-1 jacket , I did a lot of research to settle on this as a good economical replacement . I bought this at the end of last winter during the clearance sales , so I 've not really had a need to wear the entire ensemble yet . What I can say is that the outer jacket has been outstanding in rain , wind ( and we get a lot of wind in this part of the country ) and cold.It has a snap off hood that unfortunately does n't stow in the collar , but you can put it in a pocket if you like . It has a fleece lined collar that is soft and warm and keeps the wind at bay . It has zippered pockets top and bottom on both sides on the outside . My last jacket had waterproof zippers here , this one does not . The lower pockets are fleece lined so they make good handwarmers . There are three interior pockets , two use velcro fasteners so we 'll see how long those last with frequent use ( I do n't use them frequently ) and the third is labeled as a goggle pouch but it has no closure of any kind , I have n't found anything that I would feel comfortable stashing in that pocket knowing it is just hanging open . The main zipper has a wind flap closed with velcro , I do n't like it as much as snaps but it seems to be holding up okay so far.The liner I have n't worn much but was extremely warm when I tried it on the first time , the space blanket interior is good at trapping your heat .	1
Unbelievable on how warm this coat is . I can tell that it will have to be close to zero for me to wear this coat . It is that warm .	1
Being a very large person , 6'9 '' , 295lbs , I bought the 2x Whilibird parka , the parka fits me well in my midsection , but just makes it in the shoulder area , its just a ECH tight but not enough not to purchase it . I was lucky and came across the outlet stores they maintain , and saved beaucoups bux ( tell them your email addy and save ten percent more ) . Love what it is and the weight of the parka is half of my EB goosedown coat , which I must say is longer over the seat . I like the feel of this parka , the pockets are sooo soft . I have a bottom seat heater in my car , so the belt length of this parka will not get in the way . My wife purchased a Columbia parka ( diff model ) too , and we both find that they do not offer zippers that open both ways , so when seated in the car you can release some of the tightness . I told her to just use the velcro closure on the parka to get to the car and when you sit it will open up as needed , rather than having to take the time in the cold to unzip yourself to drive . We must also admit we are not skiers but enjoy being outside year round and WARM which this parka does in spades . I have a set of bib snow pants so when it is snowy I will be covered all over . Jeans do not provide much heat retention . Over all I would recommend this parka to the big and tall .	1
These gloves we 're too small for stated size . Order a size larger than you normally wear . Aside from sizing , they are nice , well constructed polertec fleece gloves . They are not waterproof .	1
The gloves fit well and are warmer than the ones I had been using.It is nice to have two pairs of gloves to change off with in the winter .	1
This shirt ( along with UA Evo ColdGear Fitted Legging Bottoms ) were a perfect base layer for camping in 20 degree weather . The cold compression clothing did a great job keeping me warm throughout our stay in the woods . It was extremely comfortable .	1
This is a compression fit ... ... ... .its suppose to fit tight , that 's what traps your body temp . thus you stay warm and pulls the sweat if you get overheated to the surface ... ... .amazing ... ... ... This is perfect for layering under sweatshirts , fleece , flannel etc . the logo sticks out so you get alot of newbie people to Under Armour asking what your wearing at the Soccer and Football games . Highly recommend . I take a large in all my dress , t 's and these run true to size .	1
Greetings ; I really like this garment . It is exactly what it advertises to be ; compression leggings for cold weather . I am currently using here in Afghanistan with the Under Armour bottom . Great piece gear worth the weight to carry around . It stretches well , it is comfortable to wear , keeps the heat in and the wind off your skin .	1
I got this shirt to replace my original mock turtleneck from UA . This one is thinner than the old one and not quite as warm , but it still does what it says it will do . I wear it under another cotton turtleneck under my body armor and uniform , so the compression fit is a must for me . It is warm , but on those really cold days it just is n't enough to suit me . I may have to look into buying some base 3.0 shirts and pants for the really cold weather .	1
I am 6'3 & # 34 ; , 190 and the medium fit perfectly as a compression shirt should . Great cold weather base layer from UA	1
Quite warm , very comfortable . Best base layer I have found ... fits like a second skin and takes up very little room in a pack.I honestly thought Under Armour was a little too pricey ... until I tried it out . This stuff is worth the money . Not only does it perform as advertised , but it is very comfortable , and wicks moisture very well.Recommended .	1
I bought this UnderArmour Men 's Coldgear Mock after extensive research into different options for sailing in cold weather . I started sailing in Ireland in October and wanted to continue sailing into the winter time to gain experience before I move back to warmer climates next year.After wearing this for a few cold days out , I am glad I bought this . It kept me warm in the cold weather and it has an amazing ability to keep you feeling refreshed even if you start getting hotter . It works really well at wicking any sweat from your body while also maintaining your warmth . I wore this directly under a splash jacket . I noticed that the splash jacket was a little damp on the inside when i took it off so I assume that it pulled the sweat away from my body and pulled it onto the exterior . I would n't have even thought I was ever sweating though.I bought the medium as I wear mediums typically in the US and found the measurements on the website to be closer to US measurements ( an equivalent large size in Europe ) . Upon arrival , I thought this would be too small and was considering a return . I tried it on and it felt a little tight but after pulling up pictures from the website and other sources , the compression tops are meant to be tight fitting which probably helps to hold in the heat better . I probably could have pushed to a large as I feel I am probably in the middle of the two sizes , but at the end of the day , the medium was okay.I highly recommend this mock and really value the purchase .	1
So far , love the look , only like the fit- will take a bit to get used to I 'm sure . Received in timely manner and anticipate on using this during November duathlon . Once I test it out in some chilly weather , I will update the review but so far , I like the fit but next time I may get `` fit '' style instead of `` compression '' or we 'll see , I may just get used to it and like it .	1
Just the right weight and thickness , and never a blister . The odd pattern on the socks is not that noticeable , so OK to wear with both regular and exercise clothes . These socks are also very durable .	1
Double layer socks are the way to go for long hikes . The two layers are thin , and that is good so that they do not affect how the shoe fits . Highly recommended for endurance hikes .	1
This compact scope is excellent for my Savage 22 . It sits a little high on the riffle , but the dots are clear and accurate . I am going to try it on my tactical stock . It can be mounted forward for sighting with both eyes . Great price for a great scope .	1
this is a great sight , used it on my mossberg 22 plinkster and the dots are bright and if you dont like scopes i say buy this	1
My only gripe is that the dot is n't bright enough to be easily seen on a bright day . You have to search for it in the sight , which kind of takes the & # 34 ; reflex & # 34 ; out of a reflex/red dot sight .	1
Super accurate and does n't need to be configured too much after you 've zeroed it . From 15ft , the dot 's about 3 inches high , but from 30 or more , it 's right on target .	1
This sight works great on my M & P 15-22 . Looks nice , holds zero , and the batteries last a long time . It has both a red and green option . I prefer the green , as most of the ranges I go to are indoor .	1
Item was ad described . Quality is quite good and at a price that was very reasonable . Light enough for a pistol ( I use on a Ruger )	1
Works fine looks shape and seems well built . Nice red dot with diff size adjustments and adjusts fine and can even get with in a 12 & # 34 ; target zone .	1
PUT IT ON MY M & P15 SPORT EASY TO ADJUST AND WORK GREAT FOR NOW PUT 200 RDS ON IT WILL UPDATE IN THE FUTURE BUT FOR NOW WORKS GREAT . A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE . I USED .223 LET SEE HOW IT HOLDS UP THE THE.556	1
recommend this item Works great , more than I need Great item , I would recommend this to any and everyone . Why so many words here ?	1
I have this red/green dot mounted on a S & W ; 15-22 rifle . Its a low recoil rifle that was in need of an optic upgrade . I chose this sight for 1 simple reason ... PRICE . I couldnt find a cheaper red dot sight for the price . Here is my review : Pros : - light- red and green dot- really bright dot- co-witnessed with my front post sight- nice flip up covers for keeping dust out- works great after 500 .22lr roundsCons : - adjusts backwards ( height i think ) - screws need threadlock . After my first 300 rounds the scope and rings became loose.Overall : I really like this scope . It works well on my .22lr . A guy at the range commented how he hated the scope and how he broke 3 of them on his AR-15 . I assume this is because of the increased reciol of the AR . It worked awesome on the low recoil of the .22 . For the price it does not get any better . It looks awesome and makes planking at longer disances fun .	1
I bought this for my M & P ; 15-22 and I really like the red dot . The gun barely has any recoil.Good product for a really good price .	1
We use them for airsoft on M16 's and MP5 's . Well made and mounts solidly.The lens covers can slide off sometimes so I 'd suggest taping them onor adding CamoWrap . The dots are visible even on sunny days . Thewindage and elevation adjustments have a good range and stay put.The riser is open all the way through , so you can view the iron sightson an MP5 right through the space if you do n't have time to light it up.We were able to adjust the dot to sit just above the front sight onthe M16 , making it a great enhancer on grey days or in low light .	1
Got these as part of package with G & G CM16 airsoft rifle . Item was as described . Suggest to get this and a lot of air soft BBs since we go thru BBs in a hurry . My son loves to shoot and the air soft gun is great outdoor fun . Would recommend to anyone that has enough outdoor space to use .	1
I bought this to go with my new Echo 1 Robinson armament XCR-L . The green and red dot are very nice and produce a very accurate sighting once zeroed in .	1
gives good field of vision and easy to sight in , If you reach the max on the screw adjustment you might think about resetting the mount .	1
I received this just a couple of days after ordering this , witch I love . However the brightness adjuster nob was extremely hard to twist . I think that this is a really good sight once it gets going . it is made very well and was surprisingly heavy . I do n't worry about wait so this was n't a problem for me . over all I would still recommend this sight . I use it mainly for airsoft . It works well .	1
For the money this dot scope is hard to beat . It has held zero for over 100 rounds on my AR . It also looks good on my rifle . The only negatives I have are the red dot being too bright on the lowest setting and both dots are slightly misshaped but not enough to really hurt anything . It will get you within a 6 inch circle at 100 yards because that is about the area the dot covers at that distance . For the application I use it for it 's just right and very quick on target . If you want precision at distance , do n't go with a dot .	1
I love this scope . It is a little fussy to sight in . The adjustments seem to behave weird , but it will adjust . The reticle is easy to see and works as advertised . Replace the cheap plastic covers with better plastic . I cut some 1/8 & # 34 ; polycarbonate discs with a hole saw and dropped one in the cover and slid it back on the scope . The flip open one I removed since it will get shot out on the first strike.With this mod , you got a great , inexpensive scope .	1
Item is exactly what you expect from NcStar , inexpensive optics that work . I matched this up to a Mech Tech w/G21 , holds zero after sight in , and after 600 rounds it still holds .	1
These pants are comfortable and a good length for me being 5'9 & # 34 ; . The waist band is wider than in the pic but still flattering since it helps hide my bit of belly . Material is soft , not thick and not thin but just right .	1
These fit nicely and are actually long enough for me . They look nice . But the fabric is thinner than I 'm used to for sweatpants . And there 's no pockets . I should have checked for pockets but I think I assumed all sweatpants had them . I gave them 4 stars because they are only about $ 13 so I think they 're fine for the price . But I bought a pair of & # 34 ; Gilden Ladies ' Heavy Blend Yoga Style Sweatpants & # 34 ; for about $ 17 and like them much better .	1
I have two pairs of theChampion Favorite Bermuda Short , which are basically the same as these pants -- but in shorts form . I wear a 12-14 and in the shorts I ordered a L , which are fitted and perfect for working out/running . But I bought the pants to hang out in at home and wanted them a little on the loose side , so I went up a size to the XL and am very pleased . The Xl size is very comfortable and has some wiggle room without falling off . The cotton is also very soft and lightweight , which is exactly what I wanted ( if , on the other hand , you 're looking for warm , heavy sweats , look elsewhere ) . They are also a good length : I 'm 5 ' 10 '' , and they come down to just below my ankles and do n't seem to have shrunk in the dryer . Overall , these are just what I was looking for , and the price was definitely right .	1
I am taller , so these are high waters on me . Aside from that , the fit is super comfy . No pockets though .	1
The fit is large around the waist although I think a size down might be too tight in the abdomen . The fabric is a little rough . Pockets would be a great addition , although I have almost given up on finding sweat pants with pockets .	1
These fit great except they do run a little long for me . My inseam is 30 & # 34 ; and I can get away w/ 31 & # 34 ; but this must be 32 at least . So I washed them in warm water , dried them in hot drier ( to shrink ) -- and they did n't ! Fortunately , I have no problem sewing it to the desired length , so that is my next step . I plan to wear them as lounging pants , like PJ 's , so I do n't mind answering the door or picking up the paper in them , and also cuddle up on the sofa w/ my kitty , but I do n't sleep in them . Very comfy , wear w/ any color tee or top .	1
I wear champion workout shorts and shirts always . My medium sized shorts of this same style fit perfectly , the large are too bulky , so I figured getting medium in the long pants version would be good , but it form fits in places I 'd rather not have it so snug . It could be fixed by wearing a long shirt with them . The length is great . Nice and long ... no high-water look with these pants , just beware of a slightly smaller fit than usual .	1
High quality pants that will last a long time for exercise , or sitting in the sauna . Lightweight material , not bulky like heavy fleece .	1
I am 5'.5 123 ish . Small fits over my running shorts , and the length hits right on the floor . But when seated , it falls perfectly at the ankle . Its not & # 34 ; that & # 34 ; thin . Its about 180 thread count . I would recommend as gym coverup . Lounging in a pants with this thick waist band is not my thing . It serves the purpose , a pants to wear to the gym over my workout shorts or leggings .	1
So far it was good . Two packages were not air tight so I discarded them . Am going to buy this again though as that seems to be an average out of 100 .	1
saving it so I do n't know if it taste like cardboard or if is great . oxox oxox oxox oxox oxo	1
The food contained in the ARK are all kind of like sides . So they 'd really benefit from a main course here and there like a can of spam or a can of chicken . But that 's what you 're supposed to use your savings on as this is the most complete and cheapest & # 34 ; food bucket & # 34 ; on the market .	1
I have recently begun to can , and buy MREs but I wanted a little variety and some VERY shelf stable provisions . I bought this despite some of the reviews saying there were open bags inside . Mine came sealed nice and tight , no open bags . BEWARE : if you choose to open this up and pull all of the bags out , be prepared to spend some time re-packing them . I got most of them back in and had to pull some out and re-arrange them so they would all fit back in . I would recommend adding some of your own freezer bags immediately to this because the servings come in large pouches . You could make a meal , re-bag unused portions and ration out the servings	1
Have n't used it but received it fast and the price was right . Storing it for emergency hope I do n't need it soon .	1
Bucket has a tight seal , This is for emergency only so will not be opening unless needed , i wish these buckets had a manufacture date stamp .	1
LOTS of food for the price , good solid sealed container that can double as water carrier if needed.Arrived quickly and in good condition . Basic carbohydrates , no frills , very little protien , and a little more fat content than I was looking for . However , carbohydrates and fats give energy and are what is need in an emergency situation . Supliment this with a good stock of vegitable protien and vegitable starch seeds and you have a pretty good sustainable emergency food supply.4 stars for lack of dehydrated protien options , but quantity , quality , and density of whole package worth it .	1
It arrived towards the later part of the estimated time . I cant attest for the taste of this product , but I feel better knowing its in my emergency kit . I have four members in my family so the portion-per-package is just right for us . Im not sure I would rely soley on this for emergency food . I plan on supplimenting canned goods in with these packages . I plan on purchaseing 1 a month until I have a 1 year suply for all 4 members of my household . I could only give it 4 stars because I havent sampled it yet .	1
I play sand soccer and we use a smaller ball . This is perfect . Feels great on your feet . My Rottie got a hold of it and punctured a few holes in . Did n't pop which is a miracle so that proves its very durable . Its a ball , it rolls , it works .	1
got this for our 4 year old . first time any one in our family has played & many of his team mates had balls that were duds . This will last for years .	1
I 've had another size 3 Wilson ball for a few years and has always been outside in the elements . The ball is still usable but I decided to get a new one for my other little boy . These are good quality balls	1
My son is 3 and needed a ball to kick around and just learn the basics of soccer and this was it . The ball is more of a golden yellow and not quite the neon yellow it looks in the picture . My son loves it and it stays inflated and it was less than ten bucks so you ca n't beat that . I would highly recommend it !	1
I had several wilson soccer balls , they looked great at first but worn off extremely fast ( less than one month of use ) So far it has great grip ( not slippery , feels soft and metallic ) , it has good weight and proper balance .	1
I purchased this four months ago for my 12 year-old son . To my non-soccer-pro eyes the quality seems very good . He does n't take very good care of it but the ball has held up nicely over time and in all weather .	1
We have about 8 balls now , and this is one of our favorites . It is an excellent ball at a great price !	1
Great little addition to the gun safe . Mounts easily and you can hang multiple pistols and even other things such as knives , tools , etc . Solid construction . ( Former US Army )	1
Product is made of quality materials . Very strong . Works as designed . No complaints at this point . I have a cheap $ 80 Gun safe with one shelf on top and I always used to knock the guns off and when trying to get something off the shelf . This is a great way to organize the guns and not run the risk of dropping and damaging them.Fits my Glock 19 and Ruger LC9 great .	1
Excellent product . Opened up tons of room in my StackOn 10 gun cabinet . Easily mounted to door . I used rivets unstead of screws provided ... .Highly recommended .	1
Used for my shotty ... Double stick ng ... you have to use screws to make it sturdy ... Use two for parallel mounting ...	1
Holds 1 to 2 pistols depending on sizes of the pistols . I put 2 Mark III Ruger .22 's side by side on this rack in a stack on wall safe . Of course I used a couple of screws to attach it through the holes already in the bracket . Bought 2 and glad I did since I have a couple of wall safes . Durable vinyl coating but could have been cheaper .	1
Purchased for mounting inside a gun locker door . I used the pre-mounted double-sided tape , prepped the door with isopropyl alcohol , and let it cure for a day before I hung a pistol . So far , the mount has remained in place without issue . It appears that the mount is large enough to handle 2 pistols of the right make , or could easily manage one with a large trigger lock . As it is , my .45 floats around a bit , but since I do n't open/close the door often , I do n't find this troublesome . The pistol leans to one side , and stays there.Build quality is good . Overall , higher quality than I would expect for the price.I will update if I have any issues with the coating or the sticky tape , but I do n't anticipate any .	1
I have been using these racks for two years and just ordered four more . They can be placed anywhere to make the best use of available space since they are individual , stand-alone items.I place the racks side-by-side for small pistols . Larger pistols are placed alone in the vertical stack of my narrow safe . The racks hold pistols securely , right side up if desired and in full view , while still providing instant access . They are very sturdy . A small criticism : -- While the coating does not mar gun finishes , it could be improved by making it less slick ( or more grabby ) .These racks are not cheap but are worth it to me mainly because I can place them exactly where I want rather than be constrained by the size and shape of a multiple rack .	1
Picked up this rack 2 days ago and it is what I expected it to be . good workmanship and nice finishing . was thinking about to fab something like this myself but for $ 12 , it is better to buy them . very happy with it . Will buy 2 more for my other handguns .	1
We have 2 of these , one for the home defense shotgun and another for the AR . They work quite well , however there is no adjustment once in place , so measure twice / drill once . The placement for the AR will not accommodate the shotgun , though the stock of the AR can be adjusted to fit in the shotgun rack . It is handy to use a cable lock through the rack and the magazine well to ensure that they wo n't blow a hole in the roof .	1
I have several long guns in my gun safe . I also have a SAR bullpup carbine which is much shorter then the rifles . It the end of the suppressor does n't come close to the upper support . I attached this to the wall of my gun safe about 10 & # 34 ; above the floor and the suppressor of carbine fits perfectly in the upper support of the safe . The only thing that would make it a little better were if it had a little bigger screws in the mounting kit .	1
I wanted this to mount a home defense shotgun behind a door . The shotgun has a action lock , for safety reasons , and many gun racks or holders have issues when the action lock is on . But this rack holds the gun effectively and ready for action.I do with the rack had a thick coating of plastic or padding , since they gun rest right against the metal . For most people this will not be a problem , but its not recommended for something you do not want to take a chance with scratching.The top mounts is installed per the height of your gun . Which means it may not work for a 18 '' Barreled Security shotgun , if it was installed or mounted for a 28 '' field barrel shotgun.No feasible for mass gun storage , but for a single gun behind a bedroom door or in a closet , these work really nice .	1
Works great with my 12 gauge goose gun . Had to throw away the hardware . Not near heavy enough for the gun . Used toggle bolts instead .	1
To be honest , I would have preferred that the barrel was pointed down to keep dust out of the end and to keep oil from flowing into the chamber . It 's my only complaint.This was simply to mount behind a door . The shotgun is easy to grab . It does what I needed it to do .	1
This is a great mount for a home defense situation . Keep it mounted in a discrete location and it 's now quick to deploy if necessary !	1
I like these you can put them anywhere you would like to place you weapon . They have no problems with a 12 gauge shotgun with the 5 shot holder that fits on the stock so far . I am putting 4 more or so up and will post with each one . This one went on the wall with a moss burg 88 that has a turkey choke and a 5 shell holder on the stock . It is well secured . I use a bed one for my house gun .	1
this rack works great and i like it a lot . it is a little different way of holding a rifle on the wall and i like it a lot .	1
My home defense shotgun is now readily accessible , God forbid , should I need it.Installation was easy , providing I used my shotgun , with short barrel ( barrels are interchangeable on the Stevens Model 320 ) as a means to measure to make sure the rack parts are properly positioned prior to attaching to my wall.I suggest though , to use bigger , better wallanchors , especially in an old fashioned plaster-type wall .	1
I love these things .. second time I have purchased.. I have two shotguns now using these things .. I cant even begin to tell u how simple and easy they are to install and as well how really secure my rifles are .. they allow you to mount in places that are discreet as well they replace that annoyin habit of just leaning a rifle in a closet corner.. I highley recommend these because they are Perfect perfect perfect ! ! ! !	1
Bought this off of the recommendation of a friend and fellow hunter . Just got back from South Texas last week where we called in 5 coyotes and a bobcat in 2 days of hunting . The call is plenty loud , we were hunting in 20 mph winds so challenged by that but it worked . Whenever we cranked the volume up over 55-60 the sound was very distorted . We kept it around 35-45 and it worked . Coyotes came running in and then would stop at the decoy ( Mojo Outdoors Critter Decoy ) try to get down wind and then it was over ... ..for them at least . Very happy with the purchase . Remote worked great out to about 100 yds , Real easy to use and control . I really like how it folds up compact . Makes for real simple grab and go when changing locations . Highly recommended .	1
like to go out and do predator hunting this has a very loud sound and have called in a couple coyote 's and a some foxes	1
I tried to crank this up in my living room and almost could not stand the level of noise when turned up close to max . It was very loud and clear . I was shocked at the clarity at the higher volumes . The unit folds up into a compact unit and the remote stores on the back with a secure connector . The side speakers fold back and the sides/legs fold up over the side speakers . The side speakers can be angled to direct the sound in one or multiple directions . The remote worked fine from about 20 yards . I was able to figure out the menu system without reading the instructions . I also added audio fines on from my PC by simply dragging and dropping to the Primos folder when it was connected to my PC . The Pro Hunts are great and take the thought out of what to do or how to combine calls at the right intervals to get the best results . I 'd like to see more Pro Hunts available for more species . Overall I would highly recommend this system .	1
I wish I had the decoy that would work with this caller 's remote . The caller works great and gets the job done . I would reccommend it to any serious caller .	1
Have n't had a chance to get it in the field , but it drives my dog crazy trying to find it , so it 's at least fooling him .	1
pretty impressed with this ! it does get very loud with little distortion . the pro calls loaded on this are very cool . i did notice some of the other basic calls have background noise in them . think i will just download the fox pro calls , they seem to be far better . i do like the price , battery life and remote a lot better then the fox pro 's	1
I as an outfitter use these constantly . I own 4 different electronic calls and this is by far the best I have used . Cant begin to tell ya how many times I have had coyotes call back , packs come running in . On 2 occasions I had 2 separate packs came charging in.Will also be using it for some deer hunting too but mostly I use mine for predator hunting . We tested mine ( remote ) and it worked at 275 yards easy . And dint have line of sight .	1
I use this product to hunt predators -- coyotes and bears in particular ; the taped professional hunt sequences are fantastic -- my main criticism however that after prolonged use at higher volume , the speakers start to go ( mine affected now permanently ) and sound quality of game calls is definitely affected . I have had this model for several years now , harvesting both bear and coyotes in Texas and Washington States ( box has also drawn in wolves and one mountain lion in WA ) . Looking to replace the speakers if possible to save on purchase of a new caller box -- shame they have n't lasted longer ; if I have to buy a new setup -- I 'm going with the more expensive , but I 'm told more durable FoxPro ...	1
Sound quality is super . Many different calls preloaded . I took it out once without any success . Well built and the remote worked great for me being 50 yards away from the call . I 'd definitely recommend this .	1
Perfect fit , nicely stitched and tough	1
does a great job of cover the hawk i cant complain , it is at a great price and it fits with a great snug while not moving around a lot	1
I usually make a leather sheath for my cutting tools , but I wanted to get out to the woods to use my Pipe Hawk and did n't have time to make the sheath . This simple nylon sheath works well , is inexpensive and does what it is designed to do ( protect the tools edge and protect you and your gear from getting cut by the tools edge ) . Fits really secure . More than happy with the purchase .	1
The sheath is very simple and functional . One must make sure that they purchase the sheath designed for their hawk or it will not work . The sheath fits very tightly and does not appear to have the likelihood of falling off . The canvas and rivets are of good quality and seem to be up to the task of everyday use .	1
well done , it feet exactly , good safety device , came in with in 2 weeks , i like it a lot	1
Sheath fits my pipe hawk nice and snug . Snap still functions fine after half a dozen hiking/camping trips.It does n't have a belt sheath though . I would never use it , but I know some people want that .	1
fits good , covers the blade of the pipehawk , snaps securely ... My only concern is that I will lose it in the woods b/c it is so small . Think I 'll connect a short piece of bright paracord to it to make it more visible if I drop it accidentally .	1
Bright , bright , bright ! I leave not used it yet but this light left me seeing stars when I switched it on ! I like the fact that it can be charged via USB . It comes with multiple settings and I 'm sure drivers will be able to spot me from at least 100 yards away .	1
I was so impressed with this tail light that I bought one for my sister in law who is also an avid bike rider . It is very bright and gives you peace of mind that you can be seen at night . Safety is very important to me , especially at night , and this tail light fits the bill . A compact size , easy to fit on the bike , your clothing or backpack , and has a battery life of over 10 hours . Easy to recharge with a USB Cable .	1
I feel very confident with this product due to the high brightness.Also , the battery life is extremely good . I charge it once every two months ( reduced it later to one month because I heard that deep draining lithium battery is not good ) .Heard from some review that the light may be a little too focused in the middle , however , this is not verified personally as I do not look at my back when I ride.Mount seems acceptable to me . ( not sure why some complained that it is too flimsy ) Like the fact that you can change the speed of the flashing . I turn it up when I use it while cycling and down when I am jogging so that it relates to the speed that I am moving , thus allowing easier position tracking by motorist behind.Cons- Can not replace battery - should not be a concern since it pays for itself over time as it is rechargeableDoes not tell you when battery is lowDo n't like the way how brightness is adjusted in steady mode because it is hard to tell if it is at the peak brightness already or not .	1
this is a good overall product , the light is enough to see from a 100 meters . the charge last a long time with out having to recharge it . has a bunch of settings that honestly i did not use . i went through all of them and selected the fast flashing pace . it is a matter of personal taste . but it has plenty of settings in my opinion . i would recommend it to anyone that wants a rechargable light . you can use the charger from another usb mini-reg usb , they all work with it . that is why i did not buy the charger . you can also use the charger from the cygolite front lamp if you have it . i have the 400 model and it works fine .	1
I attached this to my helmet ( replacing a Flea light that fell off and got lost somewhere ) .Since it charges from the bottom with a standard mini USB connection ( there is a rubber flap protecting the port ) , there is no need to ever take it off the helmet , so I attached it with zip ties and electrical tape ( I am not loosing another light ) .It is perhaps the brightest tail light on the market , gets great reviews everywhere I look , and it should serve me well . Judging by what I have seen elsewhere , cars coming up behind be , even before the sun goes down , will be able to see my Hotshot blinking long before they can actually see me and my bike . This is a VERY good thing . After biking for 40 years , I am very grateful that technology has reached the point that I do not have to change batteries so often and can have a brighter light to boot.I bought the one with the charger simply because it is only 6 bucks for the charger and since everything uses USB for power these days , you can never have too many . It has an output of 700ma . The Cygolite Expilion headlight ( which I also have attached to my helmet ) comes with the same charger.The lower portion of the light ( much less bright than the main light ) blinks while charging and becomes a steady light with fully charged.Some complain that a covered port is a potential problem as you may loose the cover and water may enter , however , I love the fact that any of the 6 mini USB charging cables I have can be used and it can be charge without removing it from my helmet . Ideally , they would borrow the idea from Apple notebooks and the Blackburn Flea and create a magnetic connection , but until then , this will have to do .	1
This is a blazing little light . My ride evening ride group comments on this light range from , & # 34 ; Damn that is bright ! & # 34 ; to & # 34 ; Thanks for having it - makes me feel safer & # 34 ; , and & # 34 ; Where can I get one ? & # 34 ; I have taken to riding with bright tail lights , even at daytime after too many cyclists in our area where run down by cars that claimed to not have seen them . At least it is an attempt to get rid of that excuse.I have had many different tail lights and like this one best . It was n't the most costly but it works exceptionally well and is convenient to re-charge with the USB cable .	1
This light is brighter than my Blackburn Mars 4.0 . There has been discussion about the directional limitation of the light . I 'm not sure it is a limitation for traffic approaching directly from behind.I 'm getting a little weirded out my some of the less than friendly motorist . Especially the third-in-line , race home to meet the school bus , tailgaters that are yakking on their cell phones . There 's a 5 watt , extremely bright light on the market for $ 220 . I may buy it the next time I get buzzed . $ 220 sounds expensive , but so does medical bills . Stepping down for my soapbox now .	1
Tiny buttons are awkward and having to press for 1s to turn off is a silly PITA.It should be immediate on/off , and hold to switch modes . Who changes modes anyway ? Surely you choose one and stick with it.It 's nice and bright though . I came up behind another one on the commute and was curious to see what the awesome light up ahead was . Glad to see it was the same as mine - the brightest I see day to day . The beam seems fairly tight but in practice it is plenty wide . As cars approach from the distance they 're bound to be in the bright area , and when they 're closer and out of the main beam it 's still plenty bright .	1
This light is so bright I can see it in the mirror when it reflects off signs I have passed . Another biker passed me with the identical light and I could see it for about 1/2 mile . It has several modes , but I have found the single flash be the best and brightest . I charge it up about once every 2 weeks . Great bargain ! Updated 10/19/13 : I like this light so much I bought a second one for the back . I do a lot of night biking and I want to make sure people see me when they come upon me . With two of these lights on the rear of my bike now , I notice people slowing down more . This is the best light for your safety ! ! !	1
Wow- I turned the light on out of the box yesterday when it arrived and I looked at it straight on and it blinded me..Seriously - it freakin blinded me for a second or two . PERFECT- This kind of intensity is what EVERY biker needs to get drivers attention . For $ 30 ? Bargain !	1
I had my doubts at first but this is a really good taillight . The light is very bright at nights and so far I have not had any issues . Some people have mentioned having problems with the buttons and yes they really are hard to press sometimes but to me that 's not a really big issue . Right now I have it hooked up under the seat in the back and everything is still working even in rainy conditions .	1
Wondering which of the many red flashers on Amazon is most likely to be seen during daylight hours ? It 's the Cygolite Hotshot . There 's a good comparative review of the fifteen most popular flashers on the Australian edition of Gizmodo , dated 3/17/2012.I think a lot of customer reviews make the mistake of judging the brightness of a front or rear flasher from up close . Everything seems bright by that standard . What you really need to do is park the bike , then walk the length of an American football field away . Three hundred feet only provides a five second warning to a car closing at 40 miles per hour . Anything less does n't leave time for the driver to react.In my opinion , the Hotshot 's most attention grabbing mode is constant flash set to about two flashes per second . This setting is almost blinding out to 300 feet or more beginning one-half hour before sunset . It 's actually too bright beginning one-half hour after sunset , and you 'll need to switch to a less intense mode such as triple flash or random flash.Of course , you should n't feel invincible given that no flasher is effective against a drunk or distracted driver . You 'll find that out quickly enough.The Cygolite is bright enough to be better than nothing even during full daylight . At the least , it is still the best available flasher for that purpose.The version with the 120V charging accessory is worth considering . The AC charger is good quality and allows me to charge the Hotshot out in the garage with the bike . It 's only an extra three dollars , so well worth the convenience.The all plastic construction is reasonably robust . If the push switches become difficult to operate , it only means that the red elastomeric cover over the circuit board switches has become dislodged . It 's easily put back into place.The cons : ( 1 ) Limited mounting options . Basically , you ca n't use this flasher if you do n't have enough exposed seat post to clamp around . I had to improvise a seat stay mount because my hybrid bike has a shock post that 's about four inches tall when lowered fully . A shock post is way too big in diameter to accept the Cygolite 's mounting strap . Cygolite 's customer service offered zero help , although they at least responded to my email . You 're also out of luck if you use a seat bag . If Cygolite wants the Hotshot to qualify as insanely great , then it should design and manufacture a mount to fit on the seat stays and include it with the Hotshot as standard equipment.Cygolite will tell you that you can always use the option to clip the Hotshot to your clothing . The clothing clip is integrated into the Hotshot . However , this really is n't an effective solution to universal mounting . The problem is that Cygolite has achieved the outstanding brightness of the Hotshot by confining most of the light to a tightly focused cone . Brightness falls off very rapidly beyond +/- 20 degrees of center . The Hotshot needs to be used with a rigid mount that accurately points its beam directly to rear , both horizontally and vertically . Letting the Hotshot bounce around on clothing means that its effective brightness will be unpredictable from moment to moment . ( 2 ) As others have noted , the elastomeric cover for the USB charging port pops open frequently .	1
This light is perfect in being bright and in rechargeable . I mountain bike a lot and have to use roads some times as a means to get to another trail . When mountain biking at night and having this on my tail I feel a lot safer and comfortable when I see head lights . it hold its charge well and stays on while I am bouncing off of rocks.This deserves its five stars !	1
I use these on & # 34 ; splatter & # 34 ; targets to stretch a little extra life out of each on and they work fine . They stick well , are big enough to cover more than one hole ( if your grouping is descent ) and they come in the box that automatically primes the next dot if you pull the feed tape gently .	1
Targets can be used several times now . Box has a nice `` one at a time '' dispensing system.I also use a colored marker to mark shots in the white .	1
What can I say they 're . Black dots ! If you need black dots . It 's a roll of black dots . Oh and did I mention they stick	1
Lets you get more mileage out of those paper targets . New holes show up great on these black pasters . Will buy again .	1
I waited for a while to write a review on this , to see how the treadmill would hold up to 1/2 marathon training . I am unable to run outside , because of visual impairments , so my training is solely done on this treadmill . I have been very pleased with it so far , and I 've run about 200 miles on it . The inclines are good , and I especially enjoy the interval training mode . As far as the complaints about the fan from previous reviews , I do n't find it a problem . It may not blow directly in your face , but I think it was designed to just circulate the air around a bit to cool you off . I rather like it . There are 3 settings to the fan , and I increase it as my workout continues . As far as the speaker on the board , well , that 's just a cheap speaker , nothing more , nothing less . I was n't expecting much in that department , so I was n't disappointed . I plug my I-pod into the treadmill , anyway , and use earbuds . That works perfectly , with no distortion . The digital read-outs on the panel are easy to see ( even with my visual impairment ) , and as far as treadmills go , the distance/calories calibration is okay . I could n't afford a more expensive treadmill , and considering the price & quality of this , I think it 's an excellent buy .	1
Great product with minimal assembly . Have two people assemble this product , it makes the setup a lot easier . The speakers are nice and loud , no bass though . The program selection is easy and diverse . The belt requires minimal maintenance .	1
I ordered the T101-3 for 690.00 from amazon.com and yesterday I received the T101-4 , which is the newest model . No problem getting the upgraded model except that the newer one in a separate listing was much cheaper . Called Amazon and they happily refunded me the difference , so am happy with that.T101-4 has a larger fan that seems to work fine , and a lot more exercise programs than the T101-3 . My daughters and I built it today and got it set up with no men ( thank you very much ) and got it adjusted . Seems to work fine , but it is new . As far as building it you have to have someone help you hold things and hold the items as you bolt them on . With a little bit of cussing , it is done . I am sure I will need to tighten the bolts again after everyone has used it a bit . The console and fan even holds my daughter 's laptop and she is using it now as she walks .	1
This is a very good treadmill , with heavy construction , and it does fold up for storage if space is a consideration for you . I knocked off a star because attaching the console proved to be fairly aggravating -- yes , it 's nice to hide those screwheads , designers , but sometimes tough to keep a lock on them when you ca n't see them.Usage-wise , though , I 'm glad I got this . The treadmill has multi-speed control and various programs , of course , but what really surprised me was the flexibility regarding incline . It can be set from 0 to 10 percent , which is far better than I expected from a treadmill at this price in the home market.Walking surface of this one seems exceptionally soft , which is a treat for the feet . Ergonomics are good although the grips that activate the heart-rate monitor are a bit too low for me , and I 'm only 6 ' 1 '' although I do have long arms.I was seeking a good treadmill that I think will last . Makes it easier to walk or run on those days when the weather forecast is bleak .	1
I like this a lot , but I often get an E1 error unless I increase the speed right away above the start speed of .5 mph . I have been able to fix it by adjusting the sensor up front on the left next to the front roller , but it is very sensitive and gets jostled from running so the error will come back . We have learned just to immediately get the speed up to 1mph or higher and its no biggie . It tends to be a bit squeaky when you run it due to the cushion deck as well . It has held up well and I really like connecting my iphone or ipad to it for watching a Netflix video or listening to music . As others have mentioned , the built in fan is week once you are really hot you wo n't even feel it on .	1
Fit me nicely , maybe a bit large for my medium sized hand . I used it for 2 games and it is already broken in .	1
This is a nice glove , bought it for slow pitch softball and only used for about 10 games but it was great . Comes pretty soft already but does require some breaking in . Definitely had the nicest glove on the field after purchasing this .	1
For summer leagues this mitt works great . It is large yet it doesnt drop the ball . I just hope it lasts long , but the leather is pretty soft out of the box so I do n't know how long it will last for . The glove was quick to break-in too !	1
I have only used it for a day and great glove immediately way better than the Wilson A 1000 I got two weeks ago . I ordered that since I am in Colombia and good gloves here are hard to find and expensive . I was always a Wilson guy and my old Wilson was stolen at a game . But the A 1000 was not a great mitt and I left a mediocre review on it . I ordered this 14 & # 34 ; and a 13 & # 34 ; model and both are great . Fit my hand easily and was immediately excellent in the field . Great pocket and needs some breaking in but played a game with it in the outfield and the 13 & # 34 ; at second and both did an excellent job right out of the box .	1
I have played years and years of softball , and could never give up my baseball mitt from high school . I was too afraid of trying a & # 34 ; new thing & # 34 ; when my old mitt had been so good to me . The FIRST ball I caught ... I was shocked at the fact my hand did NOT sting ... I 'd grown so accustomed to dealing with a painful line drive or catching the ball at the top of my hand , it was just expected . I played the entire evening and never once stung from a catch . I have NO idea why I waited so long . GREAT , glove !	1
I bought a pair of these in white for my daughter to use while playing softball . They have held up very well and fit her comfortably . She 's 11 years old ( but tall for her age ) and wears a woman 's size 7 in shoes ( 7.5 in Mizuno cleats ) . I bought her the size medium and they were a perfect fit . She has thick calves and some brands of socks cut into her skin , but not these . The prefect softball socks !	1
My teenager roommates use these for sports events at the varsity lievel in high school and like them a lot . That means I like them as well .	1
These were n't too tight as some knee-high socks tend to be . They stayed in place and was easy to tuck my pants under them for the old school look . Nice !	1
Exactly what I wanted at an affordable price . They stay up , even over slippery pants . I wear them both for running and Crossfit , so I 've washed them many , many times , and they keep their compression capacity and color very well .	1
the color and quality are great . I am 5'8 '' and these socks come up to my knees which is what I wanted . they have nice thickness to them and are very comfortable . great protection for sliding . I got the large size and are perfect . everything I have ever bought from the mizuno brand has been quality . cant go wrong getting these .	1
The gf really likes this towel . She returned another brand and got this instead based on reviews so I 'm adding another positive one . She is n't the sweatiest person in the hot yoga room but she still likes to feel supported and she has n't complained of slippage once.Hope that helps .	1
Really strong rubber smell when first used but that seems to be leaving after several washings . Nice , soft . Works as well as I expected though it 's not going to be as grippy as a bare yoga mat . The color was true to the picture .	1
So it worked well for a couple weeks , but during a lunge workout , it snapped on me . I liked it and thought it was a great product until this happened . I noticed small rips on the band . This could have been the issue .	-1
I have several different bands and these are the least likable , they do not stretch enough and make it way to difficult to use	-1
As most exercise products , these were used a few times , and stored away in the bag for a few months . I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights , and the bands are starting to discolor and fade . Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening ...	-1
I wish I would have taken the warnings I read in some of the other reviews seriously ! I purchased these bands and loved them the first 2 times I used them . The handles make the bands very comfortable to hold . They seemed to be high quality . I am 5'3 '' and the stretch was plenty for me , though if you are tall I 'm not so sure this set of bands would work for you . After my first 2 uses I would have given these bands 5 out of 5 stars , but after today 's workout there 's no chance ! While I was using the yellow band the hardware snapped and hit my leg . Thankfully it hit our concrete garage floor before hitting my leg . I 've attached photos of the hardware issue -- as you can see one of the handles becomes disconnected even with the slightest amount of pull . It seems that the peg that keeps the clip attached to the band is too small for the hole.All in all I would say do n't waste your money ! I 'm going to cough up a little more money and buy actual dumbbells .	-1
I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon . On my first use , the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one . I will never buy anything with Outers written on it . I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit .	-1
My kit arrived with parts missing . Everything was in disarray , with just a few parts resting in their spots . After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs , I opted to send it back . The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap kit . I did n't even try to use it ... just packed it up and sent it back . What a disappointment .	-1
Piece of crap . The black push rod handle cracked in half the first time I used it and the copper bristles fall out of the pieces . Lots of sizes to use but what 's the point when they are all low quality garbage	-1
used it for a year or so and definitely have had to buy better equipment . the skinny cleaning rod- snapped.. the thicker cleaning rod- also snapped . i 'm not one to apply heavy force on these , they 're just very soft/cheap . the brushes are decent enough . after spending cash on a nicer kit , i guess i learned my lesson . if you have the funds skip and buy something a little nicer .	-1
I have to laugh at this one . The cheesy picture behind the hole , the fake & # 34 ; traps & # 34 ; , the generally terrible build quality ... it 's so lame it is in fact kind of funny . But for 40 bucks the joke 's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball . For that it gets an extra star.I 'd give this four stars at 15 , and five at 10 . But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same , so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks , there 's always lots around . Or buy one here for far less than this . Or just use a glass on its side on the rug . But OMG , then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself ! One tip : put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll , makes it more fun too .	-1
Cheap product ! Within two days of use it started to loose air where I found a pin size hole and is now no longer useable . You could buy the same product ( also made in china ) at local stores for 1/4 the price . I would not recommend this product .	-1
This must be more ideal for a handgun . The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15 , Remington 12 gauge , nor my Reuger .22 . The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger , however , when I tried that , I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun . The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved . I should have returned it , but I was lazy .	-1
this lock is useless on my glock and shotgun and only barely fits very awkwardly on my sig sauer . it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too . it is bulky and you 're better off getting a small lock box instead of this . it may sound good until you try in on and it does n't fit or barely fit , not to mention it may scratch up the gun . this claims to fit many or most guns but it doesnt fit the popular ones out there like the ones i have . what 's worse is that the 3rd digit on the combo gets stuck and is difficult to move . that would totally render this lock totally useless . it doens't fit and if it does fit it would take you forever just to roll the digits over to your code to unlock it ! overrated lock .	-1
It did n't work on an AR -15 , AK 74 , or a Remington 870 shotgun . After I adjusted and squeezed the two pieces together as tight as I could , I could still provide enough force to twist the unite sideways and to engage the trigger . I was trying to save money , but you ca n't save money if it does n't work . The weakness is that it does n't have pins that surround the trigger AND the trigger guard . All it has is a single & # 34 ; rachet post & # 34 ; .Imagine having a single post in front of your trigger ( hopefully behind the trigger ) that is held secure only by the pressure of the two sides squeezing together . The unit works only if you can squeeze it tight enough around the grip or the slide to hold it in place . Weak ! ! ! The Pro Lok is an EXCELLENT lock ! ! ( But $ 34 ) It has lighting speed access , movable pins to get infront and BEHIND the trigger , it has a key if you want , and an extra enclosed chain if you want . That provides a rock solid hold on the trigger , and two other forms of backup if you want it . ( key and chain ) I am not sure why this lock has so many good reviews . It makes me feel like I am missing something here . If I am missing something , please leave a reply and I can change my review .	-1
I purchased two of these for my Glock and my AR . Neither one fits on securely due to the shape of the lock . I have tried to attach these to both my firearms in various ways to get a solid , secure hold and each time I am able to twist and move the lock enough to gain access to the trigger . I thought this product was exactly what I was looking for , but it does not serve its purpose	-1
Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However , on my two lever-action rifles , it 's not very effective -- probably no surprise , given the design . On an older Winchester 94 , I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together , with some effort . On a Winchester 9422 , it attaches itself to the trigger guard , and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used . The rifle can be loaded , cocked , and fired with the lock still in place .	-1
My husband bought this for our two year old son ... and it was just too big for him to use . So , we thought we 'd wait . We had it outside , under a tarp and within two months , it started to rust . Once it started , the rust could n't stop . So basically , a big waste of money.Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler .	-1
I would never buy this trike again for a child . It tips VERY easily when the child 's weight leans even the slightest bit forward or to the side . Enough said . Money wasted and damage done .	-1
4 month update ! well after about 4 month it has completely lost it 's sharpening ability . minding that i do a lot of cutting , and I used this on every knife around the house . However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer . all an all i 'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review : Sharpens the knives like never before ! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it ) . rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade . works very well on a variety of steel grades .	-1
Product arrived missing the Green 1200 grit stone . I only received the Red 600 grit , and Blue 325 grit stones . Although DMT makes a great product , I think these sharpening stones are too small and awkward for sharpening knives . I will stick with the Diafold sharpeners from DMT .	-1
So you gain a nice , checkered , flatter surface on your classic SD . You lose your toothpick and your tweezers . Sound like a good deal on a multi tool that is that thin and small to begin with ? Honest , I was about to order one . How cool would it be to have a larger Alox tool AND it 's little brother ? How cute would that be if they matched ? ! But , then I thought about how not having the extra few tools would stink , added to the fact that the classic SD is already super tiny to begin with . So tiny , it literally will disappear if misplaced.. It just did n't make any sense to me.My guess is that if you have an Alox style companion to this , you might want it . But I do , and I do n't want it for the reasons listed . It simply does n't add any value when you lose tools on an already super slim product . You 're paying more for less , essentially . I do n't like throwing money away , so I 'll stick with my classic SD cellidor scales for now . My honest opinion of course . Take with a grain of salt .	-1
ORIGINAL : It is like a Yellow Ferrari : ) The color in the picture is faithful to reality . All tool are excellent as expected but beware that this is very small knife . A true keyring thin short knife and micro scissors : ) UPDATE : After first use , I noticed that the keyring is at the wrong end of the knife and right end of the scissors . Maybe this knife in reality is a nail-clipper ( scissor to clip and file to smooth out and the knife is a novilty that goes with the name . I am updating my review to 1 just so they may listen otherwise the knife is worth 3.5 stars max 4.ACTIONI think we should all update our ratings to 1 for Victronix to listen up or as one of the reviewer said already that he has contacted them since 2o years ago but no one listen .	-1
Looked forward to replacing my Classic knife on my keychain because the scissor feature did not perform well . The two halves of the scissor bind and only open partially unless you manually assist it each stroke . So I ordered a new one . It arrived , incorrect style , quickly corrected by Amazon customer service . But the correct knife arrived and was a continued quality disappointment . The scissor feature on the new one is as bad as the old one . I have many Swiss Army knives and have previously believed their quality and customer service were first rate . I contacted SA and received a response stating they would look into my quality concern . A couple weeks went by and they replied that their scissor spring had not changed . Period . Hardly addresses the poor performance I reported to them . And the spring was never the problem anyway . The two cutting faces of the scissor are too tight.Bottom line ... Poor or deteriorating product quality and sadly poor customer service to match .	-1
I agree with all of the other reviewers here that say the key ring is at the wrong end of this & # 34 ; Knife & # 34 ; making the knife unusable while atached to your keys.The construction of everything Victorinox is first rate , no doubt , but I ca n't understand why these are made this way .	-1
Todays version of this knife does n't come even in thin plastic container-it comes in only thin paper box . The shiny handle material on mine was all scratched . The distributors of Swiss Army knife here in States got a bit cheap on its presentation of a fine knife . I remember when I bought Victorinox years ago and it was in a nice box inside of which was made in a special shape to accommodate shape of knife . Now they do n't include instruction manual , knife can be scratched , and it ( knife ) just dangles in thin paper box . Not a good present for someone indeed . But as tool it is quite good . If you want to give someone a present repackage it yourself . Again new knife came all scratched up , maybe manufacturer in Switzerland do n't know that American distributors just screwing up here . I hope for the sake of a good knife they will.Update : Retuned this one to Amazon for replacement . Got new one today . It looks the same-plastic handle all scratched up , wo n't return this one , but wo n't consider it as a present to someone either .	-1
There are a number of great credit card knives , ( so called because they are when folded the size of a credit card ) made by both S.O.G . which makes the `` Access card '' , and Spyderco which makes the `` Spydercard '' . The cost nearly is the same and the others have actual useful blades . This thing is cheap , cheap , cheap incomparison . Do yourself a favor and take a look at those others before buying this one .	-1
I am a big fan of the peppermint version of this line of soap , and the Hemp Tea Tree was as good in terms of functionality ... but it smelled very strong , and it had a vague aroma of gasoline , which I 'm not a fan of bathing myself in.I thought I was going crazy , but other people who used it said the same.weird . But if that 's what you 're into , you 'll love the soap .	-1
This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather . I never felt clean using this because it does n't lather . I would use some with a loofa , and I 'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session . I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash ! I 'm sure it was cleaning just fine , but I have oily skin and need the & # 34 ; reassurance & # 34 ; soap lather provides.Basically , if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap .	-1
the reason i purchased this was because i read some review on pintrest that it works to clean pans . Well first it has palm oil and 2nd who the heck writes such junk on a bottle ? the thing creeped me out .	-1
Product is was too pricey . DO NOT USE ON YOUR HAIR ! It says you ca use it on hair and body but it dries and damages the hair . If you 've a sensitive sense of smell then you can smell the hemp in it . Gave it to a friend who seemed to like it . I will stick with Bath and Body Works ( - ;	-1
I 've used Thera-Band balls at the place where I got physical therapy and I know they are great quality . The issue I had was that the ball I received did not come with an adapter that would allow me to inflate it with a bicycle pump , nor did it come with a plug . So basically it was unusable , as you ca n't inflate it without a plug to stop the air from exiting once it 's inflated . Also , if you do n't get an adapter for a bicycle pump , you will need some sort of pump that can fit into the hole of this ball to inflate it.As much as I love the brand , I would recommend a different ball that comes as a kit with a hand pump , plug , etc . I ended up getting a GAIAM ball and have been very pleased .	-1
I 'm convinced that these mattresses have the wrong type of valve . It has a small nipple and after you inflate the mattress you push in on it to retract the valve back inside of the mattress . The valve is just like the valve is on a cheap beach ball.One other thing I did n't like was the size . The add say 's it 's 26.5 wide but when you blow it up it 's less which makes for too tiny of a mattress if you 're using it for sleep instead of a water floatation raft.I had bought several of these for camping and returned them all and replaced them with the same companies ( INTEX ) extra wide mattresses . The valves on the extra wide are totally different . They 're made with a hard vinyl valve that 's recessed into a hard vinyl pocket . The valve is made so when you put air in it wo n't come out . It has a stop on the inside if the valve that 's like a flap that closes when air starts to escape . To deflate you just unscrew the valve and it deflates in seconds.I would highly recommend ( anyone interested in a great quality mattress ) the INTEX extra wide . Only 6 dollars more .	-1
I thew this garbage away after spending only 1 night on it . Kept deflating and I had to wake up repeatedly to re-inflate it . Be careful - if you order one you might get a leaker and spend a miserable night on it .	-1
The light itself is so-so . The mount is cheap and poorly designed . I put one on my Stepdads bike it fell and broke on the 3rd week.Do n't buy it .	-1
Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo ( Whereas my front light was gray in hue , unlike the black/gray one you see here ) thinking it was a good buy , wrong ! This product is as shoddy as most `` BEll products '' are.The rear light went out first , then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i 've learned not to trust the viability of `` Bell products '' ever again.That 's why i 'm now a `` Cateye 's '' and `` Nite Ize '' product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost .	-1
Bought two for the fam , used once , did n't hold air for more than a few hours then had only about half , which is where it stayed , and that was before ever , ever put any weight on them , in the middle of the day . And yes , I double-checked the plug . Also removed all rocks from the sandy tent pad , used a quality tent tarp underneath a quality tent , as well , though since had n't put any weight on either of them when they lost the air that should n't have mattered anyway.Did I love the carrying bags ? Oh yeah . Also loved the nice new ( to me ) plug system which made blowing it up and sealing quickly while still full of air very easy . Too bad the part that really matters - holding air - was so immensely inadequate . Returned them immediately after returning from camping trip , now have to go find something else after having shopped for this till thought would drop ... '' thanks '' Coleman ... arrgghh .	-1
I bought this mattress about 6 weeks ago , to replace an older model of Coleman Queen-Sized air mattress that lasted 2 years , before it started to leak.Within a week , this mattress developed a slow leak - had to pump it up about once a week - I thought , Well , that 's not too much trouble , but it certainly does n't match the quality of the older model.Then , a few days ago , it developed more ( or a larger ) leak ( s ) - now , it deflates in about 4 hours - pitiful . Someone said it came with patches - mine didn't.I suggest you buy something else - I am going to - do n't know which one yet.Buyer beware - the quality has went spiraling down , faster than the leak *__*	-1
The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad . Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize . The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft . The unit just does n't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose .	-1
It 's rechageable which means it is for convenience.Yes , it 's quite convenient and works well.However , it 's rechageable which means the battery wo n't last forever.After less than 50 times of recharging , it dies.I recommend 12V or 120v one if you can use power outlet at the site .	-1
While we love the goggles ( my boys are n't fans of the typical style ) and they are amazingly easy to put on , we had one pair crack in numerous places around the seal after just one season of use . We do not abuse them , so I do n't know how or why it occurred , but I did buy a pair to replace them . If the others crack I 'll update ! The sun-tinted goggles are perfect for my little guy with sun sensitive eyes . They fit my 4 year old ( first wore them at 3 ) and 6 year old both well , I just need to make sure they are sealed before they jump into the pool.Updating a few months later - the sun-tinted goggles only lasted 4 months of weekly ( twice a week in the summer ) . The last pair is barely hanging on and I 'm guessing they will likely last a few more swim lessons before they start allowing water in . The seal has cracked on each pair of goggles , and I treat them the exact same way that I treat my own swim goggles that I 've had for years.I do not recommend these goggles , I do n't think they are worth buying a new pair this often . I have n't read other people 's reviews lately , part of me wonders if there is something I 'm not doing that they need that my own goggles do n't ? If anyone has an idea , please let me know !	-1
This is a very small , not average sized Razor . I had bought one a few years ago for my daughter and she still rides & loves it . I bought this one for my 6 year old boy , thinking it was the same size . He ca n't even get both feet on the deck . I do not recommend this razor for anyone older than 4 .	-1
I dont know the condition the item was stored in , but I had serious emulsion problems . Parts of the images would not develop or would show up discolored . In the future I plan to purchase from a local reputable camera store	-1
It 's just not enough cushion for my poor tail bone ! Perhaps the thin layer of gel may be enough for people already accustomed to riding , but for those just getting into or ( like in my case ) back into the sport , I 'd suggest padded shorts instead . Those definitely eased the pain a lot more than the seat cover .	-1
I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly , it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat . It worked pretty well for a while , but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material . That was it , it was ruined . It lasted one season of riding . Felt good when it worked . It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat . After a good season of riding i did n't need it any more , the standard saddle is fine .	-1
I bought it not for softening my saddle . The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions . So I bought this product purely as a `` cover '' and I did n't make much research on this item , supposing that `` any will fit '' First of all , I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product . It is unreasonably heavy , very heavy . It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles , but its not the best idea . If you apply it on narrow saddle , than you cant fix this cover at all . It moves and slips all the time . Fixing strand is another bad idea . In fact , I ca n't find any positive point in this product thus I ca n't recommend it . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I was lucky enough to use this over a period of a few weeks while at my mother 's house . It does not provide an aerobic workout compared to a treadmill or an elliptical . There is very little resistance . It is squeeky . The movements are jerky compared to an elliptical . It take sup a lot of space . I found no value to it since it did n't get my heart rate up , it was n't working any muscles , and it did n't provide a core work out . Not sure what the purpose would be . I am not a very aerobically fit person and can easily work up a sweat on other equipment within a few minutes so not getting an aerobic workout here really says a lot . So , I do n't even think that this is a good machine for beginners.On the positive side , all of the grandchildren love to swing on it and play on it . ( that probably is n't a positive for my mother though ) . The kids think it is fun .	-1
Setting up a new camping outfit , we got a new tent , air mattress , lantern and camping stove , all Coleman . The tent and air mattress : great ! The lantern : terrific ! The stove : not too good.We did not have the problem that many others seem to have had ; namely , an aluminum tray that catches and is not secured to the base properly . And , as with older models , the design is a winner -- adjustable wind flaps , and folding and carrying that are well-thought out ( as long as you are able to carry the portable propane tanks separately ) .BUT , the raison d'etre of a stove is ... . HEATING . You can not control the flame on this thing . No matter how precisely you adjust the flame , no matter how carefully you remove your hand from the knob , the flame immediately goes to high . It would be more accurate to have an on/off switch instead of a knob . This was okay when we wanted to boil water , but trying to actually cook was not at all pleasant . This was true on both burners.Coleman should be ashamed . Is this the start of the demise of the Coleman reputation ? Surely the company knew about this before these went out to the public . I wo n't be so quick to assume a Coleman product is good quality anymore . Of all the things to get wrong ! You would n't think a stove 's heating capabilities would be considered optional by the manufacturer.I thought about exchanging this item , but the number of reviewers making the same complaint indicates a return is more in order . Our next stove will not be Coleman .	-1
As long as you do n't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit . You see , the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings . No problem if you 're trying to warm a kettle of water , a bigger problem if you 're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast . My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end ( as opposed to side by side with this one ) , and it worked great . You 're on the right track , but keep looking ... stay with propane , but away from this model . I 've seen others comment with this same concern , so it is a quality control/product issue . C'mon Coleman ... build it US , build it right .	-1
I have owned three of these stoves over the years . i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model . The windscreens are cheaply , made , fall off the stove which then doesnt support the rear screen . Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid . The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it .	-1
The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions , I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED . I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing . Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating . The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating . For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it . For more advanced boxers , spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight . Wraps are not flexible and too short . Bag gloves are unnecessary .	-1
Not worth the price I paid . I purchased 2 of these mats in search of the Everlast mats that are like the ones in my gym . These look the same but they are n't solid like the old ones . They are better than some of the cheaper versions but again , NOT worth the price . If you expect to get a good sturdy mat like Everlast used to make , this mat is NOT it ! I guess they just do n't make them like the older version . The original Everlast mats were n't made of sponge . Do n't know what they were made of but they 're much better than these and yes , my ORIGINAL mats are still going strong . I 'm not sure these will last very long at all.You can see in the picture how the vinyl looks wrinkled . That 's because it is and it does n't fit tight like the original . $ [ .. ] would have been worth the price for the original but not for this one , definitely not the $ [ .. ] they are asking now !	-1
Does not fit well on a large adult male head . Perhaps my melon is too large but other goggles have fit well , these are too tight . If you have a medium to smaller size head these would likely perform just fine .	-1
This was a once great American iconic brand , and it was the best insulated bottle out there . Not anymore . Does not have the insulating properties that the older American made models have and the handles are spot welded and cheap . Do not buy .	-1
The original model i was looking for ( 24oz food jar ) was sold out everywhere , so i picked this one up . I was impressed by the labeling that promised to keep liquids hot for 24hrs.First thing i did was a temp test with boiling water . 8pm : preheat bottle and fill with boiling liquid . Sealed Securely . 8am next morning ( 12hrs in a typical work day ) : Water is room temperature . I might as well have left it in a plastic container . The packaging explicitly says it will keep liquids hot for 24hrs and cold for 32hrs . This seems to be false . I did several leak tests , did the test all over again , with the same result . Water is cold by the time i open the bottle 12 hours later.I did notice that this bottle becomes noticeably warm to the touch after being filled with the liquid . For an insulated bottle , it seems to be giving off a lot more heat than it should ... i dunno ... be insulating ? Any time you introduce cost-cutting into manufacturing ( such as outsourcing to china ) you probably lose out on some consistency , which is why a few customer here have reported duds . I am likely the recipient of a lemon . I cant say for sure that the claims Stanley-pmi makes are false , but in my experience there is a large gap between the quality Stanley advertises and what it delivers .	-1
I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA . I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is . While it may look like the old American made Stanley , it is just a veneer of it 's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk . I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation . Do n't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago .	-1
Complete junk . As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI , the people that bought Aladdin , really have no idea how to make things . Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly . PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place , but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price . Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty , I bought a vintage one off of ebay . The quality is night and day . The vintage stanleys were truly built to last . PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys , but they can not steal the quality of the original .	-1
Now some folks have a fit if you write a review and do n't own the product which has happened to me . However I feel the main value of reviews is to try and get an accurate sense of the quality , reliability and dependability of a product before you buy it . Cost is also a factor as is most important ; the product warranty and how the company handles it.This product is a classic example of something I would quickly purchase based on their prior reputation.I have a 38 year old stainless steel foam insulated vacuum bottle that needs replacement . I said to a friend in the ice shanty & # 34 ; It 's time for a new Stanley. & # 34 ; However after shopping here I will have to alter that statement.Almost 30 % of the reviews are 3 stars or less which means a lot of unhappy purchasers who thought they were buying traditional American quality and not new Chinese trash.Like any wise buyer I am willing to pay a little more for quality and reputation but no stupid enough to buy junk . Thanks for the great reviews . I will be doing one in the future on the Thermos I will buy .	-1
Bought this for my 6 year old nephew . He liked jumping on it but when he would jump on it the legs would slowly bend inward ( into storage position ) and have to be constantly re-positioned . Returned it .	-1
I bought these for a seven year old who is learning to skateboard . These are not a great fit ( much too big ) for his legs , and the plastic dome portion just slips around . He also has trouble putting these on himself and it takes me quite some time to help him .	-1
These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself . I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid 's sized , but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing . The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight , and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically . The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads ... except that they are even tighter than the knee pads ; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off ... I 'll probably never use the elbow pads again . The knee pads at least do an `` okay '' job at protecting my knees ( so long as they stay on ) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents . I 'll never be buying these again , nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children ... . ( in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them . )	-1
This chain and lock 's price is consistent with the level of security it provides , however , it is far too heavy.The only claims about the chain are that it is `` high tensile steel '' . However , tensile strength is not how bike chains are attacked . Tensile strength means pulling , and many hardware store chains provide good strength for hauling and securing things against that kind of resistance . However , cutting attacks involve shear and compression forces , and the properties of steel are quite different for resisting these kinds of forces . Many things with high tensile strength will cut like butter.Low security has its place , however , this lock is the right price , but it is far too heavy . One can get an equally low security cable lock which weighs far less and is more compact . Or one can get a higher security chain ( for medium security , I would recommendKryptonite Keeper Integrated Chain Bicycle Lock ) which has a chain designed to resist cutting attacks.This Mongoose chain is too easily cut , and provides very low security . It can be cut with bolt cutters one can conceal on one 's person , and as such , it provides no more security than a cheap cable lock in terms of how bike thieves actually operate.The padlock is of low quality as well , and the one I have is very difficult to close as the tolerances are horrible . It is a big padlock of very low quality , and the chain provides very little resistance against cutting attacks .	-1
DOE . Did not work out of the package . Tried the provided battery first , nothing . Bought another battery thinking it was probably just old , still did n't work . Never powered up . Never displayed anything . It was returned ( thank you for the great return policy Amazon ! )	-1
I bought this for my wife 's bike because I am very happy with a similar unit from Schwinn I bought for mine last year . Unfortunately on this one the latch that holds the head unit to the handlebar mount is very weak and the unit will come off all too easily . Sometimes it works loose while riding . Fortunately when that happens you will see the speedo stop working and you have time to get it secured before it drops off completely .	-1
It 's ok , it does the job , but the problem is that It does n't stay in it 's little clip very well . Many times I 've knocked it out and it fell off or I was riding along and it was n't logging the last ? ? ? miles ? Other than that it 's ok .	-1
I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I 've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me . Right out of the packaging , this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable , but it 's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I 'm riding on a layer of wood.Also , the product description says that it is designed for `` spin bikes '' and does n't say that it 's made only for Schwinn spin bikes , so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike . However , it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it , even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible . This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs , which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I 'll continue to use this since I ca n't return it since I 've used it a few times , but I 'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand .	-1
The first time I rode my bike with this seat cover in place , I was really pleased . It was nice and soft and the center cut-out made it much more comfortable than the flat seat pad I 'd been using before . But as soon as I got off my bike after that first ride , I saw little sticky white blobs all over the cover . The gel was leaking out through the fabric . At first I did n't think it was a big deal . I told myself that maybe there was just a little excess gel in there and the leaking would stop once the extra gel had been squeezed out . But no such luck . It kept on leaking little lumps of gel every time I rode.Then I realized that the gel was not only leaking out through the fabric , it was shifting into the center cut-out . I tried taking a heavy needle and thread and stitching around the edge of the cut-out in an effort to hold the gel in place , but it did n't work . It 's no longer shifting toward the center of the pad , but it 's shifting everywhere else in every direction , creating uncomfortable bumps and bulges . I 've barely had the seat cover a month , and it 's a bedraggled lumpy mess.So if you 're considering buying this , I have one word of advice : do n't .	-1
This would be a really good product if it fit the seat on my bike . After reading some of the other reviews , I had some doubt about purchasing this item . A lot of people were talking about outdoor bikes and spin bikes , and how the cover did not fit . I have a Schwinn Stationery bike , so I thought maybe it would fit because it was a different type of bike . Wrong answer , the width of the cover is not wide enough and the length is not long enough . I was very disappointed . I am just going to detach my seat and take it to a bike shop where I can purchase the right seat cover for it .	-1
When they arrived I took one look and was very disappointed . One of them had a broken globe , so I 'll have to resend it out for another one . These were supposed to be stocking stuffers , but I do n't give people stuff I do n't recommend myself . The ones I was sent were gold in color and they do n't even look like a & # 34 ; Coleman & # 34 ; lantern ( Like the one in the picture )	-1
Hard to beat the price but I did n't expect that Casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing . I gave the watch away a day after I got it .	-1
You get what you pay for.I needed the strap for another watch . The watch was cheap enough to order . My strap broke on my other watch , so I ordered this to use the strap off of .	-1
The AirZooka may be a *little bit* of fun for a very young child , but overall it 's a pretty disappointing toy . I have to wonder if the people who seem to have had a great experience with this toy actually were able to purchase one pre-assembled . That 's because once all the pieces are together , this toy may hold the interest of some kids . But putting this toy together reveals how poorly designed and fragile it is . And personally I really did n't see the point once we did get it assembled.One of my nephews received a pair of these on Christmas Eve . Good thing he got a pair because only one survived . I , and several of my cousins , undertook the rather embarrassing endeavor of trying , and failing to correctly assemble these . It quickly turned into a joke along the lines of `` how many engineers does it take to assemble a simple children 's toy . `` The unit is made of three concentric rings , as you can see from the product picture , that must be extended before you can attach the handle and a sight . The two attachments are kind of shaped like christmas trees , but have some small tabs that are supposed to attach to the rings . These tabs are VERY fragile and be warned , if you break one of the 4 there is virutally no way to attach the handle . And without the handle , it 's impossible to use this toy for what it 's meant to be used . The three rings collapse into themselves if you try to just hold onto them and pull the air bag without the handle attached.Somehow we were able to at least get one of these put together . The pay-off was very anti-climactic for me . There 's a plastic bag inside the AirZooka that you can pull on and release to shoot a concentrated gust of air . I suppose if you caught somebody off guard it might be funny . But how long can that joke be re-used ? My nephew seemed to enjoy it OK , but after 15 minutes had moved on to his other toys . Considering three of us messed with this thing for 30 minutes to get it to work , the pay-off just did n't seem worth it . I also have to wonder how safe this toy is . If that rubber band were to break free , I could see the bag and pully being launched at somebody.I am surprised that others seemed to love this toy . To me , the poor quality was strike one . While some kids will find sneaking up on people with this to be fun for a little while , this also seems like a one-trick pony . For me that joke would get old fast.If you have n't removed yours from the box yet , exchange it for something else . And if you are considering this , I definitely do not recommend it at any price.Good luck .	-1
To be honest , I really wanted a Burley trailer for my kids and I do even more now after having dealt with the Quick N EZ trailer for a year . Our first trailer we got for $ 25 at a garage sale . It was also InStep but I do n't see that they make this style any longer . It had a hard plastic base as opposed to the canvas most ( if not all ) trailers are made of these days . My son would slip and slide all over . After just a few minutes of biking with no suspension and no seats , he 'd be slumped down with the straps around his neck.Needless to say , I was n't going to make him endure that any longer ! So we picked up the Quick and EZ for $ 80 . We were pleased with how easy it was to set up and how quickly it folded down , though it still was n't small enough to fit in the trunk of our Grand Prix . We now have a Sienna so it 's no longer an issue , but my son 's comfort was immediately a factor from the first time he was put in it . The hammock-style seat is straight up in the back , so when he falls asleep he just slumps over and looks very uncomfortable.Not only that , but the airflow inside the trailer is a HUGE concern for me . After 10 minutes of biking in 80ish degree weather , he is beet red and soaked in sweat . Now , he is not in direct sunlight so that 's not what 's heating him up . It 's that because the hammock seat is canvas and because the seat effectively goes from `` wall to wall '' inside the trailer , there is nowhere for the air to go , even though there is a vent in the back of the trailer . We started putting him in shorts and nothing else to try to keep him comfortable but he still gets extremely hot . How can I enjoy my ride when I know he is miserable ? And you can forget about putting two kids in this thing unless they 're very easy-going and do n't mind being squished together . When I was a daycare mom , I would regularly take my son and one of our daycare kids who was only 4 days younger than my son and about the same build , and the first few times they did nothing but fight ! Sure they were two 2-year-olds , but can you blame them ? The hammock seat forced them to lean into each other and make them even MORE hot ! Would you really enjoy riding in the car if you were pressed up against the person in the seat beside you the entire time ? Not likely ! Aside from that major complaint , I do have to complain that the small wheels and lack of suspension make for a very bumpy ride and I also feel bad subjecting my kids to that . Also , it would be nice if you could only partially lower the sun shade to keep your baby protected . When we 're going in the wrong direction , he always gets sun on his thighs and sometimes even his arms if the sun is high . We always put sunscreen on of course , but if I 'm going to expect him to sit in there while I bike for two hours , I 'd like to make sure he 's comfortable.So , all complaints aside , the trailer has one big plus . It 's price . You ca n't beat the price , but you get what you pay for . This summer I am seriously considering spending one of my bonus checks to get my son a wonderful Burley trailer . Yes , it 's $ 450 and probably not practical if you only bike once in a while , but seeing as we bike daily in warm weather and sometimes 2-3 times a day , I think the price is justified to make sure he enjoys it as much as I do . Burley trailers come with large wheels with suspension , a roll bar , PADDED BUCKET SEATS ! ! with mesh on the upper part to allow for good airflow , and padded seatbelts.Yep , definitely getting a Burley this year ! I 've waited long enough ! ; )	-1
I learned to cook on cast iron 50 years ago . What they sell now as cast iron is crap . Good cast iron cookware is surfaced on the inside bottom then seasoned so you have a flat surface . This junk they pass off now has all the grit of the sand mold left on the inside . You would need a heavy grinder to make this stuff useable.IT 'S TOTALLY WORTHLESS JUNK .	-1
SIGG fed on our fears of BPA and profited as we bought their BPA-laden bottles . Punish evil ; do n't buy their products !	-1
Sound quality was on par with my $ 29 Caldwell units , and those run about the same size overall . having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me , especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open . i never got the one side installed at all , so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options , and if they were n't on sale , it would be a shame to waste the money on them . Back to Amazon they go . Next guy gets 2 free batteries , I cant get the things out .	-1
Got these for my husband as he was looking to get a new ear protection for the range ... had lots of good and bad reviews but like most things its best to test it yourself.First impression WOW very compact and super sturdy ... instructions were a bit iffy on the battery needed . they could specify its needs AAA battery but other than that its great . Tested it out real fast in the garage banging a hammer against metal and it was great . Tested speech which had no problems at all . Highly would recommend this to anyone.Now the bad parts . Took them to an indoor range wearing them outside the shooting area sounded great , walked in and hear a BANG from a 9mm was like umm ok . Kept walking towards the lane and hear another .40cal go off had ringing in my ears . Right away I got out went grabbing regular nr25 slim protectors and it was a major difference . You must wear additional ear plugs using this at least for indoor range or anything powerful . Also no light for on and off light.Buy something else . Only reason it got 2stars for quality of build .	-1
A piece of junk . Low noise rating and poor quality amplified audio . This must be a made in China . Hard to replace batteries . Not well constructed . Would not recommend .	-1
This is the third pair I have had . The first was wonderful , lasted 3 years and you could hear a fly at 50 feet . The second pair lasted about 8 months , and the audio was much less than the first . The right ear unit stopped working . Third pair is junk . The volume reduced after a couple of weeks and the right ear quit after 6 months . Buy the Howard Leigh . They are going on two years now .	-1
Update 1/8/13- Now having these for 2 1/2 years , I am downgrading this recommendation even more . It is incredibly frustrating that they can not do the basics such as having some kind of indicator showing when the device is on or off . Even without that , it should have a marking on the earphones indicating on/off . Lazy design , lazy engineering , lazy thinking . They really do n't deserve your hard-earned money ! I rated these earphones as `` okay '' but not great . At the gun range , they definitely keep the sound down , but it 's the little things that it 's missing . For example:1 . It should have an LED indicator telling you if the earpiece is on or not . That 's annoying and can drain your batteries if you 're not careful , especially , since each ear turns on and off . In addition , it should at least give you an on/off indicator , even it it 's not an LED ! 2 . The overall hearing protector should have an adjustable head band . Not all head sizes are the same . I have an XL head and this barely covered my ears.3 . Installing the batteries is a major headache , that they should definitely make more user-friendly . I have a graduate degree and this thing took me 15 minutes to figure out.Bottom line , for the money , I expect more . Either pay more for a better model or go elsewhere .	-1
The current model of these is not what they used to be . I concurr with current reviewers on this major point.I bought a set for my 11 year old for a shooting kit to go with his new Henry Golden Boy.I 've had a previous generation set for years and mostly like them for the audio and protection and slimness . And knowing the negatives of the somewhat difficult to change batteries and the exposed knobs often turning them on in the bag - with no auto-off - killing the batteries ( thus getting into difficult to change batteries ) .But I ordered a set for my 11 year old because I knew them well and he really liked the fit and feel.I could immediately tell they were newer - the plastic moulding is ( acceptably ) different . I could not , without fear of wrecking the ear pads with excessive force , remove them to put in the batteries . Period . Pads would not come off without risk of damaging the pads . I trued the usual grips and angles I use on mine that help - but nope . So while I figured he 'd have difficulty and need my help on batteries - I was n't expecting myself , an experienced user of these , to find it impossible to access the batteries.So when 3M bought this from Peltor - they ruined them . Poor quality control on fit and finish of pads and battery access make these unusable.At the time I bought mine years ago - these were both the best and only in their class . That is not so now . Knowing the possibility I had also ordered and tried Howard Leight . Those my older son and I really like - but their rectangular pads wo n't cover the lower back corner of my 11 year old 's ear/head . So I 'm still searching for something for him . I may give him my older generation Peltor Tactical 6S and get Howard Leights or another perhaps higher end model for myself to replace them.EDIT 3/18 : Compared against Howard Leight 's . The Audio is crisper than the Howard Leight 's . No `` spacey '' sound . The Peltors did n't have as much gain ( volume ) . The Howard 's only had that `` spacey sound '' with volume turned up.So I gave my 14 year old theHoward Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffand my 11 year old will probably get these ( my older model pair ) .3M / Peltor - what have you done with a gold standard ? Unfortunate but true .	-1
First off , these amplify ALL sounds , so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.When I walk on concrete , my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones , and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step . I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on . They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable , but you feel much better NOT wearing them.To top it off , I got it at the last GoldBox deal , and I was *NOT* sent the `` 7S '' model I paid $ 99.99 for . I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $ 79 on Amazon , and I didnt notice until 5 weeks later .	-1
These Aerobies boomerangs have been a disappointment . The AerobieSuperdisks are beyond awesome . These are not in the same league . We have had a lot of folks try these with nothing close to a return . Now I am not Mr. Frisbee , but for me these do n't work .	-1
doesnt give a sharp edge really.. Cant keep it stable to sharpen evenly also needs to be 3 inches longer to be more effective..	-1
I would not recomend this . Couldnt get it to snarpen a schrade 5 dollar knife that I 've had for 12 years .	-1
made in china and did not say so in product description . should have done my homework due to the low price .	-1
This should be called a dulling stone . Have something to sharp ? Then this will make that no longer a concern	-1
Sorry , I 'm just not a fan . This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes , but I just could n't get the hang of it with knives . The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle . The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you 're trying to sharpen , rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks . I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result .	-1
I was hoping that this would take over for the double stone I currently carry in my pack . This was bigger and heavier than two small sharpening stones of different grits . I do n't use this .	-1
This scope felt nice and looked cool and everything , and IS VERY CLEAR when looking through it..the buttons/dials were all nice , seemed like a good buy , however i experienced the same problem as other reviewers with something coming loose during firing..returned for refund..you may get a good one you may not . but with amazon 's easy returns you can take a chance on it . Its such a nice scope , but not shock proof ? thanks amazon..	-1
Owned this scope for 2 seasons . Mounted on my RRA AR15 . I was initially please with this scope . Made in Korea , zoomed smoothly , versatile , stayed tight on the mounts and consistently accurate . After putting about 500rds through it I was amazed that the crosshairs fell apart . That 's right . The crosshairs literally fell apart . The lens were fine , scope was never dropped or abused . Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered . Weird . I liked the scope I paid $ 79.99 retail , and it appeared to be top quality . It held up well . I guess too many rounds went through it . Pretty disastrous failure if your'e hunting for food . Maybe pay more and get something rated for more use .	-1
I bought this Bushnell Banner 3-9x40mm as an upgrade to replace a 32mm Barska Plinker for my 10/22 rifle.It had been specifically recommended over the Barska but boy was I disappointed ! It has a very bad fishbowl effect around the edge of the lens . All scopes have some . This one has a lot ! I would n't use it for anything other than shooting paper with a .22LR because the distortion is so bad.The magnification is wrong . On 3x it magnifies equivalent to 4x on all my other scopes.If I had wanted 4x minimum I would have ordered 4x minimum ! The image is very clear , but only in the center , and not noticeably better or worse than any other 40mm scope I have.It 's not a bad scope . It 's just that it gets beat by scopes at half the price ... I 'm really just upset that I spent $ 75 on this Bushnell to replace my $ 30 Barksa and the Barska seems better to me.My advice : stick to scopes either over $ 300 or less than $ 50 'cause you wont get better untill you hit the $ 300 mark ...	-1
Cheap , low quality CHICOM scope with even cheaper ring mounts . Seriously just save your money and get something better . If you want a decent quality rimfire scope for under $ 100 , a Nikon is a good place to start .	-1
The scope adjusted fine and held zero on a small .22 I was very happy with it until I realized this thing has major glare issues , worse than any scope I have used . Unless your hog or coon hunting at night it is nearly unusable . Maybe something was wrong with mine , idk , but for the cheapest scope I have ever purchased it is not really worth looking into .	-1
I really wanted it to work on my 10/22 breakdown , but gave up after getting it sighted in at 6x , then going to 3x or 9x . It would not hold zero . 3x went to lower left quadrant , 9x to upper right quadrant . Several tests convinced me I had a defective scope . Tired of messing with lower priced variable zoom scopes , purchased a Nikon rimfire 4x- no issues . Decided I did not need 9x on a .22 rifle . FWIW : I do not have this problem on my large caliber Nikon variable zoom scopes .	-1
You get what you pay for . This is a cheap scope with poor optics . I will not return this as I got what I asked for but it will either sit on my shelf or get tossed as it is not even worth the hassle of returning . Do not buy this scope if you are familiar with Leupold , Nikon scopes .	-1
Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a gps or laser rangefinder . This product does not work well .	-1
It 's a good hat , but it is POLYESTER not wool . I do n't understand how Amazon can allow sellers to lie like this . Again , durable hat that 's well made and fits well on most head shapes ... but it is not wool .	-1
If you install these end caps onto your bike rack crossbars , they will never come out without a fight . After coming out , they will not be suitable for reinstallation . The price needs to come down for this product to meet its quality .	-1
Here in Florida , we get a lot of heat , humidity and rain . After having my rack system and Q towers in place for about 3 years now , I 've now been through 3 sets of end caps . They always start to crack right where the molding injection point is , and just go crazy from there . I 'm definitely going to look into something cheaper , as I 'm tired of spending $ 11 on a set of 4 stupid caps .	-1
What complete garbage and huge waste of money . I put 4 of these caps on standard Yakima round bars . I even lubed each one up with food grade grease , took great care to be sure each was centered well and tapped lightly with the palm of my hand . ALL FOUR of these pieces of junk cracked - I could not believe my eyes . Like another reviewer suggested I bought 4 standard 1 inch rubber table feet which fit perfectly and look fine , with the added benefit of a bit of cushion just in case one gets a stray head bump . Yakima might as well be stealing your money - these are worthless pieces of junk and they should be embarrassed to have their name on them . I am thoroughly disgusted and if I had not already sunk hundreds of dollars into building my roof rack I would get rid of the whole thing just on principle . I hate being taken advantage of and even though it was only $ 12 it is still tantamount to theft - 100 % guaranteed to break - 4 out of 4 cracked caps . I would give negative 5 stars if I could .	-1
Spent a small fortune putting together a Yakima rack system to replace a different brand that had been on my car 24/7 for the last 14 years..Putting together and installing the the towers , clips , locks and end caps , I was really happy with the results..Today I noticed that one of the end caps had split from about 3:00 to 7:00 and was hanging loose..Checked the other 3 caps and found a second one on the opposite side that had also split..I have only used the rack once since installing to carry my cargo box for a total 24 hrs..The cargo box does not come close to the end caps so it can not be the cause of the damage..Appears to me to be caused by faulty design or JUST PLAIN CHEAP MATERIALS ! used by Yakima..I will NOT be replacing these with the Yakima product but will be looking for something different that I can modify to serve the same purpose..HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT..	-1
It was too big . I needed it for mic when I teach my step classes and it was too pouchy for me . Its perfect if the purchase is for running but not for an aerobics instructor .	-1
Good construction , but does not fit a small wallet . You 'd be able to put your iphone and a small set of keys in there probably .	-1
This is not for survival situations . It only lights up things that are very flammable . Good for planned camping but not something that is not planned you will not be able to start a fire . You ca n't start a fire with a blast match by things you will find in the woods. [ ... ]	-1
I ordered the 35 pound weights and tested it on three different scales.. One read 34 even , the other two read it at a 34.2 ... It was slightly less than 1 dollar per pound according Amazon , however , I think it came out to evenly 1 dollar per pound since a few grams were missing .	-1
This seller is selling these for an outrageous price and you should look elsewhere . Bicycle Source US refused to cancel my order when I realized how ridiculous their price was and insists on charging a huge fee for a return.Please go elsewhere .	-1
you get what you pay for I guess . My plates came with all sorts of dings and pits . Really this is probably the lowest quality plate out there . Next time Ill spend a few bucks more	-1
I 'm XL in everything else , but in these , the Large fits properly.Unfortunately , the pad seems to be one size , and that size is XXXL.The fabric is smooth and durable . The stitching is clean and looks nice.Unfortunately , there is a stitch in the very front and center , most of the way down to the pad.This chafes way too much when riding . It 's a severe design error that should never happen.Basically , I think these designed for women , and sized for men .	-1
Shorts are very good . They fit well and padding is nice . However on second day threads started to open . Perhaps I got defective piece .	-1
The reel is avarege in quality but it came with broken reverse mechanism . I bought it as a spare reeal and did not use it until recently .	-1
First let me say I am a HUGE fan of the OLD hit a way . This new one is basically worthless . The ad says you can use it on a pole , where this is true it does not specify that the pole must be 2 inches or smaller in diameter . How many poles do you find that size ? Pretty much zero . It WILL NOT fit around your typical basketball pole as they are 4 inches or bigger.The strap is long enough , but the velcro is not long enough for it to secure around a larger pole thus making it worthless.I think the design is so that you are forced to buy their pole to use the item . If you notice in the picture of their pole it is a small diameter item.What once used to be great is not worthless , Unless of course you want to go out and spend more money buying their pole and equipment to use it.Do n't waste your money .	-1
Poor quality , with cheap non-ceramic guides and awful & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; . A telescoping rod can actually be designed and built to fish fairly well , and Shakespeare certainly missed that mark , here . I 've found a perfect ultra light telescoping spinning rod ( see my South Bend review ) , but still searching for a longer , medium action telescoping spinning rod that is worth fishing with .Swing and a miss on this one !	-1
Had perchused one of these 15 years ago in a combo pack . That was a great little rod , i had cought up to 4ib smallies , then last summer it finaly broke . So I ordered up a new one . At fisrt was impressed by the revisions to the guides . much wider than my original one . I did relize that the pole was only 4ft not 4'6 . I threw on my little Daiwa Crossfire . I get to the lake to pick up a few sculpin and brim . First cast the rod snaped in two , right in the middle . Didnt even get to reel in the line . Just splintered and snaped in two . Only had 1/32oz weight .	-1
Too ultra-light action of rod throughout length of this rod . To fix that , I pulled in the last section of the rod to down into the rod & glued it there , making the rod not as whippy . Then I noticed the amount of arc/bending of the rod is same all the way down to the handle , which means if you wanted to reel in any small lure you wouldnt feel the lure , meaning you also would have a tough time detecting a nibble if using bait without a bobber . So you 're limited to just bobber fishing with this rod , & even then only if you had shortened the rod like I did so the rod would n't bend into a circle if you caught a small fish . Also btw the eyelets are all-metal instead of any ceramic inside the loops to avoid eventually tearing line , but can live with all-metal guides at this cheap price , it 's the arc all the way down to the base that I do n't like.On the plus side , the grip on this handle is nice comfortable sponge . Plus you can fit the base of any reel on this . The best tiny telescopic rods are the Pen brand of rods , way better than this junk , but Pen small telescopic rods wont hold any reel of yours..	-1
Bought as a cheap rod ( 4ft 6inch UL ) to keep in the car for impromtu fishing trips . Rod sections jammed in place the fisrt time the rod was extended kind of defeating the purpose of a telescopic rod ! Returned for refund .	-1
I do not feel anything with this line when fishes bite . i put it in a very light rod , and i still have hard time feeling the bite if i cast far which i do , the good thing about it is that it does n't tangle and is good line and good castablility but it has serious stretch factor which i find very very annoying .	-1
Nothing worse than getting fishing line and having part of it come off the spool in shipping . I had to reel off about 100 yards or so before it caught up with the issue . The spool is too small for how much line they pack onto it . It was packaged well , its just a flaw in the manufacturing . I got the 10 lbs version and it casts like knotted mess . I have had to hand retrieve lures because upon casting it gets caught up on it 's self . I 've only run into this with real cheep line . If you are trolling though , it is probably not an issue .	-1
this is not meant for hunting . i have no idea why people say otherwise . ok if you walk to a nice stand that is easy to get to and do n't stalk around.i hunt public land and hike about a mile to two miles in , sometimes trhough some nasty stuff . this thing gets caught on everything , and when it does it falls apart , the arrows fall out and its just plain and simple silly.i strapped it backwards to my pack with some paracord and it made it out of the woods with less pain . promptly returned to store.avoid this and save syourself headache	-1
I MANAGED TO BREAK ONE OF THE SET SCREWS WITHIN 25 MINUTES OF OPENING THE PACKAGE , I BOUGHT THIS REST BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE THE GOLDEN KEY TM HUNTER REST I HAVE HAD ON MYOTHER BOW FOR 20 YEARS . THIS REST IS JUNK . I AM TRYING THE NAP 800 INSTEAD . ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH A RATING .	-1
This is my first squirrel call . It does n't do the bark , squeal that real squirrels do . I 've sat on my porch and used it while watching the squirrels in my yard , , , they stop for a second , then go about their squirrely business . I think my expectations may have been a bit high .	-1
The quality is OK and the bats fit in well . It does hold as many bats as it says however the straps are way too short .	-1
I might have to re-review this tool if I ever cut anything with it , but so far I have been unsuccessful.Amazon suggests other people have bought a slingshot with this tool , which I assumed was used to shoot the weighted bag over the limb . Save your money ... the slingshot is not nearly powerful enough to send this bag more than a few feet , especially when weighed down by the rope and saw . Throwing the bag by hand is more effective.When throwing the bag , be sure not to catch the metal hook on your finger , or it will cut you.After several attempts at throwing the bag over a 40 ft high limb , I instead got the weighted bag and rope wrapped around a limb of a different tree , and could n't get it loose . I ended up just cutting both trees down with a chainsaw to be done with it.It seems like a good idea in theory , but it did n't work out for me .	-1
Lasted only for 1 blast gave as gift to a friend and it let him down , when he needed it on his boat not worth the money or effort	-1
I was very excited to get these guides until I took everything out of the box doing inventory . The company failed to provide bolts and hex nuts . So I got to waste my time , gas , and additional money going to several stores to get the equipment needed to install these guides . They look great now that they are in place , but I found it unacceptable to have to get all the hardware for a project that should have been complete and ready for set up on arrival .	-1
I could make a better guide on using PVC and glue.You ca n't even tighten the support rail enough to where it does n't move because you 'll crack the PVC .	-1
I bought these to replace a set of side roller guides on a 18 foot bass boat . If you look closely you will see that they mount close to a 90 degree angle with little extension allowed if the side of the boat is angled . I had to combine the old mounts of the rollers I removed with the tubes these have to get them to work on my boat .	-1
I used this on my boat canvas and it make it WATERPROOF . I recently bought this for some canvas furniture covers and it let the rain water pass right through . I am not satisfied with this product .	-1
I was looking for an electric knife to make slicing my round loaves of bread easier . Unfortunately , the crust on my loaf was barely being cut by the sawing action of the blades.Maybe I was using it incorrectly . The blades sawed back quickly and smoothly , but regardless of the amount of downward pressure I applied , the action did not slice my bread.It was also much larger than I expected it to be . I did not try cutting anything else with it , since I only needed it to cut bread . And I did not try cutting a softer sandwich loaf .	-1
Your experience may vary , but even though I followed the instructions on the bottle , I did not see any difference in the headlight on my 2006 Mazda 3.I am a fan of Meguiar 's products but can not recommend this one .	-1
I bought this product to reduce the micro fine scratches in a collection of plastic welding helmet eyeglass inserts , that are essentially `` cheaters '' for welders.I went through the routine as described on the bottle , at least 20 times over a period of two days , on my first sample . These were nothing more than scuff scratches . After what must have been a total of one hour of work of buffing ( with an old flannel shirt ) on this same piece of plastic , I will say that there was about a 25 % improvement , at the most . The scratches are still there and quite visible.Now , each of these eyeglass inserts goes for about $ 5 on Amazon . Sooooooo , you do the math . Was I wise to spend an hour of work on a five dollar item ? If I hired someone to do it for me , I would be prosecuted for paying below the minimum wage.In retrospect , I have deteremined that there is indeed one scratch that this product will most definitely remove . And dat be the scratch in yo wallet , bro.Ron DiGiovanniEaston , PA	-1
This product is defiantly to strong for removing hard water spots on dark colors , cause it will scratch the paint or gel coat very fast .	-1
I used this for a while . Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did . One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it .	-1
It shoots like a field point out to 30 yards . Beyond that it is unpredictable . I have used them for target practice in the woods . I have shot them at rocks and tree stumps . They bounce off without damaging the arrow . I shot them at a large ground squirrel at 15 yards , thinking it would only crush it without causing excessive damage . I was wrong . It punched completely through both shoulders leaving a 1.5 inch entry wound and a 2.5 inch exit . I had planed to use these on grouse , but now I am not sure they wo n't destroy them . I also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads . The slip on stopped on impact , and the arrow punched through the rubber . So this broadhead is better then those slip on , but I 'm not sure rubber is the way to go .	-1
The concept of an emergency use toilet at a reasonable price sounded great . The product took over a week to be delivered and is made for Tinkerbell 's Butt . It is built from very cheap plastic and the lid will not open all the way , so you have to crouch at a very uncomfortable angle or break the lid off the hinge ... which I am sure will happen in its first use.There are better products out there ... Skip this one unless it is a backup for your real backup .	-1
this rod is heavy to handle , the rod 's `` ceramic guide inserts '' easily break.the rod gets stuck when put together.needless to say save your money , pay a bit extra & get a better rod like the Daiwa beefstick.you do n't need any rod longer than 11 or 12 ft . I ended up returning it to amazon after a nasty cut on my hand due to ceramic guides breaking .	-1
not happy with it , I purchase two of this rods , reach scratched so its not the best deal I done here	-1
Leaked right from the start from around the valve on/off or the 1/8 fitting so back it goes . Looked well made and stout though !	-1
If I could give this zero stars I would . The product looked unfinished and had a couple of gouges in it . Not worth the hassle of returning it so I 'll just use it as is . It is possible that the product suffered the gouges during shipping but the rest of the defects can only be attributed to poor quality control . Do n't think I 'll be buying anything from TYR again .	-1
Frame distorts , screws fall out , top lid wo n't lock ( because frame is distorted ) , and the handles pop out or their attachment point . What 's not to like !	-1
these poles do n't stay together , in order for them to be able to come apart -- - they come apart when fishing too ... .I need to find a collapsible pole -- not this one =0 ( the reel was descent though =0 )	-1
the mask is fairly small , appears to be cheaply made especially the rubber strap - this strap will not stand the test of time . had i actually seen it in the hardware store i never would have bought , particularly at the near to $ 15 price . To me , the price/value would be more apt in the $ 8 range . It certainly does not look like the pic on amazon - the pic makes it appear larger than it is , the surface area of the filter hence will be limited in it 's ability to handle larger volumnes of air over time- but then they want you to buy replacement filters faster .	-1
Does not hold the ammo locked in place so you can load it , we do n't even use it any more , this was a waist	-1
I had to alter my grip to make this work for me . I have a model 642 with rubber grip . the wood grip models would work unmodified .	-1
The speed loader is great , but my wife 's Taurus 85 cylinder will not swing-out far enough for proper operation without hanging on the cylinder release lever . This was listed for my wife 's gun , but will not work with it , unless you get used to dropping the rounds into the cylinder at an angle . Very klutzy operation . Useless , really .	-1
Its a nice simple speed loader , however it do not fit my Taurus 605 very well . I do n't think it would be easy in an emergency situation to reload . Hope my aim is good : )	-1
The speedloader seems like a good product in terms of quality and function , but it does not fit my revolver . The website does not specify which models this speedloader does and does not fit . I purchased this speedloader for my standard .38 S & W ; Model 442 Airweight . The gun is plain old normal factory specs from the manufacturer , no after market parts , no customization , etc . The speedloader does n't even feed in half way to the cylinder before it gets stuck . You may want to do some research on this item to fitting your gun before you go through the hassle of ordering and returning.The ad on the website does not provide the information , but now that I have the item in front of me , I can tell you what is says . This item on amazon is for a : HKS Speedloader , model 36-A . The packaging says it fits 5 shot , .38 Special , S & W ; models 36 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 49 , 60 // Charter Arms // Taurus 85 .	-1
Even though this states it works on Taurus Model 85 , the cylinder really does not swing out enough for this to be useful . I can load manually much faster . Also , I found the mechanism that locks the rounds in place is hard to use and awkward . For 5 round cylinders , I say you are better manually loading .	-1
First off this review is just about the loader , not the supplier . THIS THING WILL NOT FIT THE COLT 38 DET SPECIAL . It is too big to get lined up with the cylinder because it is agenst the frame of the gun . It will only allow the tips of 4 out of six of the bullets to be placed in the cylinder then you have to relice the bullets and guide them in the rest of the way after you move the speed loader out of the way . DO N'T BUY IT FOR THIS GUN .	-1
HKS Revolver Speedloader for S & W ; 25-5/Taurus .45 Raging BullIt 's a good product . But , they sent me the wrong ones . The Taurus comes in both 6 round and 5 round variants . I met a guy at the range who gave me the info on what he ordered . His were 5 round speed-loaders . They sent me 6 round speed-loaders . I note from another reviewer that this has happened before . Like the earlier reviewer , I now have to return them . There is not a contact the seller link on this products page . Too bad . I might have been able to get the right information the first time ! Hey Amazon , you can certainly fix this !	-1
Its a good product if they would have sent the right ones they are supposed to be 5 shot loaders instead they sent 6 shot loaders which do no justice for a revolver that holds 5 rounds lol needless to say i have to send back ordred this same item 5 weeks ago and got 5 shot speeedloaders so i orderred 3 more and they send 6 shot loaders go figure	-1
I wanted a speed loader , but this was not a good choice or something , I ca n't get the ammo to stay put or hold till you put the ammo in it does n't hold the ammo , : - (	-1
I have been using HKS speedloaders for over 30 years and recently purchased two HKS-586-A 's to fit a revolver I just purchased . What a disappontment I received . They were much lighter in weight than my older models , and the signature `` click '' that assured me that my rounds were firmly secure in the loader was pathetically anemic at best , and THAT was after I had to jiggle the rounds just to get the casings to secure with the holding teeth . When I twisted the securing knob , it would just jam with the shell casings and not smoothly lock the rounds in place . I tried the second speedloader to see if perhaps I had just received a lemon , and sure enough , the other loader was no better . So here I am with two speedloaders that bind with my rounds while trying to secure them in place , and once I jiggle them and do get them secured , the weak tension from the ball bearing that secures them , leaves me feeling less than confident that the slightest bump of the knob would n't send my rounds cascading to the floor , and probably at a most inopportune time . Very disappointed HKS . You really cheaped out what was a great design . Guess I will have to re-think the Safariland II loaders . I would return these two POS 's but it is not worth the effort . I am going to send this evaluation to HKS and see if or how they respond . Interestingly enough , for a company that prides themself on customer satifaction and quality , they have not means to contact them . Their home pages just says : `` Contact your retailer . '' Thanks HKS for dodging the feedback bullet from a loyal customer .	-1
This is a tiny , flimsy case that does n't fit a single speedloader I own . Totally worthless to me . Would not purchase again even if I did have a speedloader that fit .	-1
eCop never even sent the items and had the nerve to have me start the process through 'UPS ' for the lost items that they never sent ! I wo n't lie for them or anyone else , the nerve ! I contacted them as soon as I got the delivery but only one item was in their very large shipping box . After a few months they wrote me to say they ca n't and wo n't start the paperwork with UPS because it would be harder for me to get a refund from UPS using a 'lost ' shipping item . They never sent the item and they want me to lie to UPS shipping for them ! I wo n't lie for anybody . I really hate being ripped off , but I 'll give the 10+ for the name 'eCop ' it kinda sounds like an honest little ma & pa shop . What a load of Bull ... .I still ca n't believe they wanted me to lie to UPS and Amazon for them . Again I want anyone who might want to buy from them BEWARE of a scam and do n't spend much on any item you want , instead of that just roll up the money and burn it over the stove .	-1
Bear Creek makes much better loaders , as long as you get the right caliber . This one works , but not as nicely IMHO	-1
Will NOT fit the XDS 9mm single stack . You would think that the sellers would have known this , especially since it is a very popular modelversus something old and obscure . I would suggest that they simply post a picture of the back of the packaging , it shows which magazines each model made by HKS will accommodate .	-1
The HKS works on my .45 1911 magazines but you have to push the rounds back with your thumb and the loader is plastic construction so it flexes especially at the thumb lever . This is not the best loader I 've used ( UPLULA is best ) but it is the cheapest at about half the price of the UpLULA . If you want something cheap get the HKS but if you want something that works best spend the extra bucks and get the UpLULA by Butler Creek .	-1
Read the application guide close ... very close . There are very few magazines that this will fit . I have a few that were listed on the guide , but as of yet it 's nothing more than a piece of plastic without a purpose taking up space in a junk drawer .	-1
Purchased this for my wifes 380 and she has used it a few times to try to get used to it but essentially it has proved worthless .	-1
My gym has a few of these jump ropes with the plastic tube sections on a rope . This is a cheap knockoff , not the quality of the other jump ropes that I 've used . I 'm disappointed in it , sending it back . Sigh ... .	-1
Case was mislead because the picture does not show the clips . The case so far has no technical problems , it is however just not what I expected . It 's small , but cheaply made , the clip mechanism is a snap-like action with no folds , so it reminds me of how ammo cases are folded . The package also took long to arrive . The case is overpriced for the quality , but nonetheless it has n't broke down yetEDIT : after a year of using this case . I regret buying it . and should 've coughed up 2 extra dollars for a much better , more durable and reliable case . this case dries up my pistol , so do not use this if you have a metal frame gun . i hate this case and have been using it to hold my art supplies instead .	-1
plastic hinge and case lock tabs are very thinmay be good for weekend use but every day use is not a good betget one with sliding locks and a wire - cylinder hingereturned for one that has above and was less expensive	-1
THE PICTURE SHOWS A 1911 IN THE CASE . IT WIL FIT A 1911 BUT IT IS A BOOGER TO GET THE MAGAZINE IN AND CLOSE THE CASE . I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE PRODUCTS ( I BOUGHT TWO ) BUT IT IS TOO MUCH OF A HASSLE . I 'LL USE THEM FOR SOMETHING .	-1
These are some type of polyester ( ? ) they just do n't work as well as cotton . It 's nice having the patches cut to size but the bulk cotton patches work much better .	-1
The reviews here seem to be written by kind gentlemen who do n't wish to sound harsh . But what they do say is quite a problem . These Hoppe 's patches are way too small for the bores they say they are deigned for . These Hoppe 's patches look like the same as the & # 34 ; Outers & # 34 ; brand 17/.22 caliber patches but Hoppe 's must be much thinner . I needed THREE .22/.270 caliber Hoppe 's patches for each pass in my .223 caliber rifle . And I needed two and one half patches of the Hoppe 's .270/.38 caliber patches to fit my .308 rifle . These tiny patches will cost you much more in the long run than the superior cotton patches from & # 34 ; Pro-Shot & # 34 ; that are sold here . If the Amazon word search here for & # 34 ; gun patches & # 34 ; ( ? ) had shown the available Pro-Shot brands , I definitely would have ordered them and been very happy . As it is , I am not that pleased . Go for the Outers ( better ) or ProShot ( best ) brands .	-1
These patches are way too thin . I even doubled up with two patches and goes through the barrel too easily . You 'll end up using more patches than the cloth type patches so you 're not saving any money and spend more time and effort to clean your .223/5.56 rifle . I do not recommend these patches .	-1
These are not my cup of tea , but it might be your 's . It just does n't seem to do the job or the way I like to do it with cotton or flannel patches . To me it seems too thin to do a good job .	-1
I needed some smaller patches for my 22 and these are just too small to be effective for cleaning the barrel because they slide right through . I would not purchase again .	-1
Very flimsy . Requires dozens for one cleaning . Very loose in the barrel of my 5.56 . These are also not very absorbent .	-1
These patches are thin and shed and tear easily . If I would have known what I have know now I would have spent my money the first time on the Allen Patches . AVOID	-1
I will no longer buy gun patches from Hoppes . The patches they sell are almost like synthetic toilet or tissue paper . They are thin , almost transparent . I prefer cotton patches , not this synthetic , or whatever material it is that Hoppes now uses . Go elsewhere and buy 100 % cotton patches , not this junk .	-1
While I have not used the Hoppe 's .38-.45 caliber patches yet , I just finished using the .22-.270 caliber size in my .223 rifle and the .270-.38 caliber size in my .308 . THEY ARE REDICULOUSLY SMALL AND THEREFORE WASTEFUL . I needed 3 patches to feel any correct resistance in my .223 , and 2.5 of the .270/.38 patches in my .308 ! Stick with the Pro-Shot cotton patches , also sold here as well . They will be far cheaper in the long run because you only need one patch per swipe instead of three . Pro-Shot is best ... ..Outers is acceptable ... ..Hoppe 's fail the test .	-1
I bought these because they were cheap and being Hoppe 's brand , I thought they would be good . I personally do n't like them . They are a fiber-like material and they do n't hold much liquid . I prefer cotton or flannel .	-1
Hoppe 's is an over-rated product line . Do yourself a favor and try something else . These patches are thin and rip too easily .	-1
Not made of cotton . Very thin and roof . Def looking into another cleaning patch for handgun . I wish I would have read more reviews . Lesson learned	-1
These are very thin and rip easy . I am use to having cotton patches and I will be going back to that .	-1
I ordered this on the 17th of April . It still has n't arrived ! ! ! ! Apparently , it takes OVER A WEEK to ship 1 item . Now I 'm normally very patient with these things , but holy crap people . It 's been 2 weeks ! ! ! Other than that , I 've used this product before . You 'll need to oil or lubricate your firearm after using this but it does dry quickly and cleans well . Generally , I clean with oil , spray this stuff throughout and wipe down , then oil again . I 'm fairly meticulous with cleaning my firearms though so you may not need to do this .	-1
One almost gets the feeling this product is no different than a widely used lubricant called WD40 which is a fraction of the price .	-1
it doesent fit , or at least not thick enough to really clean the AK47 bore , even when fully soaking it in cleaner and fully dry it goes through but not tight enough feel to really clean or pull all the crap from the barrell , at least doesent feel that way , comes out very very easily .	-1
Great idea for other calibers but this caliber requires the snake to be too small and when pulling through the barrel ... well the rope has a tendency to brake . I broke two of these already in my .17 caliber rifle . I usually recommend these snakes but NOT FOR THIS CALIBER !	-1
I could not really figure out what to do with this , and it seemed to not fit my 22 lr barrel , I tried pulling it through and it would almost feel like it was stuck and I was afraid something would happen to my gun so I stopped trying . However , if you can make it work , I think it would work well for a quick cleaning .	-1
I bought this bore snake a few days ago . Went to clean my .17 rifle and it broke the first time I tried to use it . Wasted $ 18 on junk.Dont waste your money on this product buy something else to clean the bore of your rifle .	-1
I want get the easy way to clean my rifle . my it is too small for 7.62 / 303 and 308	-1
I ended up sending this product back because it felt cheap . And I did not want this cheap thing breaking off in the barrel of my AR-15 . I ended up buying a cable style cleaning kit from Otis instead . Thanks Amazon for the quick return !	-1
been using bore snakes ever since they were invented . bought this one to replace my 30 cal that was worn completely out . this snake is LOOSE in the bore and will not clean . my worn out snake cleans a lot better .	-1
There is zero need for a sprayable form of Hoppe 's # 9 , it is smelly and gets everywhere you do n't want it . There is no applicator straw , you just get Hoppe 's ... everywhere . Buy a jar and you 'll be happier .	-1
Subject line says it all . I would not buy this again . It smells really bad . It 's probably a good solvent , but ...	-1
Followed the instructions to the letter . Metal surface was clean , smooth & free of any solvents . Wiped it down several times with ethyl alcohol . Applied Black Magic with a Qtip as recommended and got very uneven results over the area ( about 2in long & .5in wide ) . Repeated it 2 more times with the same result - uneven bluing . Yes , It does blueing but I ca n't recommend it if you want a quality appearance .	-1
After hearing so many good things about Otis kits I dropped ( the not unsubstantial ) $ 40 on this kit . While it 's a good idea , I really do n't think it lives up to the hype . The bore cleaning procedure is effective , probably about as good as using a proper rod , brush and jag . But that 's about all you can do with this kit . There is no way to clean any complex chamber- the short wire tool is next to useless in an AR chamber . There is no toothbrush , only enough oil for one or two cleanings , and no room to put a good rag in the pouch . After one use I 've gone back to keeping a bore-snake , toothbrush , bottle of CLP and rag in my field kit and keeping a proper cleaning kit at home.The Otis kit is not worth the money , or the hype .	-1
I suppose that if I really needed a very small package to carry my cleaning kit , this would be a life saver . Otherwise , it seems like it was a waste of money . Traditional rods and brushes work fine .	-1
I purchased the Otis Tactical cleaning kit ( not from Amazon -- got a better deal elsewhere at the time ) to care for two 12 gauge shotguns , a pair of .22 cal target pistols , several .38 cal and .357 magnum revolvers , and several 9mm and .45 cal pistols . From its advertising it seemed like the perfect `` one size fits all '' cleaning kit . But it does not live up to the hype.This kit does come with some basic tools to clean all common types of guns , including the needed slotted tips and bore brushes . But it does not have the ( optional ) picks and brushes needed to do a thorough cleaning . That will cost you another $ 15 or so . Only a small number of patches come with the kit , so you should plan on buying more right away . Interesting , no one who sells these cleaning kits locally in my area also sells the Otis patches . So I had to purchase those online ( which I did buy from Amazon ) . The patches cost about 10 times the amount you would spend for common square patches . Even though Otis claims you can get 6 uses out of each patch I found you will drag dirty patches through your barrel if you try to get that many uses . At best you may get 2 or 3 uses from each Otis patch if you really want your gun to be clean . In all I spent about twice a much for this cleaning kit as I did for a similar comprehensive rod-based cleaning kit.So how well does this kit clean your guns ? The patches will clean your bore about as well as any other slotted patch system . But I find I can get the bore much cleaner using a jag and rod . The fact that you can pull the patch breech to muzzle is handy , though , for revolvers . But if you clean your gun the way Otis illustrates in their instructional videos it will not get very clean . If you dissassemble your gun you will find the breech end of the bore is not very clean , and the slide is filthy . You will need to scrub all of these areas with a brush ( which the kit does not include but sells separately ) and wipe it down with patches ( do n't use your expensive Otis patches for this unless you want to spend a fortune on patches ) .In the end , the Otis cleaning kits ( they make several but work fundamentally the same way ) are useful if you want to take a compact cleaning kit with you to the range or hunting where taking a cleaning rod would be a hassle . If you want to do just a quick clean of your bore without disassembling your gun it will work fine . It is handy to clean the bore of a revolver from breech to muzzle . If you think a Bore Snake cleans your gun sufficiently then you will probably be happy with the Otis system . But do n't expect this kit to clean your gun as well as you can clean it with full disassembly and use of a simple rod and jag with much cheaper patches , a toothbrush , and some solvent ( I usually use Hoppes and BreakFree ) . I have spent many thousands of dollars on nice guns . I do n't mind spending money on a good gun cleaning system to protect that investment . But you will spend a fortune on the Otis cleaning system and , in the end , your guns will not be all that clean .	-1
Well guys , you tried to build the better mousetrap and a darn fine job . OOPS , your main beef about the breach to muzzle cleaning just doesnt apply to & # 34 ; most & # 34 ; of the firearms as you boast . AND ONE OF THEM IS MINE ! FAIL !	-1
I wanted a paddle holster , the description even says , rubberized paddle , I got a belt holster , it does n't even look like the one in the picture . The belt loops are too small for any belt I own so I ca n't even use it if I wanted to .	-1
I see that this model is mainly advertised as an H & K ; pistol holster , but the title and description both had written that it would fit the S & W ; Sigma 9ve . Of course , it did n't . It could n't be THAT easy , right ? As you can see from the picture , this holster has a square trigger guard area . This trigger guard area is actually the main retention device , other than just friction fitting -- so it 's pretty important to get the trigger guard area properly fitted I would think . When I slid the 9VE into it , I had to apply a significant amount of pressure to get it in , and I expected it to `` snap '' into place or something . It never did . Instead , the seam of the trigger guard area spread apart so much that I thought it would break . The 9ve not only has a round trigger guard , but it also seems quite a bit wider than the holster trigger guard mold is capable of accepting . The gun physically fits into the holster dimension-wise , but the trigger guard does NOT properly `` snap '' into place , it just kinda spreads the plastic apart , which is not good and does not provide more than just friction fitting.I liked the idea of the holster for an inexpensive way to carry around a 9ve on the farm , but I never got a chance to test the product out because it did n't even fit the gun , mainly due to the trigger guard area . I did n't want to play holster roulette online again , so I decided not to order another of a different model , but the s & w ; m & p ; fobus holster may work , seeing as it DOES have a rounded trigger guard mold .	-1
This is the first fobus holster I 've purchased . I 've seen them in their packaging at some firearm stores and they did look kind of cheap , but I have been seeking a holster for my H & K ; USP 45 Compact for a while now to use as a home carry holster.The CONS : First I would like to start with the description.This is an area Amazon and their vendors need to fix . They need better descriptions and a way to contact the vendor for questions . If you look at the photo you see a paddle behind the holster but the main title says belt . I was under the impression you get both just like Blackhawk holsters . Well this one just come with a permanent fixed belt attachment . Ok , you know what they say about what happens when you ASSUME.Second issue I have which can also fall under the first issue I have is that this holster will NOT fit the H & K ; USP 45 COMPACT if you have a rail adapter on it . ( I have a GG & G ; Slimline Rail adapter ) . I was unable to find a review saying it would not fit and it says nothing about it in the description.Third issue : After removing my rail adapter , this holster does n't really fit this firearm well , you can see that it is very tight and the seem of the holster is just about splitting . Definitely will put wear on the finish of my firearm if used often.Fourth issue the mold has bumps and scratches all over it like it has been used.The PROS : Low cost for someone who wants a belt attached holster.If you own a threaded barrel , this will fit.That 's my gripe.Overview : I will be keeping this holster because when i received it I did n't bother to look and see the packaging was zip-locked and I ripped it open so this item will not be resellable as & # 34 ; NEW & # 34 ; .I did try some of the other firearms I own and my Sig Sauer Mosquito slides in this well however the sight clips the bottom of the holster when drawing the firearm.There is a seperate paddle adapter you can purchase for this holster right here on Amazon for just under $ 10.00 , but if you do the math , you are better off buying a BlackHawk serpa holster as they are definitely better quality as I own a bunch with carbon fiber detailing for my other firearms and they come with both attachments ( Paddle and Belt ) and cost is about the same if you buy the paddle adapter . Unfortunately I did not have enough patience to wait for one for my USP . I believe they just recently made one for it , not sure if the rail adapter will fit either.As information for some people reading this that is about to recommend a custom Kydex holster . I do have one that will fit with a light attachment ( Raven Concealment ) .I just wanted one that I can quickly slap on when I need one on my person right away for when unknown people are at my doorstep ringing my doorbell . I do not want to do it & # 34 ; Ghetto Style & # 34 ; and do a Plaxico.I 've been getting a lot of unprofessional solicitors recently showing up at my door ( No ID and looking suspicious ) and it just takes one time.. I will not longer accept that risk.Hope this review helps someone 's decision .	-1
simply did n't fit . i could jam it in then barley rip it out so i tried to & # 34 ; break it in & # 34 ; yea that was n't happening	-1
Fobus usually makes great gear , but this mag holder did n't secure to my belt with the paddle as well as I required . Having two G20 mags on your belt is challenging enough without worrying about them falling off . I do n't fault Fobus for this , but it just did n't work for me .	-1
I am 6'1 & # 34 ; and I could not get this to fit me in a way which was comfortable to wear . Ended up returning it and going with a Galco brand holster which is much more comfortable to wear all day .	-1
The one step is great if you can put it together . Trius should revise the instructions because you get it half together and find out the rest of the instructions are n't there . The instructions only tell you how to put the base of it together but leave off how to assemble the working mechanism . I emailed Trius and asked if they had an updated set of instructions . After about a week and no response I emailed them again asking why they had n't tried to answer my email . The response I got was & # 34 ; just attach the arm and the spring and you 'll be good to go & # 34 ; ! ... ... DUHI looked at a few of the other reviews that mentioned the same problems putting it together so I looked at the box and did what I thought I should do . I had a couple of parts left over and tried to figure where they went and I still have n't figured that out but it works.I 've put some fairly complicated things together in the past and the one step should have been easy . The problem is safety . The sling arm is made of sheet metal and when the spring releases it with a lot of force you would n't want any kind of malfunction . There are a couple of very sharp edges on the sling arm that should have been made smooth because they are razor sharp.Bottom line is a good device without the essential instructions and the worst customer service I 've had to deal with other than Centurylink !	-1
This bag is not what I expected . I use it to carry my Marlin 336 scoped back and forth and it 's a very , VERY tight fit . I end up having to close the case halfway and then shoving the gun inside . The case is 43 '' and the 336 is 38.5 '' so it should have worked out better . I might get something else ...	-1
You would think that something this simple would be without difficulties . Not so . I bought two and both required major modifications to the buckle before I could even get them open . If you have another choice , take it .	-1
The one that I received can only hold 20 gauge shells . There is no chance of fitting a 12 gauge shell through any of the loops . Good price and good concept , but the quality control does n't seem to be there .	-1
This is about the worse made sling that I 've ever owned . As soon as I bought it , and put it on my gun , it broke . If you want something that will last , look elsewhere .	-1
What can I say beyond , I do n't like this sling and I would n't recommend that anyone purchase it . The sling appears to be well made and it 's not reflective of Allen Company 's other products . The main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place . It does n't matter how big or small you are , it just does n't sit in the right place .	-1
This thing will not fit on any gun ... .the shoulder padding is unmoveable and comes nowhere near your shoulder when put on the gun ... ..I got a refund on this and they didnt even make me return it ... I threw it in the trash and got my money back ... ..This is the only item I have ever ordered from Amazon that I was disgusted with ... ..it is truly a POS	-1
This will work in a pinch but is not nearly as good as using a standard sling with hardware . I use it with an air rifle that I did n't want to drill and put hardware on . It has n't broke yet , but not sure I would trust it with a high dollar gun .	-1
When mounted on a shoulder harness the mags would not stay in with movement { running } except straight up .Not how I want to carry them . ...	-1
Bought this from Midway USA about a year ago . Before purchasing , I checked and double checked that this would work with my magazines . Upon receiving it , I noticed the mags were very tight and would almost pull the entire pouch off my belt when I was finally able to remove the mags . Not good . I thought if I left 2 spare mags in it for a while it would loosen up ... nope . I also tried a little Rem oil on the mags ; it helped but not enough . I also tried sanding the inside the pouches ; did n't help.After I tried it again this past weekend . I got frustrated and contacted Fobus through their website . Steve Palinkas ( Customer Service Manager ) quickly replied and asked me to call him and included a phone number . I tried about 6-8 times and every call went directly to voicemail . I finally asked him to call me using the number I included upon first contact . He called the next day and asked if I was using metal or polymer/plastic mags . I told him plastic ( polymer ) . His reply was `` it dos not work with the plastic ( polymer ) magazines ; only the metal ones . '' He said H & K ; does not manufacture the plastic mags anymore ; which I do not believe is true and I have never even seen a metal mag for a USP ( not saying they do n't exist but I believe the polymer mags are the most common ) . I said that was odd since when I purchased my weapon over 12 years ago , it came with two plastic ( polymer ) mags and when I purchased the Fobus 6900 I also bought 2 new plastic ( polymer ) H & K ; OEM mags . I also explained to him that their own website does not state anything about whether they would for plastic ( polymer ) or metal mags . He said I would need to contact the seller to try to get a refund . He did n't even offer to do anything at all like exchange it for a new one . I find it extremely disappointing that Fobus has the same terrible customer service as Uncle Mike 's . I will never even look at or consider a Fobus product ever again . I guess you get what you pay for . Cheap price = cheap quality . If you need a magazine pouch ( especially for a H & K ; USP ) I would look somewhere else like Raven Concealment or one with a tension screw .	-1
These patches are way thicker than the name brand patches.That means that unless you have a really skinny rod , you are not going to be able to push them through their advertised caliber..I ordered these and .30 cal . and I assume that they are cut from the same cloth.I could not push the .30 cal through so I had to use the .223 size.I will not buy these again .	-1
These are about 1/2 the price as the ones in my local outdoor store . They are also about 1/2 the quality , I end up using 2 times the amount if not more when cleaning . They are very thin and the threads come out easily . If your looking for cheap , look no further . You get what you pay for with these .	-1
I like the holster but it did n't fit my Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 38 and it is J frame . I have been told Fobus is one of the absolute best holsters world wide . It just did n't work for me .	-1
Purchase this to use with my 2.5 in .38 Special but it was not comfortable probably because im not privvy to having such a had object on my hip . Im more accustomed to leather rigs that are attached to my tactical belt..to each their own .	-1
Cheap paper , you 'll tear it trying to get it out of the package . The package that it comes in , is 10 times the quality of thepaper the target is made from . A tip for you friends : pay 5.00 for a bale of straw , spray paint circles on the straw bale ofyour choice of colors , then you 'll have a quality target that will last all summer . In the winter cover it with a large plasticleaf bag , and put it in the shed for next summer . Take heed to my message to you , I give you true and factual info . Thisis a fact , it is a s*** item ... ..	-1
I bought this for my son cause the price seemed reasonable , but when I got it , it was really small . Not true to size at all . My son has 2 other karate uniforms size 000 , and this one seemed to be made for a 2 year old , not 50 lbs ! I gave it to a friend who has a tiny 4 yr old .	-1
this item was very small- I purchased it for a back up for karate class . It is the same size as the label of the one my son uses but it is much smaller- tried to exchange for next size without a response . Will just give it to the school to use for thier smaller kids	-1
First of all the shipping cost will either be higher then the item or same price . I think thats why they have it at a cheap price to makeup the cost . The problem is , the 7 plus dollars you pay is way to much.. Same item you can get at the dollar store.. Hope this helps	-1
Not good at all , I thought the whole of it was rubber , but no , it was cheap plastic that was already cracked . Buy something else !	-1
INITIAL REVIEW UPON PURCHASING : I purchased this hand pump for inflating my bike tires . I am only an occasional biker , so I use it every month or two . Thus far , I have been very pleased with its performance . It 's easy to pump and makes quick work of my bike tires . Those interested in getting perfectly optimized pressure will need a separate pressure gauge , as one is not included with this pump.TWO MONTH UPDATE : I 've owned the bike pump for two months and used it exactly twice . Yesterday , when I attempted to pump up my tires , the entire thing broke in two . I guess inexpensive really does mean cheap in this case . I 'll be searching for a better quality pump in the future .	-1
Coghlan 's Magnesium Fire Starter is a failure of a product if your life were to depend on it to start a life saving fire . In general magnesium is a great method to start a fire and anyone who travels in the outdoors for backpacking or camping should have numerous methods to start a fire . I have used magnesium fire starters from other companies numerous times and they have worked flawlessly . The problem is with the Coghlan 's brand . I have experienced on three separate occasions with three different Coghlan 's magnesium fire starters that the striker rod detaches from the magnesium bar . For people that do not have redundant fire starting methods and are counting on this product they may be in for a big surprise if the striker rod gets lost as they will have a difficult time igniting the magnesium . It appears that the rod is poorly glued in to the magnesium piece . If Coghlans were able to properly secure the rod to the magnesium this would be a great product but it is too undependable especially for a survival situation when fire is absolutely needed.Due to the problem listed above I do NOT recommend Coghlan 's Magnesium Fire Starter . I have successfully used magnesium fire starters from other companies that worked great . Stay away from Coghlan 's .	-1
Dont expect all of the items shown in the picture . All that I received is the slotted cleaning red shown at the bottom of the picture . That item is acceptable and will fullfil the intended purpose . I mean , whats the purpose of showing the other two items ?	-1
I attached this to my cleaning rod and put a patch through it . Just as I started to turn a solvent sprayed patch through my bore , the threads broke off and almost left me with a useless cleaning rod.I was able to successfully remove the broken thread piece and salvage my cleaning rod but this plactic clotted end is terrible .	-1
I bought this through a local shop instead of Amazon , but I came on here to provide a warning to others ... PROS : - easy to install- quick to connect/disconnect- cheapCONS : - you have to cut the end of the strap off to install this , essentially making it necessary to always have some kind of connector.- IT 'S PLASTIC ! ! ! ! I used without any problems for a few months . One day after getting home from a ride on the highway I went to take off my helmet and the clip broke . I could only imagine being in a crash and having my helmet come off , or if it had come unsecured at 70mph and my helmet flew into the person/people behind me ! it 's VERY convenient , but I wo n't bet my life on a plastic clip again . it needs to be made of metal , not plastic .	-1
wanted to use it on my Icon Variant , did not fit , the strap is too thick for the supplied plastic clip , besides the little button on the strap would make it impossible to go through the supplied plastic clip even if the size was wide enough , same scenario for my Arai . I 'll be dammed if I attempted to modify my helmets to fit this flimsy clip because it does not strike me as being made of strong material .	-1
I purchased these for about $ 6.61 each after looking and being unable to find them at a few stores in my area . Well , after ordering them I found the exact same ones at the dollar store for , well , a dollar . So I paid just under $ 20 for what is really worth 3 bucks . I was uninformed about the value of these but the fact that someone would sell them for that much more makes me feel I 've been ripped off . I would n't trust a seller who has such a high markup on something . They may have gotten my money this time but I will never again purchase anything from them . In fact , as an Amazin seller , I may just purchase the entire stick of these from the dollar store and resell them on Amazon just to undercut these people .	-1
If you plan on doing serious backpacking these are not great socks . In really wet environments where wet feet are a fact of life these are utterly useless . Once wet , they stay that way for days literally . Very comfortable , great for dry climates or day hiking . NOT for wet environments at all . I 'm sticking with my old GI socks , they dry in under an hour by a fire and a couple hours hanging from my pack and are pretty well just as comfortable .	-1
I was looking for a pair of socks to keep my feet warm for road cycling . These socks are good to wear around the house and walking outside . However , for road cycling , they do n't keep your feet warm below 45 degrees temperature . Above 45 , they work well .	-1
I bought this for my wetsuits thinking ti would reduce the order , but no chance . Dawn dish soap works better and for a fraction of the price .	-1
My wife and I each received a scubapro cruiser snorkeling vest as wedding gifts for our honeymoon.Mine worked great ( size large was good for me by the way , at 6'1 '' 185lbs ) , but her vest lost air after inflating it.It still provided visibility and protection from the sun , but it was a defective product.The 3rd party vendor , LeisurePro , has informed us that we can send it back to them and after an inspection they may ONLY issue a refund to the person who purchased the gift for us.I do n't think that 's the proper way to discretely deal with a gift return , nor is it the way Amazon deals with gift returns , but they wo n't budge on the issue.I come to Amazon because they stand behind their products and have a very good return policy in my opinion . However , if you have a problem with this third party vendor , I think you 're out of luck !	-1
The length is amazing on this mat as is the thickness of it but after all that there is nothing positive i can possibly say about it ! ! I also bought the matching MatWare Sleeve which i had to return since i ended up sending this back as well.I tried everything i read and heard about trying to `` break in '' a mat and to make it stop being slippery but nothing worked on this mat ! ! Extremely disappointed i am just glad that i was able to return it and get a refund before i broke or cracked a bone or something ! ! I would never buy again nor would i recommend it .	-1
No offense to this mat , as I have only found one that works for me ( Lululemon black pro mat , $ 100 ) . I 've tried this and the pro-lite , and neither kept me from slipping , even after the salt rub down . I waited too long hoping I could 'break it in ' as directed , and was no longer able to return , so I had to give a $ 70+ mat away.My form is good , but I 'm just too much of a sweater , the grips and light texture do nothing for me .	-1
I think I 've had this for 4 months now , use it 2-3xs/week and I am still sliding on it . I love the regular heavy manduka pro , but it is quite heavy so I leave it at the other studio that I teach for , and use this one to carry with me . Not worth it . I should have just purchased another heavy manduka pro . There 's no reason to spend upwards of $ 50 or $ 60 because this quality is more like a $ 30 mat .	-1
I expected the neck warmer to be shaped in a way which would provide adequate protection in the back of the neck and less bunching in the front . It felt like I was being choked .	-1
Buy the Carhartt instead . This does what it is designed to do and it does it well ( keeps your neck very warm ) but the fleece quality is sub-par . It & # 34 ; pills & # 34 ; and just had a cheap , thin feel to it ... .I purchased the Carhartt neck gator also , and it is made of much better ( thicker ) material ... my wife and kids have them too and all love it . There is a huge difference when your neck is kept warm in cold weather ... it keeps your whole body more comfortable .	-1
I bought & will be returing back to amazon since it 's very flimsy . Also , dangerous to open & close the scissors .	-1
Having purchased Coghlan 's items in the past , I thought I 'd give this a try . It does have some good idea items , but quality is very poor.The good : the water proof bag.The bad : whistle with a pea ? ? cheap , cheap and cheap . Minor first aid items- band aid are cheap to begin with , not to include quality is just wrong period . A pencil & paper you probably have everywhere at home . matches , that are not water proof or at least strike anywhere ? 5 '' of water proof tape , could you spare it ? A rusty needle sticking thru plastic bag , cool.The not so bad : standard poncho , Mylar blanket , green light stick 12 hour , 2 fire starters , and a button compass , and smashed orange trail tape of cheap quality.String , rope , razor blades , smashed fishing line , snare , safety pins etc , just not worth it.Bottom line : you can put a better kit together your self cheaper with higher quality items . Or just spend the couple extra bucks and buy better quality from AMK or others . After all your talking about a SURVIVAL kit , your worth the extra money right ? ? ! ! Get a pen & paper look at different kits and write down things that you want or will work for you and just get them . AMK survival kit is the best put together kit so far for the money . I also am putting together my own to see just what a quality kit will run.This kit was smashed , sliced thru and the box was trampled during delivery , not to mention the missing items !	-1
bought this bell thinking it was for adult bicycles . It was n't until I was on the Autobahn with car traffic going over 100 mph that I found out how wrong I was . It turns out , this `` bell '' is for a tricycle for 2 year olds .	-1

I really thought that the number of positive reviews would have been accurate , but the bell which I received does not even sound like a bell . Something is dampening the resonance and it just sounds like something rubbing against some metal . I eneded up going to Walmart and buying a $ 5.00 & # 34 ; Cars & # 34 ; ( the movie ) bell . It sounds much more like a traditional bike bell.Save the money and time and just buy a cheap bell from Walmart . It may have a cartoon character on it ( for me it is actually fun ) but it is much louder , and really sounds like a traditional bell .	-1
This product produces a slow flow due to its design . I bought it because a reviewer said it fits a Nalgene water bottle . And it will fit some . But the flow of water from it is very slow . I would not but it again . I would not even use it on a Dromedary water bag . The water bag nozzle is good enough .	-1
First off , though I tried to follow the instructions , I wound up with some problems where the bunched up portion of the wrists around my jacket did n't seem to get properly coated , and therefore let water into my rain coat that I treated.It seems like I used about an entire bottle of this stuff on one coat . I may have over-applied it , even though some areas like the wrists did n't seem to be properly treated.Given that I may have had some mistakes in application , I am going to say that I was n't impressed with the results . After application , a couple of rainy walks seem to see the jacket start to wet out in various places again . I could certainly see a lot more beading than soaking , but after a couple rains it seemed to wear off.I was hoping to avoid purchasing new raingear , and I gave it a shot , but from now on I 'll just bite the bullet and get the new raingear . While this product may turn out to be ok for casual walks around the block or to the store , I do n't think it fits my needs ( wearing my rain gear on motorcycle trips in heavy rain for 40 minutes or more ) .	-1
I bought several of these rings and installed them without problems UNTIL the other day . I was mounting one lower ring on my Savage 93 bolt gun until it tightend up ( the screw did ) but noticed the lower ring still was loose . The other lower ring did n't have that problem and tightend up properly . I switched off the problem lower ring with another one ( same type ) and it did tighten properly.Being curious , I bought a different set of rings ( Leupold Rifleman series ) from a local gun shop and tried them . Everything worked fine and I noticed that the Leupold rings were beefy compared to the wimpy Weaver ones . The small clip that tightens the ring to the rail is thin on the Weaver and heavy duty on the Leopolds . Hmmmm ... . Well I ditched all the Weaver ones and changed everything over to the Leupolds . I hear horror stories about bad scopes , inaccurate barrels , my gun not shooting consistantly straight , ect , and most of the time it 's a bad scope mount or improperly mounted scope . I ca n't trust these rings at all.Look at the picture of these rings and notice the thin rectangular piece of metal underneath the tighting screw . Then compare it to a Leupold `` Rifleman series '' ring and tell me which one do you want on your gun.Price difference is twice for the Leupold but $ 18.00 for the good one vs $ 9.00 for the cheap one should n't be a show stopper . Weaver does make higher end mounts but this line is marginal at best .	-1
Nothing against the scope rings but they where not tall enough for .257 and I had to send them back .	-1
You get what you pay for . Honestly they are n't -bad- , they are innexpensive low profile rings that are good for a .22 or something , but they rattle to much with my .308 and my 5.56the main reason it lost an extra start instead of being average rating , is they are not only low profile , but I can not look UNDER them because of the bolt in the way and I bought them to use with a rail that allows both the scope and irons , but this bolt is in the way , even though it does n't look like it in the pic .	-1
The screw is too long , zero visibility even in daylight conditions.Rip off . Even if it the screw was n't too long , the visibility itself is no better than a bead sight . Garbage .	-1
Waste of money . I bought this bulb and it was defective . Contacted seller and they send a second one which was also defective . They tried to say my flashlight was defective . I explained I had alligator clips to the spring and post and the guy said the switch on my flashlight was bad . If your thinking about buying these , go to a brick and mortar store with the flashlight and do n't leave until it works .	-1
The P60 Lamp Reflector Assembly by SureFire is an incandescent bulb that serves no useful purpose in today 's flashlight market considering that you can upgrade to an LED light that will last significantly longer , is much more durable , and is up to seven times brighter than this bulb . If you use your flashlight for work and need a reliable light then stay away from this bulb as it can easily be broken.Pros : NONECons : - Poor durability . Drop your flashlight once and this bulb has a good change of breaking.- Poor bulb life . You will end up spending less money if you upgrade to an LED light which will last for the remaining life of your flashlight . The initial cost of an LED will be more but will pay off in the long run.- Poor Lumen output at 65 lumens . You can buy an LED upgrade for a 450 lumen replacement such as Flashlight Bulb LED Upgrade - 450+ lumens - CREE R5 Single Mode Drop-in - P60 design : Surefire , Hugsby , Etc.- This bulb gives off a dull off white color while an LED will provide you with a bright white light.Overall , I do not recommend this bulb and would highly recommend an upgrade to an LED light which will serve you better on every level . This is especially true if you use this light for work such as the military , law enforcement , fire service , EMS , or first responder .	-1
I bought this knowing that it will fit my surefire light , It does fit well ; the only and very serious problem is that the metal part inside will scratch your light every time you take your light out . I only placed my light there twice and I regret it big time . Unless mine was defective ( which I think so ) but either way , save your money and go for a cheaper one , definetly not worth the money .	-1
Got a new Surfire light for my birthday and was planning on purchasing a SF nylon holster but decided to go for this one instead , BIG mistake ! ! Overpriced , very uncomfortable and the retention clip broke after using it a few times , not to mention the big scratches left on my new SF 6P , terrible design , save your money and go for something well made , something that will last longer and wo n't ruin your light . Surefire needs to realize they 're no longer the only companies making flashlights and accessories , there are others out there making long lasting and better products at more affordable prices ... ... That 's not just my opinion , it 's a fact ! !	-1
Forget it ... useless item ... not at all on a par with the Balistol products ... it really did nothing useful I can see , and if you really want some ... I have half a dozen spray cans that I will not ever use . To be subtle ( ? ? ? ) , do not waste your money on this junk !	-1
These are very small and expensive . Two cubes would not boil 16 oz . of water indoors out of the wind.There are better fuel choices . I do n't get the 5 star reviews .	-1
I used 5 cubes and it did n't could n't even make 8 ounces of water boil . I would not rely on this as a main mode of boiling or cooking . Do n't waste your time .	-1
