I have a Samsung Galaxy 4 , and definitely did not want to break it or crack the screen , this Case is just what I needed for the protection of my phone . Very durable and covers it up nicely . Definitely would recommend this product to anyone who has an S4 and wants to protect it .	1
Fits the s4 like a glove ! Very easy to put on the phone . Perfect for protecting my purchase from life ! Highly recommend . Plus it looks great and is n't bulky like other Otter Box cases .	1
Otter Box is the ultimate case for protecting your mobile phone . I like the commuter case because it has a slim look and still provides max protection .	1
Amazing case for my Galaxy s4 . It looks durable , protective and do not make my cell to look bigger than it really is . It fits perfectly on the Galaxy s4 . Just buy it !	1
This is for the Otterbox Commuter Series case for Samsung Galaxy S4 . The fit is perfect . Installation was a complete snap without any problems . It does n't add much weight to my cell phone ( which I was afraid it would do ) . While I have n't dropped it so I can not attest to its protectiveness , it is a great case . All of the holes leading to the charger , speaker , etc line up correctly . To charge , simple flip down the protective plastic which covers up the connection . It has built in covers for the volume control and off and on button . Both work great and I have not had any issues . The camera opening is also lined up perfectly and I have not had any issues with it . As an added plus , it came with a protective face shield that was extremely easy to apply . It does not get in the way of the sensors and works great.I have a white Galaxy S4 and wanted to retain the white without adding bulk or changing the color . This does the perfect job . The only issue I have with it is that I can not locate a holster that will work with it . I am a woman and do n't always carry my purse with me , so this is an issue .	1
This case is perfect amount of rubber case and touch shell . light weight . protects charge and audio port . Good investment	1
I have been using Outterbox Commuter cases for a few years now . This case fits the S4 perfectly . There are no lose fittings . All the ports and buttons are covered , port covers do stay in place when not in use . The two piece case is easy to take off , but more of a challenge to put back on . ( Gets easier with practice . ) I started out with the all black case , but when I saw this color , could n't resist getting it . It does add some bulk to the phone , but not much . It feels good in the hand as well . I have know worries when I drop my phone , of it getting damaged .	1
Great fit , nice looking and protects my wifes samsung galaxy s 4 . We love otter box protectors they workas designed ! ! !	1
I like everything about this case except the firmness of the rubber/silicone insert . It is rather stiff , which makes the power and volume buttons rather hard to press ( you sure wo n't press them accidentally ! ) .The color is nice , the design is nice , and the fit and feel is great . If they must use such a high durometer insert , they should make the material over the buttons a little thinner to make them easier to press .	1
I was suprised at the color , it 's not even remotely close to the color pink I expected , it 's neon pink . The other surprise was how heavy it makes my light phone . I 've had other cases like this ( non Otterbox ) that were made with rubber and a plastic case but they were n't as heavy as this one.I think it will provide good protection , but I think I paid for the brand here , I do n't feel like this will provide any more protection than cheaper cases of the same type .	1
I have been searching for a case for my Galaxy S4 that did not take away from the slimline look of my phone but yet offers great protection . This case is exactly what I have been searching for , my phone not only looks great but is completely protected !	1
Gives your case good protection , looks great I had the commuter case for the S3 but this one looks and feels a lot better . I recommend This case not just for looks but for protection .	1
As soon as it was received I tried it on my Samsung Galaxy S4 . It fits perfect on my phone and provides a strong protection against any kind of falls . I have always a good grip , will not slip from your hands as with other brands may occur . The power and volume buttons have not given me any kind of problems to use them with this case on my cellphine . I totally recommend it for a great protection .	1
Just switched from an iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S4 and this is the 4th case I 've bought . My favorite so far . Got the CM4 , Spigen Slim Armor , And Samsung protective case and this is by far the best and most protective ! Had the Commuter for the iPhone and did n't like them , but this fits perfectly for the GS4 and even included a screen protector that went on perfectly with the first try ! Does n't add much bulk and the color is great . Would absolutely recommend to anyone !	1
I have researched this case and it is the best protection bar none . It fits well and slides easily in and out of your pocket .	1
I bought this item to my girl friend , she love the color and its a robust structure and most important , the fashion look in its S4 .	1
I thought the otterbox I had with my S3 was gone and then came you : - ) . I am more than pleased with this purchase to say the least . The construction and fit of the otterbox with my S4 is perfect . The look really compliments the phone . The screen protector is also of high quality and worked out great considering that I am no expert at applying screen protectors . Great Job !	1
This is my 2nd Otterbox Commuter case . I have one for the S3 which is also excellent but a bit difficult to put on and take off . Very tight fit.This case has provided just as much protection as the S3 version and is easier to put on and take off so I would say it 's an improvement over the S3 version .	1
My wife loves the style and protection this gives her Galaxy S4 Phone . I highly recommend this and other products from OtterBox .	1
Love my otter box . I 'm not in the habit of dropping my phone , but it happens . I do n't want to end up with a cracked screen and then pay a lot of money to get it fixed . The otter box works . Just wish it can in some pretty designs .	1
I purchased this in black for my S4 . I 'll give the case 5 stars for quality , fit , protection and function . The screen protector , not so much . My recommendation is YES , buy this case but buy another screen protector . I purchased the SPIGEN SGP Ultra Crystal for mine and I love it.The case fits perfectly and the phones buttons work great with the case installed . My wife has the Defender case for her Galaxy S3 . She is a klutz and requires the extra protection afforded by that beefier case . I chose the commuter because of it 's lower profile . The commuter also lacks the 'sticky ' silicone corner pads which seem to cling to the inside of pockets . The Commuter case seems to provide all the protection I 'll need with the added benefit of sliding in and out of my pocket with ease.I did make a modification to the case already . The USB connection on the phone is protected by a flap which seals very nicely when it 's closed . However , when the phone is plugged in ( as mine is most of the time ) that cover is unsightly to me and gets in the way . It 's a personal preference thing so I cut it off . It 's worth noting that I thought I could simply rip it off along the hinge by tearing the thinner material there . I could n't ... The plastic is very tough so no worries about the plastic flaps coming off on their own because of use . Removal required a sharp utility knife ( or similar ) . I left the cover over the headphone jack because I use it less frequently . It seals tightly and stay closed rather than flapping around and opening on it 's own.It has all the necessary holes in all the correct places so as not to impede the functions of the phone . It seems to provide all the protection I need while not being too obtrusive . The screen protector is the weak link here otherwise this is a 5-star product.UPDATE : It 's been a couple months since I first reviewed this case . In that time I 've dropped my phone onto pavement and other hard surfaces without damage . I am certain this case has saved the phone from destruction .	1
This fits my phone perfectly . I saw some reviews talking about a loose fit and I was worried , but I never had an issues . I used the Defender on the iphones in the past and was sick of a heavy/clunky phone and this keeps my phone safe and sound and fits easily in my pocket . Will it protect my phone like a Defender from Otterbox ... no , but I do n't plan on dropping it out the window .	1
It protects very well ! I would recommend it to others who are looking for an excellent case at a decent cost .	1
This is n't my first Otterbox for a reason . They make a great case . Easy to take on and off . I have purchased the Commuter model for my older phones and they have protected my phone very well against many drops . I have purchased the Defender for my wife and kids . It too is a great case , but I prefer the Commuter . If you do n't need the ability to clip your phone to your belt , definitely go with the Commuter . It adds very little bulk to the phone , but still protects very well . The hard plastic shell allows it to slide easily in and out of pockets , unlike sticky silicon skinned cases . Great fit and protection for my new Galaxy S4 .	1
The protector certainly does it 's job . I love that but the hybrid nature of it seems ... to not fit properly . You put the hard shell over the soft side and it squeezes so hard a bit of the soft rim comes a bit apart from the rest as you slide it in and out of your pocket . Otherwise , it falls and protects the phone in an A-1 manner .	1
I have tried several phone cases for my Samsung Galaxy S4 , and prior to the OtterBox Commuter Series Case they have all been garbage at protecting my beloved gadget from my spastic meat hooks.I am a clumsy human being , and I need to protect my valuable possessions from my inherent clumsiness . The OtterBox Commuter Series Case has a soft , rubbery inner cover that acts as a shock-absorber and a rugged hard plastic outer cover to act like a medieval knight 's plate armor . The cutouts and button covers all line up well , and I 've noticed no sacrifice of functionality like I have with some of my previous cases . My phone is now well suited for the half-dozen daily drops onto concrete it has the pleasure to experience.My only complaint about this product , and the reason I did n't give it a 5 star review , is that the included screen protector is a nightmare to install . The instructions were inadequate at depicting all the necessary steps in applying the screen protector to one 's phone display , and the pull-tabs to remove the film from the front and back of the protective panel pulled away from the film ( instead of taking the film with them ) and thus required me to struggle at getting said films off the protector.Overall , this is a great case . Even if you just throw away the screen protector , this case is a great value to any klutz like me .	1
I felt a little uncomfortable with my S4 , it is so small and thin . I was concerned about dropping it.Anyway , this case is so cool . It 's easy to hold the phone , and it does n't add any appreciable weight or bulk.I did look at the Samsung case too . The flap over the front was of interest , but in the end it did n't seem as usable.Oh , and I did not install the so called screen protector . The phone has gorilla glass , why would you want to muck with it ? Screen protectors always diminish display quality , and I question that they will protect your phone screen when you drop it . Of course , installing it is your options.The case is great .	1
I purchased this case for my wifes Galaxy S4 . I had looked at the Otterbox website and according to there website they had not released these colores yet in Silver and Pink . I did not want the black nor the white with gray for her so I decided to see if by chance anyone had any of the other colors . To my surprise they did . I contacted the company first to see if they actually had it in stock and not backorderd . They replied quickly as in stock . I placed the order and received it with in three days . I am very pleased with the customer service and there quick shipping.The otterbox itself is really nice . My wife seems to really like it . I have the S3 with an otterbox as well and there are a couple of things that I noticed right away . First , was the volume and power pushers . On this new model they are perfect , not hard like on the S3 but not to soft either . I was really pleased about that but the one thing that does have me a little worried is that on the S3 the outer hard plastic goes around the pushers just leaving the corners exposed with the rubber and on the S4 the hard plastic ends underneath the volume and power pushers , leaving more of an area with just the rubber . To me atleast , it just seems like the S3 has better protection with the outer hard plastic going all the way up . I 'm not sure if it was made this way so they can make the pushers softer or for better grip but in any case that is what I noticed and thought I should mention it . Besides that , the rest of the case is wonderful . It 's not to bulky and has a good feel to it . I would trust this case over most others . I am just wainting for them to realease the other colors like the silver and blue for me to purchase as I just got an S4 for myself .	1
I purchased my Otterbox off of Ebay for about $ 5 less ( I know how Ebay can be but yes it 's a real Otterbox , from a USA seller . ) Anyways , so that 's just to let you know that I will not be rating the seller of this product , or shipping , JUST the case itself.I purchased the `` Marine '' color . By the stock Otterbox photos of the case ( which both this Amazon listing and the Ebay listing use ) I fully expected grey hard case and black soft case . However , for others purchasing the Marine color , the inner soft case is actually a very dark blue , a color which none of the stock photos seem to show well . So I took my own photo to give a more realistic idea of the colors there . It was n't an issue with me , so I kept it.The screen protector that came with the case works very well . I have no dust or bubbles showing , and it fits perfectly . However , unfortunately the top corners were bent inside the Otterbox packaging . This was NOT a result of getting bumped around in shipping - it was the way the manufacturer had stuffed it into the box . So those two corners have never and will never stick properly to the phone ... I will probably have to replace it much sooner than normally for that reason.The case itself fits very well . It 's not too bulky and it 's not so thin that I still feel nervous about carrying my phone . The edges of the case extend above the screen so that if you flip it screen side down , the screen will never ever touch the surface . All the buttons still work perfectly , the phone does n't get overheated.BONUS : I can tell you that if you are wanting a wireless charger , they DO work through the Commuter case .	1
I bought this as a gift and my friend is happy with it . Its not too bulky and protects the phone well . It 's easy to install .	1
The commuter series does not make your phone look too bulky . Just wish I had ordered a different color because the lighter colors may get dirty from the handling .	1
Its been 3 weeks I was using and it is very comfortable cover . It fits the phone perfectly . Though the screen protector gets bubbles in one week . 100 % I recomment it . but it is worth .	1
This was the first OtterBox case that I have ever tried for mySamsung Galaxy S4and I can truly say that I am impressed . TheOtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4has a snug fit that was a little difficult to get on at first . But once it was installed , it fit perfectly . The quality and feel of the case is very sound . It may be a little 'slick ' feeling on the back for some , but I really do n't like full rubberized/tacky cases . i feel comfortable holding it and do n't believe it will slip out of my hands or from between my shoulder and ear when not using my bluetooth headset.I had never used an OtterBox branded product before because I thought they looked too bulky for my tastes . But with my rugged handling of my smartphone during business travel , I needed something that could help protect it . And I was pleasantly surprised that the OtterBox did not make the phone too bulky to keep in my pants or jacket pocket . Nor was the case cut such that I could n't use it with my travel charger ( unlike 2 other cases i previously purchased ) .In all , this is a great investment to protect your smartphone by balancing the bulk needed for protection and the style needed for a serious businessperson .	1
I could not find a protector of this quality locally , so I 'm glad I found it on Amazon . It fits the S4 perfectly .	1
I have always used the OtterBox Defender series on my phones so I decided to try the Commuter for my wife 's S4 . She likes it and it fits well .	1
I 've had several otterbox cases for other phones and they 've been amazing . They really have protected my phone from clumsy people ( like myself ! ) . And this one i got in the & # 34 ; Wild Orchid & # 34 ; color which is a very light gray outer case and the pink inner case is brighter in person . Very pretty . I 've gotten several compliments on it . I love it !	1
I love this case ! It looks great on my phone , I bought it in raspberry , and feels great ! It adds a little size to the phone , which is great for me because the phone is so slim , and this is the perfect solution . I feel like this case offers the best protection of the cases available for this phone . I have tried three different cases , including this one , and while I have n't returned all of them , this is my favorite . I have n't dropped my phone , yet . However , I feel that if I do drop it , this case will be my savior . The hard outer case is sturdy and holds the rubberized case snug to the phone and comes up around the edges . It is fairly easy to put on and I found it easier to keep the 2 pieces together while putting it on the phone , otherwise , I found it to be a little bit of a struggle . I really do n't feel that anyone choosing this case will be disappointed , I 'm pretty picky and was happy to find a case I liked so quickly . My only suggestion is that I think they should make it in more colors .	1
Could n't say anything negative- it 's an Otterbox- my rave review is for Amazon providing us with quality for less cost . It 's ridiculous to pay the retail price . Thank heaven for Amazon !	1
Fits like a glove . Have n't actually dropped the phone to test out the durability of the case . Screen protector is fits perfect . Only negative is that dust gets trapped under the rubber section , not a big deal tho .	1
I love the case I just did n't like the color . but it is a very strong item for everyday use	1
Great fit as always from Otterbox and it comes with a really high quality screen protector . I have dropped my phone at least 5 times so far and it has n't been damaged yet ... ..	1
Absolutely love this case . with every new phone I have to have an otterbox case so this was a no brainer . I love the color . I was a little scared the grey part would look blue in person , but it does n't at all . It 's a beautiful color and most importantly protects my phone . Easy to put on and easy to take off	1
I can not say enough good things about OtterBox , especially when this case is amazing and looks amazing ! The colors do n't get dirty and it fits comfortably in my armbands for when I work out ! Worth the purchase !	1
That warm and fuzzy feeling of safety and protection is great . Especially when you know you 'll eventually fall prey to butter fingers and drop that phone that cost more than a nice laptop . It 's not the prettiest case out there ( I 'd love to be able to admire the brushed aluminum edge on my SGS4 ) , but there are Otterbox loyalists who will debate that . I like that it slides into and out of my pocket easily ( or as easily a quasi-phablet can ) . I have n't & # 34 ; test dropped & # 34 ; it , nor do I think I will . But I sure do feel better knowing that when ( not if ) I do , my phone stands a better chance of coming out unscathed than if it were not wrapped in its two sleek layers of protection . Two grumbles : the rubbery part does seem to collect dust and it can be annoying when you take the case off -- but that 's not an everyday event . Also the two & # 34 ; port covers & # 34 ; for the MicroUSB port and the headphone jack can get in the way of a quick installation or removal of the case , and they 're not the easiest to peel down to insert the cable you want to . These are not deal-breakers though . And of course you 'll get a much better deal on a genuine Otterbox via Amazon than you would at your wireless carrier 's store or any brick-and-mortar store for that matter . Order your case a little bit ahead of when you 're getting your new phone and you 'll be protected from day one !	1
Otterbox delivers as always.Case is strong , I like the feel , the back slides into pants easily but the front can keep it from slipping if put face down on a smooth surface.Screen protector included works well , good feel , has a bit of a gloss when screen is off or in bright sunlight , but works as I 'd want.Good buy .	1
Great cover and is what was described when purchased . Thank you for a great product . We are extremely happy and satisfied .	1
Otterbox is always a top case maker . I think they are actually the # 1 case maker in the US , and for a good reason .	1
Otterbox cases are a little bulky but I like the extra protection . The commuter is the best for pants pockets . Mostly smooth plastic with a little bit of rubber on the corners means it slides in and out with ease . I still have one on my iphone 4 for over 2 years but it did need some glue in the corners . This one for the S4 in designed better with no edges to catch in your pocket . My wife has the defender and it 's not really that much larger than the commuter and has much more screen protection but lots of sticky rubber .	1
I am so in love with the color not to mention i have a big problem with dropping my electronics and this does help me . I no longer have to be worried about cracked screens or malfunctioning phone	1
I have an OtterBox 77-27768 Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4 and i bought this one for my girlfriend . Great material and fits well .	1
This is an amazing product , really well manufactured and fits my cellphone like a glove ! Is the big boss in cases ! 100 % recommended	1
i had a galaxy S2 that i loved.. then dropped it once from my lap as i was exiting my car . The screen was destroyed and it cost me over $ 200 to repair . Once i got my S4 , i got this case the same day . And it has been AWESOME . I 've dropped my phone at least a dozen times and there has been not even a hint of a problem with it . Sure , it makes the phone a little bulkier , so you do n't have the sleekness of the uber thin S4 . But do you want a phone to last you or not ? So if you fear dropping it , GET THIS CASE ! the defender is more & # 34 ; child proof & # 34 ; sturdy , but this commuter case is plenty good if you do n't have kids grabbing your phone and tossing out across the room .	1
This product was ordered for a friend . She absolutely loves the product . She changed from the iPhone to the Samsung and wanted the outer box because the one she had for the iPhone worked so well .	1
Had an old Epic 4g , which surprisingly took a beating , and did not even use a case . Upgraded to Verizon Galaxy S4 , and knew it definitely needed a case . I work in an office , and do n't see myself using it in hardcore situations , so I chose the Commuter case . Fit was pretty nice , though it should be noted that it is a little loose with pulling over the top third sides of the phone ; this it where the buttons are , and only silicone protected . However , the phone has not slipped out . Alignment over all the ports and buttons are great . Obviously , while it does n't retain the slimness of the S4 , it is comfortable enough to put in your jeans or pants . Definitely not curved in the back as the first image on the page here appears . Comfortable in my hands . Of note , decided to go with a 3rd party screen protectorTech Armor Samsung Galaxy S4 SIV Premium High Definition ( HD ) Clear Screen Protectors with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [ 3-Pack ] - Retail Packagingas previous reviews mention that the Otterbox screen protector was subpar , and have not had issues with it . Gestures ( including palm swipe ) work fine . Have not had a drop situation yet , but it at least gives me the perception that it will protect better than other cases . If you have or are willing to drop money for a second case for more upscale situations , considerSamsung Galaxy S4 Tough Cases - Olo by Case-Mate Black/BlackorSPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Protective [ Neo Hybrid ] [ Infinity White ] Slim Fit Dual Protection Cover for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 .	1
This is a well-built case that provides about the best protection I have seen for after market cases . The price is reasonable and it comes in multiple colors . So why only four stars ? NO BELT CLIP ! For anyone carrying this phone in a pocket or purse , no problem . But for carrying the phone on an active job , I NEED a belt clip . I tried to solve this by buying a BoxWave case and trying to slip the OtterBox into the belt clip case of that unit , but the clips on the side break off after little use due to the thickness of the OtterBox case . If OtterBox would make a model with a belt clip ( if they do I have not found it ) then this case would win the five stars .	1
I would n't recommend this to anyone that wants a small , sleek case . That said , if you do n't mind your phone being bulky due to the case then this is a great product . I really like mine and it definitely protects the phone well .	1
This commuter case is a vast improvement over the s3 commuter case . Otterbox has done well to improve their cases . The buttons fit flush now and the plug covers have extra silicone on them to hold them in place . This one has n't lost it 's shape and holds up very well .	1
Everything fit together well . The screen protector went on without any problems ( I put Tech Armor on another phone and had many problems ) . Nice to see OtterBox pays attention to detail . Was told the product had a lifetime guarantee , but that is wrong . Word of advice , when putting on the screen protector - make sure your screen is clean , I used a LCD spray cleaner . Also when applying the screen protector make sure it is aligned to the phone edges . It helps when pulling off the # 1 layer to do it slowly and hold down the layer touching the screen .	1
The Otterbox Commuter for the Galaxy S3 almost made me lose faith with Otterbox Products . The Iphone 5 Commuter is n't as bad as the S3 but was n't up to par.The new Galaxy S4 case does everything that an Otterbox should . It fits precisely , protects the phone , is easy to install , offers good grip while being easy to slide in and out of the pocket , and looks good on the phone . The rubber also does n't attract lint like the older Otterbox cases.Here is my Commuter rating scale from previous phones that I have owned : Samsung Captivate-GoodIphone 4-ExcellentGalaxy S2- ExcellentHTC One X- FairGalaxy S3-PoorIphone 5- FairGalaxy S4- Excellent	1
I received my Galaxy S4 , Otterbox Commuter case , and iBOLT xProdock car-dock 2 days before running off on a 3-week , 4000 mile road trip to the Southwest for hiking , camping , and photography . The case worked as expected ( I 've been using Otterbox cases for years ) except for one thing I never thought about until I used it with my Galaxy S4..See con's.Pro 's : * Durable . I dropped my phone several times during my trip on concrete , gravel , sand , and tile flooring . The case did its job . It has a few battle scars on the case but hardly noticeable since I got my case black-on-black . * The back-side of the case is a little thicker than it the Otterbox commuter I had with my previous Motorola Atrix phone . While boiling water at our campsite one night the pot bubbled over and ran down the tabletop right over to my phone . When I got there my phone was literally sitting in a pile of very hot water . The thickness of the case protected it from any of the standing water making its way to my actual phone . A quick wipe with a paper towel and all was good . *Note , its not waterproof nor is the case intended to be . *Usability of buttons . This is one place I put Otterbox above all other cases I have owned . All ports are still easily accessible and buttons are easy to press , even with gloves on . The rubber port cover over the USB charging port is extra-nice for keeping debris out , yet very easy to open for charging.Con 's : *Holds in heat . While plugged into my car-dock and exposed to full sun my phone became extremely hot , even with the A/C on . I know that sounds obvious but the full-sun exposure never caused a problem with the past 3 phones I used in this manner . I constantly received the pop-up message on my phone saying `` Charging Paused , battery too hot . '' It never lead to any major problems but is annoying when I get that message when its only 75 degree 's outside . I definitively ca n't say its the phone or the case 's fault , but the logic of having a device encased in a thick black case makes sense that it will absorb and retain heat .	1
I was worried this case would be too bulky , but its the perfect level of protection without being too thick . It still fits in my dashboard mount without issue.Its very well protected , and even came with a quality screen protector that somehow feels smoother than the glass itself.I havent dropped it to test its durability yet , but im not worried about my brand new phone breaking at all anymore . Its definitely a confidence inspiring case to say the least	1
I was originally going to get the & # 34 ; marine & # 34 ; colored case , but this one was cheaper . I really like the black mist/black case combo . This is built differently than the GS3 case , with less exposed rubber on the corners and a more unified feel . The GS3 case came in 2 distinct pieces , but I had a hard time telling this was 2 pieces until I really looked . Have n't used the screen protector yet , so I 'm not sure how well that works .	1
I bought this for my Mom 's brand new Galaxy S4 . It looks great ( make sure you look at all pics , though ... there is a lot of & # 34 ; orchid & # 34 ; on the front rim ) , snaps on the phone like it always belonged there , and offers moderate protection from bumps and minor drops . The price on Amazon is amazing , considering the Sprint Store wanted to sell her the same case for $ 49.99 .	1
I 'm really not an otterbox fan , but this is a nice case . It does n't bulk the phone up to much . It maintains nice , snug natural feel and is truly rugged . I got this for my wifes phone . If otterbox made one for my Galaxy mega with a holster , I would buy it without any second thoughts .	1
bought this by mistake but I LOVE the color and the feel too bad I had a s3 instead of a s4 ! worth the buy ... very stylish	1
My son absolutely loves this case . He stopped putting cases on his phone because he wanted to show off the white phone , this solved both problems , now he can show it off as well as protect it at the same time .	1
Well what can ya say ? It 's Otterbox - one of the best protective cases you can get for your phone . The commuter is for the person on the go who is not so clumsy but , the occasional drop might happen . If you are rougher on your phone than most - get the otterbox defender - it has a built in screen protector also.If you do buy this one - do n't use the cheap stick on screen protector - get yourself a moshi washable re-usable protector ! Wish I knew about them sooner ! And your welcome !	1
Received it fast and loved it ! I did not use the screen protector that came with it based on the reviews I read that said it was n't great so I ordered a TECH ARMOR screen protector along with the case . Very durable and does n't add too much bulk like the other otter box cases . Definitely worth it , order it now !	1
Great case for the S4.Looks good and looks like it will do a decent job of protecting the phone.It is still comfortable to hold the phone with the case on it and the phone slides in and out of pockets with no problems.I am not using the included screen protector.Instead , I 'm using ailoome Samsung Galaxy S4 ( HD Clear ) ScreenMate Real Tempered Glass 9H Hardness Premium Screen Protector with Oleophobic Coating.There is a review of the iloome screen protector on you tube by Erica Griffin that can be found here : [ ... ] That demonstration of what a tempered glass screen protector can do for you is one of the neatest things I 've seen . Go on , hit your screen with a HAMMER after installing the iloome tempered glass screen protector . That is just too cool.As for the Otterbox , no complaints . Looks great , goes on easy , and it offers substantial protection for the body of the phone .	1
Best phone protection ever . Anyone who has a mobile phone of value should most definitely buy otterbox for protection . I will never go without it .	1
Bought this for the Hubby 's phone . He 's notoriously rough on phones and I wanted to protect our investment . This is a great case because it is simple , not overly designer-ish and is sturdy enough . No problem with the fit and was easy to put on .	1
This case fits perfectly . All of the other cases that I have tryied are to big . Thin case and protection for my phone .	1
Purchased it to replace a slip fit hard case that cracked the first time it was dropped . Like the Otter Commuter design . Comes in two pieces , pink is softer plastic , to obsorb the bangs to the corners & sides . Grey is harder plastic that fits nicely over the pink .	1
When my wife and I got the new S-4 I went with the standard Defender Series but she dose n't wear a belt that often and with the redsign of the the S-4 over the S-3 her old one one would fit I found this one that matched ner colorful manner . The only down side is it dose n't protect as good as the Defened series so do n't expect it too . ( Already had to replace the phone and it only fell off the bed onto a carpeted floor my phone was was with it npo dames to mine her screen was brokne in two places ) . It is fair protection for the phone .	1
the case is very good and protects the phone very well . i dropped it many times and felt assured that the phone is fine and it has been thus far . thanks it very nice case and takes of easily to .	1
I 've abused my phone and this case has kept my phone by going kaputs on me . I really love the case . It fits the phone to the t. It does it job . I 'm going to buy another one because I 'm tired of the color that I got ... might go for an all white one this time .	1
I 've been using the TPU covers on my wife 's iPhone and my prior phone , a HTC EVO - these wrap around the front so you have some protection if you drop the phone . The ones I 've used areDiztronic Matte Back Black TPU Case for Sprint HTC Evo 4G LTE ( 2012 4G LTE Model Only ) - Retail PackagingandDiztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for Apple iPhone 5 / 5S - Retail PackagingNeither phone has been damaged despite numerous drops.The Otterbox Commuter adds an extra layer of hard plastic . While this should make it more robust , it does make it a bit bulkier . Still , if you are more concerned about damage than the size , this is a decent way to go , but to repeat , we have n't had any damage to our phones while using the thinner TPU only cases I mentioned above .	1
The OtterBox case for my new Galaxy S4 phone is by far the best cell phone case I 've ever had . It is definitely worth every penny I paid for it . Soft and easy to grip on the outside , it has a heavy inner shell that really protects my phone . It also has a screen protector that is second to none.The port for charging the battery has a protective cover too .	1
There are many reviews telling how well the case is so I am just going to talk about the few questions/concerns I had with this case in case anyone else may want to know as well.Wireless charging : I installed this wireless charging receiver : B00D2V9XFCand tested it with this charging pad : B00DQDE1K8I linked the two products as I would imagine ( I have n't had a whole lot of experience with wireless charging ) that the results you get depend on the charger and receiver you picked . Anyway , It worked just fine in the otterbox case.SPIGEN glass screen protectors : I purchased the .23 mm version of the glass . After applying it the Otterbox case was significantly harder to snap together . I stopped trying to force it for fear of damaging something . I think the .15 mm version of the glass might work with this otterbox case but I ca n't say for sure.Other thoughts on quality : I have had Otterbox Defender cases in the past . With the S4 case I feel as though they used a cheaper material to make the rubber shell that goes around the plastic one . It still protects and this is just a personal observation/opinion.The reason I docked one star is because of the plastic film that is built in to protect the screen . On any of the otterbox cases I have owned this screen is n't that great as I feel it gives the screen of my phone a filmy look ( I hope this makes sense . ) I have heard others just remove it and substitute there own but I have never personally done this and I do have to admit that you can get used too it . I still dock the star though because in this case where the phone has an HD screen I feel it matters.Bottom line : I do like this case but sadly am returning it since I applied that glass screen protector . I really do feel like I am giving my phone some serious protection as it takes me forever and some sore fingers to get that dang plastic shell apart even when the phone is n't in it .	1
I have tried numerous cases on my other phones and nothing compares to the OtterBox . I had The Commuter on my HTC phone and it worked great . Now I have a new phone and have gotten the Defender for both mine and my husband 's phone . It adds a little bulk and if you like the slim Galaxy then this is not for you . If you want protection and good grip this is the one for you . I like that there is a plastic screen protector in addition to the snap on clip part for added protection . I seem to always be dropping my phones so I need good protection and this is the one for me . I totally love it . It fits tight so do n't plan on changing out a battey unless you do n't mind losing your nails lol ... but I like the fact that my phone is protected . I am one to keep my phones for 2 years so I want to keep it nice .	1
My husband is very rough on his phones due to his job , and we used to have to make at least one or two insurance claims during the duration of our contracts in order to replace them , or have a cracked screen repaired , etc . We always had spare phones on hand for this purpose , just in case . It was a pain , but we learned to adapt - until the most amazing thing that we have discovered -how AWESOME Otterboxes are.He has dropped his S4 off of a roof in this case , and it miraculously survived . I have no idea how , but only the case was scuffed . If that 's not a testimony , I do n't know what is . My Otterbox is on the way as we speak - I bought a standard flip folio case since my phone is relatively safe during the day ( from my bedside table , to my cell pocket in my purse , to my work desk , and back in the purse and home ) , but I still want that extra level of protection . Some people argue it 's expensive , but when you consider that it 's less than the cost of our deductible to replace his S4 that fell off of the roof - it 's definitely worth it !	1
I 've always been impressed with OtterBox quality and protection - owning six cases for various devices made by them , and this OtterBox Defender case with holster for the Samsung Galaxy S4 is no different . Purchased for a Mother 's Day gift for a new phone , the case fit perfectly and provides a fairly slim ( by OtterBox standards ) case with built-in screen protector . My Mom loved it ! A hard plastic shell case goes over the phone , then a silicon sheath over the hard case to buffer against drops . The screen is not negatively affected by the screen protector , and all the ports are easy to get to and buttons easy to use . The camera is not obscured at all , and sound from the phone is not muffled.The only issue we had was getting the case back off . In the directions is a 'tool ' , which did not ship with our case . A small , flat head screwdriver popped the latches so we could get to the phone , but it was tricky ! We had to go to YouTube to look-up how to do it . Other than this - it 's all good !	1
Just got this today , was kind of worried about the price due to the Otter Box brand being a little more expensive for my taste . I honestly just put this on my phone and I already like it , quality it great and fits just like the other customer 's are saying . Overall happy with my purchase and fast shipping !	1
Overall I am a big Otterbox fan . I have tried both Lifeproof and Griffin cases . I always liked the Otterbox the best . It looks good and does a great job of protecting the phone.However I do have some issues with the case:1 . The covers for the charging port and headphone port always seem to break off after being opened to many times . They will start to tear and after a while come off.2 . After putting the case on the phone , taking it off is not a easy task . Even after taking it off just once , the small tabs bend and look like they are going to break.3 . Dust will get under the screen cover.Overall I think it is a great case , but it does have issues .	1
bought an OtterBox case for my previous Galaxy device and loved it , so when I upgraded to the S4 , buying a case was an easy choice . The Defender Series provides very , very solid protection for your phone with as little added bulk as possible .	1
fast delivery good product BUT way overpriced and a shame there is not a cheaper alternative around . Ill keep looking but it protects my phone well	1
My daughter has broke 2 phone in 2 months time this time she got the Samsung and mom got the case ! ! UGH ! ! ! This case is like bubble wrap for a phone so now I wo n't be spending anymore on phones . She used up her insurance in 2 months time..I am broke !	1
I 'm sold on Otterbox . I bought this for my son who has a reputation of dropping phones . No worries with this case . It is a good look and super protective . I highly recommend it to anyone who does n't mind a little bit thicker phone .	1
One of the better Otter Box products that I have used in recent years . The design is nicer that some of my older models . Easy to get to the charger port . The rubber is n't strained as to rip after a year or so of use . The colors are nice I have always had a black case though I would change it up a bit . Would recommend to someone wanting a case . You ca n't beat the protection that otter box offers for the price on Amazon . : p	1
I have purchased this same case for another phone and this one was definitely priced a hole lot better . Love it	1
Very impressed with design -- it offers great protection to phone.I actually like the way the screen works better with the case than withoutThe other day -- I was getting out of car the seat belt caught phone and knocked off -- it fell into shallow puddle - the case offered protection from dropped and to minimize water damage -- although its not designed for this purpose . Normally -- I do not drive with phone in belt case -- but I was going 3 minutes down road to get gas -- and was going to put phone in car dock when I stopped for gas.The & # 34 ; naked & # 34 ; phone is rather light -- the case definitely adds bulk and weight -- so that should be considered before purchasingHowever if protection is your main purpose for purchasing -- - you should be pleasedOne other thought is that -- make sure you get used to snapping in phone in belt case ( securely ) -- so you do not risk losing your phone	1
By far the best case/pouch combo available for the money . Forget all the other stupid cases that look cute but interfere with the phones reception or do n't offer any major protection , such as for the charging port and headset port ! ! ! You do n't even need a screen protector since one is built right into this case ! ! Worth everty penny and a fantastic selection of colors .	1
This is the third protective case I have tried for my Galaxy S4 and it is definitely the sturdiest and appears to offer the maximum protection . The back , sides and corners of the phone are well cushioned and the included screen protector covers the touch screen without affecting its performance . There are protective flaps over the charging port and headphone jack , which close securely when they are not in use . The on/off and volume buttons are completely covered by protruding buttons which operate without any problems by pressing on them . There are openings for the Home button ( it is the only button not covered ) , earpiece , light and proximity sensors , both cameras , flash , speaker and microphones.The holster holds the phone very firmly , so firmly that it is difficult to release the phone from the holster with only one hand . This is not an issue for me , however , because I do not use the holster on my belt . I have used the holster on the sun visor of my car and it keeps the phone close while driving . The kickstand on the holster performs its function well and holds the phone at a comfortable viewing angle when the phone is on a table and I am seated.When the phone is laying on a flat surface its back , the rubberized material of the case keeps the phone firmly in place . However , the phone slides easily when placed face ( screen ) down on a flat surface . I therefore usually lay the phone on its back when putting it down on a flat surface and rely on the screen protector to prevent any potential damage to the screen.Installing my phone in this case was challenging . Although the process was fairly intuitive , I had difficulty removing the screen protector from its holder . The directions included in the box , which consisted only of a simple diagram , were useless and the on-line directions on Otter 's website were not any more helpful . Unfortunately , by the time I finally got the phone installed in the case , there was a permanent scratch on the membrane of the screen protector , but this does not interfere with viewing the screen . I eventually found an instruction video by a user on removing the membrane on YouTube , but only after I had installed the phone in the case.This case substantially increases the size of the Galaxy S4 . I usually keep my phone in my side pants pocket and inserting and removing the phone from this pocket is somewhat difficult with this case on the phone - considerably more difficult than with other cases I have tried . On the other hand , this case offers excellent protection for the phone . I think it would be most effective for those who leave their phones out in the open for long periods of time or who work in dusty or rugged conditions , such as in construction .	1
It does protect very well . i love the color ... however , some of the rubber on the front edge has peeled away a little bit , which is disappointing .	1
it 's kinda big and pricey . It seems like it would work great but while this was shipping i dropped and cracked my brand new GS4	1
My wife breaks phones . She breaks a lot of phones . I finally got her to convert off of a keyboard smart phone onto an S4 and then wrapped it in this Otterbox . Despite leaving her phone in the rain and dropping it on a near daily basis , the phone is still working like new . I am positive this case is the reason her phone still works .	1
It was a bit of a challenge to get the Defender open to insert S4 but that might be a good thing in the long run..Total weight on digital scale with the holster attached reads just over 7 ounces . Over 4oz without the plastic holster attached.When the clip on plastic holster is not attached it still fits into a pants pocket which is how I like to carry my phone . If you like it on your belt or waist band the holster with click can be put on the front or back of the case ... that is , screen covered or showing as it 's clipped onto your person.Yes , the buttons on the edge of the phone are a bit harder to press through the protective surround , but nothing horrible and serves as a reminder that your S4 is protected well . Charge port and headphone port have flexible parts of the case to seal them , but attached on one side so ca n't be removed and lost.Do n't expect the `` vibrate '' function to be as pronounced and useful as it was before as the S4 is that much more insulated from your person to feel the vibrations as before ... This Defender is not waterproof rated even if it seems that way.Otterbox has a new case that is waterproof if that is what you need . It 's the new `` Pursuit Series '' Clear part that goes over your screen is very clear and touch screen feels just the same as without to me.it is attached to a snap on frame that is part of the case and NOT a press on static type film.Although , with the new Gorrilla Glass 3 Samsung is using on the new S4 I never had a worry about screen scratches even with nothing over the glass . More protection is welcome as long as it works as well as the Otterbox design.One BIG thing I like about this case that I did n't expect was that the sides stick up far enough above the screen that I do n't press screen icons close to the edges by accident just from holding the phone . Hooray ! I 'm sure I wo n't be the only person that will find this as an unadvertised feature ... If you ca n't find the `` Kickstand '' feature , just open the clip as far as it will go and press the latch on the case , it will catch on that part and hold it open so you can set the Defender at an angle on table etc.I do like this case so far and hope that it saves the insurance deductable if I ever drop it ... at that point I would raise my review to 5 stars `` I love It '' rating.Now for long term field testing ... I always update my reviews if need be .	1
I just recently purchased this product and so far , I love it . I have not had any problems with the holster . It holds the case pretty well . I do have some trouble trying to open the case to access my phone , but I think it 's because I suffer from arthritis . The screen protector is not meant to fit like a screen protector that fits snug on the screen ; therefore , I purchased a separate clear lifetime warranty screen protector and placed it on my cell phone screen for added protected from scratches . I highly recommended purchasing an additional screen protector . The holster has a clip on the back if you want to clip it to your belt bucket . I have not tried doing that , yet .	1
The OtterBox Defender is the best case for the Galaxy S4 in my opinion . It is bulky , but makes it easier for me to hold the phone . The Galaxy S4 is so light and thin on it 's own , I always feel like the phone will go flying out of my hand at any moment . I had a thin silicone case before I got the OtterBox and I was always worried about dropping it because it was very slippery , but the Defender has the rubber part on the outside which provides for an excellent grip . I never worry about dropping my phone anymore because it 's easier to hold , but if I do drop it ( or my daughter ) I know it will be protected.It is very hard to get the case off if you need to clean it . I like to clean my phone about once a week because with these cases dirt and dust tend to get trapped under the built in screen protector . Those are my only complaints ( hard to remove and collects dirt very easily under the screen protector ) . But I 'll gladly deal with those minor problems to have my phone protected from drops !	1
I heard first hand and read many a tale of phones that survived significant falls due to this case and I did not want to pay for insurance any more ( especially now that I have multiple android phones available as backups ) so I decided to give this a try.The two plastic pieces snap together nicely and come apart well ( lift at the tabs ) .The rubber that wraps around these two plastic pieces seems to be a very good material and should last a long time and should have no problem with being removed and replaced many many times . Plus it make the phone feel good and non-slippery in hand as you use it.The clear screen protector was okay , but I did eventually remove it and the double sided tape that held it into place came off quite well with little to no residue . I put on a Steinheil Spigen SGP Ultra Crystal screen protector instead . There are many advantages to having a screen protector of the highest quality and physically attached to the screen , but the biggest one is that should the screen crack , it will still be usable . My wife dropped her phone and was able to use it just fine for months with a very cracked screen . It is now our daily alarm clock.I had to shave and round off and the prongs at the bottom around the USB port so that it would fit into my modified SmartDock , which also has 3 parts removed so that I do not have to take off the case for either my S4 or my wife 's Note II . Well , I have to take the rubber part off of this case , but that is no real issue . It was also required for the MHL 2.0 's rather large MicroUSB plug to fit without removing the case.I am generally afraid to handle my phone without this protector on and with it on , I feel I can use my phone all I want without fear.The belt clip fits well and does not seem like it would break or slide off as easily as past ones have for me . Update : It has slid off a couple of times these past few months , however the phone is none the worse and I have a tracker enabled should I discover it missing.One negative is that I can never feel it vibrate ( keep reading for an update on this point ) Another is that the clip is uncomfortable when I do not have a shirt tucked in.Another negative is that , while the clip allows you to stand it up in landscape mode , it is at too sharp an angle ( about 85 degrees I 'd say ... I think 60 to 75 degrees may be better ) After getting this Case , I purchased the Samsung EP-CI950IBUSTA Wireless Charging Cover and found that this case does not work well with the thickness of the new back cover . I finally got it to snap together by removing the inner lining of the plastic case for the back of the phone.The unexpected bonus of the tight fit is that I can now fell the S4 vibration alarm when using the Otterbox case . Very nice side effect.Overall , now 5 months later , I am very pleased with this purchase .	1
Great protective case , does not add a lot of bulk but the inner cover really seals the phone well and the outer rubber makes it very durable . I have a screen protector on the phone and even with the OB case ( with clear screen cover ) the phone works great . It is easy to but on and off . The one thing to be aware of is that the case may not allow you to charge phone on a charging stand , but the OEM charging cable from Samsung works perfectly with the case on the phone .	1
Love this thing . Anything otterbox is pretty great though . Love how easy it is to clean and switch cases . !	1
Great price . All Otterboxes are great . This one fits snugly , and offers great protection from whatever you can throw at it .	1
Dad loves it and it keeps his phone protected while he is on the job . Otter box is a great product .	1
Good protection and good price . Plain black , but cheaper than colors . Does the job . I feel safer with it since I broke my previous Galaxy S4 with a cheap cover on it and now screen cover .	1
I 've had my phone for over a year now and this case has kept it in tact , thank goodness ! Otherwise , I 'm sure I would have broken my phone a long time ago .	1
I have used the defender case on older phones . The defender has always been good at & # 34 ; defending & # 34 ; . The rubber on the old case would stretch and not fit well over time . The contacts that hold the phone to the holster would break . ( Had to use warranty 2 times for this issue . ) The NEW case does not suffer from these problems . The clip is sturdy and the rubber is tight . It is not as bulky as the old cases . It has a built in screen protector that does not reduce the touch sensitivity . This is a great case .	1
I have only had this case on for a couple of days but i like it a lot . It fits very well and is easy to put on and take off . My only gripe is that water can get in behind the screen protector forcing you to take apart the case and dry it out . no where does this product say waterproof so i cant complain too much .	1
Brought for my girl friend g4 works great , no worries about drops , seems to be good for pertecting her phone .	1
The case is a little on the large side . but the protection it provides is second to none . OtterBox is the best .	1
as described with no issues . as with any otterbox , if the added bulk is ok , it 's the only way to go .	1
this is the one i put on my sons phone , he like to drop stuff , so far it as protected the phone	1
I bought the defender case for my iPad and went ahead to buy this for the S4 . I do not regret buying . It is a very solid case and gives the best protection out there . It can make your phone bulky though but for the protection it gives I do not mind !	1
I purchased this as a backup for the Blue version of this case.it protects the front , sides , and back of the phone ! GREAT CASE.Been using it for a week now and I would n't use any other case .	1
I purchased this case for my son-in-law , who had seen it in a store and was impressed with it . Protection was the most important factor in choosing this case , and he loves it ! I would have given it five stars , but it did n't arrive on time , so docked it one star .	1
Its worth every penny it cost . My experience with this is remarkable and I would recommend this to anyone that wants to preserve the life and esthetic of a cellphone .	1
Bought this for my niece for her birthday , she loved it . It fits and functions just like it should , not to mention she was pretty thrilled to see it the purple color as apparently it 's hard to find anything but the black and white in a store .	1
What can you say it 's an otter box but the 'snap-in ' of the case will take some getting used to . Just remember to keep the screen in when you have the phone in the holster and make sure the clip is secure over the belt .	1
A handsome case . I removed the plastic screen protector , as all sorts of dirt and stains get between it and the glass iPhone screen , so that it requires constant cleaning . Recommend removing the plastic and installing a tempered glass protector . Quite thick . in my pocket .	1
I have wasted enough money on the less expensive cases for the S4 . This case fits perfectly and all cut outs are on target . Would highly suggest this case to anyone looking for good protection at a great Amazon price .	1
My case just did get here , so I will have to update my review later on.That said , I paid a really great price . Around $ 25.00 . I got the actual case . In the actual retail packaging . It is just the color that I thought it was online.So far , it went on pretty easy , though I can see it may be difficult to remove if I need to remove the battery for whatever reason . I checked the charger and that seemed to go in pretty easy . I have not checked the part that uses earphones yet . The `` Square '' does not work with the case on , though , you can input the numbers directly . As I often use this device , that is not going to be a big deal . If I ended up using it more I may have to figure something else out.. However , the Paypal device works fine , though it is hard to push down . And again , I do n't use it that much for it to matter at this point to me.It makes the phone heavier which to me is a good thing . The S4 is pretty flimsy and I was afraid of dropping it before today . Now , not so much . It is easy to hold in the hand . Texting is great with it on . I have not made a phone call as of yet . I will update it this part a later on when I make a new update.So far , I gave it 5 stars as that is what it deserves.Update 3/27/2014So , I dropped a star because the pink rubber part of the cover is peeling away by the camera area . It is still being used , just it is not lasting as long as I would have hoped for the price I did pay . I still like it and I plan on buying another one soon , so that I can play around with the covers . I just think it should have lasted longer .	1
It 's worth the price . This case will protect your expensive S4 from accidental drops and it also has holster for easy clipping to your waist .	1
The ultimate in protection for any cell phone is the Otterbox . I have had it pop out of my pocket when riding in my wheelchair and hit the pavement picked it up and no damage was done at all when used with my Samsung Galaxy III ! ! ! I would never go without this for my phone ! ! ! Thinking of getting another one in a different color ! ! ! Love the clip too to keep it on wherever you need to clip it for added protection ! ! !	1
Otterbox did a damn fine job on this particular case . Dropped my phone on concrete pretty hard a few times and the phone just said so what . No damage . The built in screen protector is lovely and the screen is very responsive , ca n't even tell a screen guard is on.This case is perfect for the galaxy s4 . I got the grey color which helps keep the phone a little cooler if you 're using your phone on a hot day outdoors as I do at my job . It will keep temperature a little cooler than black.The price for this case on Amazon is second to none and very fast free shipping . One of the best purchases I 've made on here and I 've made several epic purchases . If you own an HTC one look elsewhere than the otterbox defender case , I did n't care for the HTC one case otterbox put out for many reasons I wo n't get into .	1
This is a great case . I do get annoyed by the charger and headphone covers , but they are there to protect , so I deal with them . I could always cut them off if they get too annoying . Love that it comes with a screen cover . While it 's hard to remove the case , it is by far the most protective if any case I 've ever had on my phones .	1
Solid construction and great protection of both the phone itself and its screen . The hard plastic screen works very well and does not cause response problems to the various finger motions/slides and pokes . The overall protection level is OUTSTANDING . I have witnessed 3 drops from chest level onto a tile floor and no damage has resulted whatsoever . This is the precise reason we bought these cases . The accessibility of all the buttons and jacks , as well as the camera lens and speaker/microphones is perfect.This is a terrific case . My only criticism is the case is a bit difficult to take apart for cleaning ( dust can accumulate on the inside of the front screen over the period of a month or two ) . I feel one of these assembly/dis-assembly runs is going to break the locking tabs that hold the hard plastic portion of the case together ) . the rubber surround is a great shock absorberI do not comment on thin versus thick or aesthetics . Both of these are of no consequence ( to me ) , when trying to protect a $ 600 phone . Beauty is in the eye of the beholder . I like the rugged look and non-sip feel of the case . My wife got this purple one , and I got an identical case , but in blue.Perfect fit to a Verizon Galaxy S4	1
The screen protection , alone , is worth having this case , but the whole thing is great . I do n't really count the external snap on cover as a layer of protection , because I carry it in my shirt pocket , but if you drop this thing , it 's far more likely that it will survive than if it slaps off of the ground with a lesser form of protection on it . The polycarbonate screen protection saves me tons of annoyance with those cheap plastic covers that have to be adjusted and replaced . This solid case is very well made and not too thick , as I expected . My S3 would have survived the minor fall it suffered from had I used this case ( and I would never have had to replace that phone with the S4 ) .	1
at first i was unhappy with this case . the first few weeks , it used to blank the screen after a call or during a call and nothing would bring the screen back . i figured out it was the case once when i started to remove it to try to take the battery out . then the screen would come to life and i could end the call . one time someone butt dialed me and i could not hang up on them for 15 mins until i started to take the case off.anyway , it 's not doing it anymore and i have had this for 6 months now . every once in awhile it does it , but i can live with it.i hate the stupid flaps for the mic jack and the charger , so i cut them off with thin snips and a rotozip since they have steel wire in them and just a knife would not work.also , i took off the screen protector . it was too thick and was making pressing buttons very hard.i had printed a return label to ship it back , but i am satisfied that i did not return it . it 's a bit pricey though . i did n't like that part.i have dropped it many times , been in attics , basements , garages , bumped , everything ... no issues.the clip has held up well . it never comes off the clip if installed correctly .	1
Had to go through 2 Otterboxes to get one without a 'sticky ' screen protector . This one was perfect ! I had to pay a little extra , but my wife really loves it ! Of course , it also is functionally the market leader in protecting the phone ...	1
Best case for Galaxy s4 . I love it , it looks cool and feels great in your hand . I have done its job after several drops . And has a protective clear cover built in to protect your screen as well . I would buy again without thought .	1
I made the mistake of first purchasing an i-Blason case for $ 13.99 from Amazon . The pictures of the case made it look very solid , but once I got it , I was VERY disappointed . It did not fit correctly at all , and the holster supplied with it only allowed you to put the phone into it face down , meaning once the phone was holstered , you had no access to the screen anymore.I carried my Motorola Electrify phone for about 1.5 years , and from day 1 , it was in an Otterbox Defender case . I loved it . So , after I sent back the cheapo case , from i-Blason , I decided to spend the extra money and get the Otterbox Defender.I ordered my defender case from Ebay , since I was able to get it there for $ 29.99 shipped , and at the time , Amazon was $ 38.50 , but as I write this , Amazon is now at $ 31 , which I would have paid the extra $ 2 to buy it from Amazon ( faster shipping with Prime , and great customer service ) .I have used the case now for a few days , and really like it . The case fits the phone perfectly , and was easy to install . The phone , once in the case , slides into the holster both face up , and face down.The reason I am taking away half a star is because the power button is extremely difficult to activate . You have to really push hard to get the screen to turn on and off . On my old Otterbox case , with the Electrify phone , it only took a small amount of force to get the button to work.Other than that , the case is well worth the extra money you will spend over the cheaper , inferior cases .	1
the otterbox fits the s4 to a tee . very protective and does not take up a lot of room in my pocket .	1
This is the best phone case in the market ! I always depend on OTTERBOX since year 2009 when I had IPHONE 3GS .	1
bought this for my gfs galaxy s4 to protect from our 1 and a half year old son . already had to buy one replacement phone so this is much cheaper and protects from alot . i 've also had them warranty cover and replace a case which was nice .	1
Let 's face it , most of us will be wedded to our current smartphone until our contract runs out . And high end smartphones are very expensive to replace if you damage them . This case gives you the best shot at making it past the two year mark without damaging your phone through inadvertent drops , scratches , flexes , and the like.This case appears substantial , and cradles the Galaxy S4 without any pressure points . By all accounts it looks well made and capable of doing a good job of protecting its contents ( though I 've not tried the protection by dropping the phone yet ) .The main drawback of this case is that it takes a slim , good looking phone and makes it look like a kid 's toy . There 's a thick rubberized cover completely covering five sides of the phone . All buttons and ports are accessible , but the whole thing looks like its more fit for a worksite rather than a corporate setting . Elegance and beauty are lost in the quest for protection.Its a tradeoff of elegance versus protection . I traded off the former for the latter .	1
I love this case , my wife purchased another but it did n't do the job , this case covers the phone and protects the screen as well , Easy to install and use .	1
As stated in my other review , I am A BIG fan of Otter Box products , I use them on my phones and my entire family .	1
VERY VERSITILE = EASY TO HANDLE = VERY SAFE = COLOR IS PERFECT = WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS BUY ONE FOR YOUR PHONE AND YOU WILL FIND OUT YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO .	1
Perhaps my monitor is not adjusted properly , but I thought that this would be a little darker than it ended up being . The raspberry is kind of a hot pink . I 'm writing this as a warning to anyone else who was hoping for something a bit more red . I suppose that it is my own fault for not properly understanding the meaning of `` raspberry '' though.The case itself is excellent . It does take away from the sleekness of the G4 , but that is OK with me . I 'd rather have something I feel like I can hold . Since the phone is so big I find that I have to shift it in my hand to reach the whole screen . I feel a lot more comfortable doing that with an Otterbox than any other case .	1
After the challenges I had with my S3 screen and phone damage I wanted to be more robust in my day to day use with my S4 upgrade . It adds a bit of bulk to the phone but it is still very comfortable to use . buttons are easy to press and the speaker and microphone are clear and crisp . After reading other user 's comments I left the factory screen protector in place so I 'm two layers deep but the screen response is awesome and not inhibited . It will pick up some static dust particles so every couple weeks I 'll be opening the case to wipe down the screen . Well worth it to simplify my protection and end the $ 100 screen replacements	1
I would recommend the defender series for any phone . especially one without insurance.I just wish they made it for more phones . My mother does animal rescue and a puppy got the last case , the phone survived but they no longer carry that case . it was good , but not as good as my Otterbox.It has literally fell down a flight of concrete stairs without any issues .	1
I bought this case right after dropping my original phone and breaking the screen . I wanted a very heavy duty case I knew would survive anything ! A little bulky but then again it extremely worth it !	1
works great ... gets a little bulky but very protective	1
You ca n't beat the product , but you have to pay the price ! Only 4 stars because it costs more . I would love to use the boxes that are 1/4th the price but they just are n't quite as good . ( But they are close - Otterbox better watch out ) Also Amazon shipped me the wrong color ( maybe I clicked wrong - I 'll own that ) but they need a better ordering screen for this because the Otterbox Website has a lot more option choices .	1
Funny thing , when I received this case , the package looked like it had been run over . It had a tire print and looked pretty beat up . But the product was in perfect shape . That gives me a good feeling about the protection it will give my phone.The case adds bulk and size to the already large phone , but I felt the protection was worth it . It was easy to install and the buttons work fine with just a little extra pressure required . The charger cord slips right in with no problem . I have n't tried the headphone jack as I do n't use that . I suspect it will work just fine too.My friends recommended this case and I can see why .	1
I bought a different case for my Samsung S4 prior to this one . Big mistake on my part . I only gave this 4 stars due to the fact that I would like to see the stand feature added to it to make it perfect ! No other issues than that . Well worth paying 40.00 for this item !	1
Love this case for long trips . There 's no better protection out there . If you 're clumsy like me , this is the case for you to help protect that nice expensive phone of yours	1
Good case , I liked the color when I bought it but in only a few short weeks it 's starting to turn black and I ca n't get it clean . I 've tried windex , alcohol , etc ... .nothing seems to work ! For protection I would absolutely give this case 5 stars , but for how black the case is getting , I 'm rating it a 3 .	1
Never seem to have enough of these . I bought two other types prior for my son , this is the one he sticks with . Fits well , very neat.Would buy again .	1
Otterbox provides the highest protection for your portable devices . A very high quality product.I highly recommend this to friends and family .	1
I know there are many OtterBox lovers out there and I 'm not in the majority by any means . But I recently got a Samsung Galaxy S4 and the phone is large to begin with . But considering that I can be rough on my phones , it was important for me to find a case that kept my investment safe . OtterBox seemed to have it all : a case , screen protector and belt clip all in one.For the price , this is a great buy . But it added so much bulk to my phone . It was uncomfortable for me . The case I now have adds an eighth of an inch on all sides . The OtterBox adds a quarter inch to each side , half an inch per longer and half an inch wider . That is a lot when you are already working with a wide phone . The screen protector shows a ton of fingerprints and smears as well.The case is nicely made and it is certainly strong while protecting a phone . I just ca n't handle the extra bulk and the difficulty in getting it in and out of a purse or pocket .	1
This phone case just works against all the punishment teens give it . It looks brand new after hours in a pants pocket and under a pillow . The cat stepping on it . The phone looks and has no damage .	1
While this is n't waterproof , it would help prevent a lot of damage from everything else . I 've fumbled the phone and dropped it on concrete from several feet and it did n't even scratch the rubber surface . The camera lens and flash are recessed enough to be fully protected and the screen protector does a great job.The belt holster works well and keeps it on my hip . It even works with my ZeroLemon 3000mAh battery which bulges the factory back ever so slightly . There is enough foam and give that it does n't even really notice.Two things to note , low profile right angle head phones may not seat completely but the factory straight ones work fine . The other is the sleep/wake button and the volume buttons tend to be a lot stiffer to press now.Installation and removal is quite simple and easy to perform.Overall , I ca n't complain and would recommend it to a friend .	1
This is the third Otterbox I have bought . They are always consistently well built and protect better than any other case , The one for the S4 is much thinner than the ones for my S2 Skyrocket or iPhone 4S . I like the more compact design . It is a little bit smoother than the others , but not so that it slips out of your hand . A great product - and at Amazon 's pricing , it 's no-brainer . Get it !	1
Had many cases for many phones and currently am rocking a galaxy s4 . For day to day travels i keep it in a spigen hard backed case with an open front . When i know i may need ultimate protection , i pull out the otterbox . I 've had the defender for several phones and it can really take a beating and protect your phone . I even tried one of those lifepr # # f cases and it was a piece of junk . Otterbox all the way .	1
OtterBox is always a good product no matter how you look at it . It fits and looks good . Plus I 'll the extra protection for my phone .	1
This is a great product . I 've had it for a few months and have dropped my phone from many different angles several times , and my phone is still in good shape . It does as expected , easy to install .	1
Received very earlier than promised ! Great product for Galaxy S4 . Gives phone great protection ! Highly recommend for excellent phone protection .	1
This does make an already large phone a bit larger for my pocket , but its worth it ! Great protection for a great price .	1
I am hard on phones . This thing is great . It has taken a real beating and my phone is fine . The only thing that keeps it from being 5 star is the glass protector is n't replacable and it is scratched and scarred up now . I guess I got ta buy a whole new otterbox .	1
I really like this case because of it 's tough skin and protective body . By me being a contractor and working around so much dust and water plus high places this is the case for me .	1
The case is great & when I occasionally use the holster for work it 's kept the phone in place , even when I had to sprint several feet . The ONLY issue I have with the pink color is that some darker colors ( dark or black jeans ) tend to rub off on it & it can be a bit challenging to get that off the case . Otherwise this case is solid & the plastic over the screen does n't bother me a bit ( I was n't sure about that at the beginning ) . Considering 3 others on my family plan have these cases & we all like them a lot speaks volumes . I was always a fan of Seidio cases & still am but this case is heavy duty without adding a ton of bulk or weight . And of course , Amazon has the very best price I could find .	1
This is the best case you can buy , in my opinion . I like the different color choices that you can not get at your phone store not to mention the $ 50 price tag . Great price , colors , and protection . I do n't know why all the phone cases do n't have a built in screen protector but then it would n't be an Otterbox LOL !	1
Its not water proof but it will protect your phone from the occassional drop . It looks good and I often get compliments on it .	1
Best case I 've ever owned . . . This case had a plastic front shield that totally encases my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone . The front plastic is clear , so it acts as a built in screen protector , which is great ! I no longer have to purchase nor apply those annoying but necessary screen protectors ! There is also a rubber piece which covers the back of the case to protect the camera , and fits all around the outside edge of the phone case . I 've actually seen the case bounce when it hits the ground , Finally the whole case and rubber protector snaps into a belt mount case that clips to a build for easy carrying . The case protects the phone and can be clipped to a belt , pocket or waistband , to carry around with ease , Very reasonably priced for this quality product . As a result of this experience , in the future outter box will be the first brand I consider for protective cases .	1
Pros : - Makes phone rather hard to kill- I find it much easier to hold with the case than withoutCons : - No protective film for rear camera- Buttons are hard to press- Ports are hard to accessI have been using OtterBox Defenders for years , and I love them . These cases make phones nearly indestructible , which is quite nice . This case has a new rubber on it that I have not had on an OtterBox before . It is harder that the previous outer coating . It seems like it will last longer and be more durable , but at the same time not absorb shocks as well , make the phone more slippery , and make the ports and buttons harder to get to.Overall , I would not have a phone without a case like this . I highly recommend this case .	1
There are all ready quite a few positive reviews of this case and they have covered everything good about this case . My review wont add anything new to say about the case but will go more of an affirmation of the other reviews.If protecting your phone is a priority buy this case ; . If you want to keep the small size of the GS4 this is n't the case you want . If you constantly seem to find yourself dropping your phone or putting in potentially damaging situations this is the case you want . This case has n't given me any issues with the screen responding to touch or any problems with the buttons ( volume and power are covered ) , The belt clip is surprisingly useful . It can be clipped to the back or the front over the screen to provide even more protection . It does cover the camera when its on the back . I have no problem hearing the ringer or notifications with the belt clip on . Usually I put the phone in a pocket then use the clip to make sure it does n't fall out.So nothing new in this review but if you want the highest level of protection get this case ... it is n't the cheapest but its worth it !	1
This is not my first phone with an Otter Box case . It is an awesome case for my S4 . I love it !	1
This case is great ! Durable , protective and easy to use . Once you get the hang of the disassembly , it is a snap to exchange memory cards or any other task that requires phone access . Adds a little bulk to the phone but not having to worry about dropping the phone or other physical abuse , it 's well worth it ! And Otterbox technical support is very responsive if you need any help . Highly recommended .	1
The case itself is as advertised and I find none of the issues others cite except maybe a slight diminishing of sound on phone calls when using speaker function . Otherwise , it is awesome and the price I got it for was 60 % less than Best Buy or Verizon .	1
6/10/14 update : Still going strong folks . This is the best case I ever got ... .and I do n't even care that the price has dropped to $ 26 . It was worth every penny then , and an even better bargain now . I should also note that the plastic screen protector is still great ... .and that 's with two kids who love to jump on me constantly . I have n't found anything better for my S4 . I think enough of this that after a year I am updating it . Good job , Otterbox ! : ) Price update June 14 : Saw it drop to 31 and change , then back up.Update 6/11/13 : Just an FYI folks , this is currently at 34.82 and free shipping ! This is a no brainer , and a steal . None of the stores around me are giving any kind of discount ... .if they have it.I still love this case , but I did want to let you know that if you rely on the vibration to notify you , you might miss some calls . This does soften the vibration quite a bit . If you are holding it , it 's not a problem , but sometimes , when it is on my belt with a shirt tucked in , and I am walking , I do not feel the vibration . There is no problem if I am still . I also think that this is in part due to the phone . The vibrate strength , even on full , is not as strong as my old phone , so the extra cushion from the case just softens it up even more ... .but you know what , this weekend I have seen three people with this phone and Belkin cases and they all had cracked glass ! After getting a Belkin case for my S4 , it took me only an hour to go out and buy theOtterbox 77-27434 Defender Series and Holster Case for Samsung Galaxy S 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black . The difference is night and day and while this is more than twice the price of the Belkin it is totally worth it ! Plus , you do n't need to spend money on a screen protector , so it really is n't that much more.The Defender is really a three piece , full coverage , case . It provides full coverage for your S4 , corners , back , front , screen and it has flip covers for the charger connection , etc. , and those flips flip up easily , even without fingernails . The case itself provides excellent grip all around without being intrusive . It is a little difficult pressing the buttons on the face , but my fingers are a little big . One of my FAVORITE things is the screen protector ... .NO bubbles ! Yup , you heard me right , no bubbles . That 's because you do n't actually have to `` apply '' the protector to the screen . This is awesome . If you look at every screen protector I have reviewed for my iPhones and iPads , they all had bubbles ... .I have come to hate bubbles , and thought I would have to learn to live with them . I am here to tell you , I am now bubble free ( and so is my wife ) ! ! ! When pressing the side buttons you do have to press a little hard , but for the protection you get , it 's fine . Also , the openings for the camera are angled so that the thick case does not appear in the pictures . The case itself is micro-textured to provide good grip without feeling rough.There is NO interference at all with using the IR when reading and scrolling down by nodding my head or turning a page with a wave of my hand . Sharing pictures and video work equally as well with no perceptible interference . The only real issue is that I did notice a slight difference in wi-fi reception in our house with the case on . It is slightly weaker , but nothing big , and after one day I do n't even think about it . The entire screen isvisible and nothing is blocked.The only thing that I would knock half a star for is the clip is uncomfortable and digs into my skin when it 's on my belt , and is especially bad when my shirt is not tucked in . They could have made this better , and I wonder ifI will come and downgrade this to 4 stars later because of this . For now , I will say 4.5 stars with an easy round-up to 5.Instructions when installing your phone : CAREFULLY remove the rubber gasket , using your fingernails . There are little spaces along the sides . You need to use these to seperate it or you risk breaking it . Once that is done , the rest is easy . Try not to touch the inner portion of the screen as it comes perfectly clean ( at least it did on both of ours ) . Putting everything together after this pointis easy and takes less than 30 seconds . Gently click everything together and you are ready to go.We both love this case and I highly recommend it .	1
What else can be said about otterbox other than if u value ya phone dnt hesitate to buy one protection is top shelf	1
I dropped my new phone on cement parking lot with this case . no issues no scratches the phone is in perfect condition it also has the protective covering over the screen built in the case . rotating clip Very ice love for sure .	1
The case is great , it does bulk your phone up quite a bit , but it adds a lot more protection to the device . I really love the built in screen protector layer , no more having to deal with those . The holster feature is nice as well .	1
I love this case . It has a plastic cover that is built in to the case.The case is not big and bulky . My hands are very small and I can holdit with little issue .	1
****I 'm not sure this surprisingly complicated device has ever been explained adequately in the 2,397 reviews that have preceded mine , so I 'll take a shot at it.When disassembled as far as you 're supposed to go it consists of four pieces . You need to disassemble it in order to insert your phone , then reassemble it.1 . HolsterStart by removing the piece with the spring-loaded clip , called the holster , by pressing on the big tab on one side.The holster is designed to carry the case proper . You can insert the phone into the holster so the screen faces out for ready use or in for better protection of the screen . For example , you might want the screen facing in if the mine shaft you 're at the bottom of is about to cave in and there would be lots of coal dust floating around . On the other hand , if you 're expecting a call from Barack Obama in the next few minutes , as I always am , you 'd want the screen facing out so you could just flip the phone a little towards your face and know whether it 's he . Or is that He ? You attach the holster to your belt or your waistband or your tool belt or your love handles using the clip , which then does n't want to let go , which is good for your phone 's health but which also means sometimes it wo n't let go when you want it to , which problem you can sometimes solve by pushing down a little as you open the clip.Unlike the other three pieces , the holster is optional . For example , if you 're about to engage in a bout of sumo wrestling you might want to ditch the holster altogether and just tuck the phone in its case into your mawashi.The holster adds considerable bulk and a tiny bit of weight ( 58 grams ) , but there are three benefits to the holster even if you never clip it to your suspenders or your right eyebrow region when you 're drunk to see whether you can simulate Google Glass . ( Answer : No . ) -- Kickstand . The holster also acts as a kickstand so you can set your phone on a table in landscape orientation and watch a movie or something . To deploy the kickstand , rotate the clip so the top of it , the part nearer the & # 34 ; r & # 34 ; of & # 34 ; Otter , & # 34 ; not the & # 34 ; O , & # 34 ; is resting just above the big tab you used in the step above . You may rotate the clip 180 degrees and your SG4 's display will re-orient itself , but the whole device then teeters a little bit after you set it down and is not really designed to be used this way. -- Grabbing point . The holster 's clip when aligned in the non-kickstand orientation also makes it especially easy to hold the phone . In your left hand you place your thumb along the left edge of the phone in the usual manner but you can wrap the pads of your other fingers around the far ( right ) side of the clip instead of having to reach all the way around the back to the much thinner right side of the phone , which also risks that you will click a live spot on the screen. -- Shock-resistance . Although I 'm no engineer , my guess is that the holster adds protection against damage to your phone if it 's dropped onto a hard enough surface from high enough up.2 . Rubber shellOnce you 've removed the holster you need to remove the rubber-like shell that will surround the back of your phone and wrap around the edges to barely encroach on the phone 's screen . This is a precisely engineed piece of neoprene or whatever it is that because of its elasticity provides most of the resistance against impact damage.To remove it , start by opening the two very sturdy port covers -- one at the top and one at the bottom -- so they do n't impede your progress or tear in case you get too rough . Then choose a corner and pry away at it till you see how the rubber shell is attached . If you 've chosen the upper left corner , use the pad of your left thumb to push the very outside corner away from you , towards the back of the case . Eventually you will see how the rubber shell can be pushed away a little bit from the hard plastic clamshell it encases . Once you 've broken a corner loose you can open up more and more of the rubber shell along the top . Then you can push the rubber shell away from the top right corner , and then the next corner along , and pretty soon it 's loose.Although the manufacturer does n't says so anywhere , this precisely engineered shell is gluten-free and contains no trans-fats.3 and 4 . Two clamshell piecesThe two mating , hard plastic pieces of the clamshell are what most interiorally enclose your phone . The front and the back pieces are connected by tabs on the back that fit into slots on the front . There is one at the top , there are two equally spaced on each side , and there are two at the bottom , for a total of seven.To disassemble the clamshell , press on the back piece where a tab is so it no longer lives in its slot on the front piece . You 're going to gradually separate the pieces , and you have to start with any tab or pair of adjacent tabs that works . Just keep pressing on one tab or another and trying to separate the pieces till they come loose at that point . Once you 've separated that tab and its slot , use your fingers to make sure that little gap does n't close and move along to the next tab , then push it in and separate it from its slot . This is kind of fiddly , but you can do it . After a few of these separations of the tabs and their slots , pretty soon the two clamshell pieces will come apart . ****Whew.Now , here 's how to re-assemble the whole thing with your phone inside , which is why you spent so much money for this product . Lay your phone carefully into the back piece ( mine is labelled & # 34 ; MADE IN MEXICO & # 34 ; for those who care , although I do n't know why you would ) of the clamshell and then press the top piece of the clamshell onto it , making sure to engage all seven tabs you just so laboriously disengaged . Unlike some of the steps of disassembly and the next step , this part of assembly is easy.Re-attach the rubber shell . Shove a corner of the encased phone into a corner of the rubber shell , then start fitting and smoothing with your fingers in one direction and the other . Eventually you 'll get the clamshell entirely inside the rubber shell . Check every millimeter of all four edges around the screen to make sure there are no gaps . If there are , just push the rubber against the plastic till it behaves . If it does n't , I recommend beating severely on the plastic with a 5-pound sledge hammer till . . . fff Wait , no I don & # 8217 ; t. Re-write this.You 're done . You 've disassembled the OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black , you 've inserted your phone , and you 've reassembled the whole thing . Attach the case to the holster if you want and you 're ready to go . ****If you bought this product without having read this very review on Amazon , would you be able to perform these necessary steps based solely on the instructions included with the product ? The answer is an indisputable No unless you have as much free time and patience as I have . For this I subtract one star .	1
I dropped several times and it definitely has protected Samsung Galaxy IV , would recommend to others , very sturdy and reliable	1
I ordered this for my boyfriend who started a manual labor job and did n't want to drop and break his phone ( again ) . After using this for a few weeks , he has dropped his phone multiple times ( including into water ) and the phone is perfectly fine . The only complaint is the clip makes the phone bulky but it is n't a big deal , he just puts it in his pocket . Overall , great case and it protects the phone so much more than a regular back-only plastic case that you usually see .	1
I 'm sure this is a great product . It seemed well made . I did return it but only because I returned the phone it was designed to protect . I 've had otterbox products in the past on prior phones & they were well worth their slightly higher upfront cost . I wish they made one for the phone I now have !	1
If you are worried about your screen cracking when you drop ur phone , this case is for you . I was very impressed with the design of this case . Normally the defender is huge and bulky but this is not much bigger than my commuter case although it 's bigger than most . The screen and edges ( and every thing else ) are very well protected from falls and normal use . My only issue is the sticky rubber case that is not good for quick draw from the pockets . A great case overall .	1
I got this for my new s4 and it has worked nicely . A little bulky yes but other than that it is fine . Almost 2 months of use and it does not show any signs of wear or tear .	1
The only drawback is that the space between the protective screen plastic and the screen is prone to collecting dust . Removing the rubber outer area and taking the hard plastic shell apart to clean it every few weeks will eventually cause the system to fail . The rubber is already not fitting as snugly . But I like it and I will keep it because it does its job well .	1
I have had this one for about 6 months and it is working well . The belt clip has n't broken and still works .	1
So this is my first & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; case for my Samsung S4 and I 'm very satisfied with it . At first it was kind of hard to install it because the snap-on was very tight but after a while a got it open and it was smooth sailing from then on . The thing fits like a glove and even though I still have n't dropped my phone yet I 'm sure it will hold up well.It came with a holster ( which looks tough also ) but I never use those.Great product .	1
I hesitated on this item because of the screen protector . It works fine and no loss of ability in using the touch screen . The side keys ( such as volume ) need to be pushed a little harder . From time to time I do get the oily spots under the screen protector . Someone posted on youtube is a video to fix this by using baby powder . Overall it offers good protection to the phone case and screen . Have n't dropped the phone so I ca n't comment on shock absorption . I would recommend	1
Great case for the galaxy 4 , would buy again but it so durable , i doubt i would need to buy another one	1
Okay so you can read all the reviews and they all say the same thing ... great case , great protection ( second to none ) , fits is dead on , ca n't get a better case ... etc..I wanted to point out some basic things and then let you the reader who is currently in the buying mood for your new expensive smartphone ... here goes.1 ) All the happy loyal customers say one thing more than anything else , it 's a great case for protection . Do n't read this , buy the case and then write a crappy review that says , & # 34 ; love the case but it makes my phone too BIG ! & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; love the protection but my smartphone no longer fits into my skinny jeans ... & # 34 ; you get the point . This case is about PROTECTION . You simply ca n't get a better fitting case for PROTECTION.2 ) You just invested in a $ 700 or more smartphone/tablet/device that can do anything and more than most desktops found in many homes across the planet . Why would you not invest a few bucks into PROTECTING your investment ? It takes one simple drop to chip the sides or paint not to mention that the front case could crack . Yes , there are plans now that allow you to replace your phone , but why go through the hassle of starting new again.3 ) Yes , the plastic screen protection that comes with it is not that great , but if you have owned an Otterbox before you know the deal . Peel that one off , invest in a real screen protection film or better yet , get a Tempered Glass Protection screen.4 ) And as everyone who has owned an Otterbox before knows , the hard clip case is either useless and you never really carry it or you are someone who carries their phone on your hip all the time . I myself , do not.5 ) The rubber grip is just enough to be able to shove the phone in your back pocket without too much trouble and yet it has enough grip that it does n't jump out of your hand while using it one handed.All in all , an excellent case . You just bought yourself a pretty expensive piece of technology , protect it and forget about the fact that it does n't have cute little bunnies on it or it is n't olive or baby blue .	1
The cost of the deductible if I break my S4 is $ 250 the cost of this otterbox is $ 30I 've dropped my phone several times on concrete and 4x in the toilet ( do n't text and pee ) .I 've not dropped $ 250 on a deductible to replace the phoneDoes n't that just say it all ?	1
Got this for my Wife 's new phone , This is the same great quality I have come to expect from Otterbox and I am not disappointed ! Highly recommend if they make one for your model of phone .	1
This case is AWESOME for the Samsung Galaxy 4s , it 's slim and has tiny grooves on the backside for a comfortable non-slip grip.This case consists of three parts : ( First ) Rear hard-shell that snaps tightly into ( second ) the front hard shell , which includes the built-in clear screen ( so no need to buy those annoying screen protectors ! ) And finally , a tough rubbery outer shell that hugs around the back of the phone . I used to have an HTC Evo , and this case is FAR better in quality . The rubber to this phone is n't the kind that will stretch out over time like my old otterbox did on the Evo I had.I got the purple one with light teal border around the screen and its slightly a darker shade of purple than seen on my computer screen , but I actually like it better in person ! The purple part is rubber and the teal is part of the plastic shell . The side buttons are a little hard to press , but in the grand scheme of things that should be a good thing because it 's more proof that my little phone is safely snuggled inside.Best of all : Otterbox backs these with a 1-year guarantee ... so if you break it , lose parts or whatever , they will replace it for free ! Just google their 800 # . I did this for my old otterbox and they sent me a new one right away.Definitely worth the money . You wont have to re-purchase more phone protectors after this one . SO in the end , you actually save yourself money and the headache of dealing with cheap cases.I LOVE THIS CASE ! May update in a few months if requested : )	1
These cases are awesome and work so well with protecting your phone . Purchased this for my husband because his old one was way too lose for his phone and needed a new one badly .	1
Simply put OtterBox Defender system is pretty much the best protection you can get for your phone . For protection against splashes , spills , drops and falls nothing really compares . You have easy access to all the ports , camera and flash while still getting tons of protection . The screen is also covered by a very strong yet sensitive to touch polycarbonate covering . In fact the only thing I did n't like was screen protector as it was just slightly raised form my phone screen so it gave touching the screen a popping sensation . Other than that it is great . If you have any questions , please feel free to leave a comment below and I will try to answer it .	1
Great coverage , just a bit bulky . Keeping it as a backup for now until my Bolkin case breaks . My bolin has a kickstand which is great when watching shows on your phone .	1
I like how otterbox improved it 's design from the s3 to s4 . The silicone feels higher quality and more solid .	1
We had already bought an Otterbox case at the AT & T store with the phone in December . The salesman sold us on it being the best for the money . The problem was that they only had black or blue colors . We got blue . There are many more colors available on Amazon which is why I got this one . My wife wanted the violet color case . My wife needed a new phone because she had droped her iPhone 4S and the front glass broke . This time I bought insurance for phone replacement too . After reading all the online reviews I 'm conviced we made the right choice of cases .	1
Loved the case ! Product came in time , and it looks amazing ! Only complaintwould be the built in screen protector that comes with the case , but obviously itsthe defender series . The screen works well with the actual touch screen , unlike most screen protectors . All in all a great buy !	1
I was a little reluctant to spend the kind of money on & # 34 ; a stupid cell phone case & # 34 ; as this seems to command , but two things had me go for it : ( 1 ) my sweetie wanted the one with the trees on the back plus the holster , and ( 2 ) Amazon had the best price . And it was still a & # 34 ; stupid cell phone case & # 34 ; . So I got two - the one with the trees and the hornet one for me.Just got these yesterday and I am changing my assessment to & # 34 ; amazingly well engineered cell phone case & # 34 ; . Few aftermarket things fit a product as well as this does , and it is both functional and beautiful.I was really reluctant to have a case that impeded sliding into my pocket because of it 's sticky material ( silicone rubbers , etc . ) and this case does NOT suffer from that problem . Yes , it makes the phone marginally larger , but it slides right into my pocket without resistance . Very helpful for when it rings in your pocket while you are driving - slips out easily.All in all , very worth the cost ; everything fits so precisely . You can tell that they spent a LOT of time in design and craftsmanship ; truly a no-nonsense provider that makes really incredible stuff . What a refreshing situation .	1
This is the third one I buy for my galaxy 4s phone , like to change them around and really great item to have .	1
It 's worth the investment to protect your $ 600 phone . I 've dropped my phone from about 4 feet and no issues . I 've dropped things on my screen , but the case 's screen protector took the damage . When I take my phone out , it 's still in great condition . If moisture gets near the menu button , you can get rainbows under your screen protector . Easy fix is to take the phone out and clean it up . I 'd definitely purchase again .	1
I 'm the type of person who 's sometime afraid to just take something apart by unsnapping it without directions . This is one of those products . There is/are no directions for putting the phone inside the case . You 're just supposed to instinctively know to just man handle it until you get it open . Hope you do n't break the plastic part . I elected to replace the snap in back part with the clip with the BLack Leather Belt Holster Pouch Clip , B00D6NRRD6 . Turns out it was the right decision for me . Especially considering the phone comes off the holster with a flick of the wrist . No real warm and fuzzy feeling with the holster . More protection with the pouch with a belt loop as opposed to a belt clip . Not going anywhere ! Only real issue with this product are the two side buttons . They have to be pressed especially hard to engage but it also prevents accidents .	1
My husband is pretty hard on his phones . He works in construction so he needs heavy duty protection and we can always count on Otterbox .	1
Case works great ! I bought a GS4 at full retail for my wife so we could keep our grandfathered unlimited data . Since it was a full-retail device I needed nothing less than full protection . Perfect solution ! My kids can drop this phone while they play their Angry Birds all they want and I do n't freak out . It can be thrown into my wife 's bottomless pocketbook without concern of getting damaged by whatever it is that attacks my hand whenever I need to search for her car keys.The included screen protector is connected to the hard plastic shell and there is a slight oily haze between the device and the protector . I expected this and purchased a Zagg screen . Have n't installed it yet , but when I do I will remove the included OtterBox screen protector and just use the Zagg protector.I tested out mySamsung Wireless Charging Coverwith this Defender case and can report that it DOES NOT fit . Do n't use this Defender case unless it 's the OEM GS4 battery cover.The purple color is true to the pictures . Looks good with the black mist GS4.I like that this cover provides a good grip to the phone . The stock GS4 is very slippery.This Defender case works fine with mySamsung Galaxy Universal Car Mount . It grips the case well with a slight squeeze of the side clamps .	1
I 'd tried another heavy duty case and the Otterbox is definitely the best . I mountain bike and like to have my phone with me to track my rides and as a GPS mapper , so I need something heavy duty . It 's construction is solid and sound and it attaches and removes easily from the phone . Much better than any other heavy duty case I 've tried . I ordered mine in royal blue and it 's paid off - recently I finished a ride , went to turn the ride tracking app off , and my phone was n't in the holster ( that 's the only thing - you have to make sure the phone snaps securely in to the holster ! ) . Thankfully , I had n't ridden too far since I 'd last had it out . I backtracked , and found it sitting on the trail with no harm done other than being a little dirty . Other than that , I have n't had any real occasion to evaluate how well it protects - and hope to avoid that ! But I 'm as confident in it as I can be in any phone case of this type . Definitely recommended .	1
We bought this for a family member who breaks everything , installation was a breeze . Comes with a hard plastic inner cover which has a softer outer shell which snaps over the hard one . An included screen protector does not cause problems of slow input . The included clip is large and allows to clip the phone to your belt however it does not swivel . Good quality construction , excellent drop protection . All ports have access . Negative is the case increases the size of the already large phone	1
With the otter box defender and clip , I feel totally confident that my new smartphone will be protected from drops . I have already dropped it 3 times and nothing bad happened to the phone . It is a little bulky but I love it .	1
Otterbox is the greatest I have knocked my phone off the table at work and thanks to my otterbox case my phone was unharmed .	1
I have bought numerous holsters from this manufacturer and as always it works perfectly never a problem built well and as always at a great price here on AMAZON ! ! Keep up the good work Amazon and OtterBox ! ! !	1
This case , while not completely water proof is close . As I get older my sense of touch has diminished somewhat . I had the Spigen slim armor case and I loved it but this suits my physical needs much better . It does add bulk to the phone but for me that is a plus . Every access point is sealable so if you are out in the rain and need your phone it is much less likely to get water damage .	1
This is the best case I have ever owne ! I am very hard on phones , but even harder on cases . Just the fact that I have it and it still works and looks good to is a tribute to Otterbox . Do n't think twice .	1
It was either this or Body Glove . Well worth the money . I broke the screen on my first S4 , so I really wanted to protect this one . Basically a case inside a case . Does n't make it too much bigger . Access ports work well .	1
Bought for my daughter who is all thumbs . Every phone she has had she 's broken the screen from dropping g it . She absolutely loves this case , especially with two little kids in tow	1
Accidentally flung my expensive phone and only the outside screen cover of this case was very slightly scratched.Two Complaints : ( 1 ) Not very water resistant and Does not cover camera lens . ( Otterbox Armor does but , for some reason , it 's not available for the S4 . ) and ( 2 ) Maybe it was the charger I was using , but this case is so thick I had to get an extension cord for it to reach to the phone .	1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++January 2014 update : While this is a good product , I think it was built for those the do NOT change batteries . If you put it together , and do n't take it apart to change batteries , then it will last a life time . But , and a huge but , if you change batteries , as I do , then the little clips that hold the case together , will start to break and render the case useless . That is if you do n't use the rubber outer protector . This will keep the inner case together.Bottom line is I will order another one as the price has dropped.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I guess I should read descriptions more , because I did n't realize this comes with a screen protector too . Well made and about 15 bucks cheaper than buying it locally from my provider.This is an awesome protector for any phone , and the plastic screen saver does n't seem to hamper the works of the original touch screen at all . Cleaning is easy , just wipe it without worry about messing up the screen of the phone . The belt clip takes some getting used to , but after about two days use , I have figured out the best way to wear it with my daily activities , ( the clip swivels so you can rotate it 360 degrees.At first , it was aggravating with the very tight fit of the case and holster , because the first time I tried to change the battery , it actually took some negotiation and patience to get everything back off . Yes , it 's that much of an exact fit . But , as the saying goes , `` practice makes better '' so have I become with changing batteries and thus , it 's not that much of a hassle anymore.I do n't like the fact that the only way you can clip it to a belt if via a `` pin '' contraption , instead of both , the clip and a `` loop '' , gives this a thumbs down . I prefer a `` Loop '' while at work and also out in public as it makes it really difficult to accidently become unattached with the phone or to have it `` lifted '' from you by a thief.The main reason I am so adamant about a `` loop '' over a clip is that it is easier than most will admit to dislodge a clip from your belt and you will not even know it until it 's too late and you have totally lost your phone . Once , while getting out of my vehicle to pump some gas , I accidently dislodged my phone from my belt and my phone fell to the pavement while I was pumping gas ... After returning from paying for it , I just happened to look down and low and behold , there laid my phone right under the door of my vehicle . If I had been I a hurry or was n't so attentive , I would have drove off and thus , been out of a phone and would have had to pay full price for a replacement , not to mention what the increased bill could have been if someone had found it and decided to dial 900 numbers on my account .	1
this was a 50 $ case in the stores and i got it for 26 $ brand new untouched otterbox defender came in all its original packaging i 'm super happy with it do not hessitate to buy half price of the stores you cant beat that .	1
Fits Samsung Galaxy S-4 like a glove . My phone has survived several drops from waist high to concrete with no ill effects or marks on the phone . I looked at several protective cases others were using before ordering , and bought the Otter Box because it looked like the best protection for a non-waterproof phone protector . I have been very pleased .	1
I had the Ballistic case for the Epic 4g Galaxy S2 . I thought that was a great case and that it had great protection for my phone . But it was bulky , and it did n't have a belt clip.This OtterBox case is by far a better case . Not just because it has the belt clip and it is providing wonderful protection but it has a built in screen protector . Awesome ! ! !	1
When I first received this case , my first impression was how durable this case is . In my experience with this case , it has been very durable . I also like the fact that it comes with a holster for a belt as well . Now I am going too critique this case quite a bit . First of all , it is big and bulky , but durable . It also has 3 parts around the phone that snap together , If you need too get your phone out , it can be a bit tricky too get the case apart . It also has a built in screen protector , I 'm going too be honest , I do not like it at all and actually ended up taking the screen protector out . In my experience , Dust kept collecting under neath the screen protector , causing me too have too take the case apart every couple of days too clean the screen . A big pain in the rear , so I just decided too pop the screen Protector out.My final Conclusion , to sum it up . A bit bulky , but very durable .	1
You simply can not fail with OtterBox . This Defender Series is exactly what I 've come to expect from OtterBox products , and I 've never been disappointed with the way they do things . Well done , I highly recommend this case . I do n't typically use holsters , but maybe I should . If you 're not prone to using holsters , and you want to save a few bucks , look for a case without one .	1
Easy to take off and put on , VERY durable ( which means it takes a slim S4 and makes it twice as thick and heavy ) , and snaps securely into a clip that can set up to watch videos or use the S4 ( as I do ) as a night table alarm clock ( Android OS has a clock directory , unlike Windows , so that multiple clock aps can know about each other and work in harmony ) . Alas , the clip is the weak link but a new one can be had in 3 days for $ 6 ( OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black ) . That is it widely accepted as the best S4 case can be seen by it being the # 1 seller of all cases at Amazon .	1
Seriously this is an awesome case . I 've only used it now for less than a week but it is sturdy and the belt clip is perfect . I know I am going to drop my phone and I really think this will protect it when I do .	1
The case fits the S4 snugly , and the plastic screen covering seems more or less on par with other covers.The three layers used to cushion the device are of good quality , and the Otterbox Defender for my other phone has saved my bacon ( almost 4 ' drop onto concrete . ) The holster , however , is iffy - the S4 phone plipped out of it once while I was driving -- had the holster been able to swivel , that incident may not have happened.It 's still a good case , just be aware of its strengths and weaknesses . Only the holster is iffy , but it 's not a total fail ( when walking it 's been solid . )	1
Bought this as a gift for my dad 's new phone he works in construction and has been known to screw up even the most rugged phones he loves the phone and loves the case it 's been on for months and looks great most importantly the phone is still in working conditions !	1
I love the protection this OtterBox provides . Great all over cover and screen protector . I bought the OtterBox defender series for my daughter 's IPHONE .	1
Very happy with the case . Protects the phone well , the only thing is that if I want to replace the battery , I have to remove that case which can be a pain . The case is four pieces with the holster , so you have to be in a spot where you can do it and not drop the pieces of the case . But well worth the trouble of taking it apart and putting it back together . The only problem I had was I had to return the first one because the clip on the holster when I knocked into the wall . the second one has been fine . Oh , and there were some comments about the phone not locking into the holster securely , as well it not locking in with the screen facing outward , which is necessary if you want to use the stand feature of the holster . I have NO problem doing either of these . Simple trick is to be careful , listen for the click of it locking in and give it a tug to make sure . Good case .	1
Very solid , great fit . Good looks . Easy to grip . Makes the phone much larger , and twice as heavy , but that is an obvious trade-off for this kind of protection.Buttons however are more difficult to push . Hopefully they will loosen up . That is why I dropped it down a star .	1
I lvoe the otter box covers and never would purchase one because they are so expensive . I was able to get this one for my husband at a reasonable cost . He does manual labor work and I wanted his phone to b e protected . This will help preserve his phone .	1
Love this case , nothing matches up to otter boxes . I wish the back pink real tree print was a bit more like the one for the iPhone though . The iPhone is more like a print on the actual case while this one feels more like a sticker attached . I 'm worried about cleaning it , I 'm afraid I might mess up the case . Other than that love it !	1
Same case as Wal-Mart & Target , but half the price . Amazon rocks for phone accessories , as the tend to have a far better selection than trying to drive all over looking for a particular model .	1
Starting with the beautiful design and ending with the great protection that OtterBox provides , this case has it all . It might be a little expensive but I saw it in other store and the price was for US $ 10 more than what I paid so that 's not a valid complain . I trust in this brand blindly because it has proven to protect the cellphone at all cost , if I could give it 6 out of 5 I would .	1
I bought it for looks and seal but got feather light comfort hold . I just wish there was more os a seal to the front so particles of lint and ? ? ? dust n stuff wer n't able to get between the front cover and the glass . It 's really annoying	1
A friend was looking for this and I got it for them as a gift for their wife . She was thrilled !	1
Love the look and feel of this . Wasnt sure if it was going to make my phone look bigger and ulky . Not at all ! ! Fits great and highly recommend this item . Went on very easily..	1
This is a cool look ! It protects the phone great and I like that it has a clip for my belt .	1
See my other Otterbox review . The only difference between that and this is that this is my sweetie 's case and she wanted the cool trees on the back . Otherwise , we both love these cases !	1
My daughter loves camo and needed a case for her S4 . We got this . It 's exactly what you would expect from Otter Box and has not chipped as some of the other OB 's have in the past . We have had multiple OB 's and only one had this problem , and it still protected my phone just fine . Anyway this one has been perfect so far ! !	1
Wanted a better case for my new phone and walmart didnt have them . Perfect fit , and I love the case . Super sturdy . Love it	1
I really like this case . It is made well and seems to be something that will old up if I ever drop my phone . I love the colors .	1
Awsone case ... love otterbox wish they would come out with bright neon color cases for females but great case , protects awsome ive dropped my s4 many times this cases protected it . Even bought my son and boyfriend otterbox..price is much better than in store..i highly recomend it .	1
I had been told to get an OtterBox case by a few friends but thought it would n't really make a difference . Then I got my new phone and wanted a better case than the one I had originally gotten for it . I use my phone all the time in my classroom for the timer and it takes a beating . I was putting up in the attic the other day and had stuck my phone in my pocket and forgot about it . Next thing I know I 'm up on a ladder and I hear it tumble to the floor 12 feet below . I picked it up and there was n't even a scratch on it . I love that it 's completely enclosed with covers on the ports to keep bits of dirt that find their way into my bag from getting into them and prevents moisture from getting in them as well . The screen is crystal clear , as good as the screen cover film . I would n't even know there was a cover over it if I had n't put it on there myself . Best investment for my phone I 've ever made . I 'm looking to buy one for my IPad now too . I wish they made one that fit my car because I use that less and it 's got a bunch of nicks and dings on it .	1
Fits great . Only had it for about 24 hours , but love it so far .	1
This is great . I need the protection of the Otterbox , but like to be able to quickly get the phone out of the case to dock it o r to change cases to add a telephoto lens . This case provided Otterbox protection , as well as quick access to the phone itself .	1
I absolutely love this clear case . i put a sticker on the back of my phone and you can see it clearly . my only problem is that sometimes the clip does n't always catch and it slides a bit . otherwise great product .	1
I 've wanted an otterbox for ages but they are all very plain . When I came across this I had to have it ! It has a beautiful shimmery effect to the back and is extremely well made . I 've dropped my phone several times and its done its job well . I love the grey color as I 'm not very girly and I have a black phone but the colors are still different enough to be beautiful and eye catching !	1
The size of the case is perfect.Fits in my pocket securely with no slip.Goes in my purse and still easy to find.Does not add a lot of bulk and with a few drops already it has n't splint.Most two piece cases will break apart . Well this one has not ! Otterbox has done it again .	1
This case is not too bulky . I like that it is clear and has rubberized trims . So far it is doing good but , I have not dropped my phone yet . It does n't block any buttons from being accessed .	1
I love this case , it 's slim and protective and not bulky Wish they came in more colors though . fast shipping	1
Pros : - Great working case.- Looks it will protect my phone without adding much bulk . There seems to be some air-gap between phone and cover . Assume this is to protect phone from falls..Screen also seems to be protected , if it may fall on flat surface . It seems that rubber supports will absorb the shock if phone fall down.- All buttons are covered.- Better look than other Otterboxes.- Good opening for earphone and charger.- Transparent to show some beauty of your phone.- Sticks on my dash-board . Such a great convenience if you need it to keep there sometimes , say for GPS use . Deal breaker for me.- Phone does not seem to slip - great benefit of using a case.- Very easy to open or clean.Cons -- Not sure about durability of the case especially the 2 halves . Some times they come apart e.g . once those came apart while taking my phone out from my pocket . I feel those should be more secured . But having other pros , I think you can live with it . I hope those will not come out if phone fells down.- I wish case should be more transparent showing beautiful phone.- I am not confident if rubber on outer side ( especially on controls ) will stay intact or wear out . Hope it stays.Summary : It is a great choice assuming that 2 halves will not get loosen more and rubber on outside will not worn out . I am happy with this purchase but It has been only 2 months since I got this case . Despite all the cons mentioned above , I would recommend this for Galaxy S4.Why I did not get other Otterbox Cases : - I think Defender is too bulky & Commuter is very slippery . I guess Defender may also interfere with some sensors due to its built in screen protector.- You do n't want completely hide your beautiful S4 .	1
after reading some of the reviews , I was a little nervous about this item as I 've never owned a Otterbox case.. Well let me say that some of the reviews were wrong , this is a VERY nice case , it feels great to the touch and it fits perfect ! ! I LOVE it.. and if you have a white GS4 , its a hot look ! I 'm going to see if they have it in another color other than grey.. : o )	1
Broke my last S4 and purchased this Reflex ... looks , feels , protects great ! Thank for the great buy and prompt service .	1
Excellent drop protection for the klutzy amongst us . THe slight lip in the front keeps your screen from hitting the ground even if you manage a face-down drop . The only downside is that the included screen protector is complete crap . It almost immediately ended up nicked and torn and that was just with normal use . But then again you 're not buying this for the screen protector are you ? Otterbox : 5 stars . Screen protector : 3 stars .	1
it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20 % . it is a waste of money .	-1
It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money .	-1
I am disappointed that the 1A did n't work with my iPad . That 's what I get for buying a cheap adapter .	-1
After a week only one side works	-1
Only works one side at a time . When you connect two cables , one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses . I purchased two of them and it 's the same problem . Cheap and bad quality .	-1
Did n't last very long . Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I should n't have expected it to last .	-1
I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time . My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on , it will not charge while powered on .	-1
I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months , it subsequently died on me.Pros : -Has 2 USB ports for charging , one ( the top ) is 2.1 amps . The bottom slot is lower , presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight . I 've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones , except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $ 2.Cons : -It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger . It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends . The two slot design makes this design very handy ; with a 1 slot design , no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord . Of course , after this charger died , I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months , I began to notice the LED light flickering . It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently . I 'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring , bad design , I guess I 'll never know . I thought about getting another since they are so cheap , but then I thought better of it . Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason , it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I have n't found one in my price range yet .	-1
I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging , it felt hot . Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt . Tried the other one too and same thing . Be careful ... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system	-1
I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after , the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots . Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase .	-1
It looked like it was used ! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again	-1
This case for some reason is peeling , there is n't much left of the orginal skin , i loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i would n't recommend this specific one for anyone .	-1
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3 . They really need to start making these chargers better ... .I 've been thru several ! ! ! !	-1
JUNK ! ! ! ... ... This product must be miss labeled . I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger . The lights are on , the phone says its charging but nothing happens . I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge . If you need a reliable charger , DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2 , I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter . It charges fast and is dependable .	-1
The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period . I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it , I 've noticed that it does n't come apart like most vehicle chargers .	-1
WHAT A GREAT PRICE ! RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX , PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ... DO N'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD , OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ... BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT , AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WAS N'T CHARGING . SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER .	-1
Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days . Has n't worked since . My phone does not even recognize it 's plugged in .	-1
This thing worked well when it actually functioned , but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I 'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working , who knows.. What a waste of money .	-1
First , this is kind of cheap-looking , but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone , so that 's forgiveable . The springs on the side do n't have much force , though , so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port . The cable is sturdy , but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff , which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle . It 's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE : Stopped charging after a month .	-1
I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful , however , I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item . I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time .	-1
It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord ... ... ..The charger itself working fine up to this point ... ... ... .Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $ 19.00	-1
I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet . It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone .	-1
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days . I 'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon . When it did work it worked very well .	-1
This charger does n't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 ( i9100 ) properly.When I connect it to my S2 , the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual ( abnormal ) way .	-1
Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the , Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ... .. The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made , and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well ... .I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems ... .I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct ! Ugh !	-1
In a nutshell , this is NOT an OEM charger . Although it has the Samsung markings , it does n't seat well with a Samsung phone . This means that it 's either meant for another market or it 's counterfeit . With that said , I would n't buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17 , 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers . After using this for a while , it is still garbage . It does not charge my phone and in fact , it drains the phone . This must be a counterfeit product . It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! ! ! !	-1
After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it was n't even worth it .	-1
This one came in broken The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece . Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together . If it was not broken I would like it . Also if it was n't in three click in pieces	-1
I never do this , but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear . If you look at all the positive reviews for this case , you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review , other than this one of course , is a verified purchase . What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap . Furthermore , many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product , once per color . Why Amazon allows this is beyond me , but that is not the point . Also , if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers , you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other . Beware the paid shills !	-1
Watch-out , all these positive reviews are fake . Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name . What a sleazy way to sell an item .	-1
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this . it did n't even fit his phone right . poorly made .	-1
I bought this for the at & t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me . I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2 , but the cut outs was NOT good . The cut out opening was too small for the power button , there was also an extra cut out for no reason . It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars , but bad opening for my phone will be costly .	-1
the case did not fit my phone ; was a tad too small . i could only get 3 corners into the case . i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $ 20 from a local store . have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s*** , and no damage to the phone . good reason to buy a case , just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked , and broke the display screen , making his phone unusable . buy a case , not this rubber thing . i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it 's arrival	-1
I read the first few reviews and did n't read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2 . Wish I had known that .	-1
there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what 's carried by Asia . I 'm in USA , I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA , the cover did n't fit , and the speaker location is different from the phone . I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA , do n't buy cover from outside USA	-1
I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews . I do n't know how people are getting these cables to work ... but out of the 3 I bought , 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre ! The best I can do is get it to charge , though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about `` Unknown Device '' and `` Could not install drivers '' even though it works beautifully with the original cable . The only setting that works is `` Just Charge '' ! Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw ! I 've tried this with my Wife 's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well . Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device !	-1
`` This cable not recommended for this device . '' That is what I get for an error message . Plus it is really short .	-1
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last . so this cord works on when plugged into the wall . when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything . so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but do n't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc .	-1
poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone . I would not buy this .	-1
The cable is good , but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4 . It does plug in , but not far enough in to hold securely .	-1
I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone , whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone . I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this	-1
Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices . They are also very short . Took a long time to ship . Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices . It did not work in my S4 . They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better .	-1
damaged charger . when i recieved it the charger had a short in it . i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge .	-1
This charger does n't work very well . When plugged in , it shows that it is charging , but after ten minutes I 'm lucky to get 1 % more on my battery . I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower ... that 's really all it 's good for .	-1
I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone , right in the middle of a long trip . FFFFFFUUUUUUU ...	-1
The plug fits and it charges my Captivate , it felt rather snug . The `` retractable '' -ness of this charger is anything but . Plain ol ' does n't work . I literally took it out of the package , and the first time I pulled the cord out - did n't yank , tug , or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it . I pulled it out further , retracted about 4 or so inches of it . Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button , it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get . The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length . The main reason I wanted this was for the `` retractability '' since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now .	-1
I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift . However , I can not give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked .	-1
The Phone charger works , it charges the phone . However , while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I 'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better .	-1
When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half . Lesson learned , cheap things break too quickly .	-1
it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s . Once it was pulled out it would not retract	-1
THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE . I HATE IT !	-1
Excited about this based on good reviews , but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone , person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound . I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell , and they said the problem went away , so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also , just FYI , this does not come retail packaged , but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions . Not a problem for me , but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality .	-1
I 've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $ 15 to $ 150 . This one was typical of the others that I returned , low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone . I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $ 19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends . It 's nothing fancy , no volume control and no mute , but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone . Price does not determine sound quality . I recommend this product .	-1
The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you . This is pretty important to me , so I only give it 2 stars . I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem .	-1
I do n't think this will last very long . I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment , but I do n't think it would last very long . Plus , the cord is too short for desktop use .	-1
Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much . The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked , once it 's in the phone it is not an issue . So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced . So far I would recommend this battery.Update : 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything . Drained it and charged from dead several times , made sure that location services , blue tooth , apps closed ... all OFF and still drained . Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great ! Maybe I just got a defective battery ... . A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries .	-1
the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g . not a big fan , just use a credit card instead	-1
Seeing is how the 2 , 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer .	-1
Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag ( no case ) - They 're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times , they 're going to break.I do n't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this .	-1
Battery would not charge in iPhone . iPhone shut down after 2 minutes of being powered up . Had to throw it away .	-1
These are all torx drivers , there is no flathead or phillips in this set , which is going back to Amazon today .	-1
Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery	-1
I received it today and it does n't charge . I 'm sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side .	-1
The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine , nice and tight , but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit , FORGET IT	-1
I got these for my jawbone headset . Many had said they work great . but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone .	-1
When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II , they were fantastic . They fit my ear canal perfectly , negating the need for the ear loop that came with it . Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset . The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone , and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear . I tried washing and drying them thoroughly , but that only helped for an hour or so . I am not sure what the fit problem is , but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all .	-1
these were advertised to fit the habra stone . they did not . i do n't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it . not even one piece fit . threw them away	-1
I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable ... These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use . I would n't recommend this to anyone ... Do n't waste your money .	-1
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable , at least for me . It 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear , and forget about jogging wearing this . Also the insert comes off very easily , and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears , you need to find the other sizes of the insert . Sound quality is mediocre , as callees often complain about wind noise from my end . I 'm not happy with these .	-1
These things were terrible . The & # 34 ; Boom & # 34 ; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I could n't keep anything in place . The cord was very flimsy ... It was just an all around bad buy . Would n't do it again .	-1
I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2 . The car makes a lot of noise in any case , so I 'm not holding out for audio lab quality . However , the product made a quite audible ( at low automobile speeds ) click-click-click . I might have been able to tolerate that . However , there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine . The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player . The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok . I had n't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long 's to replace the Coby CA-747 . The volume with the Maxell product was very weak , and I had to turn it way up . The Maxell did n't go click-click-click , but it whistled , too . So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me . I 'm trying out the offering from Philips next ...	-1
This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players .	-1
very disspointed not getting a coby cassette tape because it did not work in my car : / i need my music	-1
Seems great at first . But sound is kind of shaky , almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact . Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it 's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again . It 'll get stuck in this infinite loop . You have to take it out , smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in . Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell . pull on your device too quickly and it 'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck .	-1
But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing.Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses.Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject . I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs ! I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes . Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back . ( I bought 2 on clearance )	-1
These things are just a confidence trick . They do n't do a thing . They ca n't do a thing . If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too .	-1
Come on Amazon , I ca n't really believe you are selling this under your own name !	-1
This thing is a waste of paper , it does n't give u any better reception . This is a total rip off in my book : - (	-1
I would like to say that this is not cheap junk , but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT & T ; , so it could be that combination does n't work with it.It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone , so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars , taking into account it could have been my unit . ; - )	-1
Want to try one ? They sell these at the dollar stores . It does nothing to improve your signal .	-1
Did n't work , It did not work at all . I have a dead spot when I drive to work , where I totally lose the Signal . This device did not help at all . DO NOT WASTE your money on it . even for less than $ 2.00 , its not worth anything .	-1
i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time on my iphone and it didnt made a difference at all ...	-1
I purchased this for my sisters phone . She continually has calls dropped , so I got her this signal booster , and it has n't made a bit of difference . I bought these before for my previous cell phones , and they really seemed to help . But apparently not so much anymore .	-1
Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe , T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address . This did not stop Amazon.com from selling me the phone , nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing ( working ) AT & amp ; T number to their service ( of course , this took two weeks and & gt ; 10 phone calls ) .After receiving no reception , I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area.I called AT & amp ; T back , and they happily attempted to restore my account , only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers.After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone , my phones are happily back on AT & amp ; T where they belong.The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon.com has not refunded my purchase price.Even in areas where I could get coverage , the phone itself did not work well . After pressing more than a few keys , the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it.Last warning : Watch out for the charges for inbound messages -- if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber , send them lots of text messages ( free from their site ) -- the subscriber has to pay $ 0.05/message .	-1
the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $ 20 . Sony took my address and said they would , but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged ! It 's been 3-4 years and it still works . It went through the washing machine and half the dryer . It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes- it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc . I buy a $ 25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes . It 's been a great little phone .	-1
Great features - except for the phone one . Seriously - Bluetooth , IR , good phone book features , nice color display ( though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses ) . However , I get much weaker signals ( and call quality ) on this phone vs. my previous one . If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals , you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge , this is not the phone for you , unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone . : )	-1
I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon 's specs for the T610 phone . T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours ( 300min ) . Who do you believe ? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds !	-1
Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are , I am not surprised that I received a used battery . I am a little mad at the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though . The battery I received holds the charge for about a day , which is the same as my old one.Disappointing indeed .	-1
It does n't fit my phone and now I must return it . What a hassle ! That 's all I have to say !	-1
I ordered this based on the rave reviews I saw for it . I am using it with a Treo 600 and I can barely hear anything out of the ear piece , even with the spongy covering removed .	-1
As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned , the problem is with the connector jack , the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack , which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin . When they are new they work very , very good , excellent sound quality .	-1
This did n't work in my phone . It was rather cheap , I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made !	-1
This item is useless . The plug is far too small to fit my phone , despite the description that this will fit `` LG phones '' . I own the DARE and this does n't fit . The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever . Who uses such a tiny plug ? I 've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone ! You get what you pay for . This item is a joke .	-1
This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried . I like the fact that it is small , that it sounds OK , and that the person on the line could hear me OK ( not great ) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it , which defeats the purpose of having a headset ! ! I ordered 4 of them , they were about $ 3 apiece with shipping , and the first two are buzzy and could not be used . I would not recommend this product . I went to an over the head headset by Jensen , and am VERY pleased !	-1
More importantly , the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap , thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly . When mine arrived , it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in . No box , no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band , just chucked it into a bag . I realize it 's super cheap but it should last a month . Is there we are at now ? I wish Amazon would be ... at all selective on what they offer for sale .	-1
Sound was fine through the headset , however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning .	-1
The earpiece is stamped `` Verizon '' and is of different finish than pictured . There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed , `` ACCSTOP '' in Oxnard , CA . For $ 2.47 , I guess it does n't matter but still , not the item pictured . It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new. Can not try it as the 3.5mm adapter has n't arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase .	-1
I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets , because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with , but they have poor microphone quality . I thought I would try this model , the MX150 Flexible Boom . Again , sound quality was crap . I make a living on the phone , so others being able to hear me is very important.I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far .	-1
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers . One tried to get it to work , and finally gave up . She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call . I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback , but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with , and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time ... if there is a next time .	-1
This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself . It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan . The Moto V600 is a much better phone , takes better pictures , gives you better clarity and reception , is smaller , and is much , much cheaper . Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile . Stay away from this ugly monster .	-1
I recently moved to Phoenix , Arizona , and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone . A friend recommended Nextel , saying we 'd use the direct connect function . Cool . So I ordered an i730 from Amazon . After charging and activating and waiting the required day , I called to get my phone number . It was a Palo Alto , CA , number ! ? That 's over 700 miles away ! An 11 hour drive to the next state . No way close to a local number . Nextel did not seem to understand or care . & quot ; It 's the closest we have. & quot ; & quot ; There are no 602 area code phone numbers left. & quot ; I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix . Nothing doing . After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere , I called Sprint ( who have not been customer service stars to me in the past ) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone . I canceled the Nextel service . They are charging me $ 35 ( expected ) plus $ 11.53 in taxes , fees and assessments & quot ; we ca n't change & quot ; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone , I hope Nextel has a local area code for you , because if they do n't you are stuck for $ 46.53 and an Amazon return . It was a pretty color screen though . . .	-1
It 's a nice-looking product . It seems like I would have liked it . But ... My unit had an electrical problem . I connected two portable external hard drives , one powered external hard drive , a printer , an external DVD+-RW drive , a mouse and a keyboard . Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse did n't work . So I unplugged it and plugged in another one . `` That 's strange , that one does n't work either , '' I thought . `` Hmmm , and what 's that smell ? '' Turns out , that smell was a hard drive frying . Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours , when I figured everything would have cooled down , I started testing my devices . One portable external drive still `` sort of '' works . I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail . The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit . One portable hard drive never worked again . The optical drive still works , occasionally , but typically wo n't boot . Occasionally the printer works . The mice never worked again . And the keyboard was fine . Everything 's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part ? Those were my redundant data storage . I lost everything .	-1
For one , this product is built very cheap . This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working ... why ? I 'm not really sure ... perhaps cheap components , and slight bending ? Secondly , it does not support charging , and yet it does at the same time . If you plug in say an apple device you 'll get an error , but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub , it 's a 2.0 . Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future . For instance , my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly : Mine is just about destroyed , because of a slight drink mishap . Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than ... it stops working from time to time , and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes : The Stand is horrible . It wo n't stay on , especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable . ( It falls out easily , it does not snap on , it 's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it `` rests '' on top of . ( Useless ) - It glows neon Blue . Why ? I 'm not sure . I like it because it matches my setup , but it 's very bright , and I 'd rather the `` power '' be used towards the other devices.Finally : This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time ... .I would get 3-4 to work ... maybe ... . at any given point . Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to `` not work '' entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with . This also made me think there was something wrong with my device , and wasted my time trouble shooting . ( just had to switch ports ) In other words ... do n't buy this device ... get a cheaper hub with more slots , or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap ...	-1
Positives : Bluetooth , IR port , VGA Camera , multiple e-mail accounts , speaker phone , more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S . I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives : phone too big ; voice recognition worthless , low volume from ear piece , IR port weak so TV remote control programs do n't work well , slow menu 's and response . Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you ( Opera has problems on this phone , but works most of the time ) . T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds , although Nokia made it adjustable , and T-Mobile wo n't fix it .	-1
This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand , but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices ( headset , handheld , or desktop computer ) . My old Siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web , you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots , this phone will probably satisfy you . If you need Bluetooth , stay away .	-1
i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it , but what i did n't test out was the reception/range . i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it , EXCEPT for the fit . it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines . it fits great . it does n't hurt . i can wear it for hours . it seems to have a ton of talk time ( at least 6 hours , i would say ) ... but the reception just plain sucks . i do n't know if it 's all the electrical devices running in my apartment , but damn , i ca n't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me . you almost have to have the phone 1 ) within about 6 feet of you and 2 ) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra . basically , count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra 's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device ! and your microwave . and your electric fans ... and running water ... they all make reception horrible . i think my problem might have been the wireless home network . but c'mon people , us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks . duh.summary : pros : *lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ( $ 42 shipped for new ) *easy to usecons : *range , range , range ! this is a huge one for me . if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time , what 's the point ? *too costly at $ 80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit . you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say , it 's for sale on ebay !	-1
I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died . Actually , I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it . I was impressed with the advertised battery life , and took the plunge . Should n't have . While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet , I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body , the connection gets fickle . You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight . Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology , does n't it ? And the static is NOT just in your end ; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it . So if yo get this , be prepared to anger your party on the other line . On the plus side , the sound is nice and loud in th speaker . That 's about it . Try something else , like a bluetrek or motorola or something . I am trying the Motorola next . This thing is trash .	-1
Magnetic mounting is a joke . It is guaranteed to fall over , scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount . It would be very nice to mount this securely , and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof .	-1
Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster , and it is not the right antenna . Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it . This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon 's problem . I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so , but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception . Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry . There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product .	-1
They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it wo n't pick up any signal ! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker ! I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down ! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it does n't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive . I tried emailing Wilson but they were n't any help . Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760 . I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work . The first one had bad threads and would n't go on all the way , the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it . The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal . I do n't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this , they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints . I 'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna , mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great . This one must have been defective .	-1
This did n't do much for me . Unfortunately , it may not be the blame . Ironically , I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes ( I thought ) . This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution . So in the mobile world , I 'm sure this would be helpful . It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage , location , type of usage , cell frequency and more . So in putting a system together , for a whole home solution , you 'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit ' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system .	-1
This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box . I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day .	-1
I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now . I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones . ( The early blue tooth standard is n't really as `` standard '' as one might hope ! ) However , it has proven rather fragile . Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch . Did not impact usability so I did n't care . For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger ( several of my colleagues are having similar problems ) . The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked . I keep the unit in my briefcase , so I do n't know why it is proving as fragile as it has . If you can use it ( or the similar HS850 ) with some assurance that it will not be crushed , it is a good choice . Otherwise , I suggest looking at other designs .	-1
This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever , I 've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well -- -- - however , the connection speeds take forever to establish -- -- in addition , the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 -- - I 've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary ... ..UPDATE : I have also tried the Moto 850 -- -- sadly , it is really no better than the 810 -- - there are some volume improvements , but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 -- -- I recommend the Scala 500	-1
I have had this headset for several months now , and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life . This headset works OK , but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect , ie . no background or wind noise , and very close to handset . I do like the feature of the headset turning off , when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from . Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset , I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws .	-1
This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made . One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad . Unfortunately , the pad moves all around .	-1
Even though the package and description stated there was no adhesive , there certainly was a white backing too remove and place on dash . I felt the item was very thin , and to the touch not sticky at all . There were no groves as competing products and the part that faced up that was supposed to attract and `` stick '' was smooth . Overall , I was not impressed .	-1
I bought 10 of these . They are the worst product I have ever used . They DO NOT work as advertised . Nothing sticks to them	-1
The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing . Then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard . Then when you pair it the iphone will ask you to enter a 4 digit code and press enter on the keyboard . That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS . But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken , it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up . I tried pressing keys and waiting . I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected . No matter what I do it will not reconnect . I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work . That makes the keyboard completely useless on the iPhone 3GS with iOS4 . There is a video posted on youtube where another person had the same problem.If anyone was able to get it to work properly with an iPhone 3GS with iOS4 , please let me know how you were able to do it .	-1
The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650 , fortunately I have Sprint 's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo . I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website . If you have a Treo do not get this device .	-1
I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip , and complained about typing on a Blackberry . I thought I better install it before sending it after her , so I could guide her along . No PC where she is , so I tried to download as advertised . Result : Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item ( ? ) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer 's description while not the web page to support the claim ... You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back ... If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page , or click on the one star reviews . A shame	-1
It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop . You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it 's new surroundings . I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor ... .to boxing it up to send back when it would n't sync to my Axim x50v ... .to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly , I now love it again . The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable . It 's great for writing a longer e-mail , inputting contacts , or writing a letter in word , when you do n't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly . The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap . Pun intended . The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA . It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you . But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just do n't want to let go . The plastic it 's made out of does n't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually . Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim , et al , is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it 's holding . Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it . I previously gave it one star , but now that it 's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5 . I know it shows one star , but Amazon whold n't allow me to edit the scale .	-1
I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time . I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site . After a lot of frustration , I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard , but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it . I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that : `` Unfortunately , we do not have a driver for that device currently . '' So , I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly `` for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds . `` By the way , the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices , only with Smartphones . A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate , in small letters , that it also works for Blackberry . In my case , though , back it goes , which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it . In the mean time , I guess I 'll keep looking.Lastly , I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit . It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove .	-1
Pro'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears , can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore . Trying to get motorola to fix it , but no help so far.Audio books may have issues . The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects . Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset .	-1
It wo n't work with my phone . After 2 hours , I got it to connect , but it wo n't answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them . Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device . It 's made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor . I 'm going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I do n't have to carry multiple cords with me .	-1
It 's a great deal , so i jumped on it . But was truly disappointed . I 've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor . I own a Razar , wish i could return that ! But this headset , thinking it 's from motorola would work well with my phone , but no . It 's on my belt clip , and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away , signal is weak , and then disconnets . To me that 's strange . It 's also surprising that this happens randomly , so it 's kinda annoying , b/c you ca n't anticipate it . Kinda annoying when driving , b/c you rely on the headset to work properly . Also get the static noise which is weird , b/c it should n't do that . especially when driving .	-1
a couple problems with this headset , when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2 . the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10 , Cardo Scala , or Palm Treo headset -- -- there are too many great headsets out there , to settle for this onehappy shopping !	-1
I am not impressed.I do n't know what the other reviewers are smoking . This device does not cancel out background noise . Listeners on the other end say I sound like I 'm in a tunnel . Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one 's mouth and the `` pinhole '' for the internal microphone . There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise . This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking . The `` ear attachment '' and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic . As a result the fit is n't tight enough . I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing 's going to fly off my head into the back seat . It 's an extremely annoying distraction that you do n't want to have while driving.On the good side , I do n't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use .	-1
I 've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst . The sound quality is low , especially outdoors , and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone . The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside ( with any background noise ) it was almost impossible . This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear ( earbud style ) . The microphone is far enough from one 's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable , especially if you wear glasses , but not as bad as some others I 've tried . It does not flop around much under normal circumstances . I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500 , which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price , but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I 'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250 . I 've used those in the past and found them much better overall , and worth the extra price .	-1
I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it , so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice , this item came in with extremely cheap package and it 's sound quality is worse than my previous one . My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one . Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging .	-1
The voice reception with this headset was just ok . Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving . I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it . It may be something to do with the design of the head set . Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain , and I have to believe them ... It 's weird though that I get always get a tingling , achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes . So try as I might , I can not wear it for prolonged periods of time . After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me ! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging . I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging . However , now the headset just died ... after 2 months . I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it . It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one . I 'm waiting for the replacement to come back . Who knows how long this one will last !	-1
This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either . The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy , long-term usage . It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog . I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life ( Oddly , it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty ) . I am surprised that Motorola could n't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line ( the volume does n't go up very high ) . It 's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great . Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall , I like the idea of bluetooth but I have n't found a great headset yet . I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you do n't find anything else in the price range that you like , buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside : I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife 's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset . When I compared the two chargers , they were identical .	-1
and i 'm fairly disappointed ! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $ 80 and i am thinking it 's going back before my 30 days are up ! in summary , considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make , this is just NOT worth $ 80 , period . even if this device worked flawlessly , it might be worth about $ 30 at best.here are my gripes : * it says it has a range of about 30 feet . hmmm ... not really . i am even using this headset with a motorola phone ( V505 ) and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south . not the biggest deal in the world . even when i am close to the phone however , there can be some interferance ( `` crackling '' ) and distortion . usually mild though . it seems like my microwave interferes with it ( when it 's cooking ) ! * does n't fit snugly on my ear . rather , it kind of `` hangs '' there . it does n't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment , so here 's hoping it fits your ear . using this headset while lying down is hard to do ; the device does n't seem to want to stay put . * drops the bluetooth connection every now and again , even when i am at close range.the `` good '' : * looks cool ! ; ) * battery life seems to be pretty good . * small , lightweighti am going to look into some other options . this simply was a waste of money .	-1
The audio is very soft of this headset . I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it . Also , it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone , so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds .	-1
I bought this from Amazon . I linked quickly and worked as advertised . I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume . Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise . I found it only adequate in a quiet room . I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal . I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car . It is fine if your sitting in quiet room .	-1
This thing just does n't work well with the Treo 6501. it does n't automatically connect , when a call comes , or when a call is initiated2 . the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good , but for the price , there are many BETTER headsets out there -- -- consider the Cardo Scala , the Jabra JX10 , and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping !	-1
Lasted 3 months , lucky I have two ( charge one , while using the other ) , the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use , hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though , but These items need to last the day .	-1

This headset seems to work fine , but the audio quality is nothing to write home about , to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone . They will also hear a lot of background noise . I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset . It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And , you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone . But I admit that it 's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires , which feels a bit safer and freer , especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit ( or your phone ) in a hot car ! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan .	-1
Do n't purchase these if you plan to use in your car . The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source , my Sirus Radio in my case , you 'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm 's increase and decrease . You get what you pay for .	-1
Received it , plugged it in , did n't work . Tried jostling the cable and plug around , could n't get it to work . Ca n't recommend it .	-1
Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone . The cable does not work . I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it 's fully plugged in . In order to hear stereo , i need to hold cable out to before the spring click . Unfortunately this does n't suit my needs for the car .	-1
it 's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3 . battery life is only about 48hrs ( standby ) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone 's spec says.4 . phonebook is pretty messedup . phone book name displys only first half of first line , although it allows you to enter two lines.5 . on/off button some times takes second try.6 . it 's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile ... under one name.7 . phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it wo n't charge . design is pretty messed up.8 . 1/8 '' of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9 . signal is very poor . I 'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year .	-1
I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s . I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae & # 8217 ; s which needed to be pulled out of the phone . Since the phone antennae & # 8217 ; s have changed , I haven & # 8217 ; t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them . I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth . The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters .	-1
This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone , I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength . I guess that 's the reason why they 're selling so cheap . Do not waste your time with this product .	-1
Did n't work for my Galaxy S3 SPH-L710 so in case you have this same phone or just a Galaxy S3 ( Verison , AT & T , T-Mobile ) does n't matter . It wont work .	-1
This does not work at all . And once you put it on it is so hard to took off . Never again ! ! ! !	-1
I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL . I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT .	-1
these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try . but really not worth a dime	-1
you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that	-1
We 've had the Sidekick II for about two months . Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value , I find it very awkward to use as a phone . It does n't have a normal keyboard , so you must flip the screen up to press the keys , then flip the screen back down to listen and talk . When you get into a voicemail situation , you have to keep flipping the screen up to `` press 1 for English '' , etc . Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $ 20 per month if you want to browse the Internet , use Instant Messaging , or even Download Fun . Otherwise , all you get is phone calls and text messaging ( which is also extra ) . Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $ 5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage . The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter `` A '' has fallen out . It occasionally just freezes for no reason . The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone , so you ca n't take it out to let the phone reset itself . No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip , for example.Internet browsing is cool , but so slow you think it stopped working . I think some of the fault is just the slow connection , but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it 's trying to display.Oh , yeah . Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $ 9.95 to set up your album on its web site , then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction . You ca n't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper , it is n't really ready for prime time .	-1
Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing , web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go . You can also download limited content . You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook , but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program . Compared to the original Sidekick , SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer . I also think it 's uglier , esp . the new thumb keyboard , but the keyboard is still very useable . Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks , requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service , though , is the poor quality of T-Mobile 's GPRS coverage . T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM ( voice ) coverage in the U.S . When it comes to GPRS ( data ) , it 's even worse , and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt . And when that happens , SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns . This makes a very frustrating user experience , esp . when you need Internet access the most ( e.g. , when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store ) . Unfortunately , T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed , so if you get the SK , be prepared for slow speed and lost connections . Once the novelty factor wears off , the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course , currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II . If you are an absolutely Internet junkie , you 'll probably find T-Mobile 's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK 's true wireless Internet access appealing .	-1
I regret buying this phone , it 's really big , and verizon service is n't that great with this phone . For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1 , or will have 1 bar when i 'm getting no service . That said , the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD , the outer LCD is pretty bad . You can play with the settings . It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of . The camera is terrible , which is pretty much true with all cell phones though , so that 's a non unique gripe . The phone is also moderately fruity , like when you make or recieve calls , the outer LED will start blinking purple , blue , pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl , and the menus are all kind of childish . That said , when the phone does have some bars , calls never drop and it 's pretty easy to set up the phone . I 'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones , i recently switched from tmobile , but im sure you can do better than this phone , good luck .	-1
I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away . It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket ! Since I have n't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets , I ca n't say if it is the headset or the phone , but either way , if you buy one of these and have the same problem , make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder ( the part that holds the headset to your ear ) . This is a bad design and honestly , there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear . The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out , which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so . Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note : The wind blocking technology works well , but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent . I 've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I 'm talking to them with the headset , and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck !	-1
the `` behind the ear '' thing just broke ... I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly , and this piece of junk just fell apart ! ! ! Very dissapointed ! ! ! I should have made my additions to this review long ago , but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way ! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset , but not just a replacement , an $ 85 replacement ! Then told me to keep the broken one , which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue ! Really incredible customer support ... I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name ! BTW , 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue .	-1
I 'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz , bells and whistles , and generally go for performance and practicality . Sound quality and features are fine for the price . But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy ; the weight is unbalanced , as well . I could not get a comfortable fit . My ear is well within normal range of size and shape , but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive , wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here . If you do n't care about medium to long term fit and comfort , or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear , you may be happy with this headset . I was n't , and am returning it . I 'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try ; if it 's no good , I 'll probably go with a Jabra , and spend a bit more money .	-1
The sound quality was excellent , but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable : terrific electrical engineering , poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it was n't broken . Even wind did n't seem to bother the headset much . The voice quality was great on transmission and reception . But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and ca n't be replaced . I got a new headset the first time on warranty . The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I did n't want the hassle . I have a Scala now that I 've been using for months and I 'm very happy with it , even though the sound and wind-immunity does n't measure up to the Logitech .	-1
It says it 's compatible with all Motorola handsets ... It does n't work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks . Very disappointing .	-1
Set it up , it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop . Returned and purchased a different item . Did n't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing . Ca n't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair , I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great ... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice ( though it does work great with Cisco IP phone ) . I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good .	-1
I have had this phone almost 6 weeks ( 40 days ) . At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working ( a , s , d , f , and g , etc ) . I was told to call Palm in India , which I did , and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up , because I have really loved Palm . This is my fourth Palm device , though it will likely be my last . I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation . My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices ( my cell phone , my Palm T3 and my laptop ) . And then , that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course , when I took the phone to Sprint , they said it was Palm 's responsibility to repair . When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes , as they always do . Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink , that they said they would give me - this one time - a `` free return and repair , '' meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days . They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $ 25 to get a refurbished replacement , complete with a 90-day warranty ( which I now know means nothing ) . These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just do n't work , and that I needed something immediately . I do n't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people , or how I can be made to feel like they 're doing me a favor by standing behind their product . I am the customer ! Does n't that mean anything anymore ? I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad ( though Amazon 's remains very , very good ) . When a person spends $ 400 on a phone , or any device , it should work longer than a few weeks . But when it does stop working , the company that sold it should stand behind their product , instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility . Subsequent to this occurrence , other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s , as well.There are other issues with this phone . Out of the box , the power/sync cord did not work . I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced . ( I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle , which works fine . ) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume . Every so often , the phone just resets itself - ca n't figure this one out at all . Also , when someone calls in on Call-Waiting , you can not disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call ; in other words , when you accept the Call-Waiting call , it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously , even when the first party hangs up . This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also , there are limited , non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone . And do n't get this phone for its camera : cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise , all the Palm applications work as they should , and as they have for the past number of years . Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all , I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device . My company will stop using Palm , and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint ( when contracts start to expire ) .My apologies for the rant , but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers . Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore ? I know mine tries to ; otherwise , we 're out of business .	-1
I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it . The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box , so call them , do n't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very , very good , there are other issues with the unit . First , the fit on my particular ear is horrible ... always feeling like it was going to fall off . I never trusted it walking through airports as it just did n't feel secure.Second , the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months . The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose , then broke off . I note that others have metioned the same thing . It just was n't well constructed . Bummer ! I 've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics , but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo , I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality .	-1
Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews , and I 've been fairly disappointed by the performance I 've experienced . My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint 's LG-PM325.First , the audio quality was not good . If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset , I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception . Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio . When using the headset with my phone , while the phone was in my front pocket , the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable . And it 's not by hearing.Second , there 's the shiny blue light . When I read other 's comments about the flashing blue LED , I really did n't think much of it . But in the dark , this thing is a strobe light . At night , with my headset left on some countertop downstairs , and while I was upstairs , I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling . That 's part A . Part B , the flash results in a very slight audible clicking , not unlike when a camera flash goes off . Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence , be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you 're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good . Pairing was excellent . The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably , and making or answering calls was straightforward.I 've returned mine because of the two problems .	-1
I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip . When I received the order , the clip would not fit on my glasses , and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction ( the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box ) .The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com .	-1
Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully . As for me , there were two main problems . First , I found the sound level to be too low . While it 's easy enough to turn up the volume , the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end . The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone . I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but , after that time , I decided to send it back and keep looking .	-1
I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece , where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end , even landline to landline , there is an annoying whine and some echo , no matter what the setting . This is n't good enough , I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon .	-1
I bought , exchanged , and then returned this unit . Both units delivered to me would not turn on . When I charged them using the supplied adaptor , the red charging light came on and a few hours later , the unit was supposedly fully charged . However , when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button , nothing happened . The unit never came on , could not be paired , and never worked . I returned both of them . I can understand one unit being bad , but two units that were shipped several weeks apart should n't be.When I called for technical support , I waited on hold for sometime , and then gave up .	-1
I bought this item @ a local retailer , was happy cause i got it on sale ( probobly clearance ) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched ! I can not find my receipt , so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this is n't an issue ! wanting to know how many phones i tried , if i tried more than 1 headset , etc ... . i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S & H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement ! Just get a nice wired headset , less $ spent & less headache !	-1
I could NOT get it charge . Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it . I ask for help on this and got no where . But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great .	-1
It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C 's that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these , it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert , but I am afraid I ca n't recommend these .	-1
Got this is a timely mannor , put it in my phone , chatged for 12+ hours and nothing ! Never worked ! Annoyed to say the least ! I ordered this just in time to go into the hospital for a ce section so i wouldnt have to charge my phone all that often considering bending and such will be painfull . A lot of good it did me .	-1
I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500 . Therefore , I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement , and last night i needed it . I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work . I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing ( not one indicator light ) . I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger , it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked ; unfortunately , i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head . Consequently , this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase , i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore , the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet . I learned a valuable lesson .	-1
The device was not as the description . It looked as if someone dropped it off their vehicle and it hit the road and skidded all the way down . I was VERY disappointed when opening it b/c it was the first thing I seen other than the front damage.I did email the seller and told them and they were very nice and refunded me as I returned the product back to them .	-1
was very unhappy with this it didnt work no time i had got it for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him	-1
This Bluetooth sucks . Plain and simple ... I mean I paid , what , $ 15 for the thing so was n't expecting the best but at least working quality . I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $ 60 but I always lose them . Always ! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I would n't cry in the corner losing out on a day & # 8217 ; s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my ( what is this my 6th ) Bluetooth . But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it . Hell , even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks ! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause .	-1
I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710 . Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry . The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software . Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710 . To bad , the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me . If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it .	-1
Bought this phone with Cingular service . I needed the phone in a hurry . I checked my order next day , had this weird message : '' Order RevisionOrder placed October 08 , 2005 at 10:35 PM PDTOpen order -- your order revision requiredhas not approved you for any phone and service plan packages . Please cancel necessary phone and service plan packages from your order . We can not proceed with your order without some action on your part . Please be aware that if you do not take action on this item within 5 DAYS , it will be cancelled from your order.Cancel necessary phone and service plan packages '' I had no idea what this cryptic message meant , but essentially they were requiring me to cancel the order . I have three cell phones in my family , perfect credit , no earthly reason why I would n't be approved for a cell phone account , just the above message with no explanation . Of course , there is no one at Amazon to call for an explanation . I do n't know if my form was missing some information , or something was mistyped - no idea at all what happened . I think that if Amazon was going to cancel my order , they need to explain it to me.I have bought from Amazon before , usually good service , but this is just awful.I think that Amazon is in over their heads in the cell phone business.From other comments , it sounds like Amazon is not being fully honest or transparent in their cell phone ads .	-1
My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago . In that time ( during which the phone was never dropped , bumped , etc ) , I 've replaced my phone twice , and hers once . The problems we 've had include : - random `` white screen of death '' - Bluetooth connectivity problems ( isolated to phones ) - dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous `` Unable to Charge '' problemAdd to that Motorola 's lousy phonebook and UI , and retarded Bluetooth handling ( e.g. , if any BT device is connected , the same Moto default ring sounds , regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones ) , and you have an overpriced , overhyped , oversize paperweight.I 'm fortunate Cingular offers my company 's employees discounts on new phones , so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson . My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service , even after having been dropped twice . It 's on its 2nd owner now , who has used it for 6 months problem-free .	-1
My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket . There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket ! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure . This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before . I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu 's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel . Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip , full support for bluetooth ( although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless ) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling . I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i do n't know whether its the service or phone . Overall i want to like the phone but i 'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it .	-1
Does n't stay on even if you figure out how to get it on . The ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you ca n't hear . The mouth piece is way too short so no one can hear you talk over the car and road noise . The cord is too short and there is not volume control on the cord with is inconvenient . Get the Bluetooth and give up the wire .	-1
This fell apart after one use , and the person I called could n't even hear me when it was n't broken to pieces . VERY disappointed ! : (	-1
This model , the C150 , is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered . I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used , however , all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality . With each one , the persons on the other end could not hear me . Disappointed . I found that it worked well with a cell phone , but not with a cordless phone .	-1
I screwed up ; should n't have ordered this ; it 's of no use to me . Since the real price was hidden in the `` shipping and handling '' it 's pointless to return it ; I 'll just write it off as an `` educational expense '' .I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a `` hands free '' 2.5mm jack . ( Siemens cordless phone system ) . The owners manual says `` ... any 2.5 mm headset '' , so that 's what I bought . I do n't even know where this thing is anymore ; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system ; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud , `` screeching '' sound ... ... playing with the plug , I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone , but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I ca n't get it to work on anything else either including my wife 's Samsung Intensity ( which also has a 2.5mm headset jack ; same results ) , but I do n't have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid ; buying this was one of those occasions .	-1
These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement , and it 's the same situation.I am not sure if it 's because I 'm using a Nokia E71x , but they both do n't work properly .	-1
There 's a problem with the design of this headset . The jack used is too short . It 's EXTREMELY sensitive to movement . If you do n't have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still , you 'll loose the connection . I do n't know why they designed it that way ...	-1
I does n't hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery . You really do get what you pay for , do n't you ?	-1
This is the 3rd `` OEM '' battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others , it was terrible . I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50 . They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time . It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge . Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery -- - not OEM . How can you tell ? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan . These say clearly that they are made in china . I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues . There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk , counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it . For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time . My time is worth more than th $ 10 I get ripped off for . But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers . AMAZON 's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth . Well AMAZON , you can start here : Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders , Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $ 30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit . So it has nothing to do with the price paid . Just dishonest online sellers .	-1
They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them . Not much better than the old ones I was replacing .	-1
I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby ( not making calls ) before it went dead . I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR . They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem .	-1
I agree with other reviews ... people who talk to me hear a horrible echo due to the mic picking up the earspeakers sound ... even if I set the earspeaker to the lowest volume . I 'm glad it came free with my phone , because if I 'd payed for this ... I 'd be pretty mad .	-1
Summary : Stay away , this product sports a very poor design ... Pro : + very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon : - morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone . 1 short beep , 2 short beeps , 3 short beeps , 1 long beep , 3 beeps up , 3 beeps down . like another reviewer said , you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it , partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door . I got so frustrated , I was about to throw this thing out of the window . For a product that use regular batteries , the battery door is the most difficult to open . Once opened , you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out . The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug . This must be a sick joke by Motorola . Forget about changing the battery on the go , you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience . ( for the record : this was my breaking point , i had to return this unit , because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off ) - sound quality is mediocre at best	-1
Quality and value of this item are fine , but WHOA , it smells SO BAD ! ! Just like bug spray ! I returned it promptly .	-1
I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out . It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone . Very disappointed .	-1
Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all . You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse . Money part needs length to really pack some cash in . Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase . Id say purchase a cheaper product like this . Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless . Buyer be aware . Update . I stopped using this . The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it . Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces . Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone .	-1
I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise . The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card . Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch . It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people do n't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic .	-1
i returned it because it came dented . I like it , wish i could have used it . They said i got the last one .	-1
I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone . However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none . I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone . I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore . I tried it again to make sure it was the cover , and sure enough it did the same thing as before . I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2 . So I had to return the case for a refund . It is disappointing because it was a great looking case .	-1
Not a very well made case , thought it would be of better quaility , hard to tell from just looking at it on the site .	-1
This product was pretty inexpensive so I had no expectations . When I received it I quickly noticed how flimsy the plastic was . You can probably fit 2 credit cards top . Might be a good case for nights out , but probably wont protect your phone much . I ended up tossing it because it was too flimsy .	-1
The case took almost a week to arrive . You buy a cheap case , you 're going to get cheap case quality . Stay away . The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all . Will scratch your phone . Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt . Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case . Thank God it did n't scratch the aluminium on the case . A credit card did n't even slide all the way down into the case . Good luck trying to fit two in there . Spend your money else where .	-1
The phone does not fit into this junky case properly . Completely worthless and just a money grab by the seller . It was cheap with the coupon code because it does n't fit ! I tossed this case is in the trash where it belongs . I realize purchasing a cheap case is a gamble , but I never expected it be so bad that it does n't even fit the phone . Completely useless .	-1
its a worst product I have ever seen by motorola . It charges my phone but I have to hold the jack that goes into phone , and also have to drive at same time.I bought Belkin 's similar product from Walmart for $ 10 and it rocks .	-1
I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working ! This thing is junk , there is no way to replace the fuse ( if there is one ) without destroying it . I tried to take it apart , but you ca n't without breaking it . If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design . Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it ? ? ? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone , that should tell you something ! How do you screw one up ? ! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how !	-1
This is the 8th headset I have tried . Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone , but not so good on a cordless phone . Same with this set ... Very comfortable to wear . I can hear those I call really well . Those that I call need to be able to hear me too ! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried , but is still low . If you are talking to clients on the phone all day , this is important . I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume . Still looking .	-1
OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for : ) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plastic , light weight and just down right worthless . the 2 weeks I had it pluged in , it never gave my phone a full charge , i drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want more , then you 'll have to pay more .	-1
I like how it just barely sticks out from the cigarette plug on my Passat , so I can close the cover when I do n't have my phone chord plugged in.Even on the 2.1 port , the charger can not keep up with an iphone 5S . With every thing off on the iphone ( air plane mode , screen off , etc ) , it gave a 15 % charge in 2 hours . That 's 7.5 % per hour.When using Waze GPS the charge drops from 100 % to 90 % in 10 minutes.I would not recommend this charger .	-1
I can have this plugged in from Atlanta to Greensboro and the phone is n't much more charged than when I started . But the phone does n't die , either .	-1
used for 1 month before it broke - also not 2.1 amps - both usb slots do not produce enough current for sgs4	-1
Product quality of this item is very , very poor . After charging my phone for 15 minutes the charger began to overheat and the charge on my phone started to fail . Had to return this item for refund .	-1
I love my Kindle Fire , but I hate the micro plug.when plugging in a charger cord , I find that sometimes it does n't recognize that the plug is in and sometimes I have to jiggle it a little to get the charging box to turn green to show that it is , in fact , charging . I can not stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire . It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or do n't work at all . Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge . I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I do n't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart . I do n't care how much you pay for one of these type of cord , they should all work . When I started using it , this cord `` appeared '' on my visual inspection to be well made , but I guess looks are deceiving . The cord , of course , fell apart after the return date so I 'm stuck.I really do n't recommend this cord . I realize that it could be just a single defective one , but , of the three other reviews , only one person out of four of us recommended this cord . So just beware .	-1
When I bought these , I thought they 'd fast charge a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 , but they do n't . They will slow charge . I have tried multiple cables , including the original Samsung cable which allows for a fast charge , but found this did n't help . Somewhere I read that they have to be specially configured to fast charge a Samsung device or otherwise they 'll charge slowly despite which port of the charger you use .	-1
I had a previous version of this product a few years ago . It lasted for about two year until a capacitor blew out . You could see it through the translucent case . I like the previous version . This one not so much.The AC prongs do not fold in so they are in the way when being used in a lighter outlet or stored in a pocket or computer back.It 's larger than the combination of some separate ac only and 12v only chargers I have , so there is no space savings.When connected to my ipad or my razr maxx , the screen keyboard malfunctions . Spurious and random characters are generated when the screen is touched instead of the keys that should be detected . Unplugging the cable immediately stops this problem.I contacted BoxWave and they did send me a return shipping label . I have not gotten around to returning the charger yet . I dont know if this is a design issue or if I just got a bad unit . But the first two issues are reasons I would not recommend these even if the malfunction is just a bad unit .	-1
Bought this to use in our brand new 2014 Nissan Altima . From the first time we plugged it in , it only worked if we jiggled it just right . Definitely not a 2.0 amp charger either . Will spend the extra dough to get one directly from the T-Mobile retailer . Not worth the return shipping cost for a refund . Only buy this if you feel like donating some money to a foreign company in Asia , just for fun .	-1
This case looks *FANTASTIC* , seriously . It 's easily one of the classiest , most beautiful cases I 've ever owned for a phone . The leather is great , it feels comfortable , it 's just a seriously awesome case.The problem is , I want to use it as a basic wallet as well , and it fails miserably at that . The entire case is so tight you can hardly fit your cards in ( I only want 3 cards and my drivers license . The fit is so tight you can barely get them in , once you do , the case does n't close very well over the phone.I guess I could go back to a wallet , but I really did n't want to do that . I wanted to use this as a `` pick up my phone and my car keys and go '' arrangement . No more fumbling for wallet , but this can not fit that bill . This case would have been far better off leaving all the extra storage out , and letting it close nicely . Overall , this case is wasted for me , just does n't cut it , even though I so badly wanted it to .	-1
It is not leather , and its smell is atrocious . However , if you 're okay with leatherette , it does have some nice pockets inside and it 's relatively thin/lightweight.I 'd avoid this seller though ( BoxWave Corp ) . Shipping is $ 5 and you will pay to return the item to them . For me , it was a total waste of money as the shipping costs alone are likely far more than the product is worth . I paid $ 30 for the case , $ 5 for shipping to me . I 'll be sending it flat rate back . Bear Mountain cases are better , real leather , and cost less ( about $ 20 for the iPad Mini ) .	-1
This Classic Book iPhone case is flimsy and the cover will not remain closed . Not good protection for an iPhone .	-1
I used the Motorola H500 before and the sound clarity is not as good as the Jabra BT250v . So I bought this product June 30 to replace my H500 . Received it July 11th . The person in the other end of the line noticed that I sounded clearer and louder . Used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed . My Jabra250v was just used for minutes of light usage ( 3 hours max in 7 days ) , but the headphone stopped working August 15 . The person on the other line can hear me fine , but I do n't hear anything from the headset . I asked Amazon for a refund or replacement , but Al from from customer service emailed me this , `` Unfortunately , more than 30 days have passed since you received this item , and we are not able to provide a replacement . Our return policy states that within 30 days of delivery of your order , you may return any merchandise in new condition , with the original packaging and accessories , or any defective merchandise , for a full a refund or replacement. `` Fair enough.He gave me a phone number to the Jabra corporation : 619-622-0764 & lt ; -- -this number does not work . So I had to go to the Jabra website and ask them for a replacement and or refund . As of August 17 12:54am EST , I have not heard anything from the company.This could be an isolated case . And for a good brand name like Jabra , I hope it is . But it sucks when you get a faulty piece of equipment . I hope you have a better experience with this product than what I have experienced . Just do know that this product is not free from possible defects .	-1
Perhaps I just got a bad one , but this thing wo n't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone , let alone the 30 they claim . It 's a nice design , and if it worked I 'd be very happy with it.UPDATE : I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen ( they even shipped out the new unit before I 'd shipped back the bad one ) . Unfortunately , while the new unit works somewhat better , it still does n't work as well as it should . For example , there is noticeable popping ( interference ) if i put my phone in my pocket , even on the same side as the headset . I 've tried many combinations of phone and headset , and the only time I have problem is with this headset , so I 'm quite sure it 's not an issue with my phone , or with bluetooth in general . ( In fact , I 've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products . ) So , the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works , but I 've found that it fails when I really need it.FINAL UPDATE : I chucked it . Do n't believe the breathless reviews about this . If you use this in everyday life -- i.e . with the phone more than a few feet from your head -- people on the other end will hear static . I got so sick of people asking me `` what 's that clicking sound ? '' that I threw the stupid thing away . I 'm amazed people love this so much . They must be so floored by the idea of wireless technology they have n't actually tried using it for a real conversation , or they have n't actually tried to call another person . With two bad experiences with this company , that was the last Jabra product I 'll ever buy .	-1
1st month , very good . 2nd month , dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me . It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth . It was bad having to always disconnect this because everyone on the other line could not hear or understand me . I replaced this after 2 months with the Samsung WEP and have had no problems . Not worth it .	-1
First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter . Worked fine , except that the vibrate feature wo n't work . Then I exchanged it for another one . This time the vibrate works , but the call pickup button would not work . It works for power up/power down . But I ca n't pickup any incoming calls . The button simply would n't work for that functionality . I tried it with few phones and it does n't work . I already exchanged the jabra adapter once . Now I 'm sick of exchanging it . I think jabra has bad quality control . Someone in the quality control shd be fired ! Everytime you exchange something , you run into a new problem .	-1
The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal ( which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO ) . Otherwise , it was horrific - static , terrible sound quality , etc . Please do not waste money on that POS . I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815 .	-1
BT250 and this newer BT250v are pure junk . The sound quality on these two units are horrid , there are no other ways to describe it . My friends and coworkers can identify these units remotely and asked that I do not speak to them using the BT250 or BT250v . The microphone is sooooo sensitive and un-tuned , it is particularly unusable in cars or while walking . The road noise or wind noise will over saturate your voice . Even under ideal quiet surrounding , normal speech will come out muddy and weak . The battery life also shortens significantly during the 1 year warranty with moderate use . The button on this unit does n't help with usability . With the earhook design , one would push the button in the direction perpendicular into the ear to activate the button , a task easily done with one finger and no pain . However , this unit uses the behind the ear design , where you would have to use two fingers with a motion to pinch your earlobe to activate the button , it 's truly an unpleasant experience . In addition , the vibrate alert feature is just stupid and useless . In most cases , one would be wearing this unit , so the audible ringing can be heard -- why would you need it to vibrate ? ? ? I truly advise against buying this unit .	-1
One of the most worthless items I 've ever had . No troubleshooting information in the manual . Works when it wants as opposed to when I want . Charge does n't seem to last a day without any use . Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy.I give up on bluetooth . And mostly , nomo MotoOne star because I ca n't give it a lower vote .	-1
I returned this product because it was clearly a used headset . There were scratches on the front , and a small dent . Frankly I do not want to insert a used product into my ear . I went to Wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money .	-1
I own this headset and the sound quality is very poor . I end up having to pick up the handset manually so I can hear the person on the other end . This defeats the purpose of hands free in a car . In a quiet room it works fine . Do not buy this if you intend to use it in a car , bus or train .	-1
As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user , I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850 . In fact , I went through FOUR HS850 headsets ( under warranty ) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 ( despite the lower model number , the H700 is a newer model ) .The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics : - Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls ( or put them on hold/mute ) - Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat 's the difference ? Well , `` good published '' battery life is the distinction . All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months , but then would not hold a charge . Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare . Apparently , their support center for these products was in Argentina , and they could only do what was in their script to help me . After the fourth failure , I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois . That support contact was a dream . After reviewing my case , he gave me the H700 as a replacement . I had that headset for 1.5 years , and it had kept its battery life and functionality . Of course , I lost it and had to buy a replacement ... and given all the choices , I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850 . I 've seen prices as low as $ 15 for this model . I think you 'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end .	-1
I have a Treo 650 , on Sprint PCS , with a firmware update of 1.08For the most part , I actually like this headset because it is very comfy , and people seem to hear me well ( the comfort is a big deal , as I often wear glasses ) however , this headset takes a long time to connect with the T650 -- - a good 7 to 10 seconds on most calls ( and by then , most people have hung up ) in addition , the volume is okay in the car ( or other isolated places ) but forget about using it outside or in noiser environmentsI 've heard that it works well with Moto products though -- -- for Treo 650 users , I highly recommend the Scala 500 , which has fast connection times and loud volumehappy shopping ! ! !	-1
I love not having the wire , but the microphone is so close to the earpiece that everyone I talk to with the headset is annoyed and complains about hearing themselves ( in echo ) . This problem can be diminished somewhat by turning the volume down , but then I ca n't hear the person I 'm talking to either ( unless I 'm in a perfectly silent place ) . Other than this design flaw , the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls , good battery life , etc .	-1
I was very dissapointed with its audio performance . I do n't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail ( good microphone , quick connect , good battery life , light-weight etc . ) , but the usability is very restricted.Here is the bottom line , if you want to take this unit outside of your office/home/any quiet environment , you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy ( this is at unit 's highest volume ) . I was using this in the car , and I can hear faint at best when the road is good , but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway , the other person 's voice is completely drowned . The speaker 's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable . By the way , this experience was inside a luxury car , not a cardboard car . I am not sure the reason behind this design , could be to improve battery life ? I had high expectations . I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 ( read good reviews about it : in-ear position & USB charging ) .By the way , I used this with my Blackberry 7100g , good syncing and quick connection .	-1
Sucks ... . I want even keep this one . First it use a non usb charger and its too big and bulk this needs to put in the trashed and buried on another planet .	-1
I bought this headset to replace my HS820 . I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved , the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off . They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this . The contact with my ear was n't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied .	-1
I like the look of this headset , and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However , the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset . Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled , and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset . Also , the earpiece speaker is not that loud , so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise ( e.g. , in the car ) .I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago . I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one ( Plantronics Voyager 510 ? ) .	-1
I had this bluetooth for a week , then I started having issues . It would disconnect from my phone on its own and then stopped connecting all together . In addition , it is n't that comfortable to wear for a long period of time .	-1
Hello , Since I am the tech guy at the homestead , I am not the user but hear everything wrong about something when I get it for my wife ( sound familiar guys ? ) I bought this in spring 2012 , she used it for two months and liked it and had no complaints about it , I was her hero ! But by June it was dead-o-roonie and I was in the dog house again ! Any-hoo I was asked to purchase again . I felt the Motorola name that came along with 900+ reviews was enough to make this a good purchase never mind the price under twenty bux ? I know , I know , what do you expect for such a low price point ? Alot , something that works for a year or more and it seems so did 900+ other buyers . Well , I am onto the Motorola H730 , everyone is abuzzin ' about that one also , and I will try it for my ever lovin ' , and see if I can be her hero again for a few months or more ? I am quite sure this unit is out of warranty , but if any of you literature readers know about the warranty of this item . Post it here ? Thanks in advance .	-1
The sound is horrible ... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel . And I bought two , to have in case the BT ran down ... . poor me ... .. And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too . No noise cancellation worth a d*mn ... forget about using it when driving a car ... . I am trying to find a new one ...	-1
Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone , the ear bud is too big , uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear . After two weeks of use , the on/off switch stopped working , and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit . In sum , it was a waste of money . There was no provision in this review for `` 0 '' stars , so I gave it `` 1 ''	-1
I do n't see what others have liked about this . It does n't add any value -- does n't make the phone easier to carry or use , does n't add significant protection , or do anything else . I 'd recommend getting a pouch with a slide-on clip , that holds the phone horizontally on your belt or waistband .	-1
This was my first clamshell phone , and I like that aspect of the phone , but that 's about it . It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones ( all Nokia bar type ) in the same coverage areas . The biggest issue is definitely the battery . I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days . This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE . I do n't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds , but it is extremely frustrating . Also , I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness ( or lack thereof ) of the menus , but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time . I wo n't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS : POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS : Looks goodCompact	-1
Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died . Constant lockups , requiring the removal of the battery to reboot even after doing a firmware update , made me return this to amazon . Will wait for the new sony .	-1
****UPDATED on OCT. 18 , 2010*sigh*I really tried to make this work for me but it just is not worth the hassle . As previously speculated , I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit . I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that , more often than not , my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call . My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden . Maybe I did n't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and could n't find one . Maybe mine was defective , I 'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth . In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73 % off but still $ 40 ( orig $ 150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold ) and it comes with its own chargeable case . Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges ! Other colors are a bit more . Check that one out if you wear glasses . It fits into the ear , not over the top , so I am hoping for a better fit . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *I was expecting more after reading the reviews.Let me first say that the sound quality is excellent . Sent myself a voice-mail while rolling the windows up and down on the freeway without an appreciable loss of sound quality ! Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from `` all windows up '' and `` driver/passenger window down. '' HOWEVER ... . I wear glasses and have a rounder face . It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on . The bulky part does n't sit well on my glasses ' frame . The mouthpiece is not adjustable . I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face . Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same . The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving . The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit . I turn it on before I place it on my ear . Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame . I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update . If it does n't work well for me I 'm sure one of my kids will like it . ( I ended up returning it . See above ) Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place .	-1
This headset generally works , though there was times I needed to re-pair it . My problems with it that are:1 ) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough , but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2 ) It 's big ! It 's comfy enough on your ear , but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it , its hard to get out of your pocket.3 ) Flashing blue light is way too bright ! When is dark and I 'm in the car , I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly . It disturbed my passengers too.4 ) Wind tolerance - it 's better than my H700 , but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I 'm sending mine back and getting another H700 .	-1
As many people complained , I found this headset 's microphone was very weak . The other person can not hear me at all . So I contacted Plaintronics for repair . Their repair process has no tracking , just sending in your headset to an address . Two weeks later , I received a used one back , not the one I sent in , packaged in an OEM box . Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in , it battery is not very reliable to hold charge , also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all .	-1
This is my second voyager 510 . The first one I had was great , but the charge was n't lasting anymore , so I ordered this as a replacement ... .very disappointed with the clarity of the unit . Lots of static in the background on my end . People on other end do n't seem to hear it , so I just deal with it .	-1
I do n't know if it 's just me , but every time I buy a blue-tooth it 's only great for a couple of months . Read the reviews and was excited but slowly performance diminished .	-1
I had Jabra when it first came out , its battery stopped charging after 10 months . So I got this one as a replacement , it too stopped charging after a year . This is the problem with all BT earpieces , its battery is not replaceable which can be done if the industry wants to . They make more money by selling the whole unit vs we pay 5-10 dollars to replace battery . This kind of practice is not sustainable . I 'm now back to the wired headset .	-1
I bought this to pair with a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone , and have been disappointed.1 ) Sound and voice quality are fine , but this thing is way too sensitive to wind . I ca n't use it outside if there is any wind current , and even the air currents from my car 's AC or heat are too much for it.2 ) Most disappointingly , the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days . I am working with Plantronics ' warranty department , but they need a `` date code , '' which is unreadable without a magnifying glass . I will update once I have some resolution.3 ) This device only works for the Ericsson 's phone functions , not music , because the Walkman music functions use the `` A2DP '' Bluetooth protocol , and the 510 is not A2DP compatible . ( Yes , listening to music with just one earpiece could be lame , but I would love to have podcasts on my phone ) . For A2DP , you need something like the Jabra 8010 or 8040.4 ) Contrary to some reviewers , I did n't have any problem using this with glasses . It 's a little heavy , but basically fine .	-1
This was great for the first 2 months . Month 3 , it started dropping calls . By month 4 , it was dropping more calls than it was answering . I replaced it with another bluetooth , because I could n't take it anymore . I would n't recommend this . I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks , no problems as of yet .	-1
i bought this one because of the excellent review , however , after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days , i 'm quite disappointed . The sound quality is ok , sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time . i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one , and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this . then there is the usability issue too , sometimes i hear the phone ringing , and pushed the button to accept the call and it would n't connect right away , had to wait several seconds to establish the link , the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem .	-1
I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to . Some heard the echo worse than the others , but all heard it . Some heard every word they said repeated back to them nearly as loud as my voice . Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back !	-1
If you wear glasses most of the time like I do , this headset will not be comfortable for you . In fact , I could n't keep it on without constantly adjusting it . So the sound was not good . I sent it back for a Sony over-the-head headset .	-1
I bought this because of all the positive reviews and was surprised when it was not very good but Plantronics does not support my cell phone the Treo 755P . It would have been nice to know this from the web site prior to purchasing . I love the sound quality of the Jawbone but it does not fit me-and many others.The hunt continues and Plantronics says it does not have any bluetooth headsets for the 755P ! Caveat emptor !	-1
