Useful little items . Allows setting up air hoses in customized ways . Fits standard air line tubing just fine . Worth getting .	1
I thought they were pricey but so worth it when it comes to needed aquarium parts ! Work very well for connections .	1
Very good quality and enough of each to accommodate any situation . I like the fact that the kit gives you flexibility to do many different options with your air bubbler for you aquarium . Good job putting this together . I recommend this kit to friend and family .	1
Timing in shipment was great , product worked all functioned and was worth it all round nice experience and worth the risk it comes to the door .	1
Package come from the Republic of China , so it did take a while to get to me , about four weeks . I needed the connectors to re-hose my 120 gallon aquarium to two new air pumps and 4 stone bubble makers . The connectors worked as they were intended to , no complaints . The price was not bad either . If you are doing a project similar to what I was doing and have time to wait , then I would recommend this product .	1
I purchased these plastic air tube connectors for use with CO2 systems on two of my planted aquariums.The plastic air tube inserts have enabled me to create a quick release system which is easy to use , and this allows the PH levels in my planted aquariums to maintain their stability.They allow me to remove a pressurized CO2 tank or DIY CO2 generator and replace them with a newly charged DIY CO2 generator before the PH can rise . I use a DIY CO2 system on one aquarium , and a pressurized CO2 system on the other.However , when the pressurized CO2 tank runs out , I replace it with a DIY CO2 generator until I have the time to get the pressurized tank refilled.If you own or are considering setting up a planted tank , these plastic air tube inserts can make the endeavor much easier for you.This is a good product for the price .	1
Works to split and connect airline tubing . Nice , tight fit . No fear they will slip off over time . Great price .	1
I have three fish tanks ... hey ... I once had 27 ... when you buy an air pump you sometimes get a t connector , especially if it is a two outlet . I thought I had one in my trail mix bag of fish tank stuff , but it was cracked . I wanted to join two older pumps to run one air stone and thereby get a few more years out of them and this was a good deal . I now have a supply of airline connectors to add extra line or split/join lines . They fit my regular tubing just fine , if you have silicone tubing you might end up using a cable tie to snug the fit . Airline tubing tends to get hard and stiff where it connects to the pump over time and inline connectors are very handy for adding a new section of fresh tubing without going all the way to the air stone or other air powered accessory . Fast delivery and a good price . I would have had to go to the next city over to get them otherwise .	1
Good product . Used it to make a bubble wall in my aquarium with a few air stones . Fits standard air tubes .	1
As a hobbyist who has been keeping fish for over 30 years , I 've learned there are small essentials that can make all the difference to the beauty and health of your aquariums without spending a fortune . Airline Tube connectors are one such product.Perfect for joining a two outlet pump into one ultra powerful stream of air , running a multitude of air stones and air wands . Splitting connections to run more than one tank and so on . Not to mention these are critical for aquascaping with air and help you to do a better job saturating your water with oxygen.I 've some reviewers complain that the airline tubing is the same diameter as the connectors - that 's the way it 's supposed to be . If your tubing is difficult to fit simply run the end of the airline under hot water for a minute and viola an effortless connection.At this price , pick up a few packs , from your current tanks , to quarantine and hospital tanks you 'll be surprised at just how handy these little gizmos are to have around .	1
Fits standard airline tubing , does the job . It 's a bit tough to fit them into the tubing , but it holds .	1
Can anyone really rate a product like this ? ? ? They work , I 've never had one leak and they are cheap ... If you cut them up with a razor blade , they are often the perfect adapter , when you unwrap a treasure chest , or some other aquarium air toy and find out they have some weird sized tubing your supposed to connect to your regular airline tubing ... . You should always have a few of these laying around somewhere ...	1
Since I have a toy breed , ( Yorkshire ) I asked my vet before administering and he advised 1/2 a wafer per day based on his weight and small size.My dog loves them and took to them very well , so I imagine they are very palatable since he tends to be quite fussy.They are hard little discs , just a little larger than a Tums tablet.There are 90 per bottle.They assist a dog 's mental development , stamina and immunity.Helping maintain your dogs hearing , vision and sense of smell.Along with a sensible , appropriate diet , these vitamin and mineral supplements should ensure your dog 's nutritional status.My dog has had no problems while on these supplements and accepts them as a treat or reward and actually looks forward to having them.Based on what I 've read and my dog 's response , it seems to be a great vitamin for dogs .	1
I give these to my dog ( ruby Cavalier King Charles ) as treats , because I usually do n't remember to give them to him regularly as vitamins . I 'm not one to worry much about pet supplements beyond normal dog food and the occasional table scrap / dog treat , but do like the idea of specially formulated pet vitamins.My dog was runt of the litter , has an overbite , and honks ( backwards sneezing , some call it ) when he gets too excited , so I guess it 's good for him to get a little extra nutrition in there occasionally.These smell weird , but the bottom line is ... he likes them . If nothing else , these make a ( supposedly ) extra-healthy dog treat . My dog goes on runs / bike rides with me , so if these do indeed help with canine athletic performance , I 'm sure he appreciates them .	1
I do n't have a canine athlete , just an overweight lab mix . When he ate these wafers nothing magical happened . He just wanted more . He loves to snack . The wafers are small and round , sort of the size of a quarter . He did n't get energetic or anything . Same old dog I know and dog . If you have a hunting dog or athletic dog , it might make a difference . I ca n't verify any of these claims with my dog.They are not cheap but you get 90 in a container and you can feed your dog 2 a day . Give it a try and see how your dog reacts .	1
We have been giving these vitamins to our English Setter for nearly a month now . He is a very active and energetic dog , so we felt he would benefit from taking these SportDOG Canine Athlete C9 Performance Vitamins . He is constantly moving around like a Jack Russell Terrier on steroids . We can tell he likes the taste of these vitamins because he chews them up and he looks forward to getting one each day . I will update this review at the end of the 3 months ( 90 day supply ) and let you know more.UPDATE : We discontinued giving these to our English Setter becuase they seemed to give him TOO MUCH energy . He was already wired and seemed to be in overdrive with these vitamins . We started our Greman Shepard on the vitamins and they are working very nicely with her . She has started showing more energy and is more `` frisky '' . She recently had surgery and these vitamins have seemed to help her in her recovery as well .	1
First time I have ever tried this brand , but I like it . I give my dog a vitamin ever day and these are easy to give and my dog will eat them without any coaxing . I like the ingredients and will continue to buy and give them to him .	1
Living in Florida , this seemed like it may be a good idea for my four-legged friends . Although they are both indoor dogs , they also spend a good amount of time outside in play or exercise throughout the day . One in particular has low heat tolerance due to some old medical issues from before his rescue days.This came well packed with moisture pack . Easy to open and a comfortable convenient container that is people friendly . I gave one tablet to each dog while acting like it was a treat . The first/older dog gingerly took it like he does all treats then gave me a look like `` huh ? '' but chewed it up and ate it . The second/younger dog promptly spit it out and only went back once she realized the first was eyeing it.Day # 2 they both responded a bit better and ate their new `` treat '' without question but without the enthusiasm of their normal treats . I get the distinct feeling they are not excited by the flavor.Day # 3 and beyond - they eat their vitamin `` treats '' without question but also without gusto . As for any notable difference on the dogs it is hard to tell as it is still early . To date , I have not noticed any difference in heat tolerance of my older dog - of course , it has been near 100 degrees every day with very high humidity so every living creature including pet parents is totally wiped out by the temperature .	1
My sister 's 3 dogs recently tried the SportDog vitamins . The instructions say 1 wafer per adult dog up to 60 pounds . That was helpful because our household has a 10 pound Rat Terrier , a 20 pound Beagle , and a 40 pound Basset Hound . The `` wafers '' are actually round tablets like chewable `` Alka-Seltzer '' looking tablets . Each container holds 90 tablets . At 3 dogs in the house , the container will last us a month . When opening the container , you can definitely smell the tablets and they do not smell that great . The dogs did n't seem to care . They ate them . The Beagle gets a similar tablet as a daily treatment for health issues in her old age . She does not like the medicine and often picks it out of her dinner even though they are chewable stand alone pills . She was the only one a bit hesitant to eat this vitamin , maybe as it seems so similar to her medicine . She did take it in the end and finished it off . The container states `` easy-to-use wafers assist in physical and mental development , energy , stamina , and immunity '' . There is a list of ingredients included , but the print is too small for me to read exactly what is in them . Overall , a small size treat , easily given on a daily bases as extra nutritional aide . I 'm sure our dogs will have no trouble finishing them off over the next month .	1
so its kind of hard to tell about things like these.we usually only take our lab , and not both dogs hiking . we ll do 7 mile jog/hike no problem and our lab will keep up . some water and hes good to go . some treats during our rest time help him too.se we gave him some and well - he kept going.i cant give it 1 star and i cant give it 5 stars . only my dog knows.i mean he didnt have an allergic reaction to it.. and kept on truckin with us.i guess only time will tell .	1
Six dogs here ; they all love these vitamins . The product is marketed to canine athletes ; my dogs get a fair amount of leashed exercise but are n't competing in anything but couch time.I 've long thought that the perfect pharmaceutical for me would be a pill that made me love exercise as much as my dogs do . These doggie vitamins come close , giving my dogs ( who eat a medium grade of dogfood ) extra energy and life . I do NOT give the vitamins if I know we wo n't be able to get out for a few days -- I do n't need that much energy when they have to be in the yard or on the couch . Everyone in this pack has a short coat and I ca n't see any difference in the amount of time I 've been feeding the supplement . ) On the downside , the bottle I received has the worst label of any supplement I have ever used . Tiny white text on lime green background is ILLEGIBLE ! ! ! ! I do not know what 's in this stuff ! The warning said , `` do not give to cats and other ruminants ... '' Huh ? Cats and ruminants ? I had to get a magnifying glass out to see that the word was `` cattle ... '' , not cats . In my 1.75 reading glasses , in good light , the guaranteed analysis reads , something calcium phosphorus , etc etc and so forth . If I did n't know what was likely to be there , I could n't tell anything.\If you 're feeding a top-line dogfood , I do n't know if these tablets would make a visible difference . With an illegible ingredient list , it 's impossible to know which of the components is something my dogs do n't get enough of in their regular food.The dose is one wafer for up to 60 pounds ; that seemed a bit broad a range . My 30 # gets half and the aging Chihuahua gets 1/4 tablet . YMMV .	1
I know these are vitamins , but my dog considers them treats , and she loves them . After a month and a half , she 's got more spring in her step , and her coat is shinier . I 'll be buying these for her again .	1
I have an Akita mix that is about 7 years old and a black lab that is pressing on 13 years . I have been supplementing both of their diets to address hip and joint pain . These performance vitamins may not be specifically designed for aging dog 's needs , but I have found that they seem to be feeling better when I give them one on a daily basis . Both of them eat them readily . I will continue to use SportDog products as they seem to be quality made .	1
I already give my dog , a 1-year old cocker spaniel , supplements . He gets fish oil for his coat and probiotics for digestive health . I 'm happy to add a multi-vitamin to his regimen . He seems to like it , too . I give this product five stars because my dog takes to them readily and eats them up without hesitation . It 's a big brown wafer and it does n't smell that great in my opnion but the dog likes it . It actually took him longer to accept his probiotics than this product . There are 90 wafers and will last a long time if you have a smaller dog and you have to break it up and give them a smaller dose . I give mine a full wafer , every 2 days . I think this can will last me a year.Just like in people , you ca n't see a big dramatic difference physically when you take vitamins . You have to just take them regularly and have faith that the supplements will help keep you healthy . Anyway , I definitely recommend if you want to add vitamins to your dogs diet . Hooray for healthy happy dogs !	1
I 'm very pleased with the effectiveness of these C9 wafers . They are easy to give to the dogs . I have two very small dogs and they get half wafers and the big dog gets a whole one per dose.One of my little dogs has an obesity problem so I 've cut back her food and these wafers supplement her diet . It seems to have worked and she waits for her wafer as a treat.I 've particularly noticed that the big dog looks brighter in the eyes , after a week or so , and she does n't groan so much as she used to . As I have changed nothing else in her diet , the C9 must be reponsible for the positive change.I do n't think this is snake oil -- it 's really packed with vitamins and minerals and the dogs love to eat them . I used to have hunting dogs ( setters , labs , coondogs , and beagles ) and if I still did , I would definitely supplement their diet with C9 wafers.Highly recommended !	1
I have a older Chihuahua who is missing many of his teeth and chewing on harder food can sometime be a trouble for him but he has no problem finishing off these wafers that are about as round as a quarter but a bit thicker . He and my other dog ( a poodle mix that will eat anything that goes near her mouth ) ate these vitamins right up without hesitation . As for the health benefits , there has been no noticeable change in either of my dogs after a couple weeks of use , but on the flip side there has been no negative effects either . One small drawback is the wafer odor , which kind of smells like some human vitamins , does stay on your hand for a while after giving to your dogs .	1
We have an American Water Spaniel that hunts once or twice a week during the season . It is HARD work for a dog , and any dog that is about to work hard should NOT be fed prior . We worried about her , and then found these . After doing some research , I ca n't stress enough how important these are for dogs about to work hard and long . And she loves them ! So glad to have these .	1
I have 3 dogs and 2 of those are quite elderly , and they love these ! No hesitation in taking them in chomping them down , and they are picky about some things . The results of now taking a vitamin since they were not before are not evident after only a week , but I will update my review in a couple of months to see if they seem to have more energy and/or better looking coat . With 2 of my dogs being border collies and very active , if this seems to make a difference , it would definitely be something I would order again .	1
I have a 4 year old Shar-pei who is almost constantly by my side . He is not a hunting dog but he loves long walks and adventures through wooded areas . I put this supplement in his water to keep him hydrated , especially when the weather is hot . It has a smell and taste ( yes I tasted it ) like beef broth which the dog enjoys . I have had no problems using this product and recommend it for active dogs . The main drawback , like another commenter said , was the price . It is a bit steep .	1
Many dogs are prone to heat prostration . Limiting outdoor time for these dogs is of vital importance.English Bulldogs , Chow Chows , pugs , puppies , over weight dogs are very susceptive to heat stroke . Over exposure to sunlight or high heat is very risky to your dog 's life.SportDOG Canine Hydration helps keep your dog 's body fluids in a normal range , however , this ca n't prevent dogs from heat prostration . Keeping the dog supervised or indoors in extreme weather is the only preventative . This product also antioxidants for before and after exercise periods.SportDOG is a great supplement for hunting and sporting dogs .	1
I hope that title caught your eye ! One canister comes with 17 individual stick packets that dissolve in 12 oz of water . I took all 3 dogs on a long walk and it got rather warm . Almost too warm . I brought along my own water bottle . Half way through the walk , I mixed up one stick in 12 oz of water and offered it to them in my travel bowl . The 2 less finicky dogs drank it with gusto and I had to slow them down and limit them since it was hot and I did n't want them to over drink so fast . The other dog rarely drinks on a walk , and chose not to drink any . The powder dissolves into the water and makes it an off tan color . It also has a slight smell to it , not bad , but it is there . I wondered if the smell was an issue for the 3rd dog . At the end of the walk , I offered more and again the 2 drank and the 3rd chose plain water . At home , there was yet a small amount left and when offered again , the 3rd dog drank it readily . Go figure . I could n't really tell if it was helpful to them , but it did not hurt them . None got sick and I 'd use it again . I think the flavor was encouraging to the 2 and it was good to see them drink on the walk and after , so readily .	1
So , I shared some with my friend - for her dog suffers more hydration issues - and she said that her dog loved it . She went to her bowl , drank her fill , and then went back to it when she was ready ; however , within that day , the mix had molded . So ( though the package had n't specifically said anything ) it is probably wise to refrigerate what the dog does n't drink the first time . The packets apparently are n't hard to mix at all . Great idea and very portable with several packets in one container . *Warning : there is a bit of a smell/unpleasant aroma to the drink mixture , but that is probably for the dog 's sake , to appeal for the dog ( not the unpleasant aroma , but just it smelling like liver/meat/etc . ) and not for humans . *Other than the stench , there is n't hardly anything negative I have to say ( thus far . )	1
We have 3 coonhounds ( 2 Walker and 1 Black & Tan ) which we hunt competitively and one which we show in bench shows . This is just the thing for hunting in the humid weather or keeping your dog from looking gaunt at the bench shows . One of our other dogs got a bad case of Whipworms we added this to his water after his wormer treatments to help him keep hydrated since he had diarrhea for awhile while getting rid of the worms.This is a powder which you add to your dogs water . I guess it 's sort of a Powerade-type of supplement for dogs that keeps them from dehydrating and gives them more energy . This has worked great for our dogs . When the hounds check in when they ca n't pick up a track we already have this premixed into their water . It seems like they do n't drink as much water when we add this to it.Though , I really like this for keeping your dog from looking gaunt if he was stressed out on the way to the bench show . So , far it 's working well.The only negative is that if you have many dogs like we do there 's only 17 packets in the container and that could get very expensive . That 's why we only use it for the show/hunting dogs or if a dog has diarrhea.I 'm not sure how practical or cost effective this would be for every dog owner , but for working/sporting dogs that do work it sure ca n't hurt .	1
First time that I 've tried this product . Works great . Easy to install and easy to clean . I highly recommend this product .	1
If you have a external power filter on your tank , this filter will help keep the bacterial balance in your tank . It is very easy to maintain and very easy to clean . Just use some water from your tank and squeeze the filter several times to remove the waste and return to the tank . DO NOT rise under tap water , it will kill the bacterial process and cause the filter to have to start over . It is very handy to keep around to seed a new tank and start the bacterial process	1
Highly recommend this sponge filter , this type of filter is great for fry as they wont get pulled into the filter .	1
I had one of these running in my sump for a couple months . When it was time to set up a nursery tank for the fry , I just moved the sponge to the new tank , and the tank was instantly cycled . They 're also great with battery operated air pumps during power outages .	1
We have a 37 gallon that has many tetras and a few livebearers , as well as a small pod of cory cats . The backfilter we purchased was different than our normal brand and we have not been happy . However , we have not purchased the new one yet and wanted something to really increase the filtration in the tank . We were reviewing old video we had transferred to DVD and we saw our 125 Gallon fish tank . It was gorgeous , full to capacity , and filtered by filters JUST LIKE THESE . So we got this one.This has a weighted base and has so far stayed down completely . The airhose was easy to attach to the top.We noticed a difference in the water quality right away . We got some nice new plants to cover the filter and you would never even know it was there.I will report back in a month or two if there are any problems . But this has been working very well so far .	1
The filter works fine and keeps my fishbowl water nice and clear . The only problem I have had with it is that when you put it into your tank it expands to about twice the stated size and therefore takes up a lotof room in my small tank . It works great though so I do recommend it .	1
I 'm using one of these in a 55 gallon tank as a prefilter on a canister filter . Like another review has said , it does not seem to be quite as well-built as the Filter-Max pre-filters , but it 's good enough.There is a large round weight on the bottom that helps to keep it in place in the tank.Pay attention to the size : This is big enough to completely fill one corner of a 20 gallon tank . If your fish are already a little cramped , get a smaller filter .	1
thought was bigger but it looks like a 20 gallon size . works great for my breeding . Recommend this product =P	1
When we were waiting for our Mini-dashund to be old enough to come home I did a lot of research on foods and things for him . The breeder had him on a food called Life Abundance- which though better than grocery , I wasnt impressed . That and the fact it 's 20 bucks plus shipping for an 8 lb bag and it shipped . I call it the Avon of dog food . Good stuff but I can find it cheaper at the store . I went with Welnees small breed puppy , its ingredient list is really good . At first Fenways stools where soft but as we went through our first bag and transitioned completely into the new food , it was the breeder food casuing the diarhea . I will keep him on Wellness despite the price , though I am going to try the regular Just for Puppy . According to the bag 's ingredience the only real different is the size of the kibble and I read reviews that someone was feeding it to a morkie so I imagine its not going to be an issue for my 4.2 lb pup .	1
This brand of dry puppy food is just what she needs . My puppy is only a couple of months old and she loves eating this food . Her stools are also consistent and solid .	1
I got my puppy from a breeder at 8 weeks and had to switch out her food . She had no issues with switching over . No diarrhea and she started eating it right away .	1
Since I was told by our personal dog trainer in 2010 about Wellness products all of our ( 6 ) Schnauzers are onWellness.We have have found through trial and error Amazon is the best place to purchase the Wellnessproducts and most everything else we purchase . The most consistent thing is FRESHNESS we have beento the high dollar pet stores in our area there are the two most well known through advertisements we havebeen to several locations . Check the dates for expiration ... if it was not out of date it will soon will be in a month.Amazon order arrives and the date is a 6 months to a year until expired . We all check freshness from Milk to meatswe purchase for our family . So sure we be mindful when buying food for our pets to us there is no difference .	1
My dog was losing weight because she is so picky and I was resorting to feeding her people food . Got this today and she went straight for it and finished every bit . Mixed with Wellness wet and it 's perfect .	1
I would buy this product again and they had great delivery time . The ingredediance are very wholesome for myYorkee 's and they seem to be doing quite well eating it . Thanx Jim	1
They dog did great on this as he was a puppy and needed the nutrition in puppy food . The pieces were small enough for him to eat . No problems with development .	1
I bought this brand as it looks like everything she needs is in it . I mix it with ground cooked turkey 93 % lean to give her a good diet experience .	1
Best dog food out of all in my opinion , and my vet visits are perfect , because my vet compliments me on my dog physical wellbeing .	1
I am raising three chihuahuas at the moment and as of week-7 they are finally on an all kibble diet of just this and their poops are perfect and their breath has improved and they love it ! Buying this off Amazon is definitely the cheapest and easiest way ! I did my research on the best food for chihuahuas and what exactly was in each brand and Wellness really is a great choice for you dog . I want mine to live as long as possible and I feel confident they will with a diet of Wellness !	1
I have a 12 week Havanese . She eats the food okay , but does n't seem to LOVE it . I think she eats it just because she 's hungry . I buy it because it is a nutritionally sound product and it is for a & # 34 ; small breed & # 34 ; puppy . Vet says my pup has an underbite and recommends that she continue to eat food that are produced for smaller breeds .	1
My two chihuahuas love this food . When I just had one chihuahua , she barely put a dent in the bag . Our new puppy is a total pig , though . This bag lasted us three months ! Save your money and buy the smaller bag more frequently . The food stays fresh when I buy the smaller bag . The seal does n't work too well on this bag . I fill a Rubbermaid cereal container with the food anyways for easier dispensing . I am going to buy smaller bags In the future since there is no need to spend this much . The food is excellent quality . Since RAW is out of the question for us , this is the next best thing .	1
My 2 year old shihpoo has eaten this food since she was 8 weeks old . She is now on the adult small breed Wellness and she has the softest coat I have ever felt . My new shihpoo puppy is now eating this and he loves it . I have had no problems with soft stools or gas or vomiting . When I had my very first dog when I was younger , I would just buy pedigree from the grocery store and she ended up dying of cancer at a young age . Do n't know if her diet was the main cause , but years later when I purchased my current dog , I decided to research the dog food and realized how awful the grocery store dog food was . My dogs will always be on this food and I feel good about giving this to them . It 's more expensive but it 's so worth it . The dogs do n't eat as much if their getting good quality food so I guess the cost evens out . I highly recommend Wellness or something similar . *something I 've noticed since getting this bag of food online *My new puppy eats the wellness puppy and my 2 yr old eats wellness adult . My older dog always wants to eat the puppy food too . My vet said it tastes better but may just make her a bit chunky cuz of the extra calories . This has been going on for a couple months so do n't think it 's , ohh I want what he 's eating , anymore . Since opening this bag of puppy food that I ordered , I normally go to Petco or Petsmart , the dogs will not eat it . Instead they both want to eat the adult food . It made me think maybe something was wrong with it . The bag looks brand new and was sealed and its not expired . Anyone else ? Maybe my dogs are just being weird . Thanks !	1
I just started with this new food for my Chihuahua rat terrier puppy . I got some samples first from the company and was sent the Super5Mix and the Core puppy food . I ended up buying the Super5Mix since it is for small breed and my puppy tends to chew it easier and seems to like it better than the Core . I have noticed though that since feeding this food he 's poop is very hard and small compared to the other food he was eating , which were Prairie and Purina Pro Plan .	1
I read the entire ingredient list on the back and I may not know everything about dog/puppy food , but my dog acts much more energized and happy when she eats this food regularly .	1
My dog loves the taste and you can definitely see the benefits of feeding it to her - shiny coat and healthy skin . No allergy issues and it keeps her fit and trim . Just wish they offered it in a larger size .	1
Okay maybe she would rather subsist on her real favorite foods like bananas and strawberries . That is n't going to happen . So instead she gets this small breed dry dog food by Wellness . The small bites make her meals less dramatic as she does n't need to walk away from her bowl each time to show that she needs to chew the big dog biscuits . Less crumbs all over the kitchen .	1
I have 7 dogs . All various breeds and sizes . I was looking for a brand without additives that all my dogs would benefit from . I have a few that need to lose weight . Wellness makes the best product . I buy the small bites for my little ones ... .pieces are small and they love it . I but the Healthy weightCORE for my `` dieters '' and mix it with canned green beans or peas and carrots . So far my Golden , who was an overweight rescue at 129 pounds , has lost 19 pounds -- she 's been on this food for about 7 months . I buy the original CORE version for my baby bulldog , who had a lot of gas . No more smells and ripples in the night ! Amazon has the best price for Wellness . And its shipped right to my home -- no lugging big bags back and forth . Yes , it 's more expensive than the other stuff -- but it really works . And that will cut down on future vet bills . All my dogs are healthy and have nice shiny coats . Priceless ! Wellness now has a SIMPLE version for those dogs who suffer with food allergies . A family member has a little Teddy Bear with severe skin issues -- she 'd scratch until raw and bloody . She switched to the SIMPLE version of Wellness and has been itch free ever since . Again ... great brand !	1
I have a chihuahua who is 12lbs . She is very solid and her frame can support the weight but I thought maybe if she could trim down a bit , I could keep her healthy a little longer . I was able ( lots of hard work keeping others from feeding her ! ! ) to get her down to 10.6lbs . I fed all three of my dogs this and at first they were fine with it but after a few months , they grew tired of this food . My dogs are super picky and do not want anything for too long so I mix this food with other weight management food .	1
we will see on the 13th weigh in day if they lost anything , I always buy wellness dog food for them , they weighed in not gaining so that was good and the smaller one loves the small kibbles over the purple bag wellness and the other one will eat anything but noticed she coat has stayed , very soft days after her bath with putting a little creme rinse as the vet said to do , so far so good	1
I started to by this food when I read the reviews on pet food advisor . My dogs like it and is small enough for them to eat it without a problem . I have this food on auto order . I noticed that I was only reviewing things when I was disappointed . So I am trying to review when I have been happy with a product .	1
we accidental bought the healthy weight version of this brand for small breed and for some reason she would not eat it , so we got the regular version and she is fine now , our little iggy loves her food . I see this is the food for dogs that need to keep a healthy weight or loose weight . our dog loves this brand of dog food though	1
My three Dachshunds are thriving on these kibbles . Their weight is good , their coats are shiny , and they are active . Especially happy with the weight stabilization since switching to this product . Highly recommend .	1
While on prednisone for his allergies , my JRT gained some weight . I bought this to help him get back to his ideal weight . It 's too soon to tell if it works in that regard , but I like the ingredient list , and my dog will actually eat this food . That 's no small feat , as he 's very picky .	1
my dogs loved them and they are way cheaper than at the pet stores . They smelled fresh and Came very quick	1
I might have a dog with a less than discriminating palate ( she wo n't eat mushrooms..or nylabone brand treats , but those are too much like the dreaded 'toys ' for her liking ) , but she does have her favorites.Pegetables have long been one of her best treats , and I have not always been able to find them for sale ( for example they are at a 'big box pet store that does not end in 'co ' , but not on the main aisle of treats , but on the bottom shelf of a different aisle ) . In any case , after a couple years missing these , I found them again , and my old girl started dancing in excitement when she spotted them.On the other hand , I now have a Spanish Greyhound ( galgo ) who is in the process of learning how to be a pet -- she has n't quite figured out the greenies , Pegetables or the Nylabone Healthy Edibles . However , she did carry the pseudo-celery to her bed and curled up around it , which was a start . However , the galgo is not really a good barometer for treats -- she only snarfs down anything that is clearly dog food or human food or something in the trash . Like Jackie , she is puzzled by toys , but also by compressed food-like products in general.Galgo aside , the Greyhound adores these and the treat ( USA made ) is worthy of her short list of favorites.Highly Recommendedby the real JTG	1
Dogs love it and good for their teeth .	1
Rexie recoils from dog food , all 4 and 5 star kibble and canned ! ! I am not sure what to do about making sure he is getting adequate nutrition since he eats steak , lamb and chicken and a few extra supplements and snacks . If anyone knows of a dog vitamin/mineral supplement that is really complete for a 10 lb dog , let me know . I have tried Solid Gold powder which he loves , but it is only to be used with a balanced diet and not really complete . Others say the same thing when I call .	1
My dogs absolutely love these . They always arrive on schedule and fresh in their sealed package . If your dog loves to eat vegetables they 'll love these .	1
My newest rescue Shetie mix Bella is around 26 lbs but had many teeth removed at the puppy mill in Lancaster , Pa , so she is able to eat this dog food much easier because of it 's small size .	1
My small Yorkie is missing some teeth and has a little trouble eating large size kibble . He has not problem eating this food and loves the taste .	1
We bought this for my mother 's shih tzu , who is a very picky eater . He is actually overweight because he will only eat fatty , unhealthy snacks . He seemed to enjoy this compared with other kibble . He is a 5yo red shih tzu , and his color faded since puppyhood . We thought that was just natural with age . His coat was also dull and not as smooth . However , after one bag , his color returned vibrantly , and his fur became soft and lustrous again . We were thrilled and knew it had to be this kibble since nothing else changed . The only issue is he does have gluten sensitivity , which is common to the breed . This is not gluten free . It has a combination of oatmeal , barley , and rye flour , which contain gluten . His skin and eye allergies did not really improve with this , so she now mixes it with Wellness simple to temper some of the allergies .	1
My chihuahuas do better on this food than any others , and i 've tried Blue for small breeds , and CORE from Wellness , and Iams , and Science Diet , etc ... .. all of them ... they eat this consistently and they never get sick from it as they did with Blue especially . Not to mention , their coats are amazingly shiny , soft and healthy .	1
I purchased this for our small Maltese because another heavily grained based dog food was making him sick . I spent many hours researching dry dog food and this is equal to Blue Buffalo . After using Wellness Small Breed , my dog is healthy again and does n't have reoccurring UTI 's . I highly recommend this for small breed dogs .	1
My picky chihuahuan is very fond of this Wellness Healthy Weight small breed kibble . I do mix a bit of a canned food , usually Newman 's Own chicken and turkey , along with it . He has done very well on this combination .	1
Actually tried this when there was so much dog food contamination in my area . My little White Chinese Crested Powder Puff really loves this food and it has been the best for this picky little eater . Would highly recommend it for safety and for a 5 paw vote !	1
This is a high quality food for dogs . My dogs turn their noses up at most foods but will eat this food every time ! The kibble is small and shaped in triangles , so it 's truly the perfect size for their little mouths . Our vet approved of our choice of foods . We sometimes mix a bit of Wellness Core for small breeds in with the Wellness Healthy Weight just for variety .	1
Kona has one of those pop-up cubes and absolutely loves that thing ( it 's basically falling apart after a few weeks though - he tends to jump on it ) so we figured this would be just as fun and hopefully hold up better.He was n't too interested at first but now he hides out in it and loves to drag his toys in there when he catches them . The tube seems like it 'll hold up well .	1
My cat loves this cat chute , she runs thru it several times a day , my only complaint is it did not light upafter the batterys were installed but that wwas really no big deal , she likes playing in it .	1
We have another chute same size , just not with the lights , and we connected the two . The cats did not seem interested at first . Our more playful female was the first to enjoy it , just sitting inside . Within a month , both young cats loved it . They love to run through at top speed , stalk each other inside it , and love to keep their toys inside . Despite pretty heavy use , the lights are still blinking after two months .	1
I bought this around the time that I got my youngest cat . My older cat , 9 years , was kind of meh about it , but still played around in it . The younger cat , 6 months old at the time , thought it was the greatest thing ever . He would jump from one end to another . The little cut-out hole in the middle is great ; it lets the cats stalk each other.I think after about 10 months or so I noticed that part of the tunnel was bent ( there 's some sort of wire inside that keeps its form ) and the lights were no longer working . The batteries may need to be replaced , but I have n't worried about it , as it 's the crinkly noise that really does it for the little cat more than the lights.This thing really is worth it .	1
I can not say enough good things about this Twinkle Chute tunnel ! I looked at the price and I thought , no toy is worth that amount . Yet I knew that Oliver had a passion for going in and out of paper bags , or things that crinkled , or under the sheets.First of all , this is a three-foot-long tunnel with an 8 1/2 '' x 5 '' hole in the middle of it for a cat to climb in and out of , and it has twinkling lights that can be turned on and off . It is made of an irresistible material that makes a crinkling sound when your cat runs through the tunnel or jumps on top of the tunnel . The tunnel is 10 inches in diameter . It is `` spring '' loaded so it springs open and stays open . You do n't have to worry about it collapsing.I had one short `` tunnel '' that was only a foot long , so that was hardly a tunnel . So I knew I had to get Oliver this when I saw it at a local pet store.Sure enough , I brought this home , set it up , and Oliver , after not much prompting , began running through it during those times all of us cat owners know as the midnight `` crazies '' or whenever he felt playful . It has a hole in the middle of it , too , so he can jump into it from the middle.Plus , as added fun , the entire thing lights up ( it is motion activated ) with tiny red lights whenever he runs through it ! Even better , you can control the lights by turning them on or off . So you do not have to waste the battery if you do not want to . The batteries are replaceable , by the way . So I can replace the batteries , and the tunnel can continue to blink away ! The fabric is synthetic , not faux fur , so cat hair does not stick to it . It is easy to clean and because it is spring-loaded neither the ends nor the hole in the middle ever collapses.Oliver is 8 months old . His Siamese friend is two years old . My Siamese does n't dash through the tunnel after him , but she stalks him while he is in the tunnel . She definitely joins in the game with him , as she begins to stalk Oliver as he hides in his tunnel , or pursues him as he is running and dashing through the tunnel or pouncing on a toy in the tunnel.Sometimes Oliver will simply pounce on top of the tunnel or drag toys into the tunnel . This also captures my Siamese 's rapt attention.This toy has a coveted place in the center of my living room , and it is not going anywhere any time soon ! I have also placed the one-foot-long `` tunnel '' next to this tunnel so that Oliver can enjoy both of them , and I have seen him running through both of them , one after the other . He quite enjoys the game ! The only negative I have found is that one end of the Twinkle Chute has long strings . This is in case you want to tie two of these Twinkle Chutes together . I personally think one of these Twinkle Chutes is plenty and that your cat will have fun with only one tunnel . I used masking tape to tape the strings firmly to the body of the tunnel . But one could also simply take scissors and cut off the strings . I had to take precautionary measures because my cats like to eat strings and a lot of cats do eat things like this if left unsupervised.Otherwise , I highly recommend this one for your cat if your cat is young , playful and enjoys hide-and-seek ! ~~ > > `` I want to die peacefully in my sleep , like my grandfather . Not screaming like the passengers in his cab . '' & lt ; & lt ;	1
My 1 year old can not get enough of this , and especially loves the little flashing lights , and great design with the hole in the middle . Only thing not absolutely perfect about it is that my larger cats do not fit well in it . My 21 pounder can squeeze through , but not enough room to move around and play in it .	1
We noticed our Maine Coon loved to get into tunnel-shaped spaces , so we decided to purchase the deluxe crinkle twinkle tunnel ( our fond name for it ) . She is obsessed with it ! She is a very playful , highly energetic cat and she has more fun shooting through this tunnel , slinking through it , and attacking toys in it or just on the opposite opening of where she 's prowling , than any other stationary toy we 've purchased for her . It 's quite hilarious to watch how much fun she has with it . The crinkle noise is music to her ears and the tunnel provides the mystery she likes.We do have another , less playful , older cat ( a Calico ) who sometimes hangs out in it , but it does n't seem to do it for her like it does for the Maine Coon.This was an absolute perfect purchase for our Maine Coon , but we could kinda see she would be into a tunnel before we purchased it . Plus , she has a lot of energy and loves the added excitement the tunnel provides in her toy room ( aka our family room , where she deposits all of her toys ) .Is this tunnel a great purchase ? For our Maine Coon - Oh Heck Yes ! For our mellow Calico - she 's not so into it.It just depends on the type of kitty you have and whether she is playful and likes tunnel-like spaces .	1
I adopted a kitten about 2 years ago and bought this thinking he would like to play with it . He did n't , but I kept it around anyway . Then last year I adopted Luna and she absolutely LOVES this thing . It 's her absolute favorite toy . She runs head on at it and slides it across the floor . She jumps into the hole in the top of it . Occasionally , she hides a toy mouse in there for safe keeping.The twinkle aspect died quite a while ago , but no one misses it .	1
Cheap , sturdy and can take a beating from a devil of a kitten ! Stay away from the triple priced tunnels at petsmart and other stores ! My cat loves this tunnel , the lights have been going for a few months now and have n't required a battery change . There is n't a single tear in it , even though I can hear my cat peddling her claws against it like shes digging for gold . Get a nice rod toy and have your cat run back and forth through this thing , no doubt they will be happily panting on their side instead of attacking your arms and legs ! Great cat product !	1
It has everything a cat loves , for the price their Human loves . Inside its dark , makes that crinkle sound , AND they can run through it . Oh , and what 's this , it folds up to be the size of a large book . Win-win-win . I almost want to get more and build a kitty maze ...	1
My cat loves running through this tube , hearing the irresistible crinkle and hiding her toys in it to later & # 34 ; discover & # 34 ; and run back and forth with through the tube . However I was very disappointed with the twinkle lights . My cat loves little lights and thought she 'd love this feature . The lights did not work at all . I replaced the battery it came with and they still did n't work . Just as well though because my cat is chewer and would have chewed on the exposed little wires and the battery cover , too , as the velcro pouch holder would not have kept her from getting to it . I ended up removing the battery case and exposed wires . Also wish these tubes were longer . My cat loves it without the lights but I am very disappointed that they did n't work and with the battery pouch and exposed wires - only about 1/2 & # 34 ; - but would 've been too tempting for my cat . Since most cats do n't chew on everything , it 's probably okay..	1
I knew from the start that my cats would love this . They play with it for hours ! Even our foster kitten loves it . They run and jump through the top hole and run through it to the other side . It is very funny to watch ! ! I would buy more of these for sure ! ! The noise does n't bother us because we have a large house but I 'm sure it could get annoying if our bedroom was near . Anyways , great product	1
This is truly the BEST Cat Tunnel around.I have purchased many and this one is GREAT ! It keeps it 's SHAPE so you never have to keep opening it up when it goes flat , like all the other cat tunnels out there ! I only wish it came in a nicer brighter color , as the color is rather drab.If you 're looking for a cat tunnel that 'spring 's into action ' & you never have to fuss over it , this is it ! ! Tampa FL	1
my cats do enjoy running through this chute and going crazy , sometimes even coming out the hole in the side ! ! ! We sometimes will wiggle our finger on the other end to get them motivated to `` hunt '' ... .very fun ! ! !	1
I have numerous cats and they all love this toy and use it constantly ! The only issue I have had is when it 's rolled up it has 2 strings used to tie the item together , I 've had to cut this off because my cats attempted to eat them , but the toy itself is loved by all my critters .	1
I bought this for my two kittens , it was one of the first products that I ordered for them . With a few sprinklings of cat nip they were hooked . I liked hearing them scratching and knowing that they were not touching the walls or the wooden furniture.They used it daily , however , now that they are 6 and 7 pounds they knock it over every time that they try to use it . They are strong and they love to get in a good scratching session . However , now they look perplexed when it falls over with a loud thud . Even though I placed it beside a wall , they can still accidentally knock it over.This is unfortunate , because they used to adore it . I will replace it with a large post , because its the only thing for them to scratch on downstairs apart from a few empty boxes . I wanted a cheaper post , because they already have a large cat tree upstairs , but now I will have to spring for a larger , sturdier and more expensive post . This is too bad , because they love pulling off the attached ball with feathers attached to it . As soon as I put it back on they go crazy for it again.+ Great for kittens up until 6 months+ Kittens adore the attachment and play with it with and without it being attached- Not for average sized or large catsBuy it for tiny kittens , and by the time that they 're grown up it will be time to get a larger and fresher post .	1
When I bought it , I did n't realize the toy attached to the top came off . My cat loves pulling it off and playing with it around the house . Easy to reattach for more hours of fun . I wish the unit did n't topple over so easily , though . My cat will often pull it down on its side . I still give it 5 stars though because he enjoys the pillar either way .	1
Hi , Very nice ! The bottom opens up as the base and screw it tight . It looks nice and is high quality . I prefer a taller post for adult cats . This is a well done post .	1
This is a good scratching post and my cat loves to bat the toy So much so I have to buy her more toys like the one attached	1
This toy is great . We have a dog that needs almost constant stimulation , so we purchased a variety of toys to make him work for his dinner . This one went over well , except , he has somehow figured out how to unscrew the top section and dump out the food . Other than that , it 's fantastic . The plastic is very hard , so it is loud on wood and tile floors , and I always think he 's going to crack it . But so far it 's held up , and he 's been using it every day for a few weeks .	1
This dog toy is by far the best I have ever gotten for my dog . He is a large ( 75lb ) mix breed , and he loves his mushroom ! It will keep him occupied for a long time . We will just fill it up with his kibble , and feed him that way . I will fill it up before leaving , and it can make sure he both has food and entertainment while I am gone . One full mushroom will give him 1-2 hours of entertainment depending on how hard I make it for him with openings and kibble sizes . My sister 's corgi also loves his smaller mushroom , as they use it to slow down his eating.This mushroom is a great way to keep your dog mentally occupied , while rewarding him for the process . Highly recommended .	1
This has been a great feeder for my dog , so far . I appreciate the fact that the difficulty of it can be adjusted . I set it really easy at first and have made it progressively harder . It 's held up surprisingly well to her jaws ( she 's a strong chewer for a 40 pound dog ) despite the beating it has taken . A few deep bite marks , but no cracks ( yet ) . I have to monitor her when she 's playing with it - when it 's not paying out much or the food has run out she 'll try to chew the top part of the mushroom off to get to the inside . But , that 's just my dog and all dogs are different . I 'd say give this a try if you need to spice up your dog 's food toys , or are looking for a challenging ( but not impossible ) food toy .	1
We are teaching treat toy feeding and this is the hardest of the toys we got . Our lab does n't quite get it yet but she 's enjoying playing with it and caring it around . She 's a chewer and has n't broken it yet ...	1
This was bigger than expected , too big for the dog . I returned it and the seller was most cooperative .	1
This , so far , is the only , out of 4 puzzle toys , that really still challenges my dog . It keeps her mind going and gives me some peace of mind .	1
We have had this toy for a few years now and it is still my dog 's favorite interactive feeder . It holds a lot of kibble , I usually put 1 cup in but it could hold double or triple that . It comes apart into 4 pieces ( mushroom bell , the adjustable piece treats pass through , the body , and a base ) for easy cleaning and is made of a durable hard plastic . I have n't had any trouble with the holes being too small for my kibble or treats ( Nutro kibble passes through fine , as well as other flat oval shapes ) . There is a slide adjustment under the mushroom bell to make the holes smaller but I keep it on the largest setting.I 've tried most of the Premiere brand interactive feeders and this is our # 1 choice .	1
Bought this after reading `` Pitlandia : Top 10 Food Dispensing Dog Toys '' ( [ ... ] and really like that it is fun and challenging for my dog , and easy to clean for me . Be warned though , the toy can be loud on hard surfaces ( like when it bangs into a wall ) , but that is not a deal breaker for us . I thought we would prefer the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball , which is soft and much quieter when it bangs into hard surfaces , but the ball is very difficult to clean thoroughly/properly .	1
I bought this for my 6 mth old GR who 's pretty smart I think but even then it took a bit of trial and error and encouragement on my part to get him to play with it . He was afraid of it at the start so I had to give him treats just for touching it . But once he got started , he loved it ! He tried to chew it but realized that did n't get the treats out so I had to demonstrate pushing it and turning it over many times before he got the idea .	1
My lab pup ( he 's 8 months ) finds this toy entertaining and frustrating which is amusing to me . He bops it , carries it , drops it , shakes it , licks it - noses it around the floor - he brings it to me when he gets too irritated that the treats are not falling out fast enough . The elderly jack russell follows him around waiting for treats to fall ( set on hard for the lab cause he is sooooo busy ) . He is intrigued and determined to get his treats out . And best of all it makes him TIRED ! Very durable hard ballistic plastic .	1
If you have a dog that is insanely food driven and hard to entertain ... .look no further . This is a great alternative to the food ball , a little less noisy and you can adjust the size of the hole to make it more of a challenge for your pup . My boys love this and i love it because it keeps them entertained and out of trouble for a little while !	1
I got this so that each dog could have a slow feeder , instead of the bowls , so it would take them even longer to eat . This toy has been amazing . My one dog is n't allowed to use it or touch it , and she 's really good about it , other wise she would have destroyed it by now . The dog we bought it for is an 80 lb lab/pit mix , and he loves carrying things and playing with his paws . It took him 3 weeks to figure out that he could get food out of this thing , but I think that was mostly out of laziness , but as soon as he decided he liked it , he started batting it all over the house . He really likes to drop it down the stairs , and amazingly , it has n't broken . The top mushroom cap will pop off , and there 's a small chip out of one of the pieces , but overall , it 's held up very well ! We got this in December and have been using it for all his meals each day , and he still loves playing with it . Mostly on the tiles in the kitchen , and by dropping it down the stairs . It fits a little over a cup of food , to still have room for the kibble to fall out .	1
We 've owned this almost as long as we 've owned our puppy . Feeder toys are the only way she gets meals right now . Her chosen method is to pick this one up and drop it ; then give it a nudge to eat from ; so I 'm not sure how much more abuse it will take ; but for now it 's going strong.We did have an issue with the threads holding it together comming appart at the stem of the mushroom ; becareful how you assemble it after washing.I would highly recommend this to a friend and fellow puppy/Lab owner .	1
My 27 lb feist Annie is pretty high energy , smart , and food-motivated , and this food dispenser toy is great for her . She figured out quickly just how to move , roll , or drop the toy to get the kibble out , but has n't gotten bored with it yet ( after 3 months of daily use ) . Most of her meals are dispensed this way , and unlike many dispensers , this will hold her full serving ( total capacity is probably about 2 - 2.5 cups , but she eats about 1.25 cups per meal ) . It 's nice that it 's easy to see from across the room how much food is left in it.I like that I can adjust the difficulty so when she 's not as high energy I can make it easier and when she 's hyper I can make it more challenging . Even on the easiest setting , it 's slow enough to dispense that she ca n't wolf down her meal . She will generally keep at it until the last few pieces of kibble are left that are too large to fit through the holes , then bring it to me to unscrew for her to earn those last few bites with tricks . It 's also quite durable and stands up to her biting , carrying , and dropping it , though I do n't leave her alone with it as the plastic could potentially splinter and hurt her.The only drawback to this item for me is that sometimes the lid unscrews instead of the neck , and I do n't really see the point of having two separate points to screw and unscrew the toy .	1
This toy has been perfect for my dog who eats fast and needs to be kept busy . It 's super easy to fill . All you do is unscrew the bottom , which is basically a bowl . I use this everyday as an alternative to her food dish . My dog loves to carry things around in her mouth which this is perfect for . Although I try to take it away from her once she starts to chew on the plastic , this plastic is pretty sturdy . Overall this is a great little toy !	1
This treat dispenser is durable , easy to load and adjust , and it takes my dogs a while to empty it , which is perfect.It 's difficult to tip , and you have to tip it twice to get the treats to fall out , which is great . This is one of the longest lasting treat dispensers I 've found , but not so hard that mine lost interest ( though I could see that happening with a less pugnacious dog ) .This is perfect for dogs that empty other treat dispensers quickly .	1
Ample volume to fit 2 cups of kibble inside to feed an entire meal . My dogs are 55lb . I let them eat and when empty I take away the mushroom . They have managed to work off the mushroom & # 34 ; cap & # 34 ; every once in a while and start chewing on the screw joint that holds it together - which would ruin it pretty quickly . Easy to wash and clean .	1
my only concern is my dogs chew on the mushroom cap so I have to take it away once the treats are gone . It has shrunk in size from them nawing at it .	1
I actually purchased this at petsmart for 25 $ so its a much better deal on here . This is hands down the best toy I have ever bought for my dog . She never once has broken it and she jumps up on the bed and drops it off to make more food fall out . She never seemed that interested with kibble in it so I put plain cherios in it and she absolutely loves it ! I refill it at least once a day . Perfect for dogs that are alone a lot too	1
This treat dispenser has held up beautifully to daily use of a highly active and not too gentle mini poodle . He has figured out how to get treats to dispense , but it is still challenging . The adjustment for the size of the openings could be a little better -- the increments between size openings are rather large . But overall , it is well designed and made of a plastic that can withstand some chewing and repeated dropping .	1
I & # 8217 ; ve been looking and trying dog toys & # 8211 ; in particular food dispensers & # 8211 ; for my Lhasa Apso as a way to challenge and make him more active while indoors . So far , this mushroom toy surpassed expectations , improving his meal time greatly in many ways . I made a video to demonstrate exactly that , also how to use it , etc . Here & # 8217 ; s the link if you & # 8217 ; re interested : http : //goo.gl/SuZLP8Basically , as I show on the video , when my dog eats the usual way & # 8211 ; in a bowl & # 8211 ; he devours his food all at once very quickly ( about 2:30 min ) . Now , with the mushroom toy , he takes more than 12 minutes until he eats all the food & # 8211 ; one kibble at a time . I think it & # 8217 ; s a healthier experience , even more given that he & # 8217 ; s exercising the entire period , patting the toy all over the place . And that & # 8217 ; s on the easiest level & # 8211 ; yes , you can adjust it to release kibbles even more slowly if you want . It & # 8217 ; s indeed a therapy for the dog and the owner & # 8211 ; I personally love to watch him playing.The toy is very easy to use , resistant , and stays clean & # 8211 ; dogs don & # 8217 ; t seem to get interested in licking or chewing it . I & # 8217 ; ve recommended it to a few friends and they all approved it . My brother gave it to his puppy ( a Shih Tzu ) , and although it was the small size ( it also comes on large ) , it was still slightly too big for her . Anyway , she plays a lot with it and as she grows it & # 8217 ; ll get better .	1
My dog really likes this and I love how she can get a good hold on the ridge . It helps me to not have to retrieve it every time it gets rolled under the coffee table . I love how many ways you can take this thing apart and how easy it is to fill and clean . It is also super easy to alter the difficulty . It took her a little while to warm up to it and to figure it out but now she digs it .	1
My dog loves this toy . It is a great thing to put in the back yard if I am going to be away for awhile . It did take him a bit of time to learn what it was about , but now it is his go-to dispenser . One of the things that I like about it is that it does n't fly across the room when he bats it . He has a couple of round dispensers that really make him run around and get some exercise in addition to the mental stimulation , but they make a lot of noise as they bang around the room . They are also smaller , and can get lost under the furniture . This dispenser is too large to do that . The openings are adjustable so that I can set how much effort it will take him to get the food out .	1
My dog loves this toy . It 's very challenging for her and her first approach is usually just to try to chew the ends off to get to the treats , so the plastic is pretty rough in some areas from her gnawing on it , but I think she likes the challenge and if she gets too frustrated with it she will bring it to us to help by loosening it up so the treat is easier to get to !	1
This has been very good . My dog loves it . He can not have the treat discs that come with it as they mess up his system . He like to chase after it . He will sit and chew for a while . I made him a dried disc of thin beef to use and he went to town . I will have to do my own disc type treats and he will be fine with it .	1
I like this toy because it gives my dog something to do for a while when she is trying to get the treats off to eat them . I put the treats in the wrong place the first time I used it , and they were gone in a minute . But the second time I actually followed the instructions ( duh ! ) and it lasted at least 30-45 minutes - which is a lot for a treat toy , in my experience . My dog is determined , so she just chews it nonstop as soon as she sees the treat . But even when there are no treats on it , she will chew on all the parts that stick out . She loves to chew ! This is a great toy for her . I just wish the treats would last longer , or cost less to refill .	1
I like the whole Busy Buddy line . I already have two with the brush , and actually put toothpaste ( dog ) on it as well as the ring . This particular toy is much more & # 34 ; busy & # 34 ; . Cleo loves it .	1
my pit bull along with our foster dogs just loves these toys . It takes them a while to get the treat from it and you can also move the rawhide disk to the outer edge to make it even harder . They even love just chewing on the toy itself	1
I have four dogs - all of whom love to chew . This dog toy is a favorite with my dogs , regardless of whether or not I put a treat in it . Every day , one of the dogs are chewing on it somewhere . It has not chipped or broken anywhere I can see . Great product !	1
My 3 yr old Affenpinscher loves this toy ! She has a longer snout than most of her breed , but this is still a challenge . She loves the different textures of the rings ( the green ones are more flexible than the purple and white ) , and is driven by the rawhide . She has yet to get the rawhide completely off , but she has only had one day with it . My mother 's Boston Terrier visited and loved it so much , I let her have it . ( I 'm getting a new one ! ) The Boston is a heavy/strong chewer and did more damage to the toy , and did not seem to be deterred by her shorter snout . My mother has trouble finding toys that she does n't destroy immediately . This one has lasted a week so far ... ... ! My favorite part about the toy is that the rawhide part is small and does n't fill up her tiny stomach , yet she is entertained for a long while . I highly recommend this toy for smart dogs and chewers . I ordered the Busy Buddy Bristle Bone also , and it is equally exceptional . It is a little easier to get the rawhide off because the bristles give more , but they add value in that they brush your dog 's teeth as they chew ! My Affie loves this toy too !	1
My 9lb . long-haired Chihuahua is very active , and needs a lot of mental stimulation . This toy fills the bill ! She nibbles at the rawhide rings for many hours of enjoyment , and carries it to her little bed at night , like a security blanket !	1
My extreme chewer had this chewed up in an hour ( it was a Christmas present ) . NOT for extreme chewers but I would recommend it for large dogs who are light chewers . It does keep them entertained for a long time .	1
My two year old Chiweenie can tear through toys faster than my Pit Bull ! I bought this and he carries it everywhere and it 's proved to be long lasting and durable . He loves chewing down the rawhide discs - this is a great toy for a busy chewer ! I 've also purchased the bone version of this toy as well !	1
I originally ordered the 8 & # 34 ; bowl holder , but it was too tall/wide for my dog ( 12 & # 34 ; shoulder height ) . This is perfect . I ordered the 5.5 & # 34 ; Petrageous bowls to go with it , but you can use your own bowls , if you prefer , which is nice to have the option . I like that the design is plain , and does not have scrollwork , which , like another reviewer mentioned , can cause a dog 's tags to get stuck in . Unfortunately , that happened to my other , smaller dog with a product I purchased on a different website .	1
This is just what I needed to hold my older kitty 's dish high enough for her comfort . I 'm quite pleased .	1
This is just the right height for my little dogs - chihuahuas . I enjoy seeing them drink at the proper height .	1
Perfect for my cats . I like that I can use any bowls . I keep water and dry food bowls on this . Cats can get to it all easily . Keeps bowls from sliding around too . Have larger/taller ones for my dogs .	1
There is some conflict between the title and the description regarding the measurements . The title states `` 3-Inch Height , 6-Inch Bowls '' and the description states `` Product Dimensions : 13 x 7 x 3 inches '' . For placing a bowl on this rack the inside dimensions are the only ones that matter ... the exact length is 12-1/2 '' but the width is only 5-7/8 '' so there 's no way something 6 '' wide will fit unless it 's tapered from 6 '' at the bottom to something smaller at the top . The outside width is 6-1/8 '' so the 7 '' in the description must be the box size but the 3 '' height is incorrect to where the bowls sit . If you have a 6 '' straight sided bowl it wo n't fit . I have 7 cats and not all will eat from this rack ... some will take food out , drop it on the floor and then eat but you ca n't please them all . I have several cats that will make about 4-5 trips to the dish before a meal is do so leaving some food out is the only way to do it . However , ants are a never-ending problem here in the warmer months and putting some dishes in a trap with water has helped ... but it gets messy fast . The reason for the purchase was to help stop those ants by lifting the food up and putting some petroleum jelly around the foot pads and/or setting the feet in 4 bottle caps with water ... and both work quite well . I did have to cut the legs down so they were only about 1-inch to get all the cats eating without moving food to the floor . The rack is pretty rugged but mine did come with a pretty bent leg that had to be straightened in a vise . It 's pretty much a 5-star item but I had to go with 4-stars because the measurement for width was wrong and there 's no way you 're getting a 6-inch bowl into this frame unless you bend out the metal frame in the middle .	1
I 've been searching for metal stands as I 've used a wooden one before and that wood starts to warp after time from the wet bowls . This stand is so far , great ! The dimensions are exactly as mentioned . I love that I can put any kinds of bowls I want . All of the feet are even and do not wobble . It even has rubberized tips so it does n't move around .	1
Have only used it twice and my yorkies eyes are now clear with no goo and no yucky fur around them ! ! yeah ! This is the 4th product I 've tried and I 'm sold .	1
These wipes work very well . I have started to notice that the tear stains are fading , and the smell is definitely better when you use them every day . They work well to remove crusty residue that sometimes forms under my dogs eyes.I would rate a full 5 stars if not for the fact that the pads are very goopy and I end up getting gel goop all over my hands and sometimes have to re-wipe her eyes with a tissue to get rid of the excess goop . My dogs hate to have their eyes wiped , but this is a lot easier , and works a lot better , than trying to wipe with a washcloth , but you might get gel goop on your clothes , so be aware .	1
These work great in getting the tear build up or & # 34 ; eye boogers & # 34 ; as we call them at our house from our dog 's eyes . It seems to have a gel type product on the textured pad and that softer texture helps to break up and remove the crusted material from the eye area . It seems to be gentle as well . My dogs do not seem to not like them used on their eyes and no irritation occurs when I use them .	1
I have a blonde Havanese puppy . She tears a lot and she has red stains under her eyes . This product cleaned it up and keeps it cleaned up . It does exactly what it is advertised to do .	1
While this product does not cure the problem it makes it easy to at least clean up my girls face under her left eye that leaks a lot ...	1
I have 2 Shih-Tzu 's with extremely dry eyes . The drops I use for this 2 times a day contain oil which stains around their eyes . This product removes the stains from the oil & removes any residue build up . Great product ! Easy to use and the dogs no longer mind having their eyes wiped . Thank you so much !	1
these are great for cleaning your dog 's eyes without having to worry about soap or harming them in any way	1
I have to clean and apply medicated eye drops to my Maltese 's eyes twice per day . These wipes do the best job . Safe to actually touch the eye . The texture seems to help when removing discharge from the fur around the eyes .	1
It is great that my 7 and 9 month old boxers can let me know when they need to use the bathroom . No more inside accidents , as long as I ' m paying attention that is , lol .	1
I initially purchased a set of Poochie Bells wihich had a thin cloth strap . Our doodle was a puppy at the time and he wanted to swing from the bells and chew on them ( playing ! ) . He chewed right through them . We then bought this set and it has lasted a long time . The brown leather looks great .	1
I purchased these bells for my cat who scratches the doorway to get inside..he actually has learned to swat the bells ! They serve to offer a gentle chime that is not annoying	1
Very easy to teach your pet to let you know when he or she needs to go outside to potty . Stick with the all leather premium edition . You will be amazed , amused , and able to put the rug cleaner away . Ron	1
My dog goes ga-ga over these treats . They smell wonderful and garlic-y . Since they are softer than real human beef jerky they can be easily chopped up into small bits that are perfect for training rewards . Not greasy , no fillers , lots of beef ... ..just perfect ! !	1
My dog is so picky about dogfood or even treats . However , she loves these Milo 's Kitchen Beef Jerky Treats . I am sure she would be happy to just live on them and forget the dogfood . She is a very small dog and the fact that these treats are smaller and softer is good for her . She just ca n't crunch on large hard treats . Milo 's has our 5 star vote .	1
After having stacked drawers full of every treat sold on the market ( Begging Strips , Milkbones , Busybone , Charlee Bear , Bonz , Carry-outs , etc . ) I 'd finally given up on finding a treat my dog would not turn his nose up at . Found 'em ! These were on sale at Petco so I picked up a bag . My dog will do anything for one of these treats . They are great . I 've never had an issue with him throwing these up or having a reaction and he is prone to those types of things . Not with these . I also break them up into smaller pieces and put them in his kong . Keeps him busy . I 've also bought the chicken balls . He loves those too but these are the ones he really goes crazy for . By the way , for those wondering how they taste ... my husband had a chew , said it tasted exactly like beef jerky.Minus 1 Star for the Price because I do feel some dog treats are overpriced . BJ 's is now carrying the chicken balls but not the jerky . Petco has the smaller sized bags and the large bags .	1
In the world of dog treats the Milo 's Beef Jerkey is one of the better ones . They are made of beef with some flavorings added . No fillers . No artificial colors . No artificial flavors . This is actually real food for your dog . Our two dogs ca n't get enough of the tasty Milo treats . Although called jerkey , the treats are soft enough to break apart with your hands.Sitting on the table at which I 'm working is a bag of snacks with a picture of a famous , perky TV personality on the package . The first ingredients listed are : wheat flour , glycerin , beef , and of course olive oil . This second bag of treats is n't bad as far as mainstream dog snacks go , and there are more treats in the bag for the same money.Comparing ingredients , the Milo 's wins this contest .	1
I originally had found these at my local grocery store . When I went to purchase more for my puppy they were out , so I found them on Amazon . I also ordered for my daughter 's adult Lab . First - they do not fall apart quickly or get all & # 34 ; gooey & # 34 ; ... ... or shred in to small chunks that my puppy can choke on . My puppy really likes them and they last a long time . Also , for me it was a big thing to find rawhide that was made AND processed in the USA - you really have to look at the labels for these rawhide products ! . After the recent news reports on pet food items , I will not purchase any pet item that is NOT made 100 % in the states .	1
My dog loved loved loved these . i had ordered them for his boarding days but he loves them so much I have to order more	1
Love these . My dog loves these . One of my dogs is n't all that interested in chewing but he seems to know the difference in quality since he has taken to chewing these and likes them a lot.My 18lb and 25lbs dogs will chew these for days if not weeks !	1
They each occupy my dog for a little while , but definitely do n't last even an hour . Honestly , he 's a very strong chewer , so I expected as much . I still gave them 4 stars because they did n't make a mess , the dog loves them , and they do occupy him long enough for us to eat dinner without putting him in the kennel .	1
I love this pen . I can make it as small or large as I need it to be . Plenty of room for my puppies to play when I 'm away . Sturdy enough . And folds up for easy storage .	1
This is perfect for our house bunnies to get some time outdoors in the grass . We can move it to shady areas in our yard and that is importaint here in the heat in Las Vegas , Nevada .	1
pretty good quality for the price , perfect for my puppy corgi . though i wish they would me more of those clam/clips ... they only have me three ... i would say 6 hold clips would have been perfect .	1
it 's perfect for taking with me	1
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GUNIEA PIGS TO PLAY IN.I CAN DIVIDE IT AND USE THE CLIPS TO HOLD IT TOGETHER SO I HAVE TWO SECTIONS.IT IS GREEEEAT.LOVE IT.I CAN PUT THE MALE ( BOAR ) ON ONE SIDE AND THE FEMALES ON THE OTHER SIDE .	1
I purchased the 24 & # 34 ; and 30 & # 34 ; . At the time , no difference in price but those 6 & # 34 ; made a big difference . This is great for containment and to block off areas of home . This is a life and sanity saver with a new puppy .	1
This has been perfect for my new puppy . After just 2 days , he loves his den . Sturdy enough to stand up to his chewing/teething , yet light enough to pick up and move to clean accidents . We now leave the door open and when our puppy gets tired , he chooses to go in his den and sleep . Also , if I take a toy out of it . he picks it up and drags it back in . He loves his new home .	1
This keeps our chihuahua in her & # 34 ; pee area & # 34 ; , but wo n't stand a chance against our lab or pit.Good quality and great price and shipped quickly.I would not recommend for dogs over 15lbs as it is easily moved around or knocked over if not staked to the ground .	1
My dog well , he does n't love it because he 's used to free roam of the yard , but it 's a perfect size for him . Would highly recommend .	1
This helped my aunt when she raised 2 puppies this summer . We were able to keep them confined as we were remodeling her new house . In addition , it makes clean up easier ! Just add a tarp under it for indoor use !	1
This has become my yorkie 's bedroom . Whenever we leave the house , she jumps right in . It fits her bed , potty pad , food & water bowls and her toys . She feels safe here . Does n't like to be left out when we are gone . I lined the bottom with a cheap shower curtain to prevent accidents from damaging the carpet . I love it . One of the best purchases I ever made . It 's all one piece and folds up , easily fitting the trunk for vacation traveling . A must have for small , indoor dogs .	1
i actually zip tied the entry way of this play pen to one of the doors on my crate and use it indoors , and the best part is i can fold it up while its still connected to the crate and put it away when i am home for the day	1
No problems setting up or using product . Does exactly what we wanted , which was to keep our puppy out of trouble .	1
Works great . The only thing I would change is the lip below the door . I wish it was closer to the ground so our little puppy did n't have to struggle over it .	1
it would be nice if there was an easy way to take off two of the panels and add them to the top so pups ca n't get out . My little 3 pound cavachon started climbing - teeth and paw - her way out of this at 9 weeks so no longer was effective as an open top pen	1
I do n't have the room for a crate in my bedroom so I use this playpen upstairs and downstairs . Adjustable for whatever size or shape you need .	1
We purchased 2 of these . One to extend out our puppy 's crate to give her a little play area during the day while we are at work and one to use in the yard when we are working and ca n't watch her every second . Works great , easy to assemble and well made .	1
This works out great for my Maltese when I am at work . It gives him plenty of space to walk around and I can separate his food from his puppy pads and his sleeping area . I have it connected to his crate , where he sleeps . My crate has two doors so I can keep one open to his play pen area and he can come and go when I am at home . You can make into the shape you need so it works great for my puppy ! ! He does n't seem to mind when I have to leave . He goes right into & # 34 ; his house. & # 34 ;	1
This worked great for containment and to close off certain areas of home . It was a big help with a new puppy and relieved a lot of stress . Would and did buy another .	1
We used this on our hardwood floor when we got a new Italian Greyhound puppy before he was house trained enough to run free in the house . It was plenty of room for him , and it SAVED us from him being all over the house with his poop and pee . I loved that it had a gate door so that I could go in and out without killing myself jumping over the walls . I have n't tried it outside yet . It lays flat to travel and store easily , which is another huge plus !	1
I was very impressed with the heavy weight construction of this & # 34 ; doggie corral & # 34 ; . It seems very well made and door is a nice addition that many of these style pens do n't have . My dogs are on the small size but I think it seems sturdy enough for even a larger dog.What I did was take my dog 's large wire crate and used it as one segment of the circle ... attaching the open side of each side of the pen to the two sides of the dog crate so essentially the dog crate became part of the continuous circle . Then I just left the crate door open to the inside and when my dog wanted to take a nap he could go right into his crate from this pen .	1
I have a number of dogs at my house at all times ( mine + fosters ) and this pen is handy for puppies . For older dogs , those I 've tried have all & # 34 ; jumped the fence & # 34 ; . Taller is better for adults !	1
We 've travelled with this pen quite a bit now and we use it during the days when our puppy is at home . It 's not the greatest in terms of quality as the door panel was bowed out from the beginning and the latches need a bit of extra finesse to get them into the lock position . Overall , it works well for our purposes .	1
If you need to take your dog out and do n't have a fence or tie out , this is the product . We ordered two And put them together in the yard . It is easy to move . It also folds flat . Made of quality materials .	1
I like the fact that this pen was pretty solid quality and cheaper than the Precision brand line of pens . I like the black paint instead of the gold metal , but I only saw this pen in the 30 & # 34 ; tall size . The pen is flexible and serves its purpose , though the one I received had a slight bend on one of the edges ( do n't really notice it though ) and the top latch is a little more difficult to close than the bottom one as the door hangs a little at an angle . I like the option of attaching it to a crate , so the pen area is even bigger and still secure . I do wish more than three fasteners came with the pen , but a trip to Hope Depot should remedy that . Depending on your height , 30 inches may be too tall to just step over without using the door , so I would be careful if you try .	1
Best buy I made for my new puppy . It helps me keep her contain in an area when I 'm unable to supervise her and I leave her in her ex pen instead of a crate when I leave for work . The only complaint I have is that if you use it indoors its easy for the dog to push it and move it , outside on the grass it works perfect . Would definetly recommend .	1
This is the most amazing thing I have bought for my litter of 6 baby Pembroke Welsh Corgis . It is the best 50 Bucks I 've spent in a long time . Thank you	1
works great keeping my puppy in place . Cant stand the latches to open the door to get puppy out . It really looks simple , but for some reason at times , it takes ten tries to get it to open . I saw others had said that was their frustration too . They were n't lying . I dont regret getting this bc it was so much cheaper than all the others i looked at . but , I do get aggravated by it . I can tell you it is very light and if you plan to put a big puppy/dog in there , they will knock it all over the place . But , my doggie is only 8 pounds and I have it set up in a small room so he cant push the walls around too much .	1
This is a wonderful toy . My grey loved this toy . It 's a great value for the size and it 's very bright and colorful , too .	1
Umbrella cockatoo likes it.. the blocks of wood are about 1.5 inches square ( give or take ) Good size for him to tear apart and chew . Leather connecting strings , and raffia accents	1
If your bird loves to chew wood , this is a great toy . My Alexandrine is a chewing machine and it took him a week to destroy this toy . It held his interest for days until he chewed it to smithereens . LOL Any toy that can survive that big beak for more than a day is a success .	1
Both my amazons love this toy ! The one amazon took 3 days to chew it and the other took about a month .	1
Use this toy for my African Grey and my BF Amazon . They enjoy the different sizes and are not crazy chewers . This would not last more than a few hours for our Macaw .	1
I bought these for my shih tzus , they love them . I had previously purchased the smallest ring bone for them but the had them chewed up in one afternoon , these have lasted a long time . They are not able to bite off tiny pieces and just keep chomping away . I plan on ordering more for their Christmas stockings !	1
We have an almost 12 week old female Aussie . She loves this bone . She chews off little pieces , but has no problem digesting them , as long as they are no larger than a small grain of rice , according to the package . She puts her paws on the ends and uses her front teeth to try to chew the small bumps off . I got her the souper size .	1
My dog is a power chewer ( 55 lbs lab mix ) and would demolish these in about an hour and we would have to constantly watch her to make sure she was n't swallowing any big pieces . If you do n't have a power chewing dog these would probably work great , we had to look else where even though she loved them , our sanity demanded it .	1
Have a large and a giant puppy , and both love gnawing on this bone . Fair warning , it 's REALLY big , so for young pups or small to medium breeds , get a smaller size .	1
Our 4 month old rottweiler pup loved the nylabone puppy bone , but went through them too quickly so I thought the ring might offer a better challenge . He does n't seem to like it as much even thought it 's the same scent and strength . He does chew on it for periods of time , so I 'd still recommend it .	1
Bought these for my 2 Chihuahua puppies . They love them . They are not quite as small as I thought they would be for & # 34 ; Petite & # 34 ; size , but my tiny pups are able to chew them and hold them in their front paws just fine . They have been working on them for almost 3 months and they have just started to break pieces off of these . It keeps them busy when I do n't have time to play with them .	1
The Wolf-sized Puppy Ring Bone was a great choice for our lab puppy from age 2 - 8 months . She was not a Strong Chewer until after 8 months and worked hard with her new teeth without getting large chunks off . Now the center section is all that is left ( 9 months ) and she just gnaws gently.Note when you order that the bones are listed in the order of - Small , Wolf , Large - when the Wolf size is the largest ! We ordered the wrong size once because of this S-L-M ordering .	1
This are a really really really great product.the puppies love them . I will definatly order these again . I highly recommend these .	1
My dogs are small but they are big chewers . Nylabone products are great for the busy puppy or dog . They wash up and are long lasting .	1
all my 3 dogs just love it . I do n't know why . they just go crazy when I show them what I got . lol	1
My puppy thoroughly enjoys this nylabone , but it really is just for TEETHING puppies up to 15 pounds . My puppy is past her teething stage , and although she is not quite a year yet , her little chompers are tearing out small pieces of this toy . I let her chew on it , but I never leave her alone with it , just in case she would swallow a piece . So please only purchase this for a teething puppy and if your puppy starts to chew pieces of it off , throw it away or supervise and remove the pieces yourself . NEVER LEAVE YOUR PUPPY ALONE WITH THIS TOY ! If you like the design , there is a durachew in the same shape and size available in a hard plastic that can not be chewed into pieces like this one . My puppy owns both . : ) Update : After several weeks of chewing small pieces off and me shaving pieces off with scissors , she has managed to chew off one end of the bone ! We are down to the ring and the other end of the bone . I will be throwing this bone away soon . If your puppy has ANY adult teeth , I do NOT recommend this product . ONLY get it for teething puppies . If you like this design and want it for an adult dog , get the durachew version !	1
I have a Great Pyrenees that is growing so incredibly quickly and had trouble finding a bone that was n't too hard , but the right size since she is & # 62 ; 40lbs at 3 1/2 months old . This provides hours and hours of chewing time and she prefers it over our furniture ! She never gets bored of this chicken flavor . The Durachews are not always a hit with her	1
Have purchased other Nylabone products , my dog loves them . He spends hours chewing on them and sometimes he buries them to save them for another time . Will continue to purchase nylabones .	1
My dogs and puppies love this chew toy . I 've bought them a lot of chew toys of all brands , shapes and sizes and this one is one of their favorites . Besides that , it was a good price as well .	1
I have no complaints about this product . My puppy chewed on this happily for the first few months of her life . I do n't understand some of the negative reviews . The product packaging clearly states that it is not intended for use with puppies that have ANY adult teeth . It does not give an age range because some puppies get their first adult teeth much younger than others . If you purchase the correct size and supervise your puppy/periodically check for damage there should not be an opportunity for your dog to eat this chew toy .	1
I have purchased two of these . One small one for when she was ten weeks old and now the larger one now that she is 4.5 months old .	1
As with many of the Nylabone products this is not my puppies favorite because it is made with such a hard material . He needs to chew but likes bully sticks consistency better .	1
Finally found a chew toy for my puppy that was n't too . If for him and by the way he LOVES it !	1
This bone is the perfect size for my 11 lb little girl . She likes to gnaw and chew , and this is preferable alternative to my shoes . As with most dog toys , I would suggest monitoring the dog while they 're using it . Little `` nubs '' come off , and I would n't want my dog to swallow them . We 've ordered at least 5 of these !	1
My french bulldog puppy loved this chew toy . It was big enough I did n't have to worry about her chocking and also small enough she could comfortably chew it . I think she also likes the ridges on it , because she chews it constantly since she is teething . Much safer then rawhides !	1
I ordered the petite size and it is okay . I bought a larger one and it is more challenging for his puppy teething . I wet it and put it in the fridge and he enjoys it longer .	1
I have a 7 month old chihuahua who LOVES this bone . It is much softer than the other nylabones we have in the house . Since this is the case I have to supervise her chewing this bone as she can work small chunks off after an hour of chewing . I do not leave her alone with this bone . We have an older dog that would do more damage so this bone is kept up until chewing time . I just snuggle her down in my lap and she 'll go to town on this bone for at least an hour.Since she is teething , this is a great bone for her BUT I would be cautious since it is so much softer than other bones .	1
My puppy liked this so well it disappeared in no time . Wish it was just a little more difficult to chew yet still tasty .	1
My Frenchie likes this chew toy a lot . He has many toys and I find him carrying this one and chewing on it often . It is rugged and has nubs on it that I am sure feel very good on his teeth and gums as he is getting his adult dog teeth .	1
I purchased this for our Chug puppy Gatsby . He has very sharp teeth and a hard bite . This toy has held up wonderfully with a lot of play still looks brand new..one of his favorites !	1
My yorkie poo just loves this . It is small and easy for her to use for teething . She carries it everywhere ! !	1
I thought they would be good for her chewing but my schnauzer is not interested in them very much , she prefers her soft toys that I have purchased for her	1
My dog just loves to chew and this . Its not too big for her little mouth . She only weighs 8 lbs , so she can carry it around with her and chew to her hearts content . I would recommend this for all dogs that love to chew on things .	1
Thanks amazon ! Saved me a bundle repairing rather than buying new . Have large dogs that play often , lost contact point on one the collars ; received kit and repaired it without having to buy a new collar ( for approx . 10x cost of Accessory pack ) .	1
This did the trick ! And they sent enough pieces that when my dog lost/broke another piece , I already had what I needed .	1
I got this ( and some Lupine 1-Inch Wild West 16-24-Inch Containment Collar Strap for Large Dogs ) because while roughhousing in the yard , one of the PetSafe collars came off one of the dogs , and ended up getting mauled as a chew toy . While the receiver itself was okay , one of the prongs was missing . This solved my problem right away.Since then , I 've raided this same stash a couple of times for replacement parts in similar circumstances .	1
I did n't realize that the probes needed to be tightened until my pup lost one ! Amazon came to my rescue and I had this in 2 days ! We did decide to go with the longer probes to ensure our dog 's compliance .	1
I needed this because my dog lost one of these from his collar Worked just like and original . Collar works well	1
I really did n't like the way it looked at first , but it works well and it 's easy to clean . I was going to buy a glass drop checker but after I bought this one I figured I would just stick with it .	1
I had way too much CO2 to start and after my first fill of this checker turned green it never returned to a blue even after I had the CO2 turned off for over a day . I refilled it and it seems to be working much more accurately now . As someone told me , this is an indicator but the true test is to see how your fish are doing . If the fish are gasping for air you have to much CO2 regardless of what this is telling you .	1
The product works , and is good for a quick reference , especially when starting out . I can easily see from across the room or even another room what color it is . If I glance over and see it 's a light green , I can make adjustments before the fish start showing signs . Or if it 's blue , turn it up . This should n't be used to get an exact reading , it does not give any indication of what the actual PPM is . If you 're looking for an actual CO2 reading , make sure you have pH and KH liquid tests . Use an online calculator to determine CO2 based on those 2 readings.The only complaint is that it takes a while to adjust to current levels . Expected based on how it works though . Also , they supply a very small fluid bottle . They say it 's only good for a few weeks before you have to switch it out , then you have to go spend more on it .	1
I love the Fluval brand they always provide great quality products . I used this in my planted tank and it worked well . However , I wanted something a little more aestheticly pleasing , so I decided to go with the Glass CO2 Drop Checker .	1
Choices are limited when it comes to CO2 indicators . I decided on the Fluval only because it was readily available on Amazon . It was simple enough to set up . I added the indicator solution , turned it upside down , and added it to my tank . It took a good 6 hours before the solution turned green . I have no fish in the tank right now , only plants.It must be working because one day , I plugged my CO2 tank in but forgot to open the valve . My tank went an entire day without CO2 . When I got home from work , the solution was blue . By the end of the following day , it was back to green.I think the key is to be patient . It does not provide real time results . Wait several hours before adjusting the amount of CO2 an wait several hours between adjustments .	1
easy product to use . just fill it turn it upside down and stick it on the wall of the tank . reading the co2 range is easy yellow is too high green is just right and blue is too low .	1
Have not had the leakage problem others have reported . I like that it comes with a solution that does not require mixing . just pour it in and stick it at about 4 inches deep and you are done ,	1
LIked the product and it looks nice it does what is supposed to one problem is that the thing will not sit straigh in the tank with the suction cup it is a little tilted , but the color is nice and easy to read , have not had any problems with leakage or anything of that nature .	1
The design makes it very easy to read and looks pretty cool and modern.Basically this is how this product works.1 . Remove the cap and put 1ml of the included solution inside ( Fill up to the line , pretty simple ) .2 . Put the cap back on the base ( with suction cup ) and slowly flip it so the point is now facing up.3 . Place inside the aquarium , preferably somewhere where no air bubbles may become trapped underneath , ruining the results.4 . Give it a few hours to get the correct reading initially.Few placement tips : -Again if air bubbles are being trapped underneath from a co2 air stone ( etc ) or just a regular air stone it will cause inaccurate results.-Try to place it 4-5 inches from the top of the aquarium , in a spot where you can clearly see the colour.-Make sure your tank has good water movement to ensure accurate resultsIt says the solution lasts 2-4 weeks which is somewhat vague . I guess I would replace the solution every 3 weeks ? It also only includes 10ml of solution so this wont last that long . Around 6-8 months probablyThis is a great little tool to tell if your plants are getting enough CO2 . It will not tell you ph or kh and those must be monitored separately.Overall if you do n't mind getting a replacement solution every few months , this works great , and is the best at what it does .	1
if your not using serious amounts , this is literally all you need . If your doing pressurized co2 , and doing alot , id get something better	1
Although not as `` pretty '' as a fancy glass drop checker , this does n't look bad at all once it 's in the aquarium , and the premixed indicator solution makes it foolproof to use . Just squeeze in the indicator solution up to the line ( the bottle has enough for at least 3 refills ) and you 're ready to go -- no need to mix up a reference solution , etc etc.Superbly convenient and the indicator solution seems to perform well for at least 6 weeks for me . It 's accurate enough to show me daily variation in CO2 and showed me clearly when I was over the top with gas -- as verified by an algae explosion . I now keep the indicator showing a nice deep to Kelly green during the day , and growth is spot on with algae in check.A good buy !	1
This food was an absolute blessing when one of our cats became very sick & just plain would n't eat anything that she normally would go for . The ingredients are AMAZING ( ! ) ... raw meat & some vitamins in a freeze dried ( no smell ) product . My kitty liked both the dry version ( right out of the bag ) and wet ( I mixed a small amount of broth with it ) with very little waste since I could mix up whatever I needed at any given time ( rather than wasting it by having too much ... as often happens with canned food ) . I have another kitty that considers the medallions a treat , but sticks to her usual dry food ( or likes a `` dusting '' of a crushed medallion on top ) . If your cat has health challenges ( or is older & has sensitive digestion ) , I can not recommend this highly enough . It 's healthy , packaged in a super convenient way , and lasts a long time if you need to store it ( a perfect pet food for food storage purposes ! ) . I adore this product and have told my vet & several friends about it ... it 's THAT good ! The BEST pet food I 've tried ... .EVER !	1
I bought this primarily for my aging cat who needs to get the best there is . I add either Catsip or canned food to it , but sometimes just plain . She seems to like this as well as their Turkey flavor . This flavor ( I have bought this Chicken flavor from another retailer as well ) seems to have harder time to reconstitute than Turkey . For those who like softer mosels to give as is or to easily and quickly reconstitute , the Turkey version is MUCH softer for some reason . I am going to experiment it with KMR ( small amout in place of Catsip to increase calories which she needs . If anyone has any thought on this idea , let me know .	1
I 'm a big believer in feeding cats only a raw grain free diet . But since I really have an aversion to handling raw meat , I 've been trying to find a raw frozn brand that is a convenient form factor , and my sales rep at Pet Food Express suggested I look at the freeze dried options . I bought Stella and Chewy as a back up meal for those times the raw medallions are n't thawed out in time , or when I 'm in a rush and ca n't warm the food to `` mouse body '' temperature ( to quote Dr Lisa Pierson from [ ... ] I was skeptical about freeze dried , thinking the texture would be gross . But as it turned out , My 12 week old kittens wolf down Stella and Chewy Chick , Chick , Chicken flavor like its the most delicous thing they 've ever had . They even chase me down to lick my fingers . I guess you can say its finger lickin ' good ! I still like the idea of the frozen raw for their primary meals , as it seems much closer to what nature intends . So I feed them raw frozen meat 6 out of 10 times , then weave in either canned or freeze dried grain free options . S & C will always be my back up meal for a grain free alternative . My only wish is that they did n't use pumpkin seeds as a filler . That does n't seem great to me , but I 'm hoping it 's a minimal amount . I 'd love for S & C to sell a freeze dried poultry only cat food with no fillers . The only freeze dried foods I 've found , even grain free ones , use other fillers and/or are fish or hoof based animals . This Chick , Chick , Chicken is the closest thing I 've found so far to being a wholesome and convenient grain free non-canned , non frozen meal . Very nice alternative to include in my rotation of healthy cat foods .	1
1 of my 3 cats LOVE LOVE LOVE this food , but only eats it dehydrated - when hydrated she tends to snub her nose at it . The other two cats are extremely picky anyway , so I do n't think it 's the product so much as my cats in general .	1
I have 2 kitties , one who is 20 years old and needless to say has dental issues as well as herpes from birth . He is on a small dose of antibiotic every day prophylactically and I have to hide the pill in his food . I was trying many kinds of wet food and throwing so much away because he would carefully eat around the pill , or would n't eat at all . He does n't have a strong sense of smell since his nose is always stuffed up . This food is perfect for him because once you rehydrate it it has a strong smell and he likes it so much he does n't notice the pill is hidden . He has gained weight and his fur has gotten more shiny . His appetite is so much better . ( My other kitty likes it as well , but she is only 3 and should be eating dry food ! ) I really recommend this if you have an older cat who needs encouragement to eat .	1
My cat ( and dog ) love Stella & Chewy 's food . The freeze-dried is great for travel and I keep some on hand for emergencies . It saved the day after Hurricane Sandy !	1
I 'm crazy about my cat . No , I do n't call her my `` kid '' or dress her up in costumes or buy her Martha Stewart bowls ... But I do make sure she has the best of everything that she needs to stay healthy . I feed an all-wet diet , including whole raw meat and several brands of canned food . I thought Stella & Chewy 's might make a good addition to her food rotation , and I was right ! Pros : My cat is really , really picky about her wet food . She eats this stuff happily . I was a little worried about spending $ 25 on ordering something she might not eat , so before I purchased it , I inquired about samples . The S & C ; 's rep said that all samples are given at the retail level and I 'd need to attend a demo to get them . The nearest demo location is about half an hour away , so I just went ahead and ordered . Fortunately , it was a hit.The ingredients are GREAT.Unless a cat has protein sensitivities , it 's a good idea to give as many different protein sources as possible , and most of the S & C ; 's cat foods have at least two . My cat has dry skin and loves chicken , so the salmon and chicken flavor went over well with both of us.I like the fact that it uses meat ground WITH bone ( this is very nutritious ! ) , no `` byproduct meal , '' and of course no grains . As an added bonus , it has NO starch ! Most wet foods have at least a little starch as a binder . Starch is not bad for cats , per se , as long as you do n't give them too much , but it 's not ideal . The only valid purpose it serves in cat food is as a binder . Additional starch is really just filler . There 's plenty of protein ( 45 % ) and a lot of fat ( 25 % ) . That does seem like a lot of fat , but keep in mind that cats are obligate carnivores - a high-fat diet is actually very appropriate for them . If you want your cat to lose weight , cut the carbs and limit food intake - do n't cut the protein or fat ! Kitties need lots of both , and S & C ; 's provides plenty.Raw meat provides maximum nutrition for carnivores . I like to give my kitty as much raw meat as possible . Commercial and homemade ground raw diets do n't provide the same dental health benefits as whole raw meat , but as long as it 's raw , most of the benefits are still there.I love to see probiotics in my cat 's food ! Cats do n't produce them the same way humans do . They 're designed to get quite a bit of them by eating their prey 's digestive system , which contains a lot of probiotics . They also get some by eating grass and other plants . I provide my cat with oat grass , but it 's great to have them in her food as well . Food that 's sold wet ( wet raw , canned , etc . ) ca n't have live cultures on it . Those have to stay dry . The fact that S & C ; 's is freeze-dried means that she can have her probiotics and her wet food , too - I just have to take a couple minutes to rehydrate.I am always in favor of cat food being wet . Kibble does n't help their teeth at all , and they really need their diet to be about 70-80 % water ( see catinfo.org for why your cat should eat wet ! ) . Freeze-dried food is lighter , which makes it cheaper to ship and cheaper to buy , but my cat still gets all her water when I rehydrate the nuggets.The meat in S & C ; 's is very safe . I always like to see human-grade meat in my cat 's diet . It 's safer for her and for me . No antibiotics or hormones ! And do n't worry about things like salmonella hurting your cat - cats are n't nearly as susceptible to the type of bacteria from raw meat that bothers humans . Because it 's raw , and because USDA-inspected meat has low sanitation standards to begin with , you will want to wash your hands carefully after handling this food . However , you wo n't need to worry about the dangers of feeding your pet overseas chicken , and you 'll be less likely to come into contact with nasty stuff yourself while handling this product.All the ingredients come from North America . Also , each batch is tested prior to packaging , and the results are posted on their website for public viewing . Yay for a company being open about their manufacturing ! Cons : I do normally like to see a *little* fruit and veggie in there for additional fiber and vitamins , and there were n't even cranberries ( to support urinary health ) in this product.It 's really , really expensive . Even considering the fact that feeding guidelines are always pretty high regardless of brand ( I would only feed my cat half of what S & C ; 's recommends ! Holy crap ! ) , I 'd still spend around $ 600 a year feeding my cat if I used S & C ; 's exclusively . Yeah , no . Not happening . However , since I do like this product a lot , I use it for one of her two daily meals about twice a week.The directions say that it 'll take one minute for the nuggets to rehydrate . Nope ! It usually takes about two minutes for my cat 's food to rehydrate , and that 's if I use more water than the directions state and break up the nuggets about halfway through.Overall , I think this is a great cat food . I wish I could afford to use it a bit more often , but such is life . If you 're considering a commercial raw diet , I think this would be a great product to try out . As I said , I 'm stringent about my cat 's nutrition , and this definitely meets my standards !	1
Just like the other Stella and Chewy 's flavor we ordered a while back , our picky kitty loves this stuff ! We rehydrate a little each evening to serve alongside her dry kibble and she 's a happy cat !	1
This is much healthier than cooked food . Cats need moisture in their diet , and should not eat a dry kibble product.This is better than any sort of canned junk people buy for their cats . It 's a great product for something storebought , and is a much more pure diet.But why not feed actual raw , not dehydrated , meats/bone/organ ? This is a great convenience product to have on hand , or to mix with raw , but I would not feed exclusively a dried product , anymore than I would eat all my dinners from frozen meals . Fresh !	1
I have two cats that have been eating some of the healthiest canned foods out there , Avoderm , Nature 's Variety , Wellness , Natural Balance , they like some brands better than others , but one of them , Frau Kitty , has been having some acid reflux , after eating canned food she sometimes throws up a little , so a friend recommended me freeze dried raw food . I even tried directly raw food , I shared some salmon sashimi with them and some other raw safe fancy food , but they are not very thrilled on the idea of raw food ( except when they killed poor birds and mice , and still they only killed them and did n't eat them : ( ) anyway , at first they were n't crazy about Stella & Chewy 's Salmon and Chicken dinner , in fact I got smaller samplers of each of the Stella & Chewy flavors , the Salmon & Chicken was the one the liked best ... in order for them to eat it a first , I sprinkled some of the stuff I know they love , like Halo Liv-a-Littles Freeze Dried Chicken Treats , it 's a good way in case your cat does n't want to try a new food , just sprinkle some of the food they DO like on top of the new one , once they start eating , chances are they will continue , do n't get discourage if they do n't , many times they will only lick the good stuff they know about and leave the new food untouched , but then one day , they will eat it ... after about 2 weeks , my cats are totally sold on this food ! I occasionally give them some of the canned food , just so they do n't get bored of eating the same stuff everyday ( it 's a lie that cats get sick when you switched foods , they do if you give them bad quality foods , but a treat now & then of a different food is actually good for them ! ) now they prefer this food than the canned one ! Also I add some chopped kitty grass to the mix , a total gourmet dish twice a day ! I do feed them some dry food as a treat too .	1
I 'm very happy with the quality and palatability of this product.I had been feeding raw food to my two cats when one of them was diagnosed with secondary lung cancer . She became very fussy and would no longer eat much , if any , raw food . I wound up throwing out large amounts of the raw food I had been using . I found this product online and figured I would try it - at least it would n't spoil as fast , and maybe I could get some better quality food into both of my kitties . I was apprehensive when I tried it at first , but my sick kitty enjoys small amounts of it once it is rehydrated . She will also eat a little of it if I break up the dry nuggets into smaller pieces . The other kitty also likes it - so it may become part of my regular catfood purchases.The only drawback I can find is that the nuggets tend to break apart when the package is moved around such as in shipping . Not a problem for rehydrating , but a little messy .	1
High quality - my dog loves it ! Believe this one will last a long time . Keeps those little chewers away from various home objects .	1
My 11-pound Maltese loves this ring bone because of its texture . He goes more for texture of the Nylabone rather than flavor and will normally choose a textured one over the smooth plain Nylabones regardless of the flavor . He chews happily on this one all the time . However , since it 's a Petite size , it will be chewed up a lot sooner . The Regular size ones last him a whole lot longer .	1
My dog is a maniac chewer . She can go through a raw hide in minutes and the same with those busy bones that are supposed to take a while . This nylabone is still going strong . She loves it . She has chewed every part of it and has not broken off any big pieces . Sometimes a tiny piece ( the size of a piece of rice ) may come off but that is it so far .	1
This dura chew lasts a long time ! My dogs had it for awhile . They loved to chew on it and it prevented them from chewing up my things !	1
I have a dog that can chew up anything ! This actually lasted ! She loves it and carries it around with her .	1
my dogs love all nylabones , and this is a favorite ... .have two large labs and they love working on this bone	1
my dog like his kibbles more than treats ( he LOVES to eat ! ! ) , and with this sprinkled on top of his food , he refuses to eat . the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And , even when i hand fed him the food , he still tried to play with his poop . ( granted , he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction ) Overall , it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop , but that same smell is present on their food , which obviously repells them.So , I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING .	-1
This product did n't work for my dogs at all , and the smell of it was difficult to put up with ( for me ) . It smelled like a Christmas candy cane gone all wrong . I put it in front of them on their ( dry ) food , I 've never seen two dogs so sad to eat their food in my life . My dogs usually chow down their food really fast . Eventually I started mixing it with a bit of pumpkin to make it more tolerable for them . In the end thogh , it did n't work and my only solution seems to be keep an eye on them like a hawk when they 're out ( in the fenced on yard ) and dispose of the poop within a minute of it hitting the ground .	-1
waste of money ... does not work for my shepherd and must taste nasty as he does not like his food as much . Worth a try but did not work for me . He still eats poop ... ugh .	-1
I fed it to my german shepard . My dachshund still eats his poop . It does not work It does not work	-1
Save your money , not worth the price . This did not work on my dogs and I would not recommend it at all .	-1
Used the whole jar and my dog still is eating his poop . It was hard to get the dog to eat its food as they did not like the SEP in there foodIt 's worth trying but it may not do the trick	-1
I purchased 2 of these Blitz lavender and cream colored bins at PetSmart years ago . I use them for dry dog food . I was pleased to find a matching one on Amazon as I now have more to store . ( I subscribe to Amazon premium dry dog foods , which is both a great bargain and convenience ) . Yes , some of the food can tumble out when the bin is full and you have the bin positioned as shown . If you turn it so that the door is on top , the problem is solved . My dogs can not get into these containers , nor do vermin . I have found them very durable , and you can clean them as you like every so often with bleach or alcohol or whatever product you prefer . One of the main reasons that I like these is that they are actually pleasant to look at . You can also open the door with one hand . I have small dogs , so food lasts fairly long . If I had larger dogs , I would probably opt for a larger container . I have just ordered another from Amazon . Until I read the reviews , I had not considered using them for anything but dogfood - but I might consider how they could help me with other storage needs.My package just arrived , and much to my disgust it contained a Bergen storage bin ( does n't match ) in a color that it ugly to me . I have messaged the seller . I ordered from BLITZ , and it was filled by Grady.Amazon , please tell your sellers that they are not allowed to do this .	-1
I have one of these that I have had for years and love it . Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs . In the title this one states Size : 40lbs . However ... .this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs . In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs ( which I did n't read as I stopped at the title ) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much . So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this ... no problem.That is the only reason for the one star . Other than that the product is great for it 's purposes . It is not intended to be air tight . It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes , etc .	-1
I have one female cat that weighs under 10 pounds and is about 15 years old . I had used EverClean for years and really had no complaints . Last year our cat , Poloma , started to urinate more frequently and my back was starting to hurt when I bent down to clean the clumps.I had seen the LitterMaid litter box advertised for several years and had always wondered if it could really be true and work as it was advertised . Sorry , I finally gave in and purchased along with the tent top.The tent top came with several pieces missing/broken . I called the company who asked me to fax the part numbers so they could forward them to me . They sent me the wrong parts and I have not been able to get around to ask for them again . I will though.The machine seems to work to not on the clumps of urine . I have to now clean the clumps out DAILY rather than every few days . The machine tries but is too weak to push , lift and dump . INstead I walk into the room only to see the red blinking light which indicates a jam.I called the company and explained my problem . The only advice they could give me was to be sure and use a quality clumping litter . I would have though the high price I pay for Litter Green would have been considered quality clumping litter . I am now looking for my fouth `` quality litter '' that might work with my single cat.As usual , if it looks too good to be true , it probably is .	-1
I bought 2 when I just got my kittens , they did work well for a couple of weeks maybe a month without a big issueVery noisy , a mess to change the containers , litter gets stuck all over the parts and the engine runs back and forth for hours ! ! Better than Purrforma	-1
Current version of littermaid does not work well at all . The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it . The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original . The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version ( on Amazon ) . It worked for six days and then died . It was replaced at no charge . The second one worked for six weeks and then died . I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase . So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product . This system forced me to give this product at least one star , I would give it -5 if I could .	-1
We have from two to four cats at a time in our home , and managing the litter box is something we want to be as easy as possible . This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried . I 'm afraid it was n't our last , as it had numerous problems.First , the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly . I 'll note that we did n't even try having this be the `` only '' litter box in our home ! We had two others there too . We just wanted to see how well this worked . The storage container would get jammed in the open position , so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However , we could have dealt with those issues . We could have cleaned the tines daily , and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly . The real problem was far more serious.First , understand how this works . The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area , the tines move across , dragging any solids and clumps with it , pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end . Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth , back and forth , driving the poor kitties to distraction . There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them ! We tried several times to fix this , but it really just was n't worth it . We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one . This one went in the trash as we could n't even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it . A large waste of money.Not well recommended.I 'll give it 2/5 stars on the assumption that some units do NOT do that random motion thing - but it would only take one fritz in a lifetime to really demolish a cat 's desire to ever use the unit again : )	-1
I have owned two of these ... the first was replaced for free by Walmart where I purchased it for the same price as here . They are complex structures and I can not imagine anyone who is not a handy man owning one for long . I am and I find it a very poor implementation of a good design idea.The good ... it works and it keeps the bin ready for the next use.The bad ... it does not work for long before things get weak and then ultimately break it . The thing still gets messed up and cleaning all the little corners and angles is a dirty job and it can not be done with a hose because all the electronics are not protected in any way from water . It is not a substitute when one goes away for more than 2 days . I have two cats using this and not full time . I needs to be emptied every two days . You must use good quality clumping litter . The replacement canisters are expensive if you do not reuse them . In fact , it is cheaper to just use a coventional litter pan and throw away the whole thing litter and all instead of using the refuse containers as throw away items . The lids will fall off and need to be taped in place.My unit burned out when one of the cats pulled out the power cord at the end of the unit . It just kept getting fuller and fuller and I was gone for a few days . Even though it is supposed to be protected from running when blocked , when I returned I found the unit almost extended to the refuse bin and the stupid wire which hangs out in the middle of the box had been tangled by one of the poor cats trying to use the unit when it broke . BAD DESIGN ! I am ordering one of the rocking style units and returning my second unit.By the way , the best litter boxes have strong curves at all corners so they are easy to clean . Keep that in mind .	-1
I read all the GREAT reviews here and laid out the money to purchase this item . It 's been a little over a year now and I 'm about to throw mine out.The rake is a pain to clean ... especially if your pet ever has diarrhea ( which mine did the first six months after we saved him from the pound ) . The rake also is super sensitive to overload and will go back and forth 3 or 4 times before giving up and flashing -- essentially jammed and unusable until you physically scoop the problem away , clean the rake and reset it . The sound of the rake going back and forth at all hours of the night is NOT a nice one and no matter what they say , this thing is STILL LOUD ! You have to be really carefully about how much litter you put in the box and if your cat is like my boy and has a good size bladder you 're in trouble.I purchased the tent to go with this , but did n't keep it on because it gets nasty too ... and I read that cats do n't like to go to the bathroom in an enclosed space any more than we like porta potties ! The cost of the plastic containers is prohibitative but at least they can be used over again . I usually scooped my plastic container and left it in until I cleaned the entire box out -- about once a month.If you have a small cat that is in perfect health and has nice neat tiddy excrement than maybe this product would work for you . As for me , I 'm looking for a nice LARGE size old fashion litter box	-1
When I received the Littermate it did not work . I called Littermate customer service . Tech support tried to reconcile the problem , but could not . So , they did replace it , for $ 10 more and I had to send them a bunch of proof of purchase stuff . At any rate , they did send me a new one , but it is very finicky , it sometimes works , even with premium clumping litter , it works sporadically , For such a costly product , it is disappointing .	-1
First off , it seems that someone is spamming the reviews . Each of these glowing reviewers has never reviewed anything else on Amazon . And when a bad review is posted you 'll see several days worth of great reviews to push off the bad ones . [ edit : Note the new `` Amazon verified purchase '' label ! Beware of the glowing review from people who have not purchased this item . ] Let me say , this is the biggest pile of junk you 'll ever waste you 're money on . Even with high quality clumping litter it did not work . The rake would get clogged . The receptacle would n't close . Litter stuck all over the place and in the tracks even though we were well below the `` fill line . '' We spent more time cleaning this piece of junk than a regular litter box . In less than a month we threw it out in the garbage.Do not waste your time and money on this product . Stick with the regular litter , you 'll be glad you did .	-1
I previously had a Mega which worked a couple years . This one was a Total Disaster . Never could get rake to work , Littermaid customer service ( once you finally get to is ) was of little help and Orange Onion ( do n't buy anything from them ) sucked . They could n't care less , at least Littermaid apologized ( on one of my three calls ) . Keep in mind , if you buy it and return it , do it through Littermaid . You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire . To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid ! ) , unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire , do n't let it go ! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment . I wasted hours and hours on this . If only they had a good competitor . They 're sending me the only thing available , the latest model that most people here seem to hate . sigh..if it does n't work , I 'm giving up totally on Littermaid . I have two cats , so it had its uses .	-1
I saw this item advertised for a few years and always wondered if such a device could work . I have one 12 year old cat who has begun to urinate more often . I really never had a problem with her litter box until I hurt my back.I decided to bite the bullet and shell out $ ( ... ) for what looked like a solution to both her more frequent pees and my aching back . Unfortunately , the product did not work . It would rake the premium clumpable litter but could not get the ball of pee into the receptacle before getting jammed and backing off and attempting once again only to fail and return to its original position with the error light blinking.I contacted manufacturer by email only to be offered the feeble suggestion to try several other litter . I went out and purchased three different premium clumpable litters and none faired better.PS . Tent is not any better . I also purchased a tent that is made to surround the litter box only to find several pieces for assembly so flimsy they broke . I contacted manufacturer who asked me to email the part numbers and quantity needed . I did and they sent me the WRONG parts.BSN	-1
I found out about these litterboxes by going into a pet store for cat supplies when I adopted my cat back in 2005 . I liked the idea that I no longer would have to worry about having to scoop out cat waste or have a strong cat waste smell in my home . I bought the LM920 which I found to have a quiet and decent motor . Unfortunately , it only lasted about three years . Then I bought the LM900 as the LM920 was no longer made even though it is superior to the LM900 and quieter . The first LM900 I bought lasted about a year and half , and I found the motor noisy and not very sturdy . The second LM900 lasted about a year . I bought the third LM900 and it only lasted two days before the rake stopped in the dumping into the receptacle mode and would n't move anymore . I had to unscrew the rake so I could empty the receptacle which was full of lovely cat waste , dump the current amount of cat litter and return it to Amazon so I could get a replacement . The replacement one broke also with the rake in the upright position so again , I had to unscrew the rake to get to the almost full receptacle to dump it out . Do n't bother buying the Littermaid LM900 model as it is obviously does n't last . I went and bought the latest version of the Littermaid which is a LME9000 and it is better with a timer so the rake does n't run during during a 9 hour duration but I still run into the rake getting stuck at various times and it also pushes unused litter into the receptacle . I go through way more litter now which is frustrating but it does seem to have a stronger motor .	-1
I should have read the reviews before purchasing.This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level . I must have overfilled by 1/4 '' or so , because it stopped working properly after the first day . The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter , my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control . And another clock in the house is always handy .	-1
I have two cats , I bought this to help keep things clean and tidy , well it was a disaster and here is why.There is a MAJOR design flaw in this litter box , it has no solid scoop only a rake-like feature to pick up the cat waste . Well that is lovely if the waste is n't in any way still damp but if it is watch out ! With the rake-like feature it dug through the waste and stuck in the scooper all the time . Then it would reverse and push the unscooped waste into the mechanisim and it was just gross ! I was useing premium clumping litter so it was n't the litter . I spent more time cleaning this litter box than I did the old fashion kind . I finally threw this thing away after about 6-12 months of trying to deal with it . I went out and bought an old fashioned covered box , it is cleaner , smells better and does n't constantly jam the way my Littermaid did.Maybe if you have one cat of small to average size or even two small cats this thing will work fine but if you have a large cat or multiple large cats this thing is a disaster !	-1
I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years . NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid . This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years , but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off . The cord finally snapped on Monday . Not only the short lifespan considering the price , but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan . No matter what litter brand I tried , it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan , would stick to the rake , and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws , which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea , very poor longterm performance .	-1
This machine never worked the way it was advertised to . It can not handle urine , the urine clumps and scooper gets caught on it . This stresses the motor out to were it resets itself , thus not scooping anything . Or if it does break through it , the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink . I tried five different types of litter , nothing improved the machines performance . I ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as I had to scoop and clean it myself . The plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use . The box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it . You might as well buy litter tray for $ 5 , it will function 100 times better . I use a plastic concrete mixing tray you can get at home depot for $ 6 . It looks just like a litter tray except it is about 2 ' x 3 ' . If you got the room this is the way to go.If you decide to buy this auto-box save the receipt . You will need itIf you want a good auto-box , get the one that uses the disposable trays with the blue crystals . That is a good auto-box .	-1
I bought this product for $ 66 at Meijers . The cats loved it and so did I , for the first 6 hours . The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake , caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours . I was so bummed . It would have made life so much easier . Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked . This is true ! C'mon you engineers . This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on . Great idea but a real mess to clean up . It is getting returned tomorrow . : (	-1
Worked great for a week . What a waste of $ 200 ( I got the `` Mega '' ) . ****update*****After my disaster with the Mega I broke down and bought the `` LitterRobot '' for $ 400 ( I travel and an automated litterbox is a must , not an option ) . Extremely well built but the cats wo n't get near it . The kitten loves it but is n't heavy enough to `` trip '' it so I have to initiate the cycle myself ( not handy when I 'm gone ) . I saw the `` Plus '' version of the LitterMaid at Walmart for $ 88 and decided to give it a try . What a little dynamo . It 's smaller than the Mega but it almost seems like the motor size was the same . Everything the Mega did was a struggle but in this smaller version it 's doing great ! ! ! ! This has been a godsend . The `` Plus model '' can plow through anything . Takes up much less room ( note to the LitterMaid designers- bigger may have sounded like a better sell but my cats only get in it one at a time ) . And if it goes out , at least it was n't $ 200 . This version gets FIVE STARS from me !	-1
The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it wo n't work with my , and my cat 's , favorite litter . Yes it 's a clumping litter . Also the tongs on the rake are very wide . This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin ( even with the smallest clumping litter I could find ) . It wastes a LOT of litter , pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it 's path into the bin ... more of a shovel , than a rake IMO . In order to not waste more litter than is used , I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter ... . far more of a hassle than useful.I would not repurchase this item , nor would I recommend it to a friend ... . an enemy ... . maybe .	-1
We currently have four always indoors cats , we have had as many as six at one time . We have owned as many as two Litter Maids at one time and experienced the same problem with all of them . First the solid waste sticks to the forks and is difficult to clean . Second the trays are expensive and messy to change . I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve , but at over $ 1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it . It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive , they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone . We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month , and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off , but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one . With the ninety-day money-back guarantee you have nothing to loose and I believe you will not want to return it.See my full review of the Scoop Free by going to the product or my clicking on `` See all of my review '' link here .	-1
Works just fine but no longer in use . It Crapped out after about six months .	-1
We bought this item 2 months ago and it quit working after one month.We used the premium litter but the `` cat material '' clumped up and the rake could n't move it . It created a real mess.Also , it sounded like a loud , dying chainsaw whenever it was doing it 's thing . It was just struggling to move even the tiniest amount of stuff .	-1
The tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper , that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods . The problem lies in the structure , which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat . If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do , the frame will break quickly.If you 're minimally handy , you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints ( they 're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store ) . If your cat is heavy and a climber , I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all , unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid , this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it 's worth .	-1
One of my cats absolutely refused to enter it , and did his `` business '' next to the litterbox instead . The big guy flattened it , and a couple of others hated it so much they made a point of spraying it and trying to wipe their butts on it . Needless to say , it ended up in the garbage . It 's not that these cats wo n't use a covered box -- they will and do -- they just really , really hated this tent .	-1
I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand . The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo . Also , the velcro already attached ( not nearly enough to do anything ) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand . Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading , which this does not do . there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro , the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit . Do n't waste your $ $ on this accessory .	-1
I 've had LitterMaid 's since they first came out , and had the very first LitterMaid privacy ( and litter containing ) tent . That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric . So I bought a new one . What an enormous mistake . The new ones do not fit the frame in any way , shape or form . I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight , and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they ca n't be zippered together ! ! ! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front , got the zipper started - and the zipper separated . Okay , put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin . The metal slider itself started to come apart . What a horrible piece of unmitigated JUNK . Do n't waste your money unless LitterMaid announces a major redesign of their litter tents . It 's sad , the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly . Someone , somewhere , cut a few too many corners on this product . The hole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash .	-1
the privacy tent is a very clever item.well made , out of good materials , but highly impractical.the privacy issue with your cat is much less an issue thanbeing able to keep the electronic cat box clean and workingproperly.this tent makes it virtually impossible to see what 's happenedin the box , and to smooth the litter around now and then.this is something you 'll need to be able to do.i bought it , but wound up lining the bottom with a blanket , and a few toys.my cats sleep and play in it .	-1
We purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong . This one arrived with cracked support rods ( different material than original ) and the plastic is stiff and brittle . Contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement . After waiting quite some time , seller advised that their supplier was out of these and issued a credit . Nothing wrong with the seller other than slow on the follow up - the product is just not the quality of the original models .	-1
I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review . The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover . The PVC frame that came with it did n't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing . It does n't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it . I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning . Not a fan	-1
Cheap 'n ' cheezy , just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are . Sure wish they would bring back the older , sturdier ones . Really makes you feel like a captive market , since you do n't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid . I line them with bags , but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid , so have to be replaced despite being lined .	-1
They fill up too quick , they 're too flimsy and litter can fall out , they get stuck too easily . On top of that , they 're too expensive and too wasteful . Stick with plastic bags , or better yet , toss your Littermaid and get a better litter box .	-1
These receptacles offer poor value for the money , and are constructed of very cheap , flimsy plastic.Pros : Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons : Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box ; you 'll have little choice but to purchase these . They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste , but are poorly designed . The problem is that they 're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box . The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors , and with the lack of a tight fit , the odors are very noticeable . In addition ; this company has poor customer support .	-1
These receptacles are the only ones that fit and seem to work in the Littermaid automatic litterbox . They are very cheaply made and crack and break easily . In addition , the tops get crinkled and often do n't go up with the little flap that raises it when the sweeper is being used.I 've found a solution for both that works for me . First I tape two of these receptacles together using a clear packing tape.Scotch 3-Inch Core Mailing & Storage Tape , 48 x 50 Millimeter ( 4 Pack ) ( Scotch tape comes off too easily ) I hold them tightly together and use several pieces of tape in various places around the top . It then looks like one more substantial receptacle . I use an old plastic grocery bag like some other people have mentioned so I can reuse it several times and it 's less mess . I then tape the little bubble things that poke through the top of the flap on the litter box and to the flap . ( On the outside ) This holds them in place when the flap goes up during operation . It eliminates the problem of the receptacle lid not going up with the flap and litter accumulating in front of the box.2/28/09 - I 've found a better and neater solution . Get one of these kits and you 'll never have to buy another flimsy receptacle or cover.PERMA-lid & BAG-it Combo Waste Receptacle Replacement System for Littermaid Litter BoxI 've used mine for about a week and it works great . I 've posted a review there .	-1
If litter maid makes these , why is the quality so much worse on these than on the ones that come with the actual machine ? Wait , maybe I can answer that ... .they do n't want you to return that machine so they are a bit deceptive about the quality of their receptacles for your initial purchase . Come on ... come on companies !	-1
The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid ( for multiple cats ) were very flimsy . The replacement box of 12 ( as shown ) I got afterward were also flimsy . This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over . It does n't make sense not to , but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion.Oddly enough , when we got our second LitterMaid ( regular sized ) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable . Why they arent all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me . Actually , I 'm sure it 's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost , but it 's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy .	-1
There are three main problems with this product . The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base ( where the box fits into the botoom ) . As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result , instead of all of it in this product . Secondly , the top part does not fit into the top well . Some effort required to get it in properly . Thirdly , the product is made of very weak plastic . As a result , if it is filled up , it bends quite a bit ( to the point where it makes handling a chore ) . Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem .	-1
When I received this Ball , I was surprised how big it was , considering it was a 'small ' dog toy.My 9 month old puppy ( Pug & Jack Russel Terrier Mix ) chewed it apart in 30 min . It was a waste of my money .	-1
This was bigger than expected ( my bad , the size is listed ) so it was too big for my dogs .	-1
This `` wiggly giggly '' ball was very disappointing . I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective , which of course amazon was quick to replace . The second one came and was no better than the first one . It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person , but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog , it went mute . He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back . I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $ 12 , I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball .	-1
It takes a lot of work to find the exact roll that will cause one very brief squeacK . The dog will seldom if ever find it . My dog is n't at all interested . It 's a total loss as far as I can see . If a person ca n't even make it work ... ... ... I only gave it one star because there 's no way to give NO STARS .	-1
My dog loved this toy and he got a lot of use out of it . The only problem is the he shredded it the whole time . It was a disaster within hours . The rubber is like a cheap dollar store sqeek toy . He still wanted to play with it , but almost choked on a loose piece , so we had to throw it away . Not worth the money .	-1
At first it looked like it was going to work great ( when the litter was clean ) . After a day or so , it was n't cleaning very well . I got better litter and it started working better , but still not great . Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake . After about two weeks of use , the rake stopped moving backwards . I tried to fix it , but it just wo n't go in reverse . Overall , this was a big waste of time and money . I 'm not even going to try to get another one . A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean . It 's too bad as it had a promising beginning . DO NOT BUY .	-1
When I first purchased the LitterMaid , I was pleased . I never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful . However , I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full , the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close . Sometimes , the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin , creating a stinky mess . This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box , so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time , causing extreme odor and spills . And , with 2 cats , it does not take long to fill that little storage bin , so if you have multiple cats , plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition , I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter . If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box , it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter . After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times ( gross ! ) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out , I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY ! I have never regretted the transition back to an old fashioned litter box , but I DO regret the money I spent on the LitterMaid !	-1
after i bought a top-rated , well-reviewed gps receiver that could n't find a satellite with both hands inside a telephone booth , i thought i could never possibly waste money that badly again.was i wrong . ( note : that is not a question . ) from first use , the thing was either raking or it was off . i could not get it to stop . even if the cat was in the box and touching the `` sensor '' ( yes , those are irony quotes ) , it just kept on plugging away . i turned it on manually when i went in to feed the cats until i had time to call customer service the following weekend . the rep sounded completely unsurprised that i was having this problem and gave me some simple steps to follow to get it to work : unplug it , lift the top part ( the lighter beige you see in the photos , which is clipped to the box by two little green-grey tabs on the sides -- you can see the little square on the side in the photo ) off the bottom part , and run your finger along the track that the wheels follow until you find the reset button . click it on and off maybe 5-10 times , and it 'll work after that . she told me that i might have to do this 5-10 times for it to work ( why 5-10 times ? why both things 5-10 times ? mysteries of life ) , but that it would work . ( i explained all the other troubleshooting things i 'd done , which are described clearly in the manual . ) well , here we are 25 days after ordering , so probably three weeks into daily use . i still have to turn it on and off manually . now , that would n't be a HUGE deal , since i 'm in there anyway feeding the kittehs . however , because i ca n't sense when it 's been 10 minutes since either cat went in , i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed . i think it has happened that way for me twice . the rest of the times , the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey . also does n't sound like HUGE deal , does it ? well ... turns out that the rake does n't hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end . and it ca n't push through the litter if a big ol ' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake 's teeth . so every time it runs now , i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth . usually it still has n't pushed the litter into an even surface by then , so the litter forms little dunes at either end , and it ca n't get up into the resting position . and i do n't want to leave it partially out of the resting position , because that 's down the side of the box into the ... work area , and a kitteh will ... work on it . so i spend at least as much time as i 'd spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way , getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out , and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging . well , i got yer packaging right here , but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition . oh , did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake ? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away -- one of them with no urging at all ( in fact , while i was still setting it up ) , and the other when the old box got dirty enough . the bad news is that i 'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute . the big boxes -- which are easy to scoop , even if that 's no fun -- are much easier for me . and for now they 're in closets or otherwise out of the way , rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished , i 'm aiming for a cat genie , the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle . it 's three times the price of the littermaid , but i 'm betting it wo n't be worse than this . ( i ca n't remember ever writing a negative review before for a product , and certainly not one this negative . think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review . sad . )	-1
I bought this for my older cat and now have gone back to a regular plastic box . It is just too small for turn-around room , thus he urinated several times on top of the box and ramp , with urine leaking in between the space where the ramp connects . It is difficult to clean although I used premium litter . I wish I 'd paid more attention to the negative reviewers and saved my money .	-1
I was betrayed by a dog `` expert '' that swears by these that they 're the greatest thing ever . I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip . The green parts are glued on , but not very well . I do n't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play . Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread . I felt like returning the ball with the green piece , poop and all .	-1
I remember the high pitched , `` Oh no , Mr. Bill '' famous phrase . This does n't sound like him ; it did n't smell right to me ; and my 27 lbs mini golden gutted him in less than five minutes . I had big fiber looking cotton balls all over the floor in minutes . Cute for ... nothing . Save your funds and buy some bones . I do NOT recommend for dogs with teeth .	-1
The frog and duck toys held up so well that I decided to get the teddy bear ( it is SO cute ) . Poor Mr. Bear does n't last a day . My dog is 12 pounds and it is so incredibly easy to chew the limbs off these guys . My dog gnawed off the leg of one of the bears so we bought him a new one ( what were we thinking ? ) He gnawed off another leg . We duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape . Cute toy for small pups if they are n't big chewers but my dog is just determined to eat this thing .	-1
Okay KONG is known for creating some pretty tough , ready to take wear and tear items.This is not one of them.I was looking for a plush like toy my 20 lb dog could play with ... they say there 's not that much stuffing in it . KONG did not have to pick it up from all over the apt.Said brown bear was stripped and gutted in about an hour.Skip this one .	-1
My rottie/lab mix puppy , little girl 4 months old , had it in pieces the first night . The stuffing was the first to come out , so I cleaned out all that and let her have the squeaky part . Bad idea . She chewed it out and literally ate the pieces of plastic . If you have a mild chewer I think it would be ok , but it is not for heavy chewers .	-1
Ohhhhhhhhh ... the mess ! The stuffing was scattered in a matter of minutes . The flat bear was ripped apart and destroyed within a day . Disappointed .	-1
This toy is much too small to be safe for a dog , any size of dog . It is easily destroyed by a small dog and the very small pieces could be swallowed causing a very dangerous situation for your pet . Try the AKC brand of dog toys , they are well-made and much less risly for your beloved pet .	-1
I know this is NOT a chew toy , if your dog is not a chewer than it will be fine for you . My dog is a chewer and unfortunately this poor little teddy bear did not last long in our house ! The price was perfect so if your dog is not a chewer then I would recommend it because its really cute .	-1
Do not buy this toy if your dog has destroyed every other stuffed or cloth toy . Its the same ! Despite being solid under the Kong name , my 6 month old Yellow Lab ripped it to shreds in minutes . Are there any cloth toys out there for Labs ?	-1
Although this is really cute , it did n't last longer than a few hours . But that 's because my dog is very destructive .	-1
My dog really wanted to love this toy . I know , because he carried it around like it was his baby . But he could n't help himself , and within a day it was shredded . WestPaw are the only toys my dog can not destroy .	-1
I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle . I thought no way does she tear through this & # 34 ; indestructible & # 34 ; teddy bear . Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off ... What a joke . KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage . I read the reviews and thought & # 34 ; well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog & # 34 ; ... NOPE , my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes . Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys .	-1
Not work it it 's so tiny and shabby not worth the money at all I 'm not sure it would last now I have to take my little guy to get better one ) :	-1
These are cute toys but be aware : my chewing chihuahua did it in within one day . Cats could enjoy it .	-1
This is very cheaply made . 2 days of my 1.5 pound pomeranian puppy chewing on it and it fell apart . I did n't like the velcro under it for removing the squeaker , and it came with an extra squeaker too .	-1
It only took about 20 minutes before my 30lb puppy tore this little guy to shreds . We kept the & # 34 ; skin & # 34 ; around for a week or so before that too was destroyed . Come on Kong , you 're supposed to have tough and durable products . What gives ?	-1
This thing is so small it should be a cat toy , it 's the size of a catnip mouse 1/2 of the length is the tail . : (	-1
This toy is incredibly small . Will be returning because I 'm pretty sure my 14 pound mutt will swallow it whole .	-1
Okaye , this toy arrived in a little padded envelope . It was tiny . It does not look like the photo . It is about the size of a mouse , only it 's empty except for the squeaker . I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily ... . it 's tiny ! It is good for a small dog puppy , not a larger breed puppy , unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse . My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes . She 's 13 lbs . I 'm not crazy about the velcro and how you can take the squeakers out , that 's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out .	-1
smaller than I thought it would be but true to Kong brand , it is well made and rugged for hours of play . This would be perfect for the toy breeds	-1
It lasted maybe 5 minutes before it hit the trash . Might be good for a small dog , but certainly not a Golden Retriver !	-1
Way too small for any dog that is bigger than the average cat . I gave it away to someone else since it was n't worth shipping back .	-1
It 's like a & # 34 ; nothing & # 34 ; for Jasper my 8 lb Yorkshire mix - he just ignores it . The brown tail of the Beaver looks like Jasper pooed on the floor if I do n't look closely . I would n't recommend it !	-1
So cheaply mad , tiny and paper thin . would probably last a day and my dogs DONT chew up their toys !	-1
This product 's page stated that the product included 4 replacement squeakers , but it only contained 1 . I actually ordered it for the 4 replacement squeakers so I could use them for other toys .	-1
nice size for small dogs but squeaker lasts for about five minutes . you have to keep replacing them . would n't buy again	-1
This looks more like a cat toy than a dog toy . I have a feeling my dachshund will destroy it in a matter of minutes .	-1
I found it way to small to give it to a small dog of any size of dog it would be more suitable for a cat then a dog I dident think it was that small to I really had seen it in person I couldent believe how small it really was in it that it would be more for a cat instead I think	-1
This toy , as described , is 7 inches from nose to end of tail . What I received was maybe an inch and a half . My dog would have choked on it .	-1
My 35 lb . springer spaniel mix is a brutally aggressive chewer . She slaughtered this lamb in ten minutes or so . I bought this toy based on the strong reviews as a last attempt to see if a soft toy could stand up to my dog . This toy faired no better than any other stuffed toys I have purchased .	-1
I bought this for my baby lab puppy and mercy , he only used it the first week we brought him home . It is super small and he quickly fished out the squeaky on the inside . I ended up giving this to a friend with a cairn terrier puppy - probably a much better fit ! This is smaller than the palm of my hand ! ! !	-1
Has n't worked at all . I have 3 cats , all are indoor animals . One got out and picked up fleas in the 3 hours he was out . It just has not worked .	-1
If you 're cat is an indoor cat , yes this product will work well for you . But if your cats go outside like mine , FORGET IT ! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately . But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days , like they advertise . I 've tried Advantage on my cats a few times . The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours . But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before . I 'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half . If the product was n't so expensive , it might be worth the money . But do n't waste your money , because it only works well for a few days . Frontline works a lot better .	-1
I put this on my cat 4 times over a 4 month period . ( He is a healthy 3 year old ) Each time , he reacted more negatively than the time before . Last dose , he acted as if it was stinging him , and he was aggressive and in a bad mood for 2 days . I looked up information regarding counterfeit flea meds and although the vials do have the right wording -- the epa # on the vials is one of two epa # 's that have been counterfeited . I am not taking anymore chances with the last two vials . I am throwing it out . Guess I will have to buy from a more reputable source in order to feel safe about this .	-1
I ordered this advantage and was sent k9 advantix that my dog endedup having a bad reaction to . However the place I ordered from didrefund me the money for the product , so that was good .	-1
I actually would give this product a minus 10 . NEVER use these products on your pets . They are totally toxic - dogs have died from this - even with just 1 use . My friend 's Yorkie had a seizure within 40 minutes of this product being put on him . All of these topicals are poison . Search online for natural flea and pest control ; you 'll find lots of options . One thing we use is neem soap on our dogs ; it not only kills pests but it also repels them . You can also make a natural spray using 1 cup distilled water , several drops of an essential oil like cedar wood , citronella , lavendar , peppermint . You need to also add a tsp of castile soap so the essential oils will mix with the water . Spray on your hands and rub all over your dog 's coat before it goes outdoors in areas where there could be pests . Re-apply every 2 hrs . This is safe for pets and works ; nothing harmful . Do n't get the spray mixture in their eyes , nose and mouth . Vets say these are safe but that 's not true . The companies also only test these products for 30-90 days because they know that longer useage will show damage to the animal 's liver . Anything put on the skin is absorbed into the blood stream and then passes through the liver . NO to this junk ; it 's as bad as spraying your pet with Raid .	-1
After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy . Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it 's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing . Should n't this information be on the box if it 's so important ? I called the manufacturer and was `` serviced '' by very argumentative representative . I do n't think the product is worth the money at all . A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog . You are better off buying from Hartz . At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb .	-1
I started giving Program tablets to my dog late summer / early fall last year . I had been using Capstar ( which works miraculously but is too expensive to use daily as a stand alone ) and read many reviews and articles stating how great Capstar and Program are when used together.My dog has allergies ( nasal and sometimes skin ) . Her hair started thinning out a little in the back and I just figured it had to do with her skin allergies . It very slowly kept getting worse . I have been trying over and over to figure out if there was something that could have been causing this , I realized it started after giving the Program tablets . I skpped the past month 's tablet and hopefully her hair will grow back in . Ca n't decide on a monthly to use on her , because Frontline Plus gives her hives on her belly . I will continue to use Capstar as needed ( a couple times a week or whenever she plays with the neighbor 's dog or grass is long/wet and itching starts ) .I 'm not saying it is a problem for all dogs , but it did cause the hair loss on my dog . This may not be a common side effect , but I ca n't recommend it to others because of this .	-1
I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house . I tried to mix the suspension with their food ( I tried dry food and wet treats ) ... they sniffed it and walked away . I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth . It was messy , they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it . I 'm sticking with Frontline Plus ... much easier for my cats .	-1
I hated these bags ! Yeah I know , I stand alone in this . But I do hate them ! Wen I clean up dog poop , I also clean up any remnants of poop on the grass , sometimes pulling bits of grass out on purpose so as to leave nothing behind ( as best as I can ) . These bags make that impossible . There is no give in these bags for detailed work such as described . These bags are like doing surgery with hockey goalie gloves on . So I am back to standard bags which work great ( I prefer Bags on Board - come off roll clean , never fail/tear/etc. , can pick up more than one pile ( we 've smaller dogs ) , etc ... .	-1
We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance . They were n't kidding . We have a full-size chuckit and this junior version and this really does n't throw nearly as far . I 'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this , so we 've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full-size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we 're in the backyard . This was a waste of money as you can just use the full-size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far .	-1
I have arthritis so I thought this might help me throw the ball for our ball crazy lab . Do n't recommend this one period . its too long if you actually need a thrower and length made it awkward to handle and reload . If you have to use a thrower recommend shorter one . This says classic but it is longer than the ones I have seen at 3 pet stores .	-1
Awkward to use for petite women . It 's only good use is retrieving the ball from the ground even then most basic tennis balls have a hard time fitting in the grip . The balls normally get stuck inside the thing and I have to wiggle it out a little before slinging it . Once I sling it the ball does not really go that far and looks ridiculous . I would n't purchase another toy like this .	-1
so she will bring the ball back and drop the ball . then try to grab at the launcher as i try to pick up the ball with it.sometimes you have to really work to get this thing to release the ball . half the time when i swing it the ball stays in the cup.needs to have some sort of trigger you can use to open the cup when you swing it	-1
Our dog will fetch these , but if she catches a glimpse of one of the other types of chuckit balls- the rubbery ones- she will totally lose interest and only wants the rubbery one . Must feel better in her mouth . They also wont wear out like this one does- they only ever have to be replaced due to losing them . The tennis ball sheds its fibers and will wear out with time .	-1
I got these along with some other Chuckits for my dog , when they arrived I allowed her one of each type to play with . These were broken open and the outside material was all over the house within an hour . Granted she still wanted to play with them , but she was trying to eat the fuzz so I just pitched them . I will stick with Chuckits other toys because she still has all of those in one piece .	-1
My dogs ( lab & golden retriever ) destroyed these in a matter of minutes , then I had to take them away for fear of choking . DO NOT ORDER . All of the rubber chuckit ! balls are amazing and my dogs love them !	-1
Bought Chuckit ball and handle . I have Golden Retriever and after 10 days the ball cracked . It is a heavier ball for distance and thicker rubber ball under cover . It will split real easy after dog has it in mouth.I bought Kong Squeaker 3 inch ball works great ! Save your money !	-1
These are the tennis-type balls that come with the original Chuckit thrower . They 're OK , but they do n't go the distance or have the `` mouth appeal '' of the Ultra Chuckit ball . My yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them , only the Ultra ball or various Planet Dog balls . Plus , according to The Whole Dog Journal , these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that are n't healthy for your dog . Spend the money on Ultra ChuckIt balls ; They cost more but last longer , fly farther , and are easy to clean.This product has been rated by two young Labs ( brothers ) , a Golden Retriever and a Beagle .	-1
My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit ! launcher , however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops . The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces . I thought this was just how life was going to be : forever buying these balls for our launcher . Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it . I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we 're still using on our first ball- amazing ! It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce . Thank you , Chuckit ! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size . I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out , but I wo n't waste my money on these tennis balls .	-1
did not like them , hiding them all over the place , so not going to do this with the nutty dog . he did not like them	-1
Not worth the money . The individual dishes are very small . Maybe if you have a cat this would work well but defiantly not for dogs .	-1
I really wanted to like this feeder , but I do n't . The main problem is that you ca n't program it , you can only set it to go off EXACTLY 6/12/24 hours from the time you turn it on . So if you want to feed your cat at 6am , you better be around at 6pm or midnight to enable it . If you do n't use this every day and always have it turned on , this becomes a major hassle.The ice packs sort of work , but did n't keep the food particularly cold , freezing the food worked much better . They are very thin plastic that you fill with water , and I have a feeling the continual expanding of the ice will eventually break them.After a month I was so sick of trying to get this going at the correct times that I ditched it for the & # 34 ; PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder & # 34 ; . It is much better.I will say though , if you make the necessary modifications ( see the pictures I added to the product ) , this feeder is impossible to break into . So if that is your primary concern , this is a good choice .	-1
This is a great product , or would be if it worked . The removable ice trays are a great feature to keep moist food fresh . There is a problem with the motor , probably a short , because it either runs all the time or not at all .	-1
I bought 2 of these for my cats , and they worked fine for a while . It 's a smart design , but they 've got many flaws.They use a LOT of batteries - the 9 volts die after 2-3 weeks ( so you have to keep a *close* eye on it ) , and they turn very slowly because of the weak , poorly designed motor . They both died within about 6 months , and I had to replace them.Also , it 's not really a 6-day unit - it 's a 6 *meal* unit . Each tray only holds up to 1/2 cup . Since my cats ( normal size ) eat 1/3 cup per meal , I must set the unit to go off twice a day . I ca n't imagine this working for a large dog . And , since the sixth compartment is perpetually open , you can only set it for 2 1/2 days in advance . Not much help for vacations.The person who said their unit has been working for 8 years is either mistaken or lying . This Asian company is barely 3 years old . I have a sneaking suspicion that the seller wrote a review of their own product , using their `` imagination '' & hyperbole.If anyone knows of a better system , please let us know or post a review .	-1
This product is OK if you 're only going away for a couple of days . I used it for about a week and now it is in he cupboard . I like the LeBistro Automatic feeder much better .	-1
I should 've known when I first tried putting in the battery ( when I tried to remove the battery , which is seriously difficult , it ripped off the metal contact point , wasting an expensive but otherwise new battery ) that this product was no good . I figured since Amazon 's return policy is a bit of a pain , I would stick with it and see . Well , about 8 months of using it , it started developing problems ; it would turn halfway , then backtrack , then turn to the intended slot . Now , 10 months in , it completely ping-pongs back and forth -- and it wo n't stop ; I have to turn it off midway and then turn it back on so it will turn to the correct food slot . I figured no problem , I 'm still under the 1-year warranty -- wrong ! I checked the manual and they only offer a 90-day warranty . What ? ! Had they offered a 1-year warranty AND I was out of that 1-year warranty , I would 've bought another one as a replacement . But the 90-day warranty is pretty worthless and shows they have no confidence behind their products . I 've already purchased the QPet Timed Automatic Pet Feeder ( hopefully I wo n't have the same issues ) .Other dislikes : horrible warranty , noisy motor , unable to set actual time ( only 6- , 12- or 24-hour time intervals from initially powering it on ) , uses expensive D battery ( thought the battery has lasted quite some time ) .	-1
I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews . First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart ... very cumbersome . However having said this the green light was on . I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate , 7 am every 24 hours . I had to wait until the next day , well it never rotated . Also the lid is very easy to move . I have a Bengal cat , even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it . I needed the feeder as we are going away . However I returned it . I will look for other options . Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews . Save your time and effort , this product is not worth the trouble	-1
I do n't think these worked very well . It was hard to get my kitty to take them , even though I halved the tablet and hid it in a treat . Finally got her to eat a whole one , and w/in a couple of weeks , I noticed worms again . Took her to the vet who told me the OTC products do n't really work that well . I 'll take her to the vet again next time and not bother w/these or other OTCs .	-1
I used to only buy Science Diet . Knowing my elderly special needs cat did not like his dry food ; I decided to buy a bag of this . Big mistake.He did not like it and after a few days I noticed the cat food dispenser was very greasy ! I decided to give it to another house cat I have , same results , she did not like it.I am the caretaker of a feral cat colony . I have tried it on 7 feral cats and they are not even crazy about it . They eat it but not eagerly . I poured the bag in a food bin and every time I scoop it out , there is oil in the scooper and also on the plate . It is heavy with oils . It even smells disgusting.Sadly after trying this out on nine different cats , I have to say I would not buy this again . Try a sample locally or buy a smaller bag if you can . Not a hit here at all .	-1
I used this food with one cat for five years and figured she was just a puker . After she died , I got another cat at 4 years old and he began to vomit frequently . The lightbulb finally went off in my head- stopped the science diet and the vomiting stopped and has n't returned . Hmmmm.My carpets are happy too .	-1
Horrific cat food made with junk ingredients . If you care for your cat and want the best for them , take five minutes to research what you 're feeding them and I guarantee you , you will not be feeding them this food .	-1
Fits so tight you ca n't get it off . Not kidding . Get a Hill 's brand from your vet . They are free .	-1
I received my order today , and as other have mentioned , there is only one cap although the pictures show a package containing two . I re-read the information given and it does not make it clear that there is only one . At that number , the price is outrageous . Go to a pet store . They are much cheaper there .	-1
Love nylabones , but this just creates extra sharp edges everywhere . It means that our dog was unable to chew/gnaw without constant worry from us . We ended up tossing it for fears of teeth/gum injury . I 'll stick to regular shapes .	-1
My dog loved chewing on this dinosaur toy but after a couple of months he managed to finely shred it to the point that about 20 % of it was missing/ingested . It did n't seem to cause any digestive problems but was disconcerting nonetheless . We 've had better luck with another Nylabone product , theDouble Action Combo Bone Chew Toy , which is still going strong after 4+ years .	-1
The description says this is for & # 34 ; powerful chewers & # 34 ; but both of my dogs ( one is only 17 lbs ) destroyed theirs in short order . There were plastic shards everywhere and they were coughing them up too . Not safe for strong chewers !	-1
It 's durable because it is made of a solid very hard plastic material . My dog is a large dog , 85 lbs , and has only tried to chew on this once or twice since receiving it . She even cracked one of her canine teeth on it . I would n't recommend it . Mine has already found it 's way to the garbage can . Broken teeth ? No thanks !	-1
My dogs are 2 and 8 years old . They had no interest in these bones . Perhaps a puppy who has a strong urge to chew would like these . They have no smell and are a slick plastic texture .	-1
I got this toys along with a few others for my one year old Lab pup for Christmas . This is the only one he does not play with .	-1
This is a TERRIBLE dog toy . We received the Stegasaurus version of the toy . The & # 34 ; seams & # 34 ; from the plastic mold are incredibly hard and actually sharp . Unfortunately I gave this to the dog without first investigating it and he quickly began bleeding from cut gums . Even if you & # 34 ; shaved & # 34 ; those off , the Stegasaurus 's wide , awkward shape is bad for a medium or small dog at least . The hard bumps all over the outside seam weird . If they were softer , I could see how it would be a gum-massage but these are super hard .	-1
My Pit Brock chewed his head off in one hour ! if you have a pit do n't waste your $ $ $ not worth it	-1
My lab chews through every single toy except Kongs . He has already eaten the head off of this and I notice that little white plastic pieces come off . Not for my dog . I would suggest if you have a hard chewer to stick with Kong toys .	-1
Do not get this if you care about your dogs.I called Nylabone up to complain about this product.They said it is not for chewers.My dog is a golden retriever.Within 2 minutes of biting on it , it started to come apart .	-1
When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town . As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog 's mouth from the sharp edges . He is an aggressive chewer and did n't want to see it go , but it really required too much supervision than I felt comfortable with .	-1
& # 34 ; Chipped & # 34 ; away to easy ... ... ... I do n't like the idea of hard plastic pieces in my puppy 's tummy ... ..threw it away after a day & got a bigger heavier duty one ... ..he is a very powerful chewer ... ... ..	-1
Dogs do n't pay any attention to it . It just sits there . They love Kong toys though and have liked other Nylabone chew toys , just not this one . I do n't know why .	-1
This product was recommended by our Bulldog Rescue organization , but when we gave it to our English Bulldog , the little nubs came off in his mouth and his mouth was bloody . We threw it away . Perhaps this would work for smaller or gentle chewers .	-1
This is very hard ! My pup does n't want to even lick this thing . Once I took it out the package I knew he was n't going to like it . Guess I 've should of payed attention to all the bad reviews .	-1
Do not buy this so called & # 34 ; chew & # 34 ; toy ! There is no way a dog could safely chew on this VERY tough and HARD thing ! As soon as we handled it , banged it on the counter , and saw how DENSELY it 's made , it got the deep six . Looks dangerous IS DANGEROUS - protect your dog - do n't have this in the house !	-1
After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues , I 'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew . I even tried coating it with yummy stuff ( peanut butter , etc . ) to get my dogs to take interest , but they 'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew . My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd , Rottweiler , Pit Bull , and Border Collie , so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item . I 'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year . It 's going in the trash .	-1
Stick with the bone shaped . The little details bits can get chewed off the stegosaurus . I 've liked that the nylabone bones because it typically only get little bits scraped off but The heads tail and feet all can break off . I 'd still say its safer then most toys out there but chewers need to beware	-1
It did however get sharp after the dogs played with it for a couple of weeks ... .finally had to throw it out cause I was worried it might hurt the dogs gums , or someone would step on it and slice their foot open	-1
I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell . We got the stegosaurus toy and so far , it 's held up . She 's a ferocious chewer -- we ca n't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits . The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body , and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once , meaning she ca n't play with this unless we 're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it . It would 've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering . I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured , which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail . The good news is , steggie does n't have a small projectile head or tail , but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail , so no worries about small pieces coming off there . The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars , but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.UPDATE : I have lowered my rating to 2 stars . She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs , tail , head , and half the body . I do n't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion , but I ca n't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone 's digestive tract any favors .	-1
My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT . Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received . The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal . It is all angular and sharp points . My dog would n't even touch it . She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we would n't know the difference . I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them . From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance . Very upset with this kind of business practice . All nylabone products ARE NOT equal .	-1
bear pays no attention to it . But time may change that . It stays among his toys . He has not found a way to brake it which is a plus for him .	-1
I 've got the T-Rex one . It does n't feel like rubber , it feels like hard plastic ! It 's also pretty sharp around the edges . I 'm surprised at the number of 5 star reviews . Maybe it 's just me but I 'm not giving it to me puppy 'cause I 'm afraid it might hurt his gums .	-1
I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos . I bought this product selfishly , because I like dinosaurs . Unfortunately , the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody 's business and left sharp shards sticking out . She only had it for a short time under ( sort of laxed ) supervison , but when i looked down the thing 's entire tail was covered in blood . Into the trash it went . Moving forward , I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones .	-1
I am a dog trainer , for 30 years , this should have been pulled years ago . the parts break off and get wrapped in the dogs guts , kills them , or huge vet bill for surgery . recently one of my sheltie clients did not heed me , lovely dog , huge huge vet bill.DO NOT BUY AT ALL ! ! ! ! ! DOG TRAINER WARNING ! ! ! !	-1
My teething puppy ( chocolate bullador ) preferred this toy to nylabone 's teething toys and has no interest with his permanent teeth . He has the same reaction to the bacon-flavored hollow stick.Before buying , know your dog 's chewing style ; not just based on breeds , but your actual pet . I have done a fair amount of research online , reading reviews , and talking to pet store clerks to find out this is not an uncommon behavior . Teething puppies are figuring out the world and will put anything in their mouth but may prefer a hard surface to push their teeth against into their gums . Then , with adult teeth , they may want to use their powerful teeth to destroy . So , this toy will likely fail to redirect destructive behavior because they will not be able to cause any damage . My dog quickly lost interest and started gnawing on his previously ignored teething bone , which I had to quickly take away after two days . He got one good day out of the teething bone , exposing the dental bristles , but was breaking off much larger pieces on day two and would have destroyed the whole thing in under and hour if I had not separated him from it . Now , I am stuck with two durachews and not quite sure how to spark his interest in either.Pro : Teething puppy looking for hard surfaceCon : Useless for powerful chewer that can not dent	-1
This product was a lot harder than I thought it would be when purchased . It 's the toughest plastic , with hard raised bumps.My puppy is a very heavy chewer ( destroyer ) , and seemed to really like this chew , but I took it away from her . It made terrible cracking noises , and I was afraid she was going to break her teeth .	-1
I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it . It 's super rock hard ! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents ' golden retrievers to see if it interests them . Also , I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout . Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex ! Instead I got the Stegosaurus . Perhaps that 's why she does n't like it : )	-1
I was so excited just before Christmas to find these at such a reasonable price since they Nylabone - our dogs are generally crazy about them - but these two have gone virtually untouched . I think are they are a little harder and the spikes are pretty 'rough ' ... we have two dogs - large and medium and neither one are too taken with them . We will most likely offer them to the dogs next door to try ... .	-1
Purchased this for my dog who almost choked on it . Vet later warned me that these `` chew toys '' are hazardous to dogs . I tossed it . Waste of money .	-1
We purchased the Stegosaurus at a local pet store the day we adopted our cattle dog mix . At the time she was about 45 pounds and 8 months old . We did not know what kind of chewer she was , but felt that a product designed for `` powerful '' chewers up to 50 pounds would be a safe choice . It was not . She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her , she swallowed several very small pieces . And much to our embarrassment , at her first vet visit ( 3 days after adoption ) we were told to stop giving her whatever `` white plastic '' toy she was chewing and eating . Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them.I am giving this product 1 star because:1 ) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up2 ) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale , our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up3 ) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog .	-1
So far my puppies will play with or chew on anything BUT this . I do like nylabone brand but this is n't the best so far ... .	-1
My dogs usually love nylabones dental chewy stuff but not this one . It is very hard plastic and some dogs like that but not mine . Not worth trying as an experiment .	-1
Careful people ! Even though this chew toy says for powerful chewers , it also says for dogs up to 50 lbs in VERY tiny print on the bottom of the package . I gave it to my 79 lb Lab Mix puppy anyway , since I had already bought it ... and lo and behold , it began falling apart in only a few moments.After removing the toy and picking up the white bits all over ... I thought to come here and warn people . I find it odd how it 's for powerful chewers yet only includes medium sized dogs in the toy description ! With pit bull terriers and a few other smaller breeds as an exception ... usually smaller dog means less destructive chewing ability . Senseless , really.If you have a dog that falls under this weight category ... except for a breed with very powerful jaws , this toy probably suits just fine , but if you have a large dog , do n't even think about it . I paid almost $ 9 for a toy that begun to disintegrate within a few seconds .	-1
I bought this quite a while back . At first my dog did n't take to it , but it 's now one of her old go-to toys . Why 2 stars ? This thing gives my dog an unfair advantage in the house . If we 're playing 'chase ' , this is the only toy I can never get away from her because it hurts my hands to hold on to . She also leaves it in strategic locations as to cause the bare foot the most damage . Overall , it 's a good toy for a dog and not a person .	-1
This looks like a figurine in actual . It 's pretty heavy for my 5 month old puppy . I felt like she is lifting a rock and I was concern that her jaw might hurt .	-1
The dog chewed it once and will not go near it now . I am not certain if it is the item , the hardness or what , but the dog does not like it .	-1
So while I was getting ready for my new corgi puppy I purchased this from Amazon . I thought , `` Hey -- good for strong chewers and he 'll be teething ! Perfect ! '' Add to that the fact that I love dinosaurs and this was a must.At a checkup for my cats before the dog came home I talked to my vet about some of the concerns with the new puppy , and her recommendations for good chew toys . She warned us against the white Nylabone toys specifically . She did n't want our dog to have anything harder than a tooth to chew on ( including bones and hard plastic toys like this ) because of the potential to crack his teeth . Even though he 's a puppy , she was concerned about the possibility of infection and abscess in a cracked tooth and the dangers of putting a puppy under for oral surgery to extract the cracked tooth/teeth . I 'm glad she did warn me because I never would have known.As soon as we got back from the appointment I returned it and Amazon gave me a refund no problem ( five stars for the customer service there ) , so that was good . In retrospect , I can see she was right . If nothing else I could have kept the toy to beat up any intruders in my apartment -- it really is that hard .	-1
My vizsla puppy loved this toy and started to chew it right away . In 5 minutes there were a lot of small and very sharp pieces everywhere . I had to throw the toy out . My puppy destroys everything and chews on toys really hard so this chew toy was n't the right choice for him . But it would probably work with dogs who are easy chewers .	-1
My 6 month old , 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products . She was really interested in this one , HOWEVER , the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp , flaking mess ! This chew piece ( & # 34 ; for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs & # 34 ; ) is NOT good . It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big , pink , patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted , sharp plastic of this T-REX . We were so excited to get a new chew , but it 's awful ! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing . I suggest Nylabone take this product OFF the Market . We 're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers , hooves & other natural chews from now on ! THUMBS DOWN , NYLABONE . = (	-1
This is suppose to be one of there tuffest bones . Our dog had it 5 minutes and she had it broken apart into tiny sharp shards . 24 hours later we had to rush her to the emergency vet only to find out part of this toy was blocking here intestine . Stay away form this toy , or you may have a huge vet bill like we did , $ 3000 to remove a chunk the size of your pinky .	-1
but it makes me nervous . These are extremely hard . I got one for the little power-chewer ( 16 pound standard dachshund ) and he likes the little bumps and the stego shape even though it 's a little big for him ... Little Remy has great teeth and a strong jaw , and does well with toys and treats made for dogs that are a bit bigger than him ( for reference , he chewed through a giant rawhide bone that was longer than he is which I only gave to him for a Christmas laugh ) . But I will probably take it away from him . It 's too hard and has no give ; it actually feels like solid plastic . I dislike Nylabone 's sizing because saying & # 34 ; up to xxlbs & # 34 ; seems misleading . This toy does not look or feel safe for the teeth of dogs & # 34 ; up to 35 pounds. & # 34 ; Personally , I would even hesitate to give it to a larger dog like my sadly departed black lab , who never had a bad tooth in her 13 years.If your dog has any dental problems , avoid this toy . Weak teeth might not be able to hold up against it . But the dino shape and bumpy texture are very interesting to dogs , so I wish that there were softer version of this toy.Also watch out because these are about as fun to accidentally step on as Legos .	-1
I have three dogs . Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier . None of them like this toy . They have had several Nylabone toys , but this one is the least favorite . Each of them tried it out , but they all got bored with it fast . It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp . That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys . After handling it myself , I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth .	-1
Did n't interest my dog at all . He would rather chew up the plastic down spout . At least he did ruin it and swallow big pieces .	-1
My three dogs found nothing interesting with this toy . I do n't even they smelled eat . It is worthless . Do not buy	-1
My dog ignored it . Had to throw it away . What else can I say about something that my dogs do n't like ?	-1
Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this , darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package . It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising . I do n't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs . I did n't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers . The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing	-1
I 'm disappointed to say that there are very few bubbles , mostly very tiny and they pop as soon as they touch something . I gave it a thorough test , blowing air at different speeds and angles , shaking the bottle before using and then using it when it has n't been shaken in a couple of days , etc . Total letdown.Important to note : both I and another person who gave this a shot felt stinging in our eyes when the bubbles popped close to our faces . Not good ! ! !	-1
Cat loves ( regular ) bubbles ! Bought this stuff . Now , the cat just waits for the bubbles to pop after they land on the floor , and she licks that up.Can you say 'Lack of motivation ... dude. & # 34 ; ? *Sigh*Maybe my cat should watch Cheech & Chong movies ... : -\	-1
I thougth this was worth a try . A new treat for my 2 kitties . Unfortunately , they each just watched the bubbles fall to the floor and pop . One of them did sniff the spot where the bubbles broke , but that was about it . Nice idea , but no treat for my 2 kitties anyway .	-1
This stains my carpet green and it 's a hit or miss on the bubbles . Plus , you have to pour it out to get the plastic bubble blower out .	-1
Does n't work well .	-1
My cat has n't tried it yet but I tried to make bubbles and there are n't any coming . It 's going to be very disappointing when I come home later	-1
My cat will sit and watch the bubbles , maybe even approach a group of them while they are falling , but he wo n't pop them . Sometimes he even acts scared of them , which I personally think is bologna . For the price , you can find a cooler toy for your kitty .	-1
After reading all the reviews I thought I 'd go ahead and try it since I started to make Max 's food and treats . He would n't have anything to do with it . Tried making gravy with it or sprinkling it or mixing it with a little bit of food and covering it up with the rest of the food . He would eat around it . So even though it might be great Max wo n't touch it . Will keep on trying until I find something he 'll like .	-1
I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly . I feed my dog raw so he does n't get grains anywhere . I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed . Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up . We now stay away from anything with flax . After adding raw green tripe to his diet , I am noticing similar positives . It is a shame , Nupro is otherwise a great product . I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax .	-1
No matter how good the nutritional value is , or how good it smells , it 's no good if the dog wo n't eat it , and mine wo n't . I am SO disappointed . I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy . Smelled great . He hated it . I then tried heating the & # 34 ; gravy & # 34 ; to really mix the powder into the HOT water . I let it cool . Put it on his food . Hated it . Next I tried it dry , just sprinkled on top . He hated that , too . The good news is that my brother 's Rottweiler loves it . But he loves anything ! I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater . Unfortunately , it did n't help ME , at all .	-1
I have been using the Missing link skin & coat for my bulldog . She was diagnosed with a nutrition deficiency even after eating $ 50 a bag dog food for years . The missing link helped but it was expensive . So when I saw this 5lb tub I jumped on it . Here is the issue , the dose of the Nutri-pet is 2 scoops a day . The missing link is 1/4 of a scoop a day . This 5lb tub did not last very long.I do n't know if it really helped my dog . Her skin conditions still seems to come back every few months . This was only a 1 month supply for my 50lb dog . So once the tub was empty I went back to Missing Link , the 5lb bag is a little more expensive but lasts 6 months or more .	-1
I have tried everything from small doses to using other foods to camouflage the Nupro . Nothing works . My GSD refuses to eat this product . My GSD will devour his food otherwise . He will also eat his food with liberal amount of salmon oil on it . He simply will not eat his food with Nupro . If anyone has a suggestion , please advise . I plan to try another supplement .	-1
I used this successfully years ago with an Akita and several Labs . I do n't know if the formula has changed but it 's labeled & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; , so probably not.I now have mother/son mutts with somewhat sensitive stomachs . They both got sick the second day ... I was easing into it and had n't even gotten to the 1/2-recommended-dose point .	-1
Our Koi do well on this food , so I ordered several 5 pound bags to get us through the summer . However , the actual bags have changed from last year . Whereas before they were easy to zip open and closed , and had a handle built in , now they do not have either of those features . In fact , the bag is practically impossible to seal between feedings . And it is very bulky and awkward to carry out to the pond now that there is no handle built in to the bag . I do n't understand why the company would change these two features , it does n't make any sense . I am going to have to find a suitable container now , to pour 5 pounds of fish food in to , that will have a handle and that I can close properly in between Koi feedings . Very disappointed .	-1
Received box with fish food and lounger that I ordered . Unknown to me the fish food broke open and was loose inside the box ... that was n't the worse part-fine dust from the fish food leaked out of the box and was all over the lounger box as well as my kitchen counter and floor . The size of fish food was priced well compared to that available in this area , however , I do n't think the clean up made it worth it .	-1
I thought a Souper would be a good size for my power chewer , but there is nothing appealing about this bone to him , and it is so heavy and smooth he can barely carry it in his mouth for a minute before dropping it .	-1
This is not a good one for puppies that are chewers . We have two pups , one is 25 lbs and the other is 60-ish . After the first day they had chewed lines into it . I recommend the Nylabone Big Chews for Big Dogs , Knot . We 've had that for 6 months now and it 's taking quite the beating but still holding up better than this Galileo bone .	-1
This was n't cheap yet IMO I think that it 's a cheap product . It 's been sitting around my dog area since I bought it and months later it barely shows any signs of dog teeth involvement . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Although I think the Nylabones are good if not the best bones to get for overactive chewers , I have not purchased this particular and peculiar , uh , 'bone ' as I ca n't fathom a dog chewing on a 'toy ' that resembles a penis . Besides , what will visitors think when there 's a chewed up looking plastic , penis-resembling 'toy ' laying on the floor ? So . I ask the company , why ? ? I think I will stick to the 'bone ' shaped chews , my favorite being the giant dura-chews , which stand up to their name and last a really long time ! And my dog ( Terrier-Sheepdog mix ) is a power-chewer and may have a compulsive chewing disorder being a year and a half old ! : )	-1
I usually have only great things to say about most Nylabone chews , however , the shape/style of this one I do not like . It also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products . One bone will typically last my pooch 2-4 weeks , this one I had to throw out after just one week . I will not purchase this product again .	-1
I purchased this product for my new 1-year old Lab puppy , a real chewer . My veterinarian advised me that they repeatedly see dogs with broken teeth from Nylabone products , because they are too hard for canine tooth enamel .	-1
I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer ( lab/shepherd mix ) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy . Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes , and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15 . This was not a good fit for our dog , and I 'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they 're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog . You just never know . We still buy the Big Chews religiously .	-1
Always loved Nylabone products . My dog dropped this on the floor the first day he got it an the bone cracked.Nylabone is not cheap and the company needs to improve its product quality or you will end up losing longtime loyal customers like myself .	-1
I guess I 'm in the minority . I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this . Good chewing BUT ... ..they made my dog sick and he barfed five times . And guess what came up ? And , yes , the sharp little edges were still there . No more nylabone products for me . I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning . mb	-1
Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer . She sniffed it and walked away . I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else . I do n't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old , also a big chewer , has n't touched it either . I 'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me .	-1
This is really no different than any other Nylabone other than the shape . The bone is still a hard plastic type material that does splinter and form sharp shards that cut the dogs mouth and catch on everything . Not really happy , was hoping for a different material that does n't do that . So it is over rated and not what I had hoped for .	-1
We have an avid chewer ( lab/boxer ) and bought this thinking it might be a toy that actually lasts . Well it has but only because our dog wo n't chew it . I was very surprised at how hard it was and was worried about our dog 's teeth . He was interested when we first gave it to him but now never touches it . I think it 's partially because of the heavy weight of it also . We 've had better luck so far with the KONG Extreme Goodie Bone . Our dog will chew this ( we do n't put treats in it , although you can ) . I think he likes it because it 's a softer material that he can sink his teeth into a bit . So far it has lasted .	-1
I think there is something wrong with this food . We received the case today and gave it to our cats and they began vomiting shortly after . We have fed them the chicken flavor for several months with no problem , but this was the first time our cats became ill .	-1
My dog is slowly , but surely , chewing the ends of this toy off , and without much effort because he does n't like this toy very much to begin with . This is not made out of the same material as a traditional Kong toy .	-1
It was too large for my dogs and the openings at each end are too big to stuff with treats - can only use treats like peanut butter and or cream cheese .	-1
We have had a regular , large size red Kong for months . It 's still going strong . We put a medium size Milk Bone in it and he loves it.He 's now fully grown at 70 lbs and I figured I 'd upgrade to a bigger size and get some teeth cleaning done at the same time.NOT an upgrade ! Short version . I put a large Milk Bone in it . I 'm in the room with him and I look over and see him with his head up proudly looking at me chewing , but the Kong is on the floor . I figure he got the bone out of it already , but there is no crunching . Turns out he 's eating a piece of the Kong and there are other pieces missing that he must have already swallowed . I do n't know how dangerous that could be but it seems pretty bad . What if I had left him alone with it.The story ends ... ... Ten minutes from Amazon package to garbage can .	-1
Dog destroyed this in seconds ... I think I will stick to the Extreme Kongs ! Too bad they do n't make an extreme version for this toy , I would have liked to try it ! ! It was lame of me to try it , I should have expected this , tbh .	-1
My lab chewed right through it . it is too soft and some big dogs will destroy this in 2 minutes .	-1
Although it clumps well , my cat objected to the smell . I introduced it gradually , but once litter was pure world 's best , kitty pooped on the floor instead of in the litter . Switched back to clay and she was fine again .	-1
I tried this product after using Arm & Hammer , Tidy Cats , and at least one other brand . My cat is not picky about his food or litter and has never missed his litter box . I slowly integrated this litter with Arm & Hammer Litter and it was n't until it was nearly completely World 's Best Cat Litter that he decided to take a dump less than two inches away from his designated area.This has never happened before but luckily that was the only incident . Looking over it , I still ca n't find many reasons to continue purchasing this brand . It tracks EVERYWHERE . I have a black table nearby my cat 's litter box and it looks like someone dropped corn flour every time my cat exits his designated area . The odor control is mediocre at best.I do not recommend this litter nor will I be repurchasing this brand .	-1
So last night I experienced a litter emergency ( emptied out the box only to realize I barely had any left to refill ) and the only store still open was Target . So I wanted to switch from Tidy Cats which I found to be too dusty and has this weird deoderizer smell which progressively becomes less pleasant the longer it stays out . Having a limited variety to choose from , I picked up World 's Best . BIG mistake . Honestly , it 's not as though I was expecting this to be the best , but ironically it 's probably among the worst . I understand all the hype about all natural products , but using corn as litter is probably the dumbest idea . When I opened the bag , I did n't expect that it it would smell exactly like grain . I wondered how something that smelled like that could possibly neutralize urine and feces odors , but since this product is priced higher than the rest and is obviously selling , I decided to ignore my skepticism . It has not even been 24 hours since I purchased this and I am absolutely outraged that this company has the nerve to sell an 8 lb bag for close to $ 10 and claim to be the world 's best litter , when their product is complete trash.Here 's everything that is wrong with this litter : -It smells like grain out of the bag and just smelled like grain mixed with feces and urine after my cat used it . I do n't know how this has any positive reviews , but I noticed that some positive ones express that those who have issues with it probably have cats with very stinky excrement . Well , my cat is a tiny kitten whose poop is NOT overly stinky because she is fed the best quality food I can find . I just dumped all the litter into the trash , because seeing how it smells , I know my cat will stop using the box if it stays in there any longer . Cats are like that.-Many people expressed that this litter breaks down into a fine powder after some time . I already noticed that powder forming along the bottom of the box . This means DUST , which I 'm guessing is the reason she had stopped burying her waste with the Tidy Cats . Plus she was sneezing all the time . That being said , in terms of odor , Tidy Cats is still a far better product and less expensive than this one.-This is perhaps the WORST part : When I placed my cat into the litter box after adding this litter to introduce her to it , she sniffed for a couple of minutes and I was horrified when she ATE a few grains . She was confused and thought it was FOOD ! I can imagine how ludicrous it must have seemed to her to have to poop and pee in food . After I read another review about someone else 's cat eating it , I gave up on the idea of using it up by mixing it with the new litter I bought ( Precious Cat which sells a much higher rated 18 lb bag for almost the same price this one sells an 8 lb bag for ) .That being said , if I ca n't stand the smell of this litter , I 'm fairly certain my cat ca n't . The main reason cats stop using their litter boxes is because of odor issues . I pay extra for odor control and if , after cleaning the box twice a day as I usually do , I still have to deal with odor issues , then this stuff is clearly a huge waste of money . So far I ca n't say much about the Precious Cat , which I immediately went out and purchased to replace this one , other than the fact that when I opened the bag , I did n't smell any funny odor or experience a puff of dust , and when I put my cat into the box she sniffed a bit and walked out as though there was nothing unusual worth investigating . If you can get to a Pet Supplies Plus or Petco , I 'd probably buy that one as it 's only a bit more expensive than Tidy Cats and probably WAY better ( I 'll soon find out ) . But the bottom line is , I would use ANY litter over this one .	-1
It clumps and that is about all it does in which I do like but I do n't like the fact that I can be in my kitchen and once he is done using the litter box I can smell the litter when he scoops it over his crap . The litter does not hold up to odor control at all and it 's dusty in between cleaning and I have asthma so this does n't work good for me . I will not purchase this again .	-1
Luckily we got this free as a promotion because my cats would not use it . The one cried and cried and held it in until we got some tidy cats the next day . It looks like nice litter but I guess it 's either the smell or the feel that they do n't like . I am so glad it was free because I think it was a 9.00 bag and I would have been upset had I paid for it since I had to throw it out almost unused .	-1
Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here . So after delivery , I decided I would make the transition slowly . A week and a half later , I was feeding approx half old and half new , and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea , had no appetite , and was lethargic . I 'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet , but if he does n't get better soon , I 'll have to take him to the vet.Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.UPDATE : Took the sick dog to the vet . He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated . $ 150 and one day later , he seems a little better . But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck . I 'm going to hold off because I do think he 's improving on the bland diet.The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night . She seems fine today , but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae , I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well .	-1
WARNING ! ! ! ! ! they do n't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it does n't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they would n't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing	-1
My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet . Our dogs have done very well on it until recently ( we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it 's in the 35 pound bags ) when they all became ill with diarrhea . My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks . After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today , my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula , so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet ! Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill. My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight , that we have used with no problems in the past , so that we do n't have to feed them any more of the Canidae . Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill , but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula . Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now , way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae .	-1
I have a new Akita puppy , and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I could n't get the breeders type of food in my area . After transitioning him to the Canidae , his stools were loose and yellow . I looked on-line , and saw that Canidae switched their formula , and my puppy 's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about . I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy , and everything has been coming out fine since .	-1
This product is really small flakes of cedar sawdust which to my cats is the 'after product ' of their normal little feline pine . So to them even fresh litter was 'used ' and this led to an unexpected cat dump in the shower . There was also a lot of tracking of this sawdust all over the house . I am going back to Feline Pine .	-1
I bought this toy for my 8 month old Mini Schnauzer ( around 12 lbs ) . Although he enjoyed playing with it , after about a month the blue dots started to fall off and he began swallowing them . Not sure how safe it is to swallow peaces of blue plastic , but I took the toy away .	-1
This said it was for a medium chewer . I realize now that my puppy has a strong bite but she had both ends of this bone off and in little pieces within 10 minutes . I would not recommend it .	-1
My dog was so very sick and as I was about to take him to the ER , he vomited several pieces of this chew bone . I will add a photo . This could have been a disaster requiring surgery , or causing death . PLEASE , do n't buy this . My dog loved it but I should have listened to the other negative reviews . Please do n't learn the hard way like I did . He 's only 13 lbs.PS I have since learned that rawhide treats are no good either , the rawhide sits in their stomach taking weeks to digest . The butcher dept in my grocery store sells bone marrow bones . I think it 's the cow 's femur . I boil it for 15 mins and dogs love it It will keep him busy for hours.Update : I 've since learned from comments below that dogs have broken their teeth on these bone marrow bones . Luckily my dog seems to be over the chewing phase .	-1
Turned around and my 40 pound dog had it in pieces in no time . He 's pooping blue smurfs now . He 's proud .	-1
our dog does n't want anything to do with this . he is a little pup so maybe he will grow into it .	-1
Our 5 month old chihuahua pup loves his chew toys and so we monitor him while he chews . He does n't have a lot of teeth yet but he managed to break off a small nub within a 5 minute period . I decided to take it away from him for fear that he would chew off more nubs . I 'm sure ingesting small amounts may not be too harmful , but I would n't want my puppy to end up ingesting alot of it . I would not recommend .	-1
Toxic , not to be eaten by your dog , but they are too be dental chews ? Not even worth the money !	-1
My dog literally sat down with it , and about 1 minute later , he 'd chewed small pieces off the side of it and was eating them off the floor . Literally stunned my parents and I . Had to give him a treat while someone else got the bone away from him . Unreal.A minute . My dog is 20 pounds . Not some huge breed of monster .	-1
Did n't last five minutes . Pretty sad . Was hoping for at least 20 minutes of chew time out of it . Oh well .	-1
I have a 9 month old puppy . She destroyed this in minutes . Would not recommend for heavy chewers . Better options out there .	-1
It breaks apart into smaller sharp pieces which I then step on in the living room without shoes on . Much like a Lego in the dark . Sad .	-1
My puppy who is a Catahoula Leopard was about 13 weeks when I bought this . She did n't take to this toy right away , would rather chew on the other smooth dog bones . Makes me think she did n't like the feel of it . Plus it 's quite heavy which I found she does n't like the heavy chew toys . She only chewed on it a short few times and that was it . I definitely would not recommend this .	-1
My little boxer chewed this down to a third of the size in about an hour . After ingesting a good amount she got sick the following morning and some of it was in her vomit .	-1
But within in minutes my 30 lb pup was throwing up the small pieces which were easily chewed off of this product.I threw it away within minutes of giving it to her ... ..not for us .	-1
Within 15 minutes it was chewed to pieces . DO NOT purchase this item . Look at Kong chew toys instead for longer lasting toys .	-1
I have a 70lb goldendoodle who likes to chew and pick at things but is n't an aggressive chewer . I noticed within minutes that the little spiky nubs were falling off . Thankfully he was spitting them out and not swallowing them ! Not a safe toy .	-1
My 2 year old boy sheltie likes to chew , but he is far from a power chewer . He prefers softer chew toys , and he tends to pick and nibble at the inedible chew toys . But in about 10 minutes , he had the end of this flexible dental Nylabone torn off into two chunks . I noticed this when I looked over to see one little piece near him , and he was working the other little piece over in his mouth . He promptly spit it out when I asked him to , and gave him a cookie as a reward for doing so.I 'd say this dental toy is softer than the other Flexible Nylabones ( with those , he gets tiny , tiny pieces off , like grains of rice ) . Be very very careful giving this to your dog as it is n't an edible chew toy , yet it 's soft like an edible chew , and that 's a dangerous thing for dogs . Dogs are like toddlers , they will put all kinds of dangerous things in their mouth if we let them , so be careful with this chew toy . Or , you can not buy it in the first place and not take the risk . I wo n't buy this again for my pup . There 's only a small number of dogs who are the chewing type who would be okay with this chew toy ... . you know , like toothless dogs *might* be okay.The nubby texture of this dental Nylabone is great though , got my sheltie 's attention . He got a regular smooth flexible ( chicken flavor , I think ? ) Nylabone at the same time and he preferred the nubby texture of this dental bone .	-1
okay I have 3 dogs all over 50 lbs . I love nylabones . I do n't like this product . It is soft and flexible and has tons of little nubbies . The dogs will chew this apart it is a given but it should last a little while if they are n't an aggressive chewer . Mine are aggressive chewers and shredded this bone . Then the younger one proceeded to eat the pieces . This is not a hard nylabone so I do n't recommend to many people .	-1
It is just a hard plastic shape with spikes . My Cavalier puppy has n't touched it . Spend you money on something they will love Bully Sticks , keep teeth really clean and will clean off built up plaque like no other	-1
My 50+ pound puppy chewed this into pieces within 10 minutes . I was very disappointed that I purchased this . Not for the avid chewer .	-1
My 2 year old pit tore it to pieces in less than 5 minutes . NOT for strong chewers . Otherwise have fun cleaning up the mess .	-1
My adopted one year old dachshund/maltese mix is a real chewer . After she chewed her way through the corner of the table , a pillow , the credit card bill , an amazon packing box , and much more , I figured it was time to stock up on safer chew toys.I selected a number of products ( many of them produced by Nylabone ) and this proved to be the worst of those I purchased . My little dog was so happy when I gave it to her to chew , but within less than 10 minutes , she had chewed off large chunks of this toy and left them strewn all over the carpet . Nylabone recommend that a dog can safely ingest fragments of this product so long as they are no bigger than a grain of rice , but those that my dog chewed off were about the size of a fingernail . I was worried that she might become sick if she were to swallow any of these large pieces , so I took the product off of her and threw it away . My dog much prefers the Nylabone dinosaur shaped bones . They are extremely sturdy and have withstood her vigorous chewing for over two weeks now .	-1
I had to give this cat litter 1 star because of the HORRIBLE OVERPOWERING ammonia smell ! OMG ! I can barely clean it without wearing a face mask . My whole condo smells of the strong cat urine it 's horrible ! My eyes were watering and my nose was burning . I cleaned out the box almost every single day . Did n't have too many issues with the litter sticking to the box . It does stick , but I got it all up pretty easily . However , after just a few days the smell started . In less than a week it was so bad I had to dump out the whole box . This has happened 3 times now and I 've tried adding other products such as baking soda and other cat deodorizers . I have n't had problems with bugs , mice or anything like that . Have n't noticed any dust . The cats do track it everywhere all over the house . I even found some in my bedroom down the hall this morning . I have to vacuum pretty much every day . If anyone has any advice for the horrible smell I would appreciate it ! I am just desperately trying to make it through the bag right now so I can move on to something else ! I am loving that I do n't smell the poo at all , just the horrible urine which is now officially 100X worse ! I 'd rather smell the poo again ! UGH !	-1
Purchased Diamond Beef Meal and Rice - dogs loved it at first ... . I mixed it in with their old food and all was well for awhile , then I noticed that after about a week they stopped eating it all together . Even when I left it in to bowl and did n't give them their old food for a short period , they would n't eat it . I noticed vomit on the floor and saw my dogs both start to drink LOTS of water . Bad sign - giving up on this stuff . Read about their problems with recalls - bad choice to buy this product ! ! !	-1
I have been buying this and was happy with it for quite awhile then my last two purchases in the Fall of 2013 something is definitely different . All three dogs having severe gas and refusing to eat anymore of this stuff . Bought a fresh bag thinking I just got a bad bag..no its the food .	-1
I did n't get what picture and ingredients showed . So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog 's treats . They did n't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change . Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change . So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed . I may buy them again . I do n't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good . My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them . review from 2 stars to 5 stars .	-1
This product is great for about 1-2 years . Over time , the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets ' fur and food , which causes the motor to break down , even with regular cleaning . I found no way to purchase a replacement motor , so I was really bummed ( as were my cats ! ) .I ended up purchasing a new fountain , but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain . I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food , fur , and other particles from getting into the motor and its ' reservoir .	-1
We previously we had this model ( the Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow ) for about 2 years . The motor ran well and it never broke , so I gave it 2 stars . But it is an older outdated model and our pet store stopped carrying the filters . So I decided to upgrade to a newer product , the Drinkwell Platinum fountain.Drinkwell Platinum Pet FountainI would definitely recommend the Drinkwell and NOT this product . The new Drinkwell has been wonderful because I 've definitely seen all three of my cats drinking MUCH more water in the last two weeks than with the Petmate fountain . I can promise you I 've found the proof in the litter boxes.The Drinkwell 's water stream is much stronger and circulates the water better than the Petmate . It gives the water the power to move most of the debris toward the little trap . That keeps the water bowl so much cleaner ; where as with the Petmate , the debris would circulate until it either sank to the bottom or stuck to the bowl walls . In addition , the Drinkwell 's filter is designed SO much better ( 6 divided coal sections ) . The coal in the Petmate 's filter would just clump at the bottom ( i believe it has 2 divided sections ) .The Drinkwell also holds a lot more water . Both products are dishwasher safe , so regular washing is easy for either . However , I can say the old Petmate has many tiny corners which made it a pain when it came to scrubbing off the mineral deposit build up ( but my guess is the new one will be too ) .I would recommend paying the extra $ 20 and going for the Drinkwell Platinum and staying away from this old model .	-1
These are reasonably nice and quiet when they work right . However , it has been my experience that they eventually get noisy and that the durability is poor . I would not recommend these unless you plan on replacing it every few months .	-1
Noisy pump and splashy waterfall that made a halo of hard water stains . Only my Maine Coon Cat would go near it , drawn by the flowing water . Under the `` hood '' this fountain has TOO MANY ( unnecessary ? ) tight corners that harbor uncleanable areas . The best way I found to really clean the PetMate fountain was to remove the pump and submerge the parts in a pail containing a diluted bleach solution . While effective , it was time consuming and even with the most thorough of rinsing , my cat found the odor to be objectionable for the first 24 ( +/- ) hours . The little water reservoir is like filling an old fashioned water cooler - invert it quickly and hope for as little spillage as possible . I always seemed to end up soaking up a couple of paper towels getting the area dry enough for my cat 's tootsies . With only one cat using it , I gave up and donated it to my local shelter for their rummage sale.FWIW , I substituted one of those clear , plexi , three liter `` beta '' aquariums you can find at the pet store that comes with its own little power filter . There is n't any need for gravel or plastic plants , just the bare bones tank/bowl and the power filter which has it 's own easily changable carbon & floss cartridges that keeps the water fresh and clean . The water fall design of the power filter oxygenates the water and it has enough of a flow to keep my spoiled Maine Coon Cat happy . The smooth sides of the four sided tank/bowl quickly wipes clean . All three of my cats readily accepted this work-around for their pet water `` fountain '' . > ^ ! ! ^ & lt ;	-1
It does what it 's supposed to , but it 's LOUD ! The motor itself is n't bad , but it vibrates . So by itself , the motor is quiet , but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck . I have n't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy . Wrap the motor in bubble wrap , maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe , until the motor finally just quit after a few years , and it was great . This one , not so much . Quality has sunk . There is no more on/off switch on the power line . The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself , making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it 's time for deep cleaning . There 's no flow adjustment , and the flow is rather slow.I 'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it .	-1
My dog hates drinking stagnant water . I had to change her water bowls at least 3x a day . I figured I 'll solve my problem with this little cool invention ... After sitting for a bit , the `` filter '' proved useless when dust and little odds and ends are floating in it , obviously NOT being filtered ... . also , just because the water is supposedly SLOWLY circulating , does n't mean the water is `` fresh . '' I literally felt compelled to take this thing apart once per day to clean , and even then , break it down at least 2-3x a week to thoroughly get in the nooks and crannies ... not an easy job when you cant really get into the water reservoir where I imagine all sorts of mildew and mold , bacteria and algae will eventually accumlate.A BIG waste of money , a HUGE waste of time , an even LARGER inconvenience.I 'm back to my old ways of changing both her indoor and outdoor water bowls at least 3x a day , whenever I walk pass it , and just washing a simple bowl out at the ened of the night ... cheaper that way too ... no electricity to use , no fear of electrocutng my doggy , no pricey carbon filters to buy.Used it for 2 weeks and now its in another `` bad buy '' pile ... .	-1
The pump completely died on me after one year of use . I wish there was a better pump as these type of devices are clearly healthier than a standing water bowl , but without an effective pump they become useless.Someone also ought to make a better design such that water does n't slosh all over the floor when moving or picking the unit up . As I have to frequently clean the entire unit ( due to the weak pump ! ) this is a major issue .	-1
I have the large Petmate waterer and I love that one . The pump went out after about four years of continuous use . When I saw the price on the linen colored one , I thought instead of buying another large , I 'd try this medium size.Maybe it is the item I have vs. the entire medium size , but the top is extremely hard to take off , the reservoir does n't empty very quickly , and the water flow seems to be all or very little . Furthermore the depth of the drinking well is so shallow that the water level drops so quickly that I have to check it several times a day to make sure there is enough water for the pump to work efficiently . And as other reviewers have noted , it seems to get dirty faster than it should.The reason I gave it a two star rating rather than a one star is because I took the pump out of it and replaced the nonworking one in my large Petmate which I would give five stars to vs. this highly inefficient medium one ! Who knew that there was such a difference between a medium and a large water fountain from the same manufacturer and same line ?	-1
This is my third unit - I too let one run dry and the pump fried ( shame on me too ) , however it was about five years old and until the pump died , worked like a trouper . I have two units in my house , one at either end of the house.My cat drinks from the top of the water run and my dog slurps from the bowl ( dog backwash has got to be worse than cat backwash ! ) . Yes , I do dig out dog and cat hair from the intake/lever area about once a week , but that 's a small task compared to washing and filling a couple of water bowls each day or worse yet , forgetting to fill a bowl or finding one completely empty and wondering `` how long have they gone without water '' ? The pumps make enough `` noise '' when the water levels get too low , thus it 's nearly impossible to allow a pump to burn out ( nearly , not completely ! ) .There is no `` slimy '' feeling to the bowl like there is in a standard water bowl ( you know that `` film '' one often feels when cleaning a regular water bowl , despite the fact it looks clean ? ) and the large reservoir ensures plenty of water all the time ( although I do keep a 1/2 gallon container nearby each one so I can just fill and dump directly into the basin instead of pulling out the reservoir to refill - I do the latter frequently , but at times I 'm in a rush and a quick refill via the extra container does the trick for me.Lastly , my veterinarian noted my cat of 7.5lb cat of 18.5 years lived as long as she did , despite being a tiny runt who had been severely malnourished and abandoned when I found her up for adoption at about 1 year of age , because he found cats drink far more frequently with these units which , in turn , keeps their kidneys filtering properly and , in turn , keeps the kidneys working well overall - kidney woes often being the fatal ailment of cats.The dog ? Well , for whatever reason , she simply will not drink out of puddles or the odd bucket or container - could be a lucky coincidence , but I ca n't help but suspect she 's only known `` fresh water '' from the likes of this system and that 's her preference - no icky puddle water ingested means less of a chance of parasites or similar.UPDATE 5/29/10 - I had read others complaining the units leak ( other sites mostly ) and alas , I am now among the growing cluster o ' complainers . Late the other night I heard popping sounds and much to my dismay ( and total disgust ) I found the unit had been leaking ( probably about 3 days or so ) profusely the entire contents ( probably two full systems ' worth ) had soaked through the carpet and had severely buckled the original hardwood flooring to such an extent two planks are nearly buckled onto their sides ( hence the popping sounds I believe ) . I had `` assumed '' the dog and cat were simply drinking more because the weather was changing and did n't realize there was substantial leak ( never saw it , never felt it , but then I usually have shoes on ) - looking back , I had noticed a very loud `` water fall '' sound had started with the unit ( which some may like , but I found it annoying ) and I discovered the section that fits atop the pump had a small split in it . I did n't worry about it as it just meant that only 1/2 of the water was making its way up to the `` ramp '' , but I should have inspected the unit more carefully as I would have likely noticed signs of the major external leak that was probably developing ( although to look at the unit , empty as it is now , it 's not like there 's some gaping hole or visible crack in the base ) .Equally frustrating is the company 's customer service option - no email , no contact via a Web site , only snail mail and a M-F phone bank that 's routinely busy . I 've been a big fan of these units for many years , but given I 'm not the first person to whine about major leaking problems , I fear the company is either cutting corners or is using defective/inferior parts . The damage to the carpet is substantial - I had no idea mold would/could grow under a carpet in just a few days - but then I do n't have experience with leaving a few gallons of water on it - the carpet can be replaced , not that I really have a choice now - but the hardwood is another story , as fate would have it , I found , `` they no longer make the plank sizes '' , it 's custom hardwood time - oh brother . Until the company steps up and addresses the increasing leaking complaints , I hate to have to say it , but stay away from buying this model ( or if you have a unit now , place it on a plastic tray or similar ) . Formerly 5 stars .	-1
I 've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well . In fact , I purchased one for my mother 's pets . I 'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year , the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick . The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often . I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price , especially if you have to replace them more often . Check out the filters here on Amazon , you 'll see I 'm not the only one dissatisfied . Because of this , I am switching over to the Drinkwell system . I 've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial .	-1
I had a Drinkwell fountain for awhile , for my two cats at home . I also have two cats at work and decided to bring the Drinkwell in for them and I got one of these Fresh Flow fountains for home . I switched at home because I thought the Drinkwell was a pain to clean . The first time I changed out the Fresh Flow I was wishing I had just gotten another Drinkwell . The two main components of the Fresh Flow are easier to clean than the Drinkwell but the benefits stop there . The reservoir is very small and impossible to clean . The water in the bowl gets full of crud the very first day and it all just sits in the bottom ( Fur , bits of food , dirt from one cat 's paw who likes to dip his paw into the bowl ) . It needs to be cleaned constantly . The bowl part is too shallow and the water does n't seem to move out of the reservoir correctly , and the water level in the bowl gets too low and the pump makes sucking noises . The pump itself gets coated in slimy goo.My cats also prefer the actual waterfall the Drinkwell provides . I 've never seen them lap water from the plastic slide in the Fresh Flow . I gave it to a friend and bought another Drinkwell for home . Drinkwell filters are cheaper and easier to find , so even though it 's more expensive initially it turns out to be the better deal .	-1
I 've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water , there are some flaws.The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape , it 's impossible to clean those spots . I also have hard water in my apartment , so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which does n't come off with scrubbing . Finally , the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you do n't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I wo n't buy this one again .	-1
Our cats just eat the power chord . One sticks her head in it and plays in it . I have bought bigger fountains from the same company before , only to have the motors die from build up of lime . The reservoir itself gets very laden with lime or whatever is In your water system . The filters can not prevent that . Other than just keeping the water running , it is a pain to clean and maintain .	-1
EDIT : I liked it . My cats liked it . But the d @ mn thing started leaking after only a month . Slow and gradual , but there was definitely a puddle on our wood floors every day that no towel could keep in check . It was thrown out . My kitties were upset . As was I ... what a waste of money !	-1
No matter what I do the water drips out the back of the thing . With in an hour there is a big puddle under it . It wics out the back seams where the filter goes . Buy a Drinkwell .	-1
I did n't think there 'd be another fountain as difficult to clean as a Drinkwell . This one is ( the right hand upper section must be removed , and it 's a bear to get off and on because it fits so tightly ) .Also - and this is not a criticism , because I misjudged capacity - but the medium size is not meant for a house with more than two cats .	-1
I had the old model of this fountain for 6 years - it was wonderful . The old model had an adjustable flow and was totally silent . The motor died on it finally . This new model does not have an adjustable water flow speed and is very loud , in fact mine was defective , the noise was too loud and my cat would not drink from it . A waste of time , energy and money to order this , assemble it , find out it doesnt work , call for return , pack it up and ship it back , and order a different brand , which I ordered the Drinkwell fountain hopefully i 'll have better luck with that one.Too bad they changed the design . Hint to Petmate : if its not broken , do n't fix it ! Add back the flow adjuster and make the motor silent again . Some cats are scared off by a noisy fountain that flows too fastUpdate 4-25-12 : Spoke to Petmate , they seem to think the loud pump noise is ok , they havent responded to two of my letters complaining about the loud pumps . I 've gone through 3 pumps now trying to get a quieter one , and they are all loud . They switched pump manufacturers and the new pumps they are making are lower quality louder and probably dont last as long . The very first Petmate fountain I ordered 10 years ago was extremely quiet , had an on/off switch and flow lever adjustment . The new pump is LOUD AND POOR QUALITY . PETMATE GET ON THE BALL WITH FIXING THESE LOUD PUMPS ! On the PLUS side , this water fountain design is the best out there in my opinion . My cat doesnt like dripping water and the water chute with water drinking area this one has is great . Could be the best pet fountain out there if they started doing quality and noise control on their pumps ! Probably sacificing quality for profit like most large companies today . The pumps are probably made in China sweatshops where everything is poor quality junk and the CEOs care more about their large salary than creating happy , satisfied customers . A sad commentary on American society and meanwhile my cat wo n't drink from this often enough because the noise makes him skittish .	-1
I have a cat that splashes water all over the kitchen even when the water is refreshed several times a day . Out of desperation I tried this fountain for her . It stopped the splashing , thank goodness , but now I had new problems.The reservoir is too small and if you do n't check it constantly it will go dry and that ruins the motor -- not to mention it is impossible to see the water level through the blue plastic unless you crouch down on the floor right next to it ! Hardwater scale builds up and is difficult to remove . It is very difficult to clean . I hated the fuss of cleaning it all the time and trying to watch it to make sure it did n't go dry . You ca n't even put it in the dishwasher ! I had a hard time finding replacement filters for it too . After only 3 months it stopped working . I went out and found a gravity fed water bowl that uses an air pump ( like for a fish tank ) to oxygenate the water and keep it moving/bubbling around . No fountain , but the cat does n't seem to mind and the splashing is still under control . Also I can put this one in the dishwasher and it is just so much easier to clean even by hand . I think it even cost a little bit less than this fountain . It holds tons more water too -- and it wo n't die if it should happen to go dry . Keep this in mind when you are looking for this type of product for your cats.By the way , my dogs have NEVER drank from either one -- they do n't even seem to know it is there , right under their nose , so the marketing to dogs is just plain silly . I only had one cat at the time the fountain died by the way . Just not a good design , not a good product .	-1
