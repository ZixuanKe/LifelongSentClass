It is a nice piece of cookware but I do have a complaint . The tempered glass lid may appear attractive but is a bad joke . While all the literature says you 'll be able to observe the contents , in reality your vision will be obscured by the condensation on the lid . Otherwise , it does the job and is relatively easy to clean .	1
We use this to make rice and curries . The size is perfect . Really easy to clean . Great lid . Very pleased with this purchase and works perfectly on our induction stove top .	1
Perfect size for family size soups , chilies and stews . Retains heat very well , cleans well . No scratches so far . I also like the fact that it is oven and dishwasher safe .	1
I bought a Circulon symmetry item following the purchase of an induction countertop and since then added a few more items . CIRCULON SUMMETRY gets two thumbs up for me for the following reasond : They are induction compatible.They are dishwasher safe.They are metal utensil resistant.They are elegant.If I was bigger on cooking than I am I would recommend an 11-pc set . Make sure its SYMMETRY though !	1
These are my favorite pans of all time ! My mom had purchased the Circulon pots and pans and after I used them for cooking at her house one night I fell in love with them and just had to have them . My husband surprised me with these pans for Christmas . Nothing sticks to the pans , I do n't need to use butter or oil to cook in them . Nothing flakes off . They cook food evenly . They are easy to clean . I have nothing bad to say about these pans and only wish I had them years ago instead of purchasing hundreds of dollars on other brands that claim to be & # 34 ; non stick & # 34 ; . This is the real deal ! ! !	1
Bought these for my son for training . He has a stove top in his room and these worked great , he is happy !	1
We purchased the 10 piece set of this same product during an Amazon Lightning deal and was a bit surprised after it arrived that it did not come with a 12 '' pan . The pan we use more than any other for our family of 5.So picked this up and have no complaints at all . We now have 2 10 '' pans , but that works well as I can have three skillets going at the same time.Like the rest of the set , the non-stick works great with no peeling so far ( tho we avoid metal utensils and the dishwasher as they come clean very easily ) .The thick heavy bottom distributes heat very well and the handles have a good feel to them.My wife was worried before we started using them that she would not like those little circular ridges inside the pans , but they have proven to be a non-issue and Circulon states that the ridges are the reason they hold up better against peeling than other brands .	1
I will tell you as a professional cook and as a grandma , that these skillets are the best dang skillets I have ever used . They wipe clean with a paper towel . Nothing sticks to them , They are truly the best skillets I have ever used , I ended up shopping for some friends for that is what I do , I am now a professional personal shopper ... I showed them mine and they all wanted them . and so it goes . I tell you it will be the best funds you ever spent buying a product that delivers ! my advice toss away all your other ones and get these . I was lucky and got mine while they were on sale but even off sale you ca n't beat the price .	1
I have had many different brands of cookware and this is by far my favorite . After receiving these two pans I deceided to by the full set . I could n't be happier . Heavy duty , truly non-stick , and an overall feel of quality .	1
I got these about a year ago . I wore out the small pan and had to buy the set to get a 10 inch replacement . The measurement is across the top so you do n't get a full 10 & # 34 ; at the pan bottom . The 8 incher would have been too small for doing two eggs next to each other and being able to flip them comfortably . The non-stick held up very well with daily use for about a year . Supposedly , you can use a metal utensil with them but I have not been daring enough . The non-stick does wear with use so why make it wear faster was my thinking . These have been the most long lasting non-stick I 've found . I wash them by hand and avoid leaning them on anything that could scratch the inside during storage . The handle never got too hot to handle on my regular stove top .	1
I 've usually shied away from non-stick , poisons , ca n't use metal utensils , however cooking eggs is a lot easier so I 've tried a few different pans , diamond coated , green ceramic all had their merits but nothing quite suited my needs . I read a few articles on Circulon and decided to give them a try . The pans are top notch nothing sticksvi can use metal , nothing sharp , and clean up is a breeze . They heat quick and even , I think I have found the perfect non stick	1
You are worth it . You deserve the best . If you 're reading this I assume you love to cook . Do yourself a favor . Time to replace every pan ( s ) you own with Circulon Symmetry Anooized nonstick collection ! You spend a lot of time in the kitchen it 's time to spend a little on yourself and increase the taste quality texture of every food that you will put in your new pans in the future I promise you this you will be happy and feel deserving and my friend you deserve it . Wishing you the best happy holidays .	1
My wife loves these pans . She had a small one and wanted another to keep in the camper . They came in a pair , but that 's OK too . They will sear and they distribute heat evenly .	1
I needed a new frying pan and these are just perfect . Love the way nothing sticks to the bottom . I have no trouble with cleaning the rings as others have said they have had . I do n't use the dishwasher to clean them in , just a kitchen sink brush and washcloth . These fit small and large burners . So far I love them .	1
bought these as a gift and like many others larger pan came oddly bent in a perfect shipping box.Obviously went in the box damaged.After several unanswered emails to vendor filed a claim w/ Amazon and vendor decided to answer.I was refunded my money and told to dispose of the pans.One nice blow with a hammer straightened the pan to new like condition and the smaller was good from the start.Now my wife is using them regularly , sometimes instead of the stainless All Clad , hmm	1
I am thrilled so far with these skillets . I am not having any problem with the ridges in the skillet as you ca n't even really feel them . Nothing has stuck or even started to stick . So far very happy with my purchase . I would and already have recommended . I also want to add that when it say 10 and 12 inch , that is exactly the cooking are you have . Some of the pans say 12 inch and that is the measurement across the top and the bottom only measures about 9 . That is not the case with these pans ... .	1
Bought this 12 '' skillet to go with the set of Circulon Symmetry I purchased , the 10 '' skillet was a duplicate of the one I got with my set , but I 've put it aside and will use it when the other one gets beat-up like I know it will , since I use my skillets so much . Love the bottoms of these pans , they have a heavy flat stainless steel disc on the bottom that keeps them from warping and keeps them sitting flat on my smooth top electric range . The non-stick surface seems very durable and food slides right out with no stuck on spots , this makes cleanup a breeze.I also like that these pans are not too heavy to handle , yet they sit nice and flat on the cook top . I purchased a very expensive Calphalon 12 '' skillet last year , paid over twice the price of these two skillets for it and it warped within the first two months of use , leading to a hot spot on the bottom and food burning to the skillet . I am very happy with these skillets and the other Symmetry set I bought , very good quality for the price , easy to cook with , and super easy to clean up , they can even go in the dishwasher . I hand wash my pots , but in a pinch , the fact that I can put them in the dishwasher is a big bonus . These get used almost everyday and so far I ca n't say a bad thing about them . Since the price is reasonable , if they last a couple of years I 'll be very happy .	1
I admit , I was hesitant to purchase these , because of the price . I have never paid more than 100 bucks for an entire set of pots and pans , to pay half that for only two ... but it was worth it . These pans are amazing and the food slips off of them . Cleaning them is very easy . the best feature is the height on the sides , which allow you to cook dishes with sauce or that need mixing , without it falling over the edge to the stove top . The rubber handle is a good grip . The only `` con '' is that they are very heavy , not that its really a con with the 10 inch pan , but the 12 inch pan is huge and heavy , making it a little awkward to cook with ( and i have a little stove , 20 '' ) . But would buy again . I do n't know if I would pay 250 for the whole set though , but these are the most used out of my set that needed replacement .	1
These pans are great . A bit on the expensive side but worth the investment . They work very well on my induction burner cooktop , and the nonstick surface lasts and lasts . Durable and withstand very high heat . Easy to clean . Recommend very highly !	1
I was thrilled to receive this set of cookware since my nearly complete set of Calphalon has been showing some serious signs of wear and tear after only ten years of use . You may laugh and say that ten years is a long time but Calphalon prides itself on being Cookware for a lifetime . We live in a 1930 's Era cottage in Los Angeles and when we moved in there was an old-fashioned work-horse of an electric stove & range bolted to our kitchen floor . Rather than replace it , we adpated to it and spent our money upgrading other appliances and needs such as windows & doors . As a result , we found out that the Calphalon cookware we had just bought , along with the many add-on pieces through the years , simply does n't do as well on an electric stove top as it does on gas . Also the handles on some of them do n't move from the skillet to the oven the way you 'd want them to unless you 're buying the much higher priced Proffessional line . When the Circulon Box arrrived , I had to tear into it immediately ! A quick look see assured me that that Circulon Symmetry bottoms on all the pans are indeed unique and well adapted to heat on a gas or electric stove and that the handles will move from the stovetop to the oven for finishing off if need be . I was so thrilled with the look of the product , the balance of the skikellets in my hand and the way the larger pots were made taller and skinnier rather than flat and squat . That means they will sit on all burners well without much overhang . For my first dish , I chose an adapted Cassoulet recipe since that is a Duck and Sausage French Stew you prepare first on the stovetop and then finish off in the same pan inside your oven . Instead of duck , I use Chicken thighs but other than that , my recipe is pretty old-school . The Circulon Symmetry 3 Quart covered Saucepan gave me perfectly even heat as I sweated out my aromatic vegetables and cooked off the various meats . Once it was ready for the oven , I was mildly aprehensive but the handle performed as promised with no damage whatsoever . I am simply thrilled.Since then I have been using the stockpot the most since we 've had soe cool weather and it 's the perfect size for making hearty soups . I am so pleased with the even heating on the bottom of the pans and no longer have to worry whe I have soups on simmer . In that past , due to eletric stovetops , I 'd inevitably find on spot of the pan was hotter than the other and it could burn a thick stew or soup if not watched constantly . My husband has been making perfect coconut rice in the 3 quart covered Saucepan and has had no problems with the bunrt bottoms we used to get on occasion with our Calphalon.We are simply loving this Cooking set and plan on adding to it . We love the Bronze/Chocolate color which actually matches our kitchen and gives the cookware a nice little flare of style . The glass lids are also a treat in the way they are constructed . they 're easier to lift without getting a facefull of steam . We 're loving that patented Circulon technology on the bottom that results in the even heating as well as the stay-cool handles that can do double duty in the oven if needed . Cleanup has not been a problem for us at all . I 'm very careful with my pots and use a natrual citrus & Coconut-based cleanser with a soft sponge ( buy it on Amazon if you want - Citrus Magic brand ) . I wo n't let commercial dish liquid NEAR my new favorite cookware ! In fact , these are so easy to clean and so non-stick , one could get by with hot water and a papertowel if you wanted to but I do add my natural cleanser for the sponge-out and rinse.This is simply the nicest and most versatile cookware I have EVER owned and I have had a number of sets of the `` latest and greatest '' over the years !	1
This is our first new set or cookware in a long time and our first experience with anodized aluminum.Anyway , on to our experience using this set , and dealing with customer service : This is a very attractive cookware set , the chocolate brown coating is very well done IMHO and looks great on a stove top . Defintely does not look like a budget set at all . Additionally this set comes with all the bells and whistles of more expensive brands . Glass lids , silicone handles and scratch resistant teflon coatings . Metal thickness on the pots and pans seems equivalent to what is found on other sets as well.Using the set with our gas stove has proven not to be an issue - I was slightly concerned using the silicone sleeved handles with the gas cooktop . Ensuring not to use overly small pots on the biggest burner has meant this is n't an issue.As to whether the pans are truly metal utensil safe - we just do n't plan on risking it . In fact our 2 quart pan developed a chip within the first couple of days of using it - which we believed was a manufacturing defect . Here 's the customer service part - we did n't have to mail the pan back and the company promptly mailed us a new one . Great job on their part.Small nitpick is that the handles are hollow at the base and near the tip but considering the value the set delivers in other places , I find the trade to be reasonable.In summary , we are very happy with this . Happy cooking .	1
The non-stick coating on this cookware is called Autograph 2 , it is one of the latest and best available . It is a three coat process that renders a very durable surface that can be used with metal utensils.Purchased this set to replace our ancient mis-matched and abused pots and pans . First off I wanted to see if all of the claims were factual . Cleaned in the dishwasher , used metal utensils , even cooked eggs with no oil or spray , then used our portable induction burner . I can honestly say that everything passed with flying colors , the set is up to it all ! The hard anodised aluminum , which is stronger than steel , is thick and gives excellent heat distribution from the bottom and up the sides with no apparent `` hot spots '' . Tried all of the cookware pieces on the induction burner with no problems at all . I will say that it 's probably easier to clean this with just a wipe with a dishcloth and rinse , rather than use the dishwasher , the non stick is that good . Metal utensils worked fine , but we have so much of the nylon , as it was necessary with the old pots and pans , well , we use that . Could never fry eggs in the old stuff with out using some oil , not with this , the eggs just slide out.We also purchased the four quart sauce pot and the covered stir fry pan to go with this set . The lid on the four quart fits the eight inch fry pan , nice to have . Have used the covered stir fry as a wok and as a steamer . Use a small stainless rack that fits in the bottom , great for steaming . Also , it does stir fry without as much heat as the old one , suppose because the heat conduction is so much better.Am absolutely pleased with this purchase , it is tough , cooks very well and looks great ! Would I purchase again and recommend this set ? -- -- You bet I would !	1
I also have this set in black.I cook quite a bit and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this set . Seriously just as good to have two of everything when it comes to cooking larger meals and you do n't want to have to cook and clean at the same time just to reuse certain pots.I prefer the black color , but I 'm seriously not picky enough to care that much about color.HIGHLY recommend this set as it stands up so well to my use and the use of up to three other 'cooks ' that visit my home.I 've included the review for the first set I ordered below : ~~~I 've been using stainless steel for nearly a decade with an occasional anodized skillet thrown in the mix.During that time I 've cooked everything from mac n ' cheese to Italian to a variety of complicated Indian dishes that often require a near scorching of the onions while preparing the masala.With the stainless steel , the post cooking clean up required a good deal of elbow grease . During the cooking process the pans did n't always heat as evenly as they probably could or as quickly.Of course I did n't how annoying all these drawbacks truly were until I received this Circulon set a few weeks back.Oh my goodness , with everything I 've cooked in these pans over the past several weeks I 've been been extremely impressed with the vast superiority in quality on all accounts to what I 'd been using before.For example , one of the skillets was used for cooking pasta sauce last night and once dinner was served , the burner was accidentally left on med-low for over an hour . I envisioned some hard scraping going on , but a quick few moves with a nylon scraper took everything off with only a touch of water.VERY PLEASED with this set .	1
A perfectly nice set of pots and pans - easy to use and to clean - there 's one for every need . I especially liked the pour spout on the one pot . How many times have I made a sauce , or anything else that I wanted to pour into another container , only to have it spill over the sides ? Perfect for soup which eliminates the need for a ladle - one less thing to clean ! I also liked the glass lids , but of course condensation still requires you to remove it in order to really see what 's going on inside . The nonstick coating prevents burning and makes cleanup easy and quick.I can tell I 'll get a lot of use out of these pots and pans . They should last quite a long time if cared for properly.UPDATE***This product has worked so well that I now have two sets-one in brown ( shown here : ) and one in black .	1
I have owned Circulon for over 8 years and have been amazed at the quality . I 've bought other lines but always end up giving the items away . and replacing it with a Circulon product.The Symmetry line lives up to my expectations of Circulon . I was a bit hesitant because the sides are thinner than my favorite Circulon items but they preform wonderfully.I 've even repeatedly put them in the dishwasher and they hold up quite well . I 'm very impressed.The only draw back is how the hang from the pot rack . The hole in the handle is not an open hole so they hang differently on the hook . Took a little bit of getting used to and I was not sure if they would be secure but once on the hook they stay put .	1
This is my first experience with a pan set in this price range . I have always been skeptical about these pricy sets , wondering if they really are any better . I have to say that I do think the price tag is worthy of the products in this case . I am in love with this set in every way.The color is great - a bronzy semi-matte metallic brown . I love the silicone grips on the lids and handles - no more pot holders or oven mitts ! They are a nice weight , yet not overly bulky . They feel substantial and are a dream to cook with.The non-stick surfaces are truly non-stick in every sense of the meaning . You know how when you dump out pasta into the strainer and there are a few lonely noodles left that kinda stick to the pan , not because they are burnt on , but just because of the starches I guess.. well that does n't happen with these pans ! EVERYTHING slides right off of and out of them . I know it is just a small rather meaningless example , but it is something that really sticks out to me as far as their performance with the non-stick coating.They clean up so very well and super easily . Everything rinses right off . I have tried to overcook some items on/in these pans , just to really test them out and see if anything will stick , but so far nothing has . It is almost amazing . I have had other sets in the past that I thought were great , thought the non-stick coating was great , but there is something different and even better with these pans.The sizing is great on these . I love that each piece is taller , instead of shorter and wider . The pour spout on the smaller pot is convenient.There is something with the lids too , the way they sit on the pans or something that deters the pot from boiling over . The lids let out just enough steam I guess maybe , that it does n't allow it to boil over . I have never used another set where I did n't have a boil over at some point . At one time or another as water was boiling for too long , the lid would start to bobble and the water would boil out in between the pan and lid and of course over the side of the pan and onto the stove . This does n't happen with this set.The pans carmelize like heaven . I have never used a set that performed this well in that aspect . Everytime I cook with these , I fall in love all over again.I really feel like everything cooks better in these . I originally thought the price tag was just for the brand name and they would n't be any better than my other Farberware set , but after using them for a while now it is easy to see that they do actually perform better overall and are worth it .	1
Search Amazon or the Circulon site , and one will find a variety of cookware sets in a wide range of prices . The shopper wonders how much better the higher priced sets are and is this extra cost worth the outlay . I thought about these things when I bought Mrs. Spudman the Circulon Elite set for Christmas . She likes the set but found it wanting in number of pieces and in those lids with the annoying , hard to clean crevice on each one . When I was presented with the opportunity to review the Circulon Symmetry set of cookware , I wondered how different they could be and how much better they could be for the almost $ 150 price difference.The difference in quality between the Circulon Symmentry cookware and its Elite cousin is readily apparent as one removes the new cookware from its carefully packed and protected cardboard cocoon . Each piece is resplendent in its elegance , design , and heavy composition . The handles are artfully designed and embellished with the Circulon logo . The ends of the Elite cookware have holes at the end of each piece to enable hanging . The Symmetry pieces have openings for hanging at the end of each handle , but the opening does n't project through both sides of the handle . These pieces are so heavy that I 'd be hesitant to hang them anyway.The Symmetry pieces have a non sticking coating called Autograph . After some online research at cookware sites , Circulon and at DuPont , I concluded that the Autograph non stick treatment is a top of the line enhancement.Other likes : The small sauce pans have curved lips on the edges to accomodate pouring . A nice touch.Symmetry pieces work well on our glasstop stove and heat quickly . Foods cook evenly and the only way cleanup could be easier is if somebody else did the cleaning for you.Even though you normally ca n't see them , the bottoms of these pieces are aesthetic treats , shining in the middle with easy to read , embedded printing stating the capacity of each piece.Lids on the Symmetry pieces excel and surpass those of the Elite set . The lids are heavy and substantial with handles fastend with large screws that can be tightened as needed . No adjustments are possible on the Elite handles . Thes lids are also much easier to clean than the Elite lids because there is no hard to reach crevice built into the Symmetry lids.We both find the chocolate exterior color very attractive . Also attractive that nonstick properties are on the outside and inside of each piece.Finally - The Circulon Elite is a nice set of pots and pans . It 's a quality set one can own without breaking the bank . For those who are willing to pay more to move up a couple notches for a set that 's both elegant in design and performs exquisitely , it 's hard to find fault with the Circulon Symmetry set of cookware .	1
The first thing I noticed when taking the cookware out of the box was that each piece feels solid and not flimsy . The handles are curved and have a nice silicone grip making them both comfortable to use and to hold on to . They are attached by 2 rivets that eliminates the handle from coming loose . There is a hole in the back of each of the pan handles , allowing the pans to hang . The lids are glass with a nice high silicone covered grip making these both user friendly and easy to grasp . This design does make the lids more difficult to store in the cabinet , but they `` nest '' nicely on top of the pots . The height on the handles would allow for easy hanging as well . The lid design makes them easy to clean.This cookware can go from stovetop to oven . According to the manufacturer 's website , it can safely be used to 400 degrees F. I also found a warning that the handles may fade over time from oven use but will not affect the silicone grips or the cookware . It is hard-anodized and has the Dupont Autograph Nonstick Total Food Release System , making them metal utensil safe . There is a warning against using sharp utensils such as forks and knives , but other metal items are not supposed to damage the nonstick coating . The manufacturer discourages the used of nonstick cooking spray as it can damage the non-stick surface and does not require the pots/pans to be seasoned . This set is dishwasher safe ( I ca n't comment on that as we do n't have a dishwasher ) and comes with a limited lifetime guarantee which does not cover misuse - high heat , sharp utensils , etc.I 'm very satisfied with this set of Circulon Symmetry nonstick cookware . One of my favorite features of this set is the small ( 1 quart ) pouring saucepan . It is perfect for making gravies and sauces , as long as you do n't need a large amount - at times I do wish it was larger . The pots/pans heat slower than thinner pans and retain the heat better , but do require a medium to low heat , as high heat will damage the nonstick coating . I have not had any problems with foods sticking , even without using any type of grease/fat . One morning , while making oatmeal , I was sidetracked and by the time I returned , the oatmeal was quite browned on the bottom , but did n't stick or create any type of mess that was difficult to clean.This set appears to be well made and seems like it will last for many years to come !	1
This is my 4th piece of Circulon Symmetry cookware . I also have a 12 '' saut & eacute ; , 10 '' and 12 '' skillets . The saut & eacute ; came with a stylish glass lid . The other pieces did not.I selected this line of cookware , because I 'd previously purchased stainless Anolon cookware compatible with my new induction cooktop ( love the cooktop , not so keen on the cookware ... it sticks ) . The Symmetry cookware is anodized aluminum , but with an induction-compatible flat stainless base . I ca n't speak to its performance on conventional electric or gas cooktops , but all pieces heat very evenly on my induction cooktop . I expect their performance on conventional cooktops would be superior , as well.It 's touted as non-stick inside and out , and I 've found this to be true . Cleanup is easy . I hand wash even though it 's `` dishwasher-safe '' . It 's also compatible with metal utensils . But I still have my Anolon plastic and silicone utensils from previous non-stick cookware I owned . So , I do n't intend to test this cookware 's resistance to scratching.My only gripe is that there are no lids like that of the saut & eacute ; available specifically for the Symmetry skillets . Amazon does offer lids for the 10 '' and 12 '' skillets from a different Circulon line . But I have n't seen one for the 8.5 '' skillet . I 've used the stainless steel lids from my Anolon cookware for this purpose ( at least the Anolon is good for something ) .	1
This pan has been a good durable nonstick pan . I like that it is dishwasher safe and would purchase it again .	1
We use this pan every day ! Usually for our eggs . We love it . Bought 2 more of this style in bigger pans , but this is our favorite . I think you can put it in the dishwasher , but I do n't . Its just to easy to rinse out and put away . Also I have started hand washing my newer pots just because its so easy to do now and it leaves more room in the dishwasher for other things . I recommend it highly . Thanks Circulon !	1
I love this brand and this is particularly good . Just wish I had bought a slightly larger one . Nothing sticks and instructions say not to use spray .	1
OUTSTANDING ... ... .CIRCULON IS BY FAR AND AWAY HAS 'THEE ' BEST NON-STICK PANS ... ... .BAR NONE . BETTER THAN THE PRICIEST OF PROFESSIONAL COOKWARES , WHICH I HAVE AND DEFER TO CIRCULON . BUY IT ... .PERIOD . ( I still have my original set my father bought me when I was in college , over 10 years ago and it STILL retains it 's non-stick surface ! )	1
This cookware is not only attractive ~ it is wonderful for cooking ~ with or without cooking oil . It easily rinses clean and it can also be put in the dishwasher . I clean it both ways . I 'm not sure how the top flare will interfere with its fit if the stove top is full , but so far , that has not been a problem . I 'd love to have the full set ... but currently have all I need in the other sizes in my old gray anodized Circulon set . If I find a significant sale , I 'll buy the set , else I 'll purchase the individual pieces as needed.As a 3/13 update to my 7/12 review , I did buy the set , Macy 's had the best deal at the time , and passed on most of my older Circulon set to Salvation Army , keeping only its 12 '' saute pan . The saute pan in the Symmetry set is 10 '' . Washing in the dishwasher only once disappointingly does remove the deep sheen . Without using the dishwasher , the recesses of the metal on the handles accumulates an unattractive baked-on amber color coating ~ guess that I 'm not the best at hand washing . But , I love the set .	1
Works great on my induction stove which is why I purchased the Symmetry model . I have had Circulon cookware for over 25 years now and the Symmetry series stands up to the best of them . I use them daily and find their evenness in cooking superb . I have cut my use of oils by 50 % with no sticking or crusting . You can dry cook in them with no sticking also but I prefer to use either olive oil or butter keep the seasonings well coated on the food .	1
In testing out this cookware set , I was comparing them to my previous set , which are copper bottomed pans . All in all , I found that these pots/pans cooked more evenly than the copper bottomed pans . When I boiled water in these pans , they boiled more evenly and stayed boiling better at a lower temperature.What I did n't like about this cookware set : -First of all , there is no lid that fits the bigger pan - which is frustrating because many of my recipes , you 're supposed to cover them while you cook . Good thing we still had the copper bottom pans & lids to use.-Second , cleaning them was very easy - except I noticed that if any food got up by the fasteners on the inside of the pan , the food got stuck underneath the fasteners very easily , but was not so easy to clean out.-Third , the pans are small - the smallest is good for scrambled eggs or the like , the other is good for maybe 1/2 lb of ground beef . We tried fixing a recipe that had a pound of ground beef and it was too much for the 10 '' skillet.Other than those drawbacks , we enjoy using this set over our copper bottomed set .	1
I bought my first set of Earth Pan cookware about two years ago after reading about them in a national consumer magazine . I was looking for an alternative to the typical non-stick coatings which I believe may be toxic . The reviews for Earth Pan were great so I decided to give them a try . I love them and have had absolutely no problem with them at all . I do put them in the dishwasher as well.My positive experience with them is why I jumped at the chance to get another set in this beautiful color . The bronze is more of what I would call a metallic chocolate brown- I think the pics make them look a little lighter than they actually are . It 's a rich color and the pans are a joy to cook in . They conduct the heat well , clean very easily and are a great nonstick solution . It 's funny that some people say that their eggs stuck because when my mom cooked an egg in the skillet she commented that is was sliding all over the place . I have a feeling some people just put the eye on too high a setting . The nonstick works awesome and the scratch resistant surface compares to stainless for me.I 've noticed other reviews that say after a while they have had trouble with their pans . I have not experienced this with my 2 year old pans or with these yet , but I will certainly update this post if that happens . The first set I purchased was the hard anodized set so I do n't know if that makes a difference long term either . For now , I definitely recommend this gorgeous set !	1
I did n't get the opportunity to use all of these pans , but I did use three of them while I was cooking my fabulous spaghetti , which is really quite good . I started out by using the larger pot to boil water in preparation for cooking the spaghetti . I kept the glass lid on it to trap the heat and speed up the boiling process while also be able to keep an eye on it so that I knew when it was ready without having to take the lid off . Very nice feature ! I then proceeded to cook my sauce in the next largest pot and after getting all of the sauce ingredients in the pot I covered it , again with the glass lid , and set the burner on a medium setting while I prepared the meat and mushrooms in the frying pan . Once I had all the various meats and three different varieties of mushrooms in the frying pan , I covered it with a glass lid and set the burner to a medium-high temperature . Obviously you can not use a metal spatula or spoon with these pots and pans because of the coating inside them . You have to use plastic or wooden utensils . Not really an issue , but one you do have to remember or you will damage the cooking surfaces if you use metal utensils.I then proceeded to stand back and let electricity and these pans do their job . Okay , I did step in a time or two and stir the sauce and the meat and mushrooms , oh and I did add the pasta at the appropriate time , so I guess I did have a bit of a hand in the cooking process.The cleaning process was also a breeze and after I had rinsed them off with hot water I simply put them into the dishwasher added dish-washing soap and pressed the start button . After they had been cleaned the appeared like the had just come out of the box . No issues with cleaning , although it will be interesting to see what happens when my girlfriend ends up burning dinner one night . Ha Ha HaAnyhow , the pots and pans all worked great and I did n't really have any problems , although and I do n't know if it is just me or the handle design , but you have to be careful that you do n't touch any metal portion of the handle when you grab the lids or you will get burned . The handle covering themselves is very well done and quite thick so it really gives you something to grab onto , but I felt that they should have extended the handle covering down further towards the lids to ensure that you do n't risk burning your hands when you lift them off the pots and pans . But other than that one small issue I have no complaints whatsoever.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD 's .	1
This is one beautiful set of cookware ! I love the color and style . Once you get into the kitchen , however , it makes an even better impression on you . It cooks evenly and is comfortable to work with . I will definitely buy more . The only downside is that you have to be sure to care for it correctly , but , you have the same issue with any quality cookware .	1
This is the best cookware set I 've ever owned . I actually have this set in a 13 piece that was offered through Costco for a short period of time . My old , much more expensive , Calphalon basically was wrecked after 5 years . The true test of cookware is how it holds up in the homes of lazy , sloppy people . Not that I consider myself lazy and sloppy , but today I was boiling dark purple wooden popsicle sticks for a craft project for my kids . Forgot about the sticks and the water boiled away , leaving the wooden sticks to burn on the bottom of the pan . Once the burning campfire smell drew me back to the kitchen , I lifted the sticks out and let the pan soak for a couple of minutes , brushed it out with the dish brush and there was not even a mark or finish problem at all . I was absolutely amazed - I mean , it was burning WOOD on the bottom of a pan on high heat ! This is the second time I 've had the empty pan sitting on a hot burner and the pan was fine . I recall that this `` feature '' was on another review I read before I purchased the set ... that alone sold me.I cook constantly , and my food is perfect everytime . Cooks very evenly ... cleanup is fast and you can even just pop them in the dishwasher . The handles are wonderful and stay cool . AND , you can use metal utensils on these things ! Need I say more ?	1
In the past year I upgraded a 20 year old set of Circulon cookware with a new set of Circulon 2 . Nothing was wrong with the old set ; my kid inherited it for his first real apartment post college . I 've been singing the praises of Circulon since the first set , but this set is probably the best.Hard anodized and non-stick , this set is a step above . I considered my old sets non-stick ; they were/are a snap to clean and even burned on food comes off with little effort . Circulon Symmetry requires no effort . A quick swish in soapy water seems to do the job , though you can also put it in the dishwasher according to the manufacturer . I have n't tested this out because a quick hand wash with Dawn is quick and does a good job.The biggest draw that Circulon has for me is its construction . These pans and pots heat evenly and produce nice results without inconsistencies such as burned spots or undercooked spots.While the manufacturer says this can be used on a flat surface electric range , I used it on my dual fuel range which has gas burners . The cookwear heats evenly and does a good job regardless of whether you are sauteing , boiling , or steaming . I put the chicken parm I made on the cooktop in the oven at 350 to melt the cheese . No problem ; it did the job and the pan was fine after the clean-up . I also deliberately burned cheese in the smaller frying pan to see if there would be any issues with sticking or marring of the pan 's finish . There were no issues . The pan was pristine after washing.This set is high quality . The handles appear to be solidly riveted to the body . The bottom interior of all the pans heat evenly . The handles remain cool . The lids are sturdy . I dropped one and it was fine . Great considering their glass.The other plus ( a big plus ) is that you can use metal utensils with this cookware.This 11 piece set is probably perfect for most people as it has 3 pots of varying size , a large stockpot , 2 frying pans , a large and deep sauteuse , and four lids . The only things Inwould have liked in this set was a stirfry pan and a chicken fryer , but I 'll see if I can get them separately.My favorite features on this new set are its sleek design and nice balance -- -- not too heavy but sturdy , the glass and metal lids which fit like a glove , the non-stick 'quick release ' feature , and the fact that I can use metal utensils.I 'd recommend Circulon to anyone , but this set in particular is a good choice for anyone with an active lifestyle who likes to keep things simple and does n't want to deal with messy cleanups.As this review is predicated on my initial impression , I 'll revisit this review later if anything comes up of a negative nature .	1
The non-stick coating on this cookware is called Autograph 2 , it is one of the latest and best available . It is a three coat process that renders a very durable durable surface that can be used with metal utensils.Purchased this set to replace our ancient mis-matched and abused pots and pans . First off I wanted to see if all of the claims were factual . Cleaned in the dishwasher , used metal utensils , even cooked eggs with no oil or spray , then used our portable induction burner . I can honestly say that everything passed with flying colors , the set is up to it all ! The hard anodised aluminum , which is stronger than steel , is thick and gives excellent heat distribution from the bottom and up the sides with no apparent `` hot spots '' . Tried all of the cookware pieces on the induction burner with no problems at all . I will say that it 's probably easier to clean this with just a wipe with a dishcloth and rinse , rather than use the dishwasher , the non stick is that good . Metal utensils worked fine , but we have so much of the nylon , as it was necessary with the old pots and pans , well , we use that . Could never fry eggs in the old stuff with out using some oil , not with this , the eggs just slide out.We also purchased the four quart sauce pot and the covered stir fry pan to go with this set . The lid on the four quart fits the eight inch fry pan , nice to have . Have used the covered stir fry as a wok and as a steamer . Use a small stainless rack that fits in the bottom , great for steaming . Also , it does stir fry without as much heat as the old one , suppose because the heat conduction is so much better.Am absolutely pleased with this purchase , it is tough , cooks very well and looks great ! Would I purchase again and recommend this set ? -- -- You bet I would ! Afterthought : Our set is the Chocolate , same set different color .	1
I have this set , and some Infinite pieces as well . This is only my opinion , but I think the Infinite pieces are slightly better than the Symmetry.On the stovetop they are great . But I do have to take off a star for the handle design and for the fact that they do not perform as well in the oven as the Infinite.The Symmetry will go into a 400F oven , while the Infinite will go into a 500 F oven because of the difference in the handles . The Infinite handles are made of stainless steel.I prefer the handles on the Infinite pans . They feel better in the hand and the pots/handles seem better balanced , plus the handles will go into a 500 oven for broiling.There is a trend toward manufacturers using silicone handles on nonstick cookware at the expense of lowering the overall temperature at which we can cook with our pans in the oven . I would rather have a pan with a handle that can handle a 500F temperature and be able to put my pan into a hotter oven.Both sets of cookware are great , though . You ca n't go wrong with either one .	1
I 've been using stainless steel for nearly a decade with an occasional anodized skillet thrown in the mix.During that time I 've cooked everything from mac n ' cheese to Italian to a variety of complicated Indian dishes that often require a near scorching of the onions while preparing the masala.With the stainless steel , the post cooking clean up required a good deal of elbow grease . During the cooking process the pans did n't always heat as evenly as they probably could or as quickly.Of course I did n't how annoying all these drawbacks truly were until I received this Circulon set a few weeks back.Oh my goodness , with everything I 've cooked in these pans over the past several weeks I 've been been extremely impressed with the vast superiority in quality on all accounts to what I 'd been using before.For example , one of the skillets was used for cooking pasta sauce last night and once dinner was served , the burner was accidentally left on med-low for over an hour . I envisioned some hard scraping going on , but a quick few moves with a nylon scraper took everything off with only a touch of water.VERY PLEASED with this set .	1
I was in the market for a new set of cookware as my 10-year-old wedding gift Emerilware set was finally losing its non-stick and getting a little scratched up . I had tried the single piece from a similar line ( theCirculon Elite Hard Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch Covered Deep Skillet ) and it was really great ... .at first . I 'd say for the first year or so , it was super non-stick and was a joy to use . However , I probably used it maybe 1-2 times a week for just over two years ( purchased February 2009 ) , and by that time it was done . Maybe not ready for the garbage , but certainly not something I 'd trust for NON-STICK ( I still use it with lots of oil or butter ) . I never put it in the dishwasher or used metal utensils , so I think it just lost its non-stick naturally . Now , I know this is a review for the set and not that specific pan ... but I assume them to be a VERY similar line ( Circulon Elite vs. Circulon Symmetry ) so they ca n't be all that different.So , that said , I still went ahead and ordered this set because it has a great assortment of pieces , I like the rubberized handles , and I wanted glass tops . And although the description says you can use metal utensils , I just ca n't bring myself to do that since I am sure that would just shorten the life even more.These are a dream to cook in and clean . Nothing sticks ( yet ) and you can practically clean them with a paper towel or just by running hot water over them -- which is a definite bonus.I do think the price point is a little high , since it 's about what I paid for my Emerilware that lasted 10 years ... but I guess if you 're looking for an overall good ( not great ) quality set with a bunch of pieces , this would be a decent set .	1
A perfectly nice set of pots and pans - easy to use and to clean - there 's one for every need . I especially liked the pour spout on the one pot . How many times have I made a sauce , or anything else that I wanted to pour into another container , only to have it spill over the sides ? Perfect for soup which eliminates the need for a ladle - one less thing to clean ! I also liked the glass lids , but of course condensation still requires you to remove it in order to really see what 's going on inside . The nonstick coating prevents burning and makes cleanup easy and quick.I can tell I 'll get a lot of use out of these pots and pans . They should last quite a long time if cared for properly.UPDATE***This product has worked so well that I now have two sets-one in black ( shown here : ) and one in brown .	1
I bought these at Macy 's about a year ago , got a few extra pieces not listed on amazon.They have been fantastic and show no signs of wearing out . These are well worth the money , they look great and the quality is very good . The non stick coating is excellent and still looks brand new . I do fill anything I use with hot water and soap after use so I 'm sure that helps the cookwares longevity . This is a great buy if you are looking for a quality set without going to the poor house .	1
Received this set about a week and a half ago . This is the most amazing and durable set I have ever owned . I have used every one of the pots and pans ( with the exception of the smallest ) . I will say that the one thing I really enjoy is the feel and gripping of the handles and the way the lids are custom fit with grippings which emulate the handles on the pots . Considering I am not the best chef in the world ( although I am desperately trying to be , lol ) , I sometimes overccok items . I found nothing to stick to the inside of the pots and after I have washed them each at least half a dozen ( or more ) times , the set looks and feels brand new . If I had one complaint , at all , is that I would have liked the largest pot ( 8 quart ) to be wider ( all pots have a tendency to be taller , but not wide ) . When I cooked lasagna , I would have appreciated the pot to be wider to make it easier to stir and separate the noodles . But outside of that , I absolutely love the Circulon brand and highly recommend them to anyone ( especially for a shower or wedding gift ) . I will be buying this set for my daughter in law for Christmas ( I think this would make a spectacular gift ) .	1
This is a very nice set of cookware , but I 've had many non stick cookware sets . The problem is the non stick element is n't going to last . The only pans in my house that are non stick are my 10 '' and 12 '' egg pans and as much as I would like to buy a really expensive non stick egg pan , I already know that they do not last more than a few years . I just buy a good heavy bottom egg pan that does n't cost too much so I can throw it away every year or two.If you want to buy cookware every 5 to ten years then this is fine , but you would be better off going to a Calphalon outlet ad picking and choosing what you really want and need and then buy the cheaper non stick pans for the use I stated above .	1
I upgraded to these Circulon pots and pans from classic steel Revere Wear and I 'm wishing I would 've switched sooner ! ! The tops are sturdy glass with a polished chrome edge and chrome and black handle . The pots/pans themselves have a great rubbery grip that does n't get hot . They do n't need cooking spray and the small ridges on the inside/bottom keep the food from sticking to the pots and pans.One thing you should know ( that is n't really a big deal when it comes to function ) If you 're planning on hanging them on a pot rack , it may be a problem-the handles do have hole for hanging , but the holes do n't go all the way through , so it 's difficult to hang them on the traditional `` S '' hooks on a normal pot rack . Other than that , these are great and I would recommend them for anyone looking for a great set ! !	1
I lost my pots and pans in the divorce . I bought a cheapish set of Kitchenade ones at Target and thought they were ok. Well , compared to this Circulon set they are less than ok . I could tell the quality of the Circulon ones as soon as I opened the box . They are solid and heavy . The handles feel great in my hand . All of the joints are large heavy rivets . The glass lids are sturdy as well and have nice cool to the touch handles.They are nonstick . I love nonstick . I tested it by frying an egg with no spray or butter . No problem ! Egg flipped and did not stick . But for me at least the biggest plus to nonstick is the cleanup ! And boy do these clean up nice . Very easy . No scrubbing at all . I do not put them in the dishwasher since I like them too much . I wash by hand and it 's not a chore at all . I went so far as to install those wire rack sliding drawers in a cabinet to hold these awesome pans.They also say they are oven safe but that the handles may discolor at anything over 350 degrees . I decided not to use them in the over . I 'll use an old pan if I make something that requires it to go into the oven.Overall , I would buy these again and recommend them to everyone.Notes : - Easy cleanup due to the the excellent nonstick- Extremely solid and well made.- I will buy more of these- My favorite cookware ever	1
I love Circulon - this is my second set . The first set is 12 years old and I moved it to our second home , as the two most well-used pans needed to be replaced . I bought this set to replace it . I love it , it 's beautiful and not as heavy . I have two problems . One is , they are very deep and so the bottom is not as wide , therefore , not so much surface on the stove . This is a problem when you are trying to brown something . The nice rubber-handled lids are lovely to look at , but not deep enough to cover a sandwich on a griddle when you 're toasting it . I had to buy 3 extra pans to go with the set , in order to have enough big pans to cook with . And there is only me and my husband , so be aware that they are slender and deep , and the pan lids are shallow . Other than that , lovely , easy to clean and very nice to use .	1
These are the best pans I have ever had . I received them a few days ago and have been cooking with all of them . The set is very complete . It comes with 3 skillets , 4 pots , and 4 lids - 2 large , 1 medium , and 1 small that fit everything but the small saucer.All pots and pans have a bell shape tapered edge that makes pouring very easily and without any mess . The handles wo n't get hot during cooking . I have cast iron skillets which work great but with weak wrists , cooking was becoming more difficult . These pans are not very heavy - slightly heavier than Teflon.The surface is non-stick and it works real well ( no peeling off like Teflon ! ) , you can use metal spatulas without worrying about scratching . The heat is evenly distributed ( tried pancakes ! ) and the pans are a good match for my glass top stove ( no wobble ) .The cleaning is so quickly . I have n't put them in the dishwasher yet ( though they state it is safe ) only because I have n't had the need , they wipe off so easily . I know that if I was to buy this set , I would like to know if putting them in the dishwasher is indeed safe , so I am testing this as soon as I get one pan really messy.I hope this set lasts me a long time . Normally I have to purchase new skillets every two years or so ( except for cast iron ) . I am willing to come back in a year and write and update . I highly recommend this set , you wo n't be disappointed . ******QUICK UPDATE : I put one of the skillets and a lid in my dishwasher to test . I used Cascade gel complete packs as detergent . The skillet came with little white spots , the lid was fine . The spots do n't look like a big deal ( did n't damage the skillet ) but I sure wonder if overtime , this grows into a bigger issue . My decision is NOT to put them in the dishwasher anymore .	1
Before I start complaining , I want to emphasize that these are very very high quality and the best set I 've ever owned ( I also have the anolon setAnolon Advanced Bronze Collection Hard Anodized Nonstick Cookware Set , 11-Pieceand I think they are both of equal quality ( made by same company ) but I prefer the circulon set ) . The anolon set is more beautiful/elegant but not dishwasher safe and do n't work with all heat sources.The bottom of these pots and pans is very thick which make these amazing . There are no hot spots . It was amazing to watch water boil in them and have even sized bubbles form everywhere in the bottom . It is very forgiving if you have the burner too hot as food wo n't burn in specific spots.These are dishwasher and metal utensil safe . I use them in the dishwasher all the time but I do n't want to use metal utensils in them.When I first got them , I hand washed them and carefully put them in a metal drying rack . This was a bit of a mistake because it faintly scratched the outside . So I do n't want to use metal utensils just in case ( I got a plastic dish rack shortly after ! ) .These are extremely nonstick but I 'm not a fan of the circular grooves in them . It makes stirring sauce in them strange as the spoon runs over the grooves . And I think the the nonstick quality is good enough not to need these grooves.The sides are n't very thick but the bottom ( base ) is what matters for heat distribution and they ( bases ) are the best I have ever used . They work with all sources of heat ( induction etc ) .Another thing I 'm not a fan of is the end of the handles . They have a depression on the bottom side so one can hang them . When I put them in the dishwasher ( upside down ) they get full of water . I 'm not sure why they did n't just punch the hole completely though like they did with the anolon sets.So while both anolon and circulon sets are the best I have ever used I would actually pick these circulons because they work with any heat source and are dishwasher safe .	1
We had to replace our Emeril non induction cook set when we went to induction stove top.This is even better than the Emeril stuff .	1
I wanted a nonstick pan with a lid that was light-weight and sturdy . This Circulon fit the bill perfectly . It has n't warped or twisted even after daily use and the best part is that it is light compared to other stir-fry pans I 've tried . You need to be able to lift the pan with one hand and then toss the contents up but some pans are so dreadfully heavy that it becomes a weight lifting exercise to lift the pan . Also , although light , the pan heats up quickly and stays pretty much evenly hot throughout use . If it came in a smaller size , I 'd buy that too .	1
I 've enjoyed using this new 12 inch stir-fry pan . I have a similar one made by Anolon that is a few years old now . While this is a nice product , I do believe that its quality is less than the similar one made by Anolon . If you are looking for a cheaper model that still has good function , though , you should try the Circulon .	1
We purchased the Symmetry eleven piece cookware set plus this piece to replace our old mismatched cookware that we have had for years . I can only say that we are not only pleased with the quality of Symmetry but also how well it preforms . The cookware is thick hard anodised aluminum , which is actually harder than steel and conducts heat much better . Thicker means better heat distribution and no `` hot spots '' . The non stick is a three layer coating called Autograph 2 , it is one of the newest and best available . It can be cleaned in the dishwasher or simply wiped clean , which is what we do . The coating is tough enough that metal utensils can be used -- we still use non scratch as most of ours were used on the older pieces of cookware.Stir fry is a favorite of ours so this pan gets used a lot . Have found that we do not need the high heat as much as in the older pan , and that because of the thick construction the heat is more even from the bottom and up the sides . I need to also mention that sometimes we use a portable induction burner and all of the Symmetry pieces work fine including the Stir Fry pan.The glass lid makes this piece useful for a lot more than stir fry -- have a small rack that fits in the bottom of the pan that makes it great for steaming . This piece is a wonderful addition to the set and one that gets used a lot in our kitchen.Just an afterthought : Fried eggs in the eight inch pan , no oil , no spray etc . they slid out onto the plate with no help -- the best non-stick ever !	1
The evenness that Circulon Symmetry has take some time to get used to . I have only cook on less then perfect nonstick pans . It always amazes me how awesome food looks and tastes like tastes on Circulon Symmetry . Do yourself a favor . Collect all of your pots and pans and walk out to the trash and put them all inside the trash bin . Now go on the Internet and click on Amazon site . Look up Circulon Symmetry hard analyze nonstick pans-order every pan to replace every pan you just threw away . We all spend too much time in the kitchen to use rudimentary and now we know dangerous potentially fatal poisonous nonstick pans . I believe you 're worth it . I believe you deserve an excellent set of pots and pans . I hope that you enjoy them and take my advice . Love & Hugs ! ! ! !	1
You ca n't expect the world from this product , but you can enjoy a great deal . It is lightweight , balanced and sturdy . Although labelled a stir-fry pan , it is much more versatile than that . Because of the secure , flat bottom , it is ideal for omelets , pasta sauces , frozen-dinners-in-a-bag and more . My husband turned an egg over with a flip of his wrist . Please note the sides are quite curved , so you probably wo n't be browning pork chops in it , but you can do practically everything else . The ergonomic design of the handle , tight fitting see-through lid and oven compatibility are plusses.Do read the directions . It is n't meant to be used with non-stick spray . If you want to use oil , you should apply it with a paper towel . This is , after all , a non-stick pan . Use moderate to low cooking temperatures or you may warp it . Instead of scrubbing and scratching it to clean , the instructions say to boil a mixture of vinegar and water . Finishing a frittata or omlet in the oven is great , but again , you may warp it if you put it under the broiler.As with all products , carefully following directions is the key to optimum usage . This is a well-designed , versatile pan that I am happy to add to my kitchen . My one quibble with it is that it is called a stir fry pan , but should n't be used at high heat as most stir fry dishes call for .	1
It appears to be made of quality materials . I 've only had it for about two months so I ca n't speak to longevity but it 's getting the job done way better than the cheap one I bought out of roger years ago .	1
Circulon is a great brand and I was excited to get this 12inch nonstick pan . It 's an easy and wonderful addition to the kitchen . It has sloped edges which make it easy for tossing/stirring and a variety of things beyond stir fry . We use it frequently for pasta dishes , sauce dishes , and of course stir fry . You ca n't actually use this pan at the traditional stir fry heat but I did n't find that to be a problem . Clean up could n't be easier - just a paper towel and clean it off . I would n't recommend putting it in the dishwasher , even though it is dishwasher safe . Overall a terrific pan and one that gets the most use in my kitchen .	1
I needed a new frying pan and this one and a couple of others I ordered are just perfect . Love the way nothing sticks to the bottom . I have no trouble with cleaning the rings as others have said they have had . I have n't used the dishwasher to clean them just a kitchen sink brush and washcloth . This one is more like a wok in the shape and fits small burner . So far I love it .	1
I almost never give more than four stars to a functional product such as cookware . Why ? If something does a task that it was designed to do , that does n't automatically qualify it for rave reviews . It means it is good and effective . But I must tell you , I quite fell in love with this Circulon Symmetry Ultimate Stir Fry pan over the holidays . As the name would imply , this is a pan that might be used in place of a regular fry pan but its design lends itself to wok style cooking . It has a real versatility and depth to make it an essential piece in our household.Cons : The only negative thing that might affect someone buying the pan is that it is quite heavy . I think this is actually a plus , but just a shout-out to those for whom this may be an issue.Pros : Size and shape give you the classic twelve inch width , but the stir fry depth make it virtually impossible to slosh contents over the side . Sturdy and durable , hence the aforementioned weight . Looks great . And this one ( surprisingly ) is genuinely made to be dishwasher safe . That 's a big bonus on professional style cookware.We have done some stir fry in this pan , but I suspect we 'll be using it for much more varied cooking . I do n't really gush over pots and pans , but this one is a winner . KGHarris , 11/12 .	1
This is the ultimate fry pan for stir fry . I just love the depth and the lid , I have a screen to cover when I use use it for wontons . A hint , put the lid on put the pan on low heat and turn the heat to low and heat the pan for 10 mins . a great pan ! clean gently with soap and paper towels .	1
This is a good pan , that and I just recently updated the rating to 4 stars ( up from 3 , in February 2014 ) .Note that I have a anolon pan around the same price range now ( I paid $ 30 in 2007 for it ) , and those are better quality pans . Explanations below : Pros : - Ample room for family cooking ( 4 - 6 people ) - Rubber handle stays cool to touch- Comes with a lid to help keep heat in and cook faster- Good quality and solid feel.- Looks goodNeutral : - Lighter than my Anolon professional pans . ( can be good or bad depending on your preference . I like the heavier ones myself ) Cons : - Teflon coating has a texture - circular lines / indentations . I 'm doubt the usefulness of them , but despite the nonstick coating , it takes more effort to clean the food on this , specially if you cook sticky stirr frys or you burn your food a little at the bottom . My other smooth teflon pans clean out very easily , the little pattern on this one makes it harder . [ See Feb 2014 update below , not as big issue as it seemed at first ] - Does not have the same quality construction of Anolon series pans . ( not just weight , but finishing , glass quality of the lid , the handle , etc ) .Overall I give this pan 3.5 stars . If I had n't used the anolon professional series before , I 'd probably give this pan 4 - 4.5 stars . But given that there are better ones at the same price range , it loses a star.UPDATE , February 2014 : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Thanks to user comments below , I was prompted to look at this review again , as well as the pan I had used as the barometer for this one getting a less than stellar rating.The pan that I recommended over this : Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch Covered Ultimate PanI 've owned that Anolon pan since October 2007 - and it is still in good condition . What has changed is that pan 's availability , and the price - as only third party sellers have it . I just checked my order ( Amazon has history all the way back then ) . I paid $ 29.99 for that pan . I also bought a second one as a gift in 2010 , for $ 33 . Unfortunately I can no longer find that pan under $ 59.99 dollarsUpdated impression on this Circulon pan : - While the indentations make it `` harder '' to clean , it really is a very minor difference . The more I 've used it - if you do n't burn the food a bit - it cleans almost as easily.- It has held up great . Their are minor marks on the non-stick surface , but still looking and working well.- It has more room than the anolon pan mentioned above - I use this one when I am making a larger meal , as it 's a little taller , ( not quite a wok , but probably half an inch taller than the anolon one ) - The lid has also held up fine and I use it about half the time ( the other half I use the anolon I got in 2007 ) So overall , given that price change to the anolon pan to be almost the same as this pan , and the fact that this one has held up great , made me up the review to 4 stars.The anolon one is a 5 star pan ( now just slightly less expensive and better quality ) while this one is a 4 star pan.So I 'd check for that one first , but this is a very good pan as well , and I 've been happy with it , use it just as much as the anolon one .	1
I absolutely love this Stir Fry pan ! So much so , that I use it for a lot of other things as well ( potatoes and scrambled eggs , just to name a few ) . It truly is non-stick ! After cooking potatoes , onions , mushrooms , and spinach in a little olive oil I did not have to clean the pan before putting my eggs in . There was absolutely zero cooking grease ( you know , that black crunchy-sticky stuff left over from sautee-ing ? Completely came off when I poured the veggies into the bowl ! I put my scrambled egg mix right in and the eggs were perfectly yellow with absolutely no crunchy burnt pieces.Of course this pan is perfect for stir fry too . It is wide and very deep . I noticed when using the lid ( which was piping hot from the heat of the pan ) , the black part of the handle was hardly hot at all . This is a great feature ! No matter what you are cooking or how hot it gets , you can easily take the lid off with your bare hand ( just be careful not to touch the metal parts- because they are very hot ! ) . The rubber part of the pan handle was also warm- not hot , to the touch.I did not test the `` metal utensil safe '' feature because just in case it did n't work , I did n't want to have a scratched up pan . I continue to use rubber or plastic utensils while cooking.All in all , this pan is superior to most pans I have used . It heats up very quickly , truly is non stick , and is simple to clean ! I will definitely be checking out other products made by this same company . Very pleased !	1
I am a big fan of Circulon and already have the 8 inch , 10 inch , and 12 inch frying pans in the Infinite series , Circulon Infinite Hard Anodized Nonstick 10-Inch and 12-Inch Skillets Twin Pack . I recommend them highly . The nonstick is really nonstick and the hard anodized surface scratches much less easily than many other nonstick surfaces.I am also a big fan of of making stir fry but because of my glass top stove , a traditional steel wok with the curved bottom is not an option . Instead , I have a large hard anodized nonstick stovetop wok with which I am very happy . It 's theAnolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick 14-Inch Covered Wok with Glass Lidand big enough to make a family dinner . However , nowadays with just myself and my wife at home most of the time , I find the 14 '' Anolon wok much bigger than I really need for a weeknight dinner for two , and I find myself using my 12 '' skillet much more often.When I saw that Circulon had a 12 inch stir fry pan , it looked interesting and I thought I would give it a try . Overall , I am pretty happy with it . All the Circulon pans have a circular stainless steel disk on the bottom which actually sits on the stove and passes heat into the pan . The thick metal base means that the pans provide very even heat and retain heat when food is added so that the pans do n't cool down as much . It also means that the pans work well on induction stove tops . The diameter of the disk on the stir fry pan is only about 5 1/2 inches as opposed to the 9 inch base on my 12 inch skillet . That gives the stir fry pan a much narrower bottom along with higher and much more sloped sides than my 12 inch skillet . This makes it easier to do that continual tossing associated with stir fry , something which is a little more difficult in the skillet . Like all the Symmetry pans , this one lacks a hole in the handle for hanging it from an overhead pot rack , so be aware if that is a concern for you . Also , the Infinite series pans have an all metal handle so they are oven safe at 500F instead of the 400F of the Symmetry series , an advantage if the pan needs to go in the oven or under the broiler.Still , net result is that this pan has become my first choice for making weeknight stir fry and it is a welcome addition to my collection . I like that it comes with a glass cover for simmering , something missing from the skillets . If I could n't have both pans and had to make a choice , I might have to give the nod to my more general purpose 12 inch skillet since the wider cooking surface gives better results when doing a couple of steaks or a few pork chops or chicken cutlets while still being adequate for stir fry . However , when using it in its official role , making stir fry on my glass top stove , this pan in the Symmetry series is great .	1
This is a superior pan for those who like to stir fry . The pan has a hard non-stick finish that really works . The pan is substantial , it weighs 2.6 lbs and the lid weighs 2.15 lbs ( I measured on an accurate kitchen scale ) . The hefty weight means a couple of things ; first it takes a little longer to preheat the pan for things like searing , second it heats very evenly . I have used the pan multiple times for things ranging from fried rice , to oriental chicken stir fry , to General Tsao Chicken . In each case , the pan provided even heating and released food very easily when cleaning . I have followed the instructions on the pan , which indicate that it is not meant for very high temperatures for extended time periods , which would lead to damage to the pan . I have used many non-stick finishes over the years and they have almost always lead to the surface degrading - either flaking off or losing the ability to release food easily when cleaning . So far this pan is far superior to other products that I have used that claim non-stick surfaces . The heavy weight of the pan leads me to think that it will last better than the much lighter pans that I have tried in the past . Another real plus for this pan is that you can use metal utensils with it ... not that many non-stick pans can claim that ! I recommend this pan.I will add to this review after more use and update the durability of the pan .	1
We have been using these for sometime now . We cook a lot and this is our goto pan for most of the cooking and works perfectly for us .	1
This stainless steel bottom pan will work on any kind of stove top including induction and work well it does . Food heats nice and evenly when I use this on my induction stove . The pan 's non-stick interior has a fine durable quality and cleans up easily . I 've only had this pan a little while , but I 'm expecting to get many years of good use out of it along with the other similarly manufactured Circulon pans I own . The size of the pan is conveniently large enough for preparing a variety of different sized meals without being too large to be convenient to use or clean up afterwards . The shape makes it good for saute , stir fry , simmering and general frying . The lid is nice and sturdy as well and fits snugly . This is an excellent product .	1
This is a great pan . Big . Heats fast on induction cooker . Great quality . Dishwasher safe . Even heating.I have the matching circulon set ( Circulon Symmetry Hard Anodized Nonstick 11-Piece Cookware Setyou can see my review there ) and this matches them in quality.It 's not a complaint , but something to be aware of : the base itself is n't that big and tends to slide on induction cookers . I do n't think this is bad at all and the I would still recommend it , it just surprised me .	1
Very beautiful shape and design and everything.Especially not sticky . Very practical.Too good.I come from China , very suitable for our diet.Titanium , really cool .	1
This pot is so perfect . The weight is great for assured balance on the stove , the lid has a great weight to help prevent spillovers , and the size is fantastic for making up those larger amounts of chili , soups , goulash etc . for freezing and easy meals from freezer on your busy rush days . Fantastic to clean up , a breeze , even the lid and the handles ( lid and pot ) are very effective in preventing the hot handle syndrome . One precaution , watch the heat level when keeping the lid on . It very effectively traps in the heat and takes less time to come to a boil then you might think . I would buy this item again . Thanks , Joyce Wagner	1
Great heavy duty nonstick pot . I needed a larger pot than what came with our set so I ordered this one . Works great and is holding up well .	1
I purchased the black one to match 2 other pans that I already had . The hard anodized is the best for cooking evenly and so easy to clean . I used to purchase cheapie non sticky pans but if you want quality do not hesitate . I also love the fact that we can use metal utensils and the 6-qt size is just right !	1
This is a great pot . It makes enough for 6 people or as little as one serving . The lid acts as a strainer and both pieces can be put in the dishwasher . Love it !	1
This is my best pot - non-stick , heats well , I use it all the time , for candy making to stew , recommend for any chef and serious cook .	1
An absolutely beautiful pot with good weight , nothing sticks , cooks food very well . I wish I had an entire set . You can not go wrong with this pot believe me .	1
I needed a pan that works on induction cooktops so I bought this one . I have used it many times in the last couple of months and I love it . Works great on induction and cleans up easy , and it seems like it will last a long time .	1
It became my main pot for pasta . Love the straining lid . Angel hair slips through a bit , I wish they had a smaller straining opening .	1
ive only used it once , to scramble some eggs , and usually the eggs get crusted at the bottom and are difficult to clean off . wit this saucepan , they came off clean with a spatula , and rinsing with hot water left it spotless . pretty impressive so far . only first use though . if things go south , ill update this with a new review and rating .	1
This pot is very well made . It is sturdy and durable but not as heavy as other pots . It 's well designed . I just love this item . I highly recommend this product .	1
nothing to say , but that it served its purpose and matches the other items in the kitchen . great great great	1
I 'm not a fan of stainless steel pans , but this is an exception . This is a well-made set that comes with the essential pieces most people need . It has a non-stick coating that provides instant release of even the stickiest food ( burned melted marshmallows or macaroni and cheese ) . The exterior and the interior is easy to clean with soap and water . The sauce pans have high sides which go a long way when it comes to preventing splatters . The pans can be put into an oven up to 400 degrees.The pans distribute heat evenly and the interchangeable lids are glass which fit snuggly and offer a good view of how the cooking process is going without having heat loss.I deliberately dropped a sauce pan and it maintained its shape and there were no indentations or marks . All handles are riveted onto the cookware and they are there to stay.The saute pan has high sides and is wildly versatile . You can make a lot of different things in this pan.This set is attractive and durable and seems impervious to most of the things that destroy cookware such as dents , scrapes to the interior , loose component , and pealing non-stick . The entire set has a balance and symmetry to it without seeming heavy or cumbersome . It is sleek , modern , and attractive , but more importantly it works as promised and offers real value.The only thing I did n't like was the handle on the lids . They protrude awkwardly and are harder to store because they take up more space and do n't exactly nestle into one another . Not a deal breaker , just something that seemed to detract from a reasonably priced set that just might last forever .	1
After much hullabaloo with Amazon in regard to & # 8220 ; in stock & # 8221 ; vs & # 8220 ; no , it & # 8217 ; s really not in stock & # 8221 ; causing our order to sit in limbo for a week , Amazon pulled through and delivered ! This set is beautiful and feels very sturdy ( haven & # 8217 ; t used it yet though ) . We bought it when it suddenly went on sale and so we got a set for our son and daughter-in-law for an anniversary gift and they are very happy with the set . Then my other half bought a set for me for my birthday . First time in over 10-years I actually own a set that matches . By the look and feel of this cookware , I think these are going to last me a long time . I don & # 8217 ; t care about if any water gets in the handles as it & # 8217 ; s hard enough to find cookware nowadays that will last beyond a year without warping issues and/or coating chipping off into your food so I & # 8217 ; ll take durable , long lasting cookware with water in the handles ( if it happens ) over warping and chipping any day of the week . By the way , the set arrives very well packaged so no issues there . So I & # 8217 ; ll give 5 stars for Amazon & # 8217 ; s great customer service and 5 stars for Circulon & # 8217 ; s excellent packaging and beautiful , quality cookware .	1
Great set of cookware that can be used on glass top range . Most other cookware of lesser quality are just not worth it .	1
As a professional chef I often get asked and often ask myself to demo a variety of cookware for my cooking programs and culinary classes . It was a joy to see this set hit the Amazon-vine program and I looked forward to opening my box of pans the moment they hit the front porch.First let me say they were packaged quite well and the lids fit perfectly onto the handles to allow each pan to be placed on my pot rack . In the package were a 1-quart covered saucepan , 2-quart covered saucepan , 8-quart covered stockpot , 8.5-inch french skillet and a 10-inch french skilletThis set is a great set for the average kitchen and I have enjoyed using them for a variety of tasks from omelets , stir fry 's , cooking pasta all utilizing metal utensils . The coating is very durable and will take up 400 degrees in the oven without flaking off or melting the handles . The lids go well with the pans and many reviews commented that the handles are too big . I 'm used to storing pans and lids aside from each other but they both work well together if you want to hang them up.I really like the exterior finish and it 's very easy to clean and maintain and has stood up to the dishwasher and scrubbing by hand . As for the interior you can burn marinara sauce , scorch milk and overcook mac and cheese till it turns black and each will simply drop out of the pan and wipe clean with little effort.I will say that high heat cooking is out if you are not adding in a liquid or some sort of fat . You will need to get a traditional pan without a non stick coating to get a good sear , unless the pans specifically state they are non stick and made to sear , such as those from Calaphalon.As for the price you really ca n't do any better for a complete set such as this . You get a great set of high quality cookware that will give you loads of versatility in the kitchen . Will this cookware set do everything if you are looking for a do it all professional set , no . Will this cookware set give the average to budding professional chef the option to get creative and have fun in the kitchen , yes.Enjoy the set of cookware , you will not be disappointed .	1
Things I love about this cookware : Non-stick : truly a non-stick surface , they virtually wipe clean . I just swish lightly with a dishcloth and rinse.Non-splattering : when cooking meats , such as burgers , there are no more grease splatters to clean up ! I 'm guessing it 's because of the small grooves in the non-stick surface , but I no longer have to cook with a lid on or use a splatter screen.Lid handles are comfortable to handle and STAY COOL to the touch . No need for a potholder to remove a lid.Nice assortment of sizes : I especially love the straight sided deep skillet.One thing I had to adjust to : medium heat is the maximum you can use for these pans so you need to allow slightly more time for them to heat up , but once they do they cook like a dream . I 'm very happy with this cookware and would highly recommend it !	1
I 've been using these pots and pans for a week and I could n't be more pleased . First of all , the looks are fantastic . They match my kitchen appliances and deco ( black and stainless ) . I have intentionally done a few things to these pans to test the nonstick surface and have had amazing results.I burned some milk in one of the pots until I thought it would require some scrubbing . Well , after letting the pan cool off , I was surprised to see how everything peeled right off the pan like nothing.To test for an even heat , I made pancakes . I could see the evenness all around , very pleased . I used metal spatulas at all times and regular tablespoons with some sauces that I did.They are no trouble to wash at all . And I was able to put some of the lids in the dishwasher without a problem.I also did some research regarding the coating which is `` Autograph2 '' from Dupont . It is different than Teflon , even better because the nonstick wo n't peel off and end up on your food.Overall , I am very pleased with this set , and highly recommend to one who 's looking for a practical and neat complete set . And looking around , the price for these 3 pots and 3 pans ( plus lids ) is very decent .	1
Just got these today and they are beautiful ! Sometimes stainless steel looks cheap , or at least it can look like that to me , but not these , these are high quality all the way . Our family is familiar with the Circulon name and have found through hard use that it is a quality product ! Never before have we had a pan that distributes the heat so evenly , having an electric stove , and not a new one i might add , that means alot ! Plus the clean up is extremely easy on these , the handles do not get hot , i tell you this is a great product line !	1
This is my second set of Rachael Ray Hard Anodized pots . I was happy to get this set . It is 14 pieces which I really love . You get your usual 1 and 2 quart saucepans , 3 quart saute , 6 quart stockpot and 8.5 and 10 inch skillet . In addition you get the 3 quart saucepan which is hard to find and a size I use very often . You also get a 4 quart saucepot , I have never had a pot this size and I really love it . It is good for making smaller amounts of thing you would ordinarily make in the 6 quart stockpot . Such as pasta , rice or even corn on the cob if you break them in half . I think having the 3 quart and the 4 quart makes this the set of pots to buy . It saves you from having to get these sizes from open stock which will cost you a lot of money.I found these pot to be a good weight and also a very good non stick surface . These pot are good for all cooks but especially some new to cooking . Its see through lids also help cooks see what they are doing . The most frustrating things for new cooks is when things stick and they do n't get the results they are looking for . Also it is very frustrating when you have to soak a pan overnight just to get it clean . With these pots , you will not have any of these problems . If you are looking for a bridal shower gift or a wedding gift , I would recommend these . The additional of the 3 quart and 4 quart make the set more convenient than most sets of pots.I also think these pot are very attractive . I like the see through lids and the orange handles , which stay cool throughout usage . I recommend these pots and am very glad to have them .	1
This Rachael Ray cookware set comes with eight pots and pans and six covers . The covers are made of tampered glass with stainless steel rims and handles . The handles are covered with comfortable orange rubberized grips . In spite of what the product description says , it is often hard to watch the food cook on account of all the steam , glass cover or not . The pots and pans are made of heavy gauge hard-anodized aluminum , which gives the cookware a hefty feel in spite of the light weight of the metal . The anodize coating is a layer of aluminum oxide produced by an electrolytic process . It renders the metal surface non-reactive to acidic foods and suitable for cooking purpose . Like all aluminum cookware , this cookware set provides quick and even heating due to the very good thermal conductivity of the metal . The interior of the pots and pans is coated with a clear non-stick material but foods like fried eggs do stick somewhat . A little elbow grease is required for clean-ups . Similar to those on the covers , the handles of the pots and pans are made of stainless steel with orange-color rubberized grips . Orange seems to be the favorite color of Rachael Ray . She has been photographed in her orange dress . The name Rachael Ray is prominently engraved on the rubber grips of the pans and a reproduction of her signature can be found at the bottom of each piece of cookware . All that gives the set a celebrity chef aura and it does look attractive . It makes a nice wedding gift to newlyweds . The instruction warns against using high heat . This cookware set is obviously aimed at the average homemakers . Professional or aspiring gourmet cooks may find it limiting .	1
I love this set of Rachael Ray cookware . I cook at least one meal each day for my family and this cookware is very nice to use . I recommend it and I will buy more pieces to add to this in the future .	1
This is a great set of cookware , perfect for someone like me who makes most meals at home but does not consider myself a chef by any means . I have found this set durable and very nice . We have been using them daily for months and have not had any issues.My favorite thing about this set is the variety of sizes . Our last set did not have as many options and I am especially loving the 3- quart covered saucepan and the 4-quart , covered sauce pot . They are also very nice looking ( I particularly enjoy the orange handles ) and easy to clean.I am a frugal shopper , and I feel like this is a reasonable price for the amount of pots and pans you get and the quality of them .	1
How well do these cook my meals ? Since I usually use my Cuisinart high-pressure cooker to cook everything under the sun , I was intrigued to see how well these performed compared to my usual staple kitchen item . I have to say , cooking bacon and eggs was pretty quick . The heat flows fast and pretty much evenly.What is the construction like ? It 's not cast-iron , so you will need to be somewhat careful with it in regards to tossing it into your cookware pantry . However , the handles and lids are of high quality , so I do n't have to worry about those breaking or coming loose.How non-stick are they ? It 's pretty good . I mean , I always cook with a bit of coconut or olive oil , more less for flavor than to prevent sticking . However , when I fried an egg in smaller skillet , none of the egg stuck to the pan.What is clean-up like ? As noted in the non-stick category , clean-up is easy as can be . The most effort you are going to need in cleanup are the lids and the rivets used to adhere the handles . Other than than , the cooking surfaces and sides require only the soft side of a sponge to get most of the food removed . ( Granted , I 'm saying this from the perspective that you wash your cookware right after you cook , and never let the food settle in the pans . )	1
I purchased an earlier iteration of this set for my Wife a few years ago ( A 10-piece set ) , and we absolutely love it . We use it , literally , for every meal . So when the opportunity to test-drive the new and improved 14-piece set came along , I jumped at the chance.Cosmetically speaking , there are a few minor visual tweaks that have been made here and there , but nothing is really very different except for one thing , and it 's a biggie , at least to me : The side handles on the pots are closer to the pot itself in this set , and they can get HOT , something the handles on the previous set never did . This is a MAJOR design flaw in my book ... ... I 've been using the old set for over a year , so I 'm generally on autopilot when I 'm cooking , and I 've been burned a few times so far by the super-hot handles on this new set . Another major difference is that this set is ( Supposedly ) dishwasher safe , which the old set was n't . I say supposedly because they stressed so strongly that you should NOT put the old set in the dishwasher that I 've become used to washing them all by hand , which I 've continued to do with this set . It 's not that big a deal , though , since it 's almost impossible to get anything to stick to these pots and pans . They really are marvelous to cook with , and cleanup is a breeze . Just watch out before you grab those handles ... ... ( Another reviewer asked what the `` Limited '' lifetime warranty entails ... ..I can answer this , due to an ongoing experience we 've had with the old set . Basically , it means that the set comes with a big list of things that you can do to the cookware that would render the warranty null-and-void , such as boiling the pots dry , using them as double-boilers , washing them with brillo or putting them in a dishwasher ... stuff like that . We cooked a huge meal at Christmas , and when I was doing the dishes , I noticed that the coating was discolored on the inside bottom portion of the largest pot . We contacted the manufacturer about the warranty , and were told that we need to send the pot back , at our expense , and it would be reviewed by their team , and they would decide if it 's something they would cover or not . I have yet to summon the wherewithal to actually box it up and wait on line at the Post Office , but I 'll post an addendum to this review once this all gets sorted out . )	1
This cookware is not just attractive . It is made of hard anodized aluminum and has a nonstick finish.Wiping and hand cleaning is recommended . I 've been using Rachel Ray cookware for about six months and using those plastic scouring pads are also useful . Basically though , they clean very easily.This very durable and scratch resistant cookware is designed to heat evenly and speed cooking time..The tempered glass lids allow you to keep an eye on your food as it cooks without having to keep removing lids for peeks.I love the stainless steel and silicone handles . They are rated oven safe to 400 degrees . You can take them from the stovetop to inside the oven and you can bring it to the table to serve without mitts.I 've been using Rachel Ray 's cookware awhile now and have been very happy with it.The quality of this cookware is apparent and is a great buy for the money .	1
I love this set . I already had the 8 Qtr Oval pasta pot ( B000HTW9IK ) which is great for cooking pasta without having to break it first . This set goes great with that . I Love this set . It is very durable , completely non-stick . The orange handles are great . Cear lids work great for seeing your food without having to remove the lids . They do clean well in the dishwasher . This set is just the right size , includes all the right size pots and pans . I would recommend any of her cookware , I am a very happy customer !	1
have liked this cook ware set thus far . seems like the coating always ends up coming off of other brands but this one has stayed well .	1
Love these . Good price and colorful . Good quality Arrived fast and packaged well . Love Rachel 's colorful products . Will buy again .	1
This is my first cookware set by Rachel Ray and I absolutely adore it . It is very attractive , easy to clean and the quality is outstanding . The best part about this cookware set is that it is just so easy to clean . It is dishwasher safe , but I still do n't put my pots/pans in the dishwasher . Super easy to clean the old fashioned way : ) The orange grip is comfortable and does n't get hot because of the material . Perfect . I have n't had these for very long yet , but I 'm thinking they 're going to last a very long time . ( We 've already used them every day since receiving them about two months ago and they still look brand new . ) Maybe in a year I will update this review and let everyone know how they 're holding up.OH ! Let me also say that I prefer this 14 piece set because of the brilliant variety of sizes . There is literally a pan or pot for everything I need.I am definitely going to continue to purchase RR cooking products from now on . Highly recommend this set ! !	1
I purchased these for my son . He is actually enjoying to cook with them . Heat great and balanced . Colors are awesome .	1
I have never owned a better set of cookware and it seems to work well for all types of cooking needs .	1
I love to cook , and am a fan of nonstick . I did a bit of research & decided on these after much deciding based on the number & different depths of pans . I had two frying pans that are great , but not very deep . These frying pans are deeper , but the sautee pan has great sides to it.I 've cooked a few really good simple things that are typically pretty messy and the end grease & grimes comes right off . I love new pans ! .Things I 'm not going to trust : - I 've ruined & # 34 ; Dish washer safe & # 34 ; pans before by putting then in normal wash cycles , so never again.- I probably wo n't use the oven ( safe to 350 degrees IIRC ) , but if I wanted I would.It says to not use a heat over the & # 34 ; medium setting & # 34 ; I 'm going to see if this makes a difference w/ longevity.I 'm not impressed with the puny sizes of the frying pans . When you buy a chicken breast these days , the give you half a darned bird . Two breasts are impossible to cook in te smaller pan , & difficult the do in the bigger fryer . It 's impossible to do both at once if you filet them like I do .	1
In 2010 my GF wanted a new , large pot for cooking meatballs . I picked up aAnolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick Rachael Ray 8-Quart Covered Oval Pasta Pot . This was my introduction to the brand . Everyone who saw the pot was impressed - the girls all knew the brand . It 's been used many times , and is fantastic . Then I was given the option to review a set and jumped on it . I was just as impressed . So much so that between friends and relatives , we 've purchased a few sets , some as gifts . Then I was given a chance to review another set . Wow ! My cookware is now the envy of everyone I know.You can spend $ 200 on one high-end pot , or around that for a set of this stuff . This is the much better buy . The pots and pans are not as thick as other really expensive brands , but are just fine . No hot-spots , very tough finish , and nothing sticks to them . I burned hamburger helper last night - popped right off . No scrubbing . The orange handles - OK , that I could do without - they are bright enough to act as a rescue signal . But they stay cool to the touch , unlike the bi-metal handles many brands rely on.You will not be disappointed with this set - there 's everything you need , and more .	1
Color is true to picture . Works very well , never had any issues with it . I have had it for about 5 months and it gets almost daily use . I have only heated water in it and I rinse it out frequently . Zero complaints .	1
Functions the same as any tea kettle , but just adds a pop of color to the kitchen . I leave mine out on my stove at all times and it 's never an eye sore . It comes true to color as well .	1
Not much to brag about here . Very straightforward . Uniform slices every time , easy to clean too . Pretty much a grown up egg slicer without the pocket for the egg .	1
So the dogs sort of insist on a good cut of the Spam , verses the unthinkable from a can of who-knows-what sold for our pet companions . And to that end , this product works great ! Cleans up easy too ! While I would surely never admit to eating Spam , I do have to do some QC from time-to-time and this makes it less messy .	1
I got this to slice a can of & # 34 ; luncheon meat & # 34 ; so that it would be easaier for frying.works great . I have found that it takes a slow steady pressure to effectively cut.cleans up great without needing to run it through the dishwasher , but can be if necessary.we also used it to slice up tomatos with no problem.vikings would love it for a gift !	1
The Cal-Max Digital Food Scale is quite nice and easy to use . It 's sturdy and well built , even surviving a minor off the kitchen counter . Its one-piece design and hard plastic outer shell make it extremely easy to clean , while it 's small footprint makes it very easy to store - whether in a drawer or on the counter.My major complaint is that the display screen really should be a little larger . Also , as another reviewer mentioned , the keypad is similar to a standard phone , which makes it somewhat difficult to enter information . I respect that everyone is looking for as much counter space as possible in the kitchen , but even if this was twice its size , it would still be pretty small . That being said , the calorie-counting benefits of this scale greatly outweigh any cosmetic complaints I have , and very clearly this product does exactly what it advertises . Having just started a diet at the new year , this is a very useful tool that I will most likely be using daily .	1
This is a very nice little kitchen scale . Unlike some other reviewers , I did n't have any trouble reading the screen . Although I mostly use it as a food scale , I imagine that the calorie measurement would be very handy for those on strict diet regimines , especially diabetics and atheletics in training . It is also small enough to fit into nearly any kitchen drawer . Good value for the money .	1
For those who are measuring their caloric intake this is a great little food scale.It comes with a small book of instructions but it 's fairly intuitive to use . It took me just a few minutes to read it and I started using it right away . You just enter the food and put it on the scale and voila , you get the caloric value.It also has a function for you to add food that is not already included in it 's memory , you can get the caloric value from the internet.The first night we got it , we spent an amusing evening measuring calories from around the kitchen . Very useful for calorie counters.The scale itself is very nice , slim and small . It 's one piece and does n't have nooks and crannies so it 's easy to clean . The buttons are rather small though . Overall a very nice design , easy to clean and easy to store away when not in use . I like it very much .	1
As anyone knows , it is hard to estimate the weight of a food portion . Most of us tend to underestimate and thus consume far more calories than we want to or need . This scale really does take the guess work out of that . It 's really simple use and clean up is a snap . If you or anyone you know has one of the old-fashioned manual kinds , strongly consider upgrading to this model . The only thing I wish is that it came in other colors besides white .	1
I looked at a lot of different digital food scales when I was working on managing my diet . This one is very small and sleek , and I love the calorie calculation feature . It makes it easier to use fresh ingredients that do n't have nutrition labels and still stick to a calorie count .	1
Just as a scale this is great ! Measures grams , oz , etc . even small amounts register -- this makes it great for measuring a variety of food.I like that I can cut up some cheese , or put on some crackers and with the food library not just get the weight but also get the calories . Makes it easier to limit my portion to a particular calorie count . Also helps build awareness of not just that this is what an oz of cheese looks like but this is what a 100 calories of cheese ( or whatever ) looks like.A great tool for keeping track of my food . I keep it out on the counter all weekend long to help control snacking . If it is going to go into my mouth it must first go on the scale . I couple this with an app for my android and it helps to track all my food.Like any tool only as good as the user . Since this tool is overall very easy to use hopefully it will help with my commitment to keep using it .	1
I had an old kitchen scale that was really on its last legs . I really like to buy things in bigger containers when possible , since it is usually ( not always ! ) cheaper . Sometimes though , you need a smaller amount and recipes often give package sizes , not cups . Chocolate chips and nuts are some that I use frequently . Recipes often call for 12oz bag of something or the other . When you have a 3 pound bag , it is hard to guess.I also like to buy big `` family '' packages of ground beef . But if you have ever frozen a whole one of those , it ends up being a concrete block ! And if you need less ... you are stuck . So I make 4oz portions of it and put each little `` hockey puck '' in saran wrap , then when those are frozen , drop them into a bigger freezer bag . Instant hamburgers . Or , if you need more , it is easy to pull out 4 for a pound . And so much faster to to defrost . I always use this scale for the 4oz portions . I actually put like 15 pieces of saran on the scale , drop a handful and measure , then add or subtract more . Then I just gather up the meat and one sheet of plastic wrap . Repeat . this scale is very nice for those purposes . It has a `` zero '' setting ( often called `` tare '' ) so you can put your bowl , measuring cup , whatever on it , and zero out the weight ... so you are just measuring the contents NOT the container ( with no pesky mental subtraction ! ! ha ha ! )	1
I have two uses for this kitchen scale , and one of them is a bit unusual - I weigh my cat on it . Anyone who needs to weigh a pet knows that a regular bathroom scale wo n't work ( unless you have a German shepherd ) . Most kitchen scales only go up to 5 pounds , which does n't help if you have a medium-sized cat . This scale tops out at 11 pounds , which makes it perfect . Okay , not everyone wants or needs to weigh their pet , but it actually comes in very handy ! The second way I use this is far more traditional . I began a diet three months ago and have already lost 21 pounds . Technically , I do n't need to count calories , weigh food or track it all by meal , day or week . But it can be fun , and there are all kinds of extras on this scale , such as adding your own recipes . It comes with 1,000 foods with their calories , but you can tweak it . I 'm not giving it 5 stars because it is n't a priceless , vitally important addition to your home . But it is useful and can be fun , so I do recommend it . You can also calibrate it so if you weigh something in a bowl or basket ( like the cat ) , you can zero out the weight of the container . I recommend weighing food or pets in a container for sanitary reasons , even though the scale itself is easy to clean .	1
I mainly got this to use as a kitchen scale- I was n't really looking for a calorie-data tool , so that was n't my primary motivation in ordering it.As a scale , it 's great . It 's the first electronic kitchen scale I 've ever used , and the precision of using an electronic scale makes a huge difference in accuracy , which lends to better food production . I have just a few things I cook that require precise amounts of certain ingredients , and these are measured by weight , and when I replaced my inexpensive manual scale with this one , I noticed an increase in the consistency of what I was cooking . The only thing I might change is the increments of measurement- the scale indicates weights in quarter-ounce increments , and tenth-of-ounce increments or something might be nice , but that might also be more precise than most people need . As it stands , quarter-ounce has been sufficient for me.As I said , I did n't order this with the calorie-counting in mind , but it 's been an interesting bonus . I have n't really used it out of necessity , as I 'm not really into calorie-counting , but out of curiosity , and for the most part it 's been accurate . It 's most effective application obviously comes in figuring the caloric content of fruits , vegetables , and meats , which do n't come packaged with nutritional information . As a test , I 've looked up items I already know the caloric content of , and it 's been pretty accurate with those . The only potential concern is that some of the categories and items are fairly generic.It 's small , light , and unobtrusive , looks good , and seems to be sufficiently well-built and sturdy . I have n't noticed anything like smearing ink on the buttons or base ( which I noticed a few reviewers comment on ) even though I 've gotten it wet several times.It 's a good kitchen scale with a nice built-in nutritional-data tool that many people will find helpful , which is a great combination at that price point .	1
The Taylor 3847 Cal-Max Digital Food Scale seems to be very accurate right out of the box , when I tested it for calibration . It is a feature rich , easy to use unit that not only comes with a huge database of pre-configured foods , but you can also add your own specific settings for things it might not already have . It is slim and has a modest footprint , taking up very little storage space or countertop space , which is a huge bonus in my already overpopulated with gadgets kitchen . The surface is easy to clean , and the display is very easy to read with a nice backlight . The buttons feel good , easy to press , but not cheap or flimsy . I suspect this unit will last a very long time if properly cared for . Overall , this seems to be a good investment for the calorie-counters and those just in need of a decent electronic food scale .	1
Oh well , I have to admit , this Taylor Food Scale has really made me 'fess up to the reasons for my weight-loss plauteu ! I belong to an online health , weight-loss and fitness group ( Spark People ) and everyday , I enter my food choices and often need the ounces to calculate the calorie `` in '' column.The Taylor has opened up my eyes as to how easy it is to fudge these numbers . For example , I love bean and cheese burritos . When inputting the burrito into my calorie `` in '' space at Spark People , I was entering a `` fast food '' burrito ( 8 ounces ) when in fact I had been eating a `` drive-thru '' burrito , but from more of a HomeStyle kitchen . I set the burrito onto the scale and weighed it ... come to find out , I had been eating a 14 ounce , 780 calorie burrito when I had been calculating 360 calories . So much for my slow weight loss.I found this scale easy to use , although the digital screen is a little small , but not impossible to read . Overall , a good product and very , very worthwhile if you are tracking the weight and calories of the food you eat .	1
I really do n't use a crock pot as much as I should . But I was in the market for one that was not oversized . This crock pot can cook a meal easily for 3 , 4 if they are not that hungry . I like the warming feature . I have used it twice and it worked like it was suppose too .	1
I find this to be very useful . It does get very hot so one must be careful . And be sure to keep it out of reach of children .	1
I received this slow cooker for Christmas and am so very happy with it . I do a lot of cooking , and sometimes I ca n't be home to do last minute cooking for dinner , but still want to serve my family a quality meal . This allows me to set how long I want my food to cook , and then will automatically set it to warm when it 's done . I love the fact that the insert can be used on the stove . This allows me to saute onions or brown meat prior to the slow cook without using a separate pot . Cleanup is very easy as well . This is a wonderful appliance for any kitchen .	1
I love this crockpot ! ! ! I almost bought a more expensive one that browns your food and gets up to 500 degrees but it got bad reviews so I found this one with great reviews and less than half the cost . It is so light and you can put it right on the stovetop then right into it 's shell . I never would use a crockpot because I always had to dirty 2 pans so I can brown the food first . Then all the great flavor stayed in my pan I browned and not in the crockpot . This is the best crockpot I have ever used . I can even deglaze the pan with some wine and cook it down then slow cook my dish all day . Great Buy ! ! ! !	1
I do n't have a lot of money to spare . These are a nice price and I actually like them . I like the silkiness they have . I 've washed them a few times and have had no problem . I 'd recommend .	1
... not that I 'd want to ... but you can . I replaced a rug I purchased at a major brick-and-mortar chain store with this GelPro Comfort Mat . I wanted something I could stand on without experiencing fatigue while doing dishes and preparing meals . I could n't be happier . It 's a little thicker than I thought it would be and it took a bit of getting used to ... yeah , I tend to shuffle my feet along sometimes instead of picking them up ... the designers thought of that and made slopes sides so your foot actually trains itself to lift the appropriate amount and you do n't & # 34 ; stub & # 34 ; into it . It has a squishy yet firm feel under my feet , for me , it 's a perfect mix . And the color is really pretty .	1
This is super comfy ; however , it DOES slid all over the place . If it did not walk , I would think it is the best mat ever .	1
I ca n't say enough about this mat . I bought one as a gift and I have two ! They make a huge difference when you have to stand at the sink or counter for any period of time . Highly recommend this mat !	1
I hope this last a long time , I love them . Wow , what a difference in the maintenance of a carpet , and they are every bit as soft and warm , just in a different way . I would not be without them ever again . I have them everywhere I used to place a carpet . I love the colors and textures they have , these are fabulous . Well worth the prices you pay for them on Amazon .	1
looks nice in the kitchen , VERY comfortable and the red is so vibrant , looks great in my kitchen ! easy to wipe clean as well .	1
I bought two for the kitchen : one in front of the sink and one in front of the range . These gel filled mats really do offer excellent cushioning while standing a lot over these areas . I really need to get an additional one for the food prep area . Had two of my teen 's friends over for her birthday party , and when one step on it , he jumped off , took off his shoes , and stood on it in socks while telling the other teen how great it felt . So the other teen took off his shoes and stood on it too ... and there they both were for 5 minutes sampling different cookies while enjoying the gel mats ! So if you are trying to get your teens to do dishes or cook , this just might be an incentive !	1
I am in the kitchen a lot and we have stone floors so this comfort mat has been a blessing inDisguise !	1
This mat is so comfortable . Would love the whole kitchen floor this cushiony ... ..but not praticle. ! ! : ) Seriously , it is great , easy to clean and does make standing at the sink doing my kitcheny things .	1
This mat is very comfortable and cleans up easily . The color is a little more rusty that I thought but still looks fine in the kitchen .	1
For the price , this mat is first rate ! I wish it was a little bigger . It does slide around a bit due to its smaller size but that is an easy fix . It is very cushy , easy to clean and the color is great . It is more red than orange .	1
I like it ! it a good size for in front of a kitchen sink . It 's comfortable and cleans easily . I noticed complaints about it being only 1/2 inch thick . The description clearly states this and i think its fine . If you want a gel may thicker , i am sure there are ones out there	1
I ordered it because According the web page it 's one inch thick , `` Product Dimensions : 32 x 20 x 1 inches '' . Unfortunately , it is misleading . The thickness is only 1/2 inch not 1 inch.However the over all quality is good , the red one i got is very pretty , it seems like it will be esay to clean . My husband said his back feels comfortable when standing on it . I decided to keep it .	1
The mat works for anti-fatigue . It also cleans easily . I am not a big fan of plastic or vinyl so I was a little hesitant to make the purchase . I bought the carmel color that blended in with my wood floor . It is not an eyesore by any means , although it does n't stand out as nicely as a colorful rag rug might . I really needed something that would not slip underneath the sink , however , and this does well , plus my legs do n't get as fatigued standing up over it washing pots and pans . I do appreciate that the little extra pattern in the mat does add something subtle to the design ; it gives it a some texture so it not so obvious it is vinyl .	1
I love standing at the sink now . This map completely stops my leg fatigue . We do a lot of canning . By the end of the day , my legs were feeling the hours on the tile floor . I love the softness and the ease of cleaning . My husband is less enchanted because he tends to trip over the mat . I tell him that he can get rid of it when he takes over the dishwashing . I 've had the mat for about a year and it shows no wear . I am completely satisfied with this purchase .	1
My husband and I wanted a Mat to put in the kitchen by the sink . This is the best one ! It 's comfortable to stand on and if you drop anything on it , you can easily pick it up or use a wet cloth and dry it . It does not move and slide . It goes great with the color in our kitchen and the cabinets !	1
It felt a little weird at first , but now I just LOVE to stand on this . Even though I 'm not at my sink constantly , it feels good for the few minutes that I am . My friend works at the airport and is on his feet all day long . He says they have these type of cushions stationed in different areas , but they are not NEAR as cushioned and soft as this one is ! And for the price , it is excellent ! Easy to clean , too !	1
I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this kitchen mat was for the money . It does not move around once placed on my tile floor in front of the kitchen sink . I would recommend it to anyone considering the purchase .	1
This mat made my feet , back and legs so happy . It is just the right amount of cushion to stand on for comfort . I paid twice as much for my last mat and it was at least 12 inches shorter than this new mat . The Espresso is very dark brown ( much darker than shown in the photo ) . I do recommend this mat to anyone who stands in one place for any length of time .	1
This is a super cozy mat that does well . My mom and I both have one . It has rubber underneath , but it still & # 34 ; walks & # 34 ; some . However , it does not go flying across the kitchen . Considering the price , the comfort , and how well it is made , I can live with the scooting it does .	1
I bought this product for when my boyfriend and I moved into a new apartment . We cook so much and I wanted something on the floor that would be comfortable to stand on . After looking all over on Amazon , I decided on this product and I could n't be happier . These are reasonably priced ( compared to others that are 80+ ) and they are just as , if not MORE , comfortable than their competition ( and I know because my parents and grandparents have other brands at their houses ) . The color is just as displayed ; I bought the Espresso and it looks great . This mat is extremely comfortable to stand on and when we move into a bigger apartment or eventually a house , I will definitely purchase more from GelPro . These are my favorite and I would recommend them to anyone ! I also think they would be great in places other than the kitchen such as the bathroom or the front door !	1
This mat is nice and comfortable . I do love the bright red color in my kitchen . Only negative is it will move around and needs to rearranged periodically , It 's pretty light weight which makes it move around but also makes it easy to straighten . I was going to be buying another but have gotten updates that they raised the price some so I am having second thoughts .	1
I seldom spend much time standing at the sink doing dishes , but I wish I had one of those when I did ! Comfortable and very stylish .	1
Good support for tired legs in the kitchen area , but not quite large enough for my purposes . I should have chosen larger size , ie a big square one , so I do n't fall off the edges so much . Good quality , and would make good knee pad for gardening , or trying to get down under the bed to find things . My knee replacement loves this pad and is big enough for me to struggle up again .	1
I purchased several of these mats for my kitchen - this one is a darker color than I wanted , and the others are more of an oak color . But by the time I realized I need one more for the space , the lighter color was no longer available . But , it 's okay - and it 's the product I 'm reviewing , not the color . It 's a great mat , and this `` expresso '' color is actually quite nice ! Would look good almost anywhere . One caution - they can slip a little on a tile floor , so you might want to use double-back tape or some other kind of non-skid product under each one . Otherwise , I highly recommend the mat .	1
This mat was very pricey But I thought I would try it because I really needed a red mat in my kitchen . Well , I am very happy with this mat . It is very thick and helps my legs and back when I have to be in the kitchen long hours . Even my husband said it was like standing on air . It stays in place pretty well and does n't slide around . The red color is a deep red which I needed so I am very happy with this purchase .	1
Makes standing at the kitchen sink much more comfortable and was slightly less expensive than the mat at local hardware store .	1
Transforms the kitchen experience -- like standing on feathers while you 're doing the drudge work of chopping , slicing , and washup .	1
I bought 2 of them . One for sink area and the other in front of the stove . I had others in year past , but these are thick and you can tell a difference when you stand a while to wash dishes . I would highly recommend these mats . And the color is right on .	1
Standing for long periods really bothers my back . I find this a great help those days that I prepare a company meal .	1
I love this pan except for the fact that the lid gets very hot when heated on medium/high heat.Its a great size for a number of cooking uses .	1
This time around I was a little disappointed in the shape of my Cuisinart hard-anodized saucepan . This 1 quart size is wider and shallower than I thought it would be but nevertheless I totally love the hard-anodized material that these cooking utensils are made from . The 1 quart size was one I really needed to add to my other Cuisinart saucepans . I have a variety of other sizes and use them nearly exclusively . The photo posted looks deeper than the saucepan actually is so the photo is not a good representation of the saucepan . It 's really a squatty little saucepan , I have to watch it much closer for boil-overs than I would a deeper shaped pan .	1
This was well worth the very reasonable price of $ 60 and just perfect for chili , soup , stew , etc . At 12-quarts it 's HUGE . The one CON I 've noticed is that the outside scratches easily so I have to be very careful putting it in or taking it out of the cupboard . The inside is far more durable and scratch-resistent . For someone with a large family this is a good little investment to make . I 've spent many years using 2 or 3 pans to make chili and stew , as I 've never come across such a large non-stick stockpot .	1
My wife wanted a large pot that is not hard to clean and does not weigh a ton.This is what she selected and is very satisfied with it.She uses this pot for making spaghetti sauce , soup and chili.Nothing sticks or burns and the pot is easily cleaned afterwards.An excellent choice for your large long time cooking needs .	1
This product is perfect for making large quantities of all kinds of homemade soups and stews , which is exactly why I bought it . The shape is appealing to the eye , the lid fits snugly , and like all my other Cuisinart cookware I am very pleased in every respect with its performance . If you need this sort of cooking utensil , it is ideal .	1
This pot is GREAT ! It is so much bigger than I thought , well worth the price ! I cooked with it last night and it was endless how much I could put into it . My husband cant wait til I make chili and fill to the top , boy that will last a month . It cleans up easy , u just need the whole sink to clean the one pot . It cooks great , even heat , sits on burner sturdy , lid fits well and u can see through . It is big , but not heavy , very light , before filling with food . Even with food not too bad to handle . Also very nice looking . This was a great buy , ff u r considering it is so worth it I would diffidently buy more of their products !	1
I love this dutch oven because it is just the right size for recipes of 4 - 6 servings . Also , the non-stick surface cleans up easily with no stuck-on food . And what a value ! The price was right .	1
This is a wonderful dutch oven / soup pot . I needed to scale back to a smaller soup pot , since my family has gotten smaller . This pot is great with respect to heat distribution . Clean up is amazingly easy , even easier than with my other hand anodized pots . The clear cover is helpful , when you want to keep track of how your soup is simmering . It 's light weight , but performs like a much heavier pot . Highly recommended !	1
I already have a nice set of the Cuisinart hard anodized cookware but needed a smaller dutch oven ( my set came with the 12 qt stock pot ) . UPS brought the package to the house today ( love the 2 day shipping with prime ) and I have already used it to make chili in ... perfect size for family of 4 , very light , easy to handle , looks nice ... and the lid fits perfectly ( one reviewer stated his lid was too loose ) . One thing no one else mentioned in the reviews is the top edge of these Cuisinarts are curved so food flows out easily instead of running all over when emptying the pot into a dish . Love that feature !	1
This was a recent purchase and I 've only used it a few times , but there are several features about it that I like . It seems that the cooking area does conduct heat evenly as the product description states . The glass top is nice to be able to check the contents without lifting the cover . The pot is very light which is great when cooking a large meal or boiling water for pasta . The handles really do stay cool which makes handling the pot very easy . Am looking forward to using it in the oven as this is the one feature of the pot I have not yet used . I also really like the shape of the pot as well . The slight curve gives it a very classy look . Happy with this purchase .	1
They are inexpensive but well made , attractive , functional , and easy to clean . The glass lid is obviously useful because you can see how your food is cooking without removing it . I also own the same pan with a domed stainless lid , but wanted another because I frequently need two of them at the same time . I highly recommend this product !	1
Purchase this item to specifically make shredded chicken breasts . I needed something to put 5 pounds of chicken breast to boil so I could make shredded chicken taco meat or enchiladas or ? ? Nice quality pan without the long handles . Good value . Recommended	1
THESE EVERYDAY PANS ARE FANTASTIC . I HAVE PURCHASED THEM FOR GIFTS ALSO.VERY VERSATILE.THEY ARE NOW THE MOST FAVORITE PANS IN MY KITCHEN . & BELIEVE ME , I HAVE A LOT OF POTS & PANS .	1
I bought it for roasting chicken . It 's just the right size . Very sturdy . Easy to clean . Would definitely buy this brand again .	1
Not only is the pot a nice looking addition to my kitchen , its quality assures food is cooked quickly and properly .	1
This came free when I order Cuisinart 's Multi-Pro set . This is a great addition , and I love it . Easy to clean , durable , and heats evenly .	1
Great pan . Very light . oven safe . Great handles . I own other sizes of this pot already . I knew it would be a perfect addition to my cookware	1
I purchased this to replace a dutch oven which has been missing a handle for about 25 years . My only regret is I did n't purchase this particular item much sooner - I so appreciate the clear glass cover to view the contents !	1
This is the best stock pot I have ever owned . The quality is superb , it looks beautiful and keeps its shine , and it cooks beautifully . I would absolutely recommend this stock pot ! Love it , love it , love it ! ! !	1
This was a nice addition to the 17 piece Cuisinart set I bought for my wife . She wanted a Dutch Oven for her set , so I found this one at a great price .	1
I have used this pan constantly since I got it and it is great . My old magnalite was just too heavy . This is light enough to lift but heavy enough for soups , stews , cooking pasta etc . And it looks great too .	1
This looks flimsy , too light , and not well made . On the other hand the looks are not the way these pots and pans are . They are light , tough , work in high heat , and I think the glass cover is great !	1
The only reason for the 4 stars is the size of the largest pot . 5 qt is great , but I much prefer a shorter , fatter 5 qt . pot . Otherwise this set is holding up well and I 'm not one to baby my cookware .	1
Very nice set of kitchen wares with enough lids . Do n't use a fresh green scrubby-it 'll mar the surface . Once the scrubby has been broken in , it can then be used . Easy to clean .	1
I purchased this from Signals catalog for the retail price of about $ 29.95 plus shipping . I would not pay any more than that since it can be purchased on Amazon or through other catalogs for that price when available.It is exactly what I was looking for . I needed something in a powder room to hold extra rolls of toilet paper . I used to have a basket on the floor but it looked messy . This solid metal giraffe holds two rolls of toilet paper with about three inches left over at the top . Or you could use it for a paper towel roll.It is pretty heavy so even though it is tall , it does n't tip over easily . It is smaller than it seems in the picture ( it 's almost as if the picture has been stretched for height to make it look taller ) but it has a small footprint ( takes up just a tiny amount of floor space ) and is perfect for what I needed.A recommended home decor piece when available at the right price .	1
This item is so unique and just fits in my little corner of a space . It adds a whimsical detail to my little bathroom . Yet it 's heavy and does n't tip over easily .	1
Giraffe paper towel holder . Cute but thought it would be large and wider . Still looks cute in my guest bathroom .	1
Whimsical little addition to the guest bath . Came very well packaged , ( I am guessing the seller read comments and took them to heart , there was no way this thing was going to get damaged in shipping ) , and I can fit two rolls on it . Looks just like the photo , no issues with it . And when it is empty it will just look like a nice little sculpture piece .	1
Fantastic . Use this in a guest bath and it keeps everything in the open for when it is needed . It 's cute but no cutesy . A little humor can go a long way . I would highly recommend this item .	1
These are a great size for so many uses & I really like the flip lid . I bought them to use to organize my office area , for crafts , & the workshop . Great for all those little things that previously got tossed in a drawer & then could not be found when needed !	1
these work fine for what I needed them for . They are plastic storage containers , durable and the lids work . 'nuff said .	1
After reading some review , I was expecting the lid to spontaneously fall off or be hard to snap.The reviews are wrong . This product is incredibly easy to use with minimal problems . The seal is n't airtight ( was n't expecting it to be ) , but you can open it one-handed and stack them and feel secure.Unlike the Rubbermaid ones , these do n't have patterns which obscure things or makes them hard to label ; instead they have straight walls . Also unlike the Rubbermaid ones , the seal will never get & # 34 ; stuck & # 34 ; and be hard to snap closed.I do n't lug these around anywhere ( you 'd want something with a stronger seal ) , but for storing things these boxes are perfect , as are their bigger cousins.The lid is attached to the box so it does n't get lost and is easy to snap back again .	1
These containers are simple and plastic . I like that the lids are attached . I use them in my classroom so that can get supplies as they need them .	1
Great little storage devices , and you definitely get your bang for the buck . I used them as quarantine for tiny dart frogs for a few weeks ( I 'm a hobbyist ) . I then cleaned them , and they work great for sorting all the things ! And they 're stackable.Highly recommended ( note , these are not waterproof or airtight when closed ) .	1
You can see everything in them , stack them and still see . Not like the storage boxes that have colored or clowdy tops , which makes stacking a hassle to figure out what 's in them.Clever . Works great in sink cabinets and linen closets . Great for separating different chemicals , like hair dyes . Separating different friendly toxins are good for your health .	1
So helpful for storage and organization , and such a fabulous deal for the price ! I 've ordered two sets and use them all over the house !	1
I had been on a search for folding TV tray tables for about 6 months ( with no luck ) . I wanted a set with a stand but did not want to pay upwards of $ 150 for such . I purchased 2 sets of these tables ( 4 total ) . They arrived quickly and are ready out of the box . They are super lighteweight but very sturdy . They do n't take up much room either , especially compared to the heavy wood styles . Definetely recommend .	1
Really love these tables ! They are so handy , sturdy and just the right height . Would buy them again.Would recommend them to family and friends .	1
I was amazed at how sturdy these tables are . Not only are they great for eating in front of the TV but can be used on my patio for extra table space when I 'm grilling !	1
It is n't as large as I thought it would be but it works in my Disney bathroom . The only caveat would be that it says do n't wash it , spot clean it . I did was it and it pilled pretty badly over the white but I was able to get that off with a small hand vac .	1
Looks just like the picture and a good size . I liked this rug it sits in the bathroom for my kids so the white has gotten dirty within a week but the rug has instructions to not wash and `` SPOT CLEAN ONLY '' on all tags so I know I cant wash it . i 'd like to just throw it in the washer but overall it is a nice piece and good price and arrived quickly .	1
I ordered for my son this mickey mouse hand towel . My son likes . Is beautiful and very soft . Came on time .Thank you very much	1
Perfect weight , perfect size , perfect details . These are cute and good quality . Yes they 're a bit pricey but they 're for the guest bathroom and very very decorative . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Absolutely wonderful electrostatic filter . Every month I wash and re-use . Beats regular filters hands down , saves money in the long run . This company is outstanding and very quick shipping . After ordering just send an email with your filter size . Simple . Filter is very durable , should last a long time . Highly recommended .	1
I should have bought 2 for a few reasons.when you clean it , you have to wait a few hours before putting it back in to let it dry off . and it took the seller so long to get it to me that i would rather not go through that again & # 60 ; 40 + days & # 62 ; despite the delivery issues , its still a good filter . I would n't call it a lifetime filter , I am hoping for 10 years or so out of it , which would still save me a lot of money .	1
Great product , replaces expensive electric air purifiers .	1
Stylish and functional . One of the caps does n't go on quite right if the container is full . Overall great quality , I also bought other accessories such as the chop sticks , egg shapers , and silver wear .	1
My husband recently started riding his bike to work and needed something compact and light to pack his lunch . I bought this base on the reviews , and I am so glad I did . My husband loves the container . It 's compact , but pack the perfect lunch portion . It has a separator that you can neatly put in your food . I took the advice of other reviews , and told him not to use the air vent when microwaving to keep the shape of the lids . Instead , he usually put them on loosely while they are in the microwave . We have had that for about 2 months now , and it still looks as good as new . In fact , I bought another one so that I can prep lunch easier for him.The only minor complaint about this is that the separator is n't a snug fit so that any liquids or sauce would eventually get mix to everything . I just bought silicone molds they make so that should solve the issue . Too bad they do n't make similar products in glass . Otherwise , I would use them for my own lunches too ( I drive to work so it does n't matter , plus glass is better than plastic . )	1
this is a GREAT lunch box ! ! perfect size for a big ol guy like me , cute like a pokeball for my inner child , everything is layed out nicely and allows for some serious bento fun . Plus the convinience of machine washable , microwavable , liquid tight ( WHEN BANDED ! ! ) All in all pretty fantastic .	1
I 'm so much happier with this bento box than my previous one . I like the construction and the size and the look . It 's easy to fit in my messenger bag so I can take my lunch to work on the bus .	1
We 're using it to hold bags of chips and snacks that always seemed to find their way on our counters . It 's wire construction so it 's easy to see the snacks on the shelves . It was pretty easy to assemble . Takes about 5 minutes . As everyone has said , do n't place heavy items on the cart . Also , the wheels look like wheels and that 's about it for those things . I do n't think they are rolling when I push it on our hardwood floor . I think they 're just sliding . I also do n't think they would roll even if on shallow carpet . Definitely wo n't work well if you have thick shaggy carpet . The wheels probably would get stuck and the cart would probably topple over . They are attached off to the side of the wheel with a swivel but the swivel does n't rotate well , so the wheels just slide around without facing correctly to movement . Definitely has no bearings . If it did , it would n't be just $ 18 . I would n't place heavy items on the bottom to make the wheels or the swivel work better . You 'll probably end up breaking the attachment , because it 's made of cheap , thin plastic . Still , cheap wheels that do n't work properly , the cart does its job of holding our snacks and clearing off our kitchen counters , and it does n't look too bad.It stands 33 inches to the upper bar/handle . The baskets are 8-3/4 inches wide , 15 inches long , and 2-1/2 deep ( inside dimensions ) . They are spaced at 8-1/4 to 8-1/2 inches from bottom of basket to bottom of basket . Wire sides are spaced at 1 inch apart . If you were thinking of placing it in a small nook , the space will need to be at least 16-1/4 inches wide by 9-1/4 inches deep by 33 inches high .	1
I own 2 of these because the 10 cases of cat food please 20 bags of cat treats are all stored in both of these carts very neatly . By the way I own 1 cat : ) LOL	1
This set of shelves was super easy to put together and the perfect size for what I needed it for . It is not heavy duty , so I would not put anything heavy on it . I am using it by my sewing machine to hold sewing supplies .	1
We got this to put next to our drier to save some place on the walls . It works great . We 've only needed to wheel it around when we were redecorating the laundry room . The wheels do n't swing around to roll it very well , but we do n't care . We do n't plan on moving it very much . If you plan on moving it around a lot , you may want to try another type of rolling cart .	1
I bought this to hold my towels and disinfectant in my workout room . It does exactly what I need it to do , and does n't take up a lot of room . Assemly was simple , and took only about 5 minutes .	1
Easy Assembly ! ! Perfect Size ! ! Exactly as the add advertised.Fast shiping , easy payment , exactly what I needed for my apartment .	1
When you buy this , know that you are NOT getting something of incredible sturdiness and impeccable quality . But it 's dirt cheap so you should have probably figured that out already . So here 's why I LOVE it:1 ) it 's extremely lightweight and portable- let me qualify this - it 's not because of the wheels because those things do n't work for crap . I 'd be better off balancing the cart on the backs of my my sons ' hamsters and letting THEM shuffle the thing around the house . Mostly the wheels are only useful because they keep the bottom wire rack from resting directly on my hardwood floors . No , this is portable because the two siderails have a little loop at the top of each ( check the photo ) that extends above the top basket and you can pick it up with these & # 34 ; handles & # 34 ; and carry it around very easily . Personally , I prefer this to trying to scoot it around on casters anyhow . It will NOT come apart when you lift it from these handles - which is awesome - because it is not built like one of those obnoxious plastic shelving units from Walmart where the shelves are part of the structure and pulling anything from the top takes the top OFF . The side rails are one solid piece and the baskets fit nicely between them , locking them together HORIZONTALLY , not VERTICALLY.2 ) it 's a great size for storing my cosmetics - it 's the PERFECT size for storing my cosmetics- I use this to organize my cosmetics . I do n't want to store them in the bathroom because of moisture issues and instead load them up onto this very petite and portable cart in cute little organizing boxes ( hint : most of them have at least a piece of visible Amazon.com swoosh on the side - yes , I cut up old Amazon boxes for this purpose ) and leave them in my walk-in closet until I 'm ready to use them each morning . Then I pick up the whole lot using the top & # 34 ; handles & # 34 ; and carry it into my bathroom where it serves as a fantastic makeup cart.3 ) it 's cheap . very cheap.- For the purpose of getting my cosmetics out of a hard-to-find-anything-anymore drawer in the moist bathroom and into a more organized and safer location , I could n't beat this with anything I could find specifically designed for that purpose . It 's a great item for the price and I could n't recommend it more for a little portable organizer.So if you need something small and are n't afraid to do a little bit of light lifting this is a perfect small shelving unit organizer .	1
This is a very sturdy cart that really holds a lot . I have two in my laundry room & they have really organized things nicely . I did not install the casters so I do not know if they functioned properly .	1
This was quick to put together , less than five minutes and fit just where I needed them too . I bought about 3 of these . They are not suitable for really heavy items but at this price why would you think they were ...	1
I just needed a small cart that I can put the doggy coats and supplies in . I am able to tuck it under the counter and roll it out so it is out of the way . The items I have in it do not weigh much so the wheels work just fine .	1
like it ! ! it 's very easy to use and to put it up , very handy to distribute the wet clothes ! and the price is very nice	1
Exactly what I was searching for . Loads of drying space , compact & easy to store , NOT PLASTIC , sturdy and attractive . My last one of this type ( different brand ) finally died after 15 years of weekly punishment . So glad to have found this on Amazon . Packaging was very sturdy , shipped & delivered very fast . Could n't be happier !	1
The Vulcano Hanger is the same quality as they also come in Germany . They do n't feel and look stable , but we had them for years.Our oldest one must be around 10 years of age now : ) They fold quickly and can be hidden behind/ under furniture .	1
THIS IS A MUST HAVE ! ! ! ! I brought one similar to this from Walmart and I grew to hate it because it was tall . I had to do a lot of maneuvering to get the clothes on , and it took so long to dry . And some would n't dry . This one is so easy to get the clothes on , and they all dries so fast .	1
Some of my clothes can be washed on delicate in the front-loader washer , and then dried flat . Other clothes are machine washable but really , air drying is a must . This unit folds up flat , but has a FLAT TOP which lets you lay out sweaters or other flat items and dry them , or you can hang multiple items from the rungs . I place this out on my deck or in the laundry room . Our neighborhood does n't allow outside lines ( and I have one of those nice European umbrella dryers that folds up and you can bring it in like a market umbrella but no dice , NOT allowed . ) So this is a good alternative.If you have clothes that ca n't be machine dried ( wool socks , sweaters , knit pants ) this is a really handy dryer . It 's very lightweight and easy to store . I save money on clothes that can be washed carefully instead of dry cleaned by using this rack .	1
Hi ! Bought this one to my wife because the other one fell apart . This one looks good and as we tested it 's sturdy . With full wet clothes on it , it stays balanced . Good product ! Recommend !	1
LOVE this drying rack . Works well , compact , holds WAY more clothes than the wooden rack I had previous . Light weight , folds up nicely . My husband sure looks good standing by it hanging clothes on it . : )	1
Wanted a second one , the first I brought with me from Germany , this one is almost an exact duplicate of my other one..that I 've been using for almost 20 years..I do n't own or use a dryer..so this gives me even more drying 'real-estate '	1
Due to our living situation , we have to think small and this is a perfect solution to dry your clothes . The thin metal bars initially left me concerned about holding towels or heavy wet pants but after a couple uses its working quite well.The extenders fold out and you can hang some smaller items there : shirts , undergarments , socks ... whatever I would n't put anything too heavy on the fold outs ... IF your washing a small amount of things they would all fit on the main portion and you can keep the arms folded down which is very nice.The thin wires ... still concern me and you will see others have had them break . after a dozen and more uses , one of the wires has stretched permanently . We now hang lighter clothes on this wire . I suppose you could torch them back together with a stronger joint solder . If your purchasing this product to save space , you probably do n't have that type of equipment , haha.After the laundry is done , you may fold this up and store against a wall or in between a very thin space . The brackets are in the legs and fold over quite easily.I would buy a second one without question if it became required or necessaryCheers	1
Works well , nice and sturdy , assembly is super fast and easy . wife loves it to dry winter coats and snow pants after a day of sledding	1
This thing is huge . It works . It 's not very complicated , it works by creating a space for you to hang wet things on it , and then the air dries those things . You do n't have to move it around a lot , or ride on it , or really do anything with it except for fold it up when clothes are n't on it . You do n't really even have to do that , if you do n't want to . It does the job it was meant to do ; it stands there and lets the air do the rest .	1
DOES N'T LIKE TO MUCH THE DRYER SO PUTTING OUTSIDE WITH THIS RACK IS SO STRONG AND EASY TO USE AND STORE	1
We have had this item for a few weeks now , and I have to say its better than our old wooden clothes drying rack . The ends open up if you need more space and the center gives you room to dry clothes evenly . I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking to buy it .	1
Purchased this due to the contemporary design and BPA-free . Yes , there is a silicone ring at the bottom that is exposed to the water.We really enjoyed this kettle until a few months ago when the first spot of rust appeared at the bottom.Now the rust is more prevalent and we must replace.We made it a point to leave the lid up/open after each use to air out and keep moisture from being trapped inside the kettle when not in use.For a minimally priced product most certainly made in China , is 18 months use a good value ? I would have to say yes , although we all know our grandmother 's stovetop kettles lasted for decades.This kettle boils water fast . It shuts off automatically after boiling for several minutes . It looks good , except for the rust .	1
I 've purchased many electric water kettles for work , home and friends . This is my favorite one ! It has an automatic shut off , the water comes to a rolling , circular boil with a blue light shining on it which makes it interesting to look at ! It 's very light weight , has a good handle , easy flip turn on switch , push button on the top that opens the lid . Sometimes I push it more than once , but that 's o.k . I 've been using it for over a year and it 's still working perfectly . The price is good , it 's all good !	1
This is a really cool water kettle . At night watching the water boil with its blue light is better than a lava lamp . The one thing I had n't thought about , water kettles are heavy . My previous pot which still works is a Zojirushi , and when I lift it , I use my left hand to steady the pot . You ca n't hold this one with two hands because the glass is very hot . In spite of this , it 's worth learning to just use the handle . Now I see why Japanese brands have mostly gone to standing pots that have a dispenser . They are safer I think . Still our family likes this one for aesthetic reasons .	1
This is different then my last hot pot and better built then many of the others . It 's clear and easy to see into the pot . The top opens with big visable button on top . The blue light is easy to see when the big toggle switch on the bottom is turned on . There is a filter at the spout to keep impurities out . I like the bright blue color and heavy plug .	1
I limit the amount of plastic in my life , and like to see the water boil , so this is a beautiful issue to my countertop . It may have limited functionality , but it works fine for me . The spout is very nice , the lid does not stick like others I have had , and it 's a very attractive design . What more could you want ? It also seems well made and I hope it lasts awhile . Best electric kettle I 've ever owned or used .	1
When my wife first ordered this I was extremely skeptical . I mean what do we need an electric kettle for ? We have one that sits on top of our stove . After the 2nd use I was convinced . It heats up the water super fast . I can see how much water is left . Easy to assemble , refill , pour , etc . Boils in 1-2 minutes and has an auto shut off . The shut off was critical as my wife has a bad tendency to leave the stove on as she is not really a morning person.One thing to note , on first use it may emit an extremely strong sulfur/rotten egg smell . I assume it has something to do with the packaging but it only happened once and went away and did not affect the water.Overall it is a great item and will probably save money in the long run by boiling water faster . Plus it looks great and is about as well designed as an electronic item can be .	1
My friend from Europe who 's using the same model recommended this kettle to me , since mine had to be replaced . Even though she said that for the course of few years she had to replace it ( with the same model ) because it broke ( she blames her husband for breaking it though ) , she also said she could n't be happier with everything about it and the blue light too ! I was considering other models ( with different settings for different beverages , but then decided that I would rather buy something simple , since I wo n't probably use different settings anyway . I just want my water to be boiled . And this kettle does its job wonderfully - fast . It has a great capacity , I love that I can take it off the base , it is very convenient and looks awesome , and , yes , I love the blue light . I am happy to have found it . : )	1
The kettle is great , the button that opens the lid is n't as reposnsive as I 'd like it to be . I have to press it a few times to get it to open . Other than that , it 's sweet .	1
Heats the water quickly . I love being able to easily how much water is in the reservoir and the blue light makes it look cool at night .	1
It 's pretty hard to find an actual stainless steel cookwell AND stainless steel lid . Not to mention stainless steel body and interior as well . This is the best roaster oven I could find anywhere . Especially nice to find it here at a good sale price on Amazon Prime.Our first roaster oven ( a different brand name ) had a porcelain-over-steel cookwell , and a painted aluminum lid . It was pretty ... but the very first time we used it , the paint started coming off the inside of the lid , exposing the aluminum , and creating loose paint bits inside the lid . Imagine food cooking , steaming inside the roaster , dripping down paint and aluminum particles onto the food ... ... yuck ! The exterior of that unit was also painted aluminum , and I am sure it would have acquired scratches in the paint , and would have not looked so good after that . It would not have stood up under any scrubbing.This Nesco Stainless Steel model is WAY better for us than the aluminum one we started out with . More than twice as good , so it 's worth twice the price of the aluminum one.Factors I noticed : *The SS Nesco is heavier weight than aluminum models ... seems more durable ! *I prefer the side heat of this model over one with bottom heat ... for better baking results . *The SS cookwell is likely to last MUCH longer than an enamel cookwell , because it wo n't chip and rust with use . *I think cooking with stainless steel is healthier than cooking with aluminum ... including the stainless steel lid ... wo n't leach either paint particles or aluminum particles into our food ! *The SS exterior will look nicer longer than one where the paint easily scratches off , and this one will shine up nicely ! *Some roaster ovens lack an `` on '' light ... this one has it ! *The chrome-plated rack is nicer , heavier-weight , more durable , than the one that came with our first roaster . *The carry handles and the lid handle do n't get quite as hot as the ones on our first ( different name brand ) roaster oven.Just like with my stainless steel cookware , I use a bit of Bar Keepers ' Friend for cleaning/polishing , and a steel wool scrubby pad , as needed . Makes clean-up pretty quick and simple . We roasted a chicken with this tonight ... wonderful results and clean-up was no problem.I put hot pads on the lid handle when this is baking , as a signal to help warn the family that the unit is HOT ... do n't touch ! There are better grades of stainless steel used in my pots and pans , better than what 's used in this product ( the lid feels a little thin ) , but it will hold up well for roaster oven purposes ! Our SS Nesco needed a longer `` burn off '' time than just 1 hour ... it was at least several hours before all of the chemical smell was gone . If you have a family member with allergies or breathing difficulty , or if you have pet birds , you will want to make sure all of that chemical burn-off gets done outdoors where it wo n't bother anybody in the house . `` Burn off '' time was the only negative , and once you get that done , it stays done ... no ongoing nuisance.The other day we had pizzas baking in the big oven , and baked some casseroles in the roaster oven ... so nice to be able to do that ! Practicing up for Christmas baking/roasting , and hoping this roaster will have a good long usefulness lifespan ! I hope Nesco will keep up the good work ! Edited to add : As of today , the listing is still incorrect : the summary description at the top of the page still says it has a porcelain coated surface ... that part is wrong . There are NO porcelain coated surfaces on this roaster . Prior to purchase , I called the manufacturer to confirm that lid , cookwell , interior , and exterior are all stainless steel.Also , mine seems to be made properly , no inadequately crimped corners to let heat escape , as someone else had experienced , and no weak sides moving when you carry it . Mine seems to be put together just right . My only wish would be that they 'd use a heavier quality of stainless steel , and just increase the price to accomodate . They could call it , `` Premium quality Stainless '' vs Regular quality ... yes ?	1
I love this roaster ! It is gigantic and works so well . The first thing I made was a huge batch of about 60 average sized cabbage rolls . They cooked perfectly ! Not one burned and they were all cooked the evenly whether they were at the top or bottom of the roaster pan . I 'm very exited about using this to roast our turkey at Thanksgiving . I will be purchasing the food warmer accessory for future use at our large family gatherings for side dishes .	1
Love it ! Love it ! We used it for this thanksgiving to make the turkey . Turkey came out juicy and well cooked . I love it because I had the oven to do all the side dishes and also had a great turkey . Before our first uses we did smoke out the oven for 1 hr as per the instructions . Heating was even and we had no issues using it . I also did some Chicken Tandoori Drumsticks today and it turned out great .	1
Simply a great machine . We 've had ours for about 2 months ; gets used every day . I bought a selection of coffee capsules directly from Nespresso to augment the selection that came with my machine . I bought the espresso maker/milk frother combination from Amazon - the C91 unit is the same . I found a set of 3 & # 34 ; tall coffee cups ( Sierra Trading Post ) and saucers to fit this unit . The coffee comes out too hot to use cups without handles . The C91 is totally manual ; the user can adjust coffee strength easily . Nespresso coffee quality seems excellent but make no mistake , you must use Nespresso capsules in this unit .	1
i paid less than $ 100 for this machine . it paid for it itself in less than a month . hard to beat in this price range .	1
I have owned several different coffee makers in the past and , when the last one became unreliable , thought I 'd give this one a try . ( If Alton Brown recommends Nespresso , it should be a quality coffee . ) It is , the capsules are easy to use , my re-orders are always prompt in arriving , and this little machine sits on my counter top very neatly . For the customer who complained that it will only hold an espresso cup size , that is what it is designed to do ! If you want a bigger cup/mug , get a bigger machine ! Being manual rather than automatic is no problem as it 's so quick that I do n't mind waiting ! For a small , neat , espresso coffee machine it perfectly suits my needs and I would recommend it to anyone who likes espresso coffee .	1
I bought myself one of these to save money on espresso shots - I was n't expecting much , so was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee it turns out . The machine itself is easy to use , quick to heat up , and feels pleasingly heavy and sturdy in its working parts . While its output does n't compare in quality to what you get from one of those massive , Buick-sized restaurant machines with their high pressure systems , it 's very , very good indeed and will save you a trip to Starbucks . Pros ; easy to use , quick to heat up , well made , and while it 's not esthetically as pleasing as its more expensive brothers and sisters , pretty much disappears on the cabinet . Downside is that it uses rather expensive pods , which you have to order either from Nespresso via the internet , or one of its copy-cat competitors like HighLine . There are refillable pods but I have n't yet tried them . I shall .	1
I bought a Nespresso for my boyfriend last year , and he LOVES it . He uses it at least twice a day . We ordered a second one to use at our condo in Florida because he could n't live without one !	1
I love to have coffee with a strong flavor and in shots as they do in Spain , Italy and other European countries . This machine just gives me what I was looking for . Although , if I have guests they can drink coffee with milk , etc . But I would recommend this for people who like small shots of coffee . It 's easy to clean and to use , it only takes a couple of minutes to have good quality coffee done . The price its also a bit cheaper than in the shop , otherwise everyone would go to the shop that it 's a great experience !	1
I love Nespresso , and will preach to anyone that likes coffee at all that this is the way to go . I 'm giving this machine 4 stars because it is Nepresso and will beat the pants off of any other espresso machines available . But if you 're already sold on the Nespresso premise , this is my least favorite of their machines.First , the amount of space between the spout and base is pretty small . If you are drinking espresso out of espresso cups no problem , but if you prefer lungo or have a regular size coffee cup it will not fit into the space allowed.Second , this machine takes like 3 minutes to warm up . I know 3 minutes is n't forever , but when I want my coffee in the morning I want it NOW.I have Nespresso machines at my office and home and I have convinced friends and family to buy as well so I 've had the fun of playing with lots of different models and this is definitely my least favorite . I think it is also the cheapest , which is why I bought it for my office but I wish I had spent $ 50 more to get one that is more compatible with coffee cups . ; )	1
I 've had another espresso maker that require grinding and tamping ( messy and a bit time consuming ) . Love the Nespresso pods and the variety . My only complaint is I wish Nespresso still had the machine with the auto turn-off so you could walk away from the machine without worrying about overflow . The only auto turn-off on here is 30 minutes of inactivity .	1
I have had my little Essenza for several years . It is truly the most dependable appliance in my kitchen . It takes seconds to heat the water ; the pods puncture every time ; the espresso or lungo cup fills in less than a minute . Perfect crema every time . The machine is the ultimate in low-maintenance . I have never descaled it . All I do is throw away the empty pods and rinse out the tray . With Nespresso 's Aeroccino to make froth for lattes , and syrups from Amazon ; my kitchen in a mini Starbucks . I love lattes ! Sometimes I put a square of Nespresso dark chocolate in the cup , or dip biscotti . So good and indulgent . Be good to yourself and make your own little relaxing ritual for enjoying a great espresso or latte . I know I deserve it . So do you .	1
This is so remedial . Buy a Wilton magazine for less money and get more ideas and instructions for your investment .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in this device . It 's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides . The only thing it has going for it is portability . It can only hold regular sized hard covered books . Forget about any size paperback , it will not work . Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions . Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again . I tried with over 10 textbooks and it did n't do well with any of them . For home reading I 'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand . The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it .	-1
I 'm very disappointed with this purchase . The quality of the product is low , the paint is uneven and the bottom of the cup is cheeped .	-1
The small spoon is too small . The bigger spoon is too big . Neither of them are true & # 34 ; teaspoon & # 34 ; size spoons . The flatware is very thin so the knife really has no cutting power ( even for a butter knife ) behind it . HOWEVER , for the price I paid , I ca n't expect anything else . They are pretty stylish at a glance but if you 're looking to do anything that requires a durable utensil , this is n't the one you want .	-1
This is okay for chopping cilantro , but does not puree very well . I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name . Much prefer my old Sunbeam Oskar .	-1
My original mini prep had a sharp blade , not a serrated blade . I got years of use out of it , and I would n't have replaced it but my husband mistakenly through the lid out in the trash . This one is only so so , and food gets caught in the teeth of the serrated blade	-1
This processor does not work . This was a replacement for a Krupps processor and I only used it 3 times . I had to buy a Phillips to replace it .	-1
received in good conditon , had to return the first one , did not chop , got the second one , it was for my daughter she said it did not work well	-1
Not for me . It 's so small ( of course ) and it 's really only good for nuts . It pulverizes other products . I returned it with no problem .	-1
i bought this mainly to chop onions and such to save time of chopping by hand , but no matter what i do i end up with mush and chunks of onion . i dont know what im doing wrong , if anyone has any suggestions - feel free to help me out	-1
I purchased this in advance for what I knew was going to be a lot of food prep Labor Day Weekend.I was so certain of the Cuisinart brand name that I threw out the boxes and other packaging and the damned thing did n't work . Well , it worked for 10 seconds and then died . It was probably the single biggest waste of $ 30 I have ever made and the entire thing ended up in the trash and I spent 4 hours chopping vegetables by hand .	-1
Then go with the Ninja Master Prep . I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush . When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant , so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush . On the New Ninja Master Prep . It has only pulse one speed , but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades , two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done . I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly . Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit .	-1
Just cut your vegtables and do n't waste your money on this because if you want to use it ; you still have to cut your vegtables in small peices anyways . This thing will likely liquify them too ... .not a great product .	-1
For this money I did n't expect the glue under the button names to peel up within a week . and I certainly did n't expect the base to cause messy leaks despite repeatedly replacing the gaskets . And now , after less than two years the motor has burned out ! Shame on you Cuisinart !	-1
I love the blender portion . It works great at crushing ice and other items . The food processor is another story . Works to chop up and blend items , but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it . With each use , the noise is louder and so irritating . I am extremely disappointed that I ca n't use the processor portion of it . As much as I love the blender , I ca n't recommend the purchase because you wo n't be able to use the processor without ear plugs .	-1
Read other reviews . The drive on this unit fails . I probably used this blender only around 10 times over the past year , and now its broken.Do not buy .	-1
This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies ( our main use for a blender ) . When the cutter assembly broke ( after ~20 uses ) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement . Since the blender was purchased as a gift ( from our wedding registry ) , we did not have `` proof of purchase '' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com ( ~ $ 21 with shipping ) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well . This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer `` service '' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore ( i.e . the replacement part had no warranty ) .If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart ( i.e . Conair ) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service .	-1
Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker . With a only 6 months of service , the grind mechanism bound and could n't be removed . Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee ( I did have to pay shipping charges ! ) Less than a year later a repeat performance . Again , I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine . Well you know what happened ! The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita 's !	-1
We have had this model for over a year and , while it does make good coffee , it is SUCH a pain to clean . You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made . Also , the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water . If I had it to do over again I 'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine . My mother has the Capresso and it 's much better !	-1
This coffee maker makes good coffee , but all the little parts , which do n't fit together quite right will make you crazy . This is a pain to clean . The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove . After a few months , I could n't get it out , even with a pliers . Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off , when trying to remove the basket . I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part ... no response . Now that the machine has n't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee does n't taste that good . In the trash it goes . The machine also `` beeps '' at you a lot ... .like I need one more complaint ! Good coffee , but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement .	-1
The design is such that you do not get maximum taste from the coffee beans . Stay away from this model . A chore to clean , plus mine broke about a year after I bought it.In a way , I am glad . I got a Melitta coffeemaker to replace it and the coffee tastes much better !	-1
Worked great for the first year we had it , when we used it maybe 3-4 times.But after that , it seemed like nothing would ever really freeze up enough . I looked into the problem and decided that I might have damaged the cooling capability of the bowl by cleaning it with hot water ( which is a no-no ) .So , I bought a replacement bowl , and once again , for the first year with a few uses it seemed to be OK.But now once again , it 's just not getting cold enough - and this time I *know* it 's not my fault since I have been very careful to only wash the bowl in cold water .	-1
Works very well -- but [ at the price ] ? Come on ! This unit isvirtually identical to the Deni ice cream maker I bought at Target for [ little over half the price ] this spring -- which also works very well . Shop around , people !	-1
Once I got the hang of it ( there is a bit of a learning curve , but it 's not terribly steep ) , I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago , while it was mid way thru churning , the upper , cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical , scraping arm . Because the machine is out of warranty , I had to order the part 's replacement at my own expense . While it 's not going to break the bank , Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks ( ! ) to fill my order.I 'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model , since it 's supposed to be more efficient , but I was n't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line : Great concept , lousy parts .	-1
I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock , and was so disappointed I returned it . It made sherbet ( milk-based ) with no problem at all , but I 've really been craving sorbet , and the freezer bucket simply was n't cold enough to do the job -- it chilled my mix , but did n't even turn it to slush before it had warmed ... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours , only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up .	-1
I got this ice cream maker primarily to make sorbets and the occasional batch of ice cream . The item arrived well packed , accompanied by a very small instruction manual / recipe booklet combination.To get a feel for the machine , I first froze the freezer bowl for 24 hours at zero degrees or less . My first attempt was a Quince sorbet from `` The Sweet Life '' cookbook . I pretty much followed the recipe instructions to the letter . I poured the chilled quince mixture into the frozen bowl with the machine running . 10 minutes passed . 20 minutes . 30 minutes . 40 minutes . My `` sorbet '' was just a frozen drink . Eventually , the freezer bowl defrosted and I had a lukewarm smoothie on my hands.Thinking it was my ability to follow a recipe , I decided to try one of the recipes in the instruction manual . I tried the `` basic vanilla '' . After about 20 minutes of churning , the ice cream started to firm up . But it never got past the soupy slush stage . So I waited some more ... another 20 minutes . The ice cream was thicker but still a soupy mess . After freezing the concoction for 3 hours , it was fine , but more like frozen milk than ice cream.Next , my wife stepped in and tried one of her recipes . Chocolate ice cream . Same results for her . A soupy half-frozen mess.I have lost faith in this machine . I still think the best and most reliable way to make ice cream is with one of those old style churns . I just do n't think this thing gets cold enough . My parents have a different model ( anotehr brand ) and theirs freezes the ice cream within 15 minutes every time.Your mileage may vary , but I would be wary of this machine .	-1
I would not recommend buying this ice cream maker . It is made entirely out of cheap plastic and the motor sounds like a dentist drill . Even the canister is made out of plastic and now there are scratches in it from when I scooped the ice cream out with a metal spoon . I followed the directions exactly and after 1 hour it was still liquid.The next time I used it ( again having the canister in the freezer for 24 hours prior to making the recipe ) , I put the mixture in the canister and then put it in the freezer and covered it with tin foil . I hand-stirred the mixture every 10 minutes and after 1 hour , it was done.Instead of buying this product , I would recommend mixing the ingredients together and then putting it in a plain plastic container directly in the freezer . It will take 8-10 hours for it to harden . You can use the following recipe to start:10 oz plain frozen strawberries ( slightly thawed ) 1/2 cup sugar10 oz heavy whipping creamPuree the strawberries and sugar . Mix in the whipping cream with the other ingredients for about 2 minutes or until the whipping cream thickens . Pour into a plastic container and place in the freezer . You may wish to stir the mixture every 2 hours so that it hardens more quickly .	-1
I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I 'm cooking smelly foods , when people smoke in the place , etc . I had previously had the more standard dual 8 '' window fan setup , and after several months of use , they always seem to get so weak they barely move air . I decided to try this one but it 's not right for my intended use . This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets , is giant , and moves a TON of air . It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door . When it 's off , the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc . Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it , but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who 's in the market .	-1
Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on . The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and wo n't hold on . We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4 '' hex bolt . It held for a year . Now the handle has fallen off , again . Is the bolt the problem ? No , it 's the threaded receptacle ! MAYBE , if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread # 10 bolt in.If This does n't work , I 'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked , it did well . A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope , this cooker is useless . Presto you stink .	-1
About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker , purchased from Amazon . It is made in China . This item is made real cheap , it not only does not do the job , the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time . I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out . I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read . I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away . I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star . I will not recommend to buy it . I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker , that works perfectly for years of use . I just wanted a smaller size . But wasted money for this junk .	-1
I 'd used my old pressure cooker for over 20 years . The Teflon coating was chipping off , and because of safety concerns , I was happy to receive another pressure cooker as a gift . That cooker ( the Casa Essentials 5-quart model ) only lasted for a few uses . The silicone seal ring lost its ability to form a seal , and the part cost almost as much as the cooker . I decided to upgrade and bought the Presto 4-quart cooker.Within a few uses , the handle became loose , because the screws that hold it on are too small . Every time I use the cooker , I tighten the handle . Next , the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape . So as the pot heats up , I tap on the safety seal to seat it properly.Today when I tapped , the safety seal fell down into the chicken soup , which began spraying out of the hole and all over the kitchen . Not a pleasant event on a morning when I felt a bit under the weather and was looking forward to a bowl of chicken soup for lunch.I fished out the rubber seal and put the soup in a conventional pan to finish cooking . Because of the problem with the handles , I 'm not going to replace the seal . I will discard the pan and either buy a good quality pressure cooker or do without one .	-1
I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault . I did n't realize that this model did not have a quick release . I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault . I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves . I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it . That is why I stuck with the same brand . I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also did n't like how I had to screw the handles into place . I want something that has permanently attached handles . I 'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto . I ca n't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option . If anyone does , please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me .	-1
I was really looking forward to getting the Presto 6 Qt . Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker . My mother had used one , and the name `` Presto '' really meant something to me . Even though I was unfamiliar with this kind of cooker , the previous reviews left me confident that this one in particular would be a good choice.Yikes ! I opened the Amazon carton only to find a very small box for a 6-qt . cooker . Turns out , this pressure cooker will arrive at your door IN NEED OF ASSEMBLY . Well , I was still game . Pulled out my handy dandy Philips screwdriver and carefully followed directions . The long handles had one screw only -- Not much for all the weight and pressure that pressure cooker handles must endure -- But I still gave it a shot.I made Chicken Chutney ( recipe in the instruction booklet ) which was `` okay '' -- Let 's suppose that I have n't used a pressure cooker before ( too true , too true ) . So if the dish was `` meh , '' that could be my fault . But ... As I was washing the cooker , it really became clear that the handle was loose . The screw was as tight as possible ( the instructions warn against screwing it too tight lest the plastic break ) , and the handle itself was clearly loose . So . . .I am returning it to Amazon ( they have made this very easy , UPS will even pick it up from my home ) . In the meantime , I will be looking for a good quality stainless pressure cooker that is securely made , and does n't come with `` assembly required . ''	-1
Bought this on November 13 last year . Have used it 10 ( that 's ten ) times . I only hand wash it ; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it . I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes . No scratchers have been used on it . It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge . Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it , but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I do n't wish to eat rust.It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years ; maybe that is why the metal is n't very high quality.Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for ; my bad . Have ordered another brand that is pricier . I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans , so we will see how this next one works out .	-1
Strong words for a pressure cooker , I know , but this thing has been such a disappointment . I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years . I 'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what . This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap . The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly . The pressure hole does n't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds . If you are looking for a solid , reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking ! This is not the one !	-1
This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down . As others have recently stated , it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws , making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady ... no matter how many times I tighten the screws , and how tight I , or my husband , try to get them , they loosen and the handles become very wobbly . This is not just a problem with one handle , but both handles ! I tried this item for a week , which required retightening the handles about a dozen times , and I have given up.Additionally , after only two washes , the screws are already starting to rust ! I did n't wash it in the dishwasher , it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product ... it is cheaply made ! However , I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews .	-1
Sadly returning this . The handles wo n't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting . Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time ! I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago . But I did not have good results with this one . Followed directions and chicken came out tough . And - a magnet wo n't stick to the interior ( only the exterior ) ... so maybe the interior is not stainless steel , but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in . Thank goodness for Amazon 's return policy .	-1
You can only fill 2/3 of this 4 quart pressure cooker so you can not really do any canning unless using very teeny tiny jars and cooking very small portion of food . I have a 5 quart pressure cook and you can not put a whole chicken in it . You need at least a 6 to 8 quart cooker to cook a decent meal with meat and vegetables . I wo n't recommend buying this pot even if it is cheap .	-1
So we 've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a year now . It was purchased September 8 , 2009.Currently , my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt . The bag in the back was emptied so we know that 's not the problem . Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what 's wrong with it , and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time has n't been that great . It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start , and I ca n't say I was overly impressed on carpet . It 's clunky to move around , and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over .	-1
Picture of bag says 'Genuine HOOVER Filter Bags . I was sold and shipped a 3-pack of genuine imitation generic bags instead . While they were made in the USA and may be just as good , do n't bait and switch products on customers . I purposely choose theses because they were supposed to be real HOOVER bags .	-1
It 's basically a small flooring polisher . It beats doing it on your hands and knees but it 's not meant for doing a whole house of hardwoods at one time .	-1
I honestly do n't understand the rave reviews for this thing ( which prompted me to purchase it sight-unseen ) . It sucks well on bare floors , has a long cord and hose , and has a foot-thingy to change to carpet , but so do plenty others without the following:1 . Heavy . Reviewers say it 's pretty small and light but I find it hard to handle.2 . Disobeys . Ok , I 'm being funny but it does n't turn corners or doorways well . You have to pull on the hose and the minute there 's a slight turn , the hose bends all the way and blocks the air , letting out a very LOUD noise that scared the neighbor 's dogs.3 . The hose is SOOOOO flimsy ! My kid 's toy vac has a better one . Super thin inflexible plastic . A few more `` bends '' and it WILL crack . Since there 's no swivel on it either , it 'll bend and crack at the base too.4 . The cord does n't retract ( you roll / attach it to the underside ) . I have n't seen that on the tiniest of vacs in 25 years so I never thought to look for this `` feature '' .5 . The tubes are flimsy too . When you 're using all 3 extensions ( standard if you 're tall or just , you know , vac'ing ) , any pressure you might apply for a rug or what not bends the tubes.6 . The `` air hole '' in the tube wo n't stay shut . I 'm not sure what that 's even for ( suction reduction , maybe ? ) but I do know I rarely use it and it compromises regular performance . But it wo n't stay shut ! Keeps sliding open from the slightest of touches.7 . Everything 's a bit `` too '' long , and `` too '' heavy , etc . It feels like it 's rebelling against being a compact.So mostly , aside from the lack of a retractable cord , this vacuum HAS all the features , but they 're all POORLY executed so it 's awkward to use and will definitely break quickly . It was a bargain , but not THAT great of a bargain . CPO applied their refund policy and took it back . Very nice on the phone , too . I was bummed they did n't carry an alternative model I liked so I could still give THEM my money . I would have .	-1
I suppose you get what you pay for , but this vacuum is just too lightweight , even for a two-bedroom apartment . We returned it immediately .	-1
It has high sound and received with one part of the pipe extension badly cracked . When we first open and connect the pipe to the hose extension it just open widely . It is not durable . I will never recommend this to any one .	-1
UPDATE at 3/8/13 : I 'm still disappointed with the function of the accessories , but the suction is really good . So I 've decided to make do until the bags I purchased are used up . I still had the floor tools from my deceased Dirt Devil canister , and they work okay with this vacuum . I only use the Eureka floor tool in the storage room and garage where my cats spend the night . It works okay on the vinyl/concrete/utility rugs , and on the carpeted cat scratcher.ORIGINAL REVIEW : Did my research and had such high hopes , but this vacuum is a big disappointment . The unit and accessories appear as described , and it sounds strong and has good suction from the open pipe.Except , not . My house has bare floors and large ( 9x12 ) wool or cotton rugs , and 3 cats . After going over the kitchen , I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me . Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug , and afterwards it looked like only I 'd crawled around picking lint by hand . Other gripes : the flexible hose kinks flat/closed ( does n't self correct ) , the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions ( and must be cleared WITH FINGERS , the debris does n't suck off by the pipe alone ) .I do n't have the heart to go in to more detail . I 'm not sure how I 'll get my floors clean with this device . This blew the budget I had to replace a 15 year old , $ 40 , Dirt Devil little red canister ( that finally burned out ) . Harrumph .	-1
Pros : Several useful attachments includedCons : Very Noisy , runs hot , average performanceI bought this to clean the cars . It works for that purpose . However , I would n't recommend it for use inside the house due to the noise . I would also be concerned with using it for extended periods of time due to the heat it generates.For the price it is okay .	-1
This was so cheaply made it should have been embarrassing to manufacture it and put it on the market . All it was ood for was making noise ! This one went back immediately .	-1
Cleaned bare floor ... roller jammed on rug fibers/human hair ... roller Not removable ... ca n't clean it up ... ca n't re-use it ... wish it had worked ... nice idea , but not practical for normal use .	-1
This worked pretty great for the first few months.. After changing the filter and using it continuously throughout the past 6 months the performance has gone way down . Its a really big disappointment for the price.. I think I paid nearly 60 at the time . I would recommend getting a bag less wireless vacuum if you are considering . Getting replacement filters for this annoying and the fact that it does n't perform that well after a few uses I would just look elsewhere .	-1
Cant believe the rave reviews . I must have got a lemon . This thing has no suction at all and both of the batteries wont hold a charge after only 2 months .	-1
Works for bare flooring . I was hoping to use it for quick pet hair pick up but it is really weak for that . Basically it is a dust-buster with a handle and flimsy brush attached . Takes a LONG TIME to charge . Not worth it .	-1
I bought it to replace my dead swifter . I guess I was spoiled with the swifter , it actually cleaned my hard wood floors . The Eureka just pushes it around .	-1
I have n't had any problems after several years with this timer however a problem with my exhaust fan it 's controlling has caused concern . You can not manually turn this switch off . My fan was buzzing and not turning this morning when I set the timer to 10min . Afraid it was about to burn up , I tried to shut it off with the timer but could not . Fortunately the fan slowly started turning and did not burn up but I will be replacing the timer asap .	-1
I purchased a Hoover Wind Tunnel model UH70120 and bought these belts only because of Amazon 's & # 34 ; Frequently bought together & # 34 ; suggestion . THESE BELTS DO NOT FIT THIS MODEL ! ! ! Even after bringing this to Amazon 's attention , this 'suggestion ' still remains . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I would never buy a Hoover vacuum cleaner again . Their customer service is the worst I 've ever seen , there is no service near by and they expect you to pay postage if sending the big non working plastic junk to them or drive 65 miles to their service center.Never again Hoover.Do Not Recommend .	-1
We purchased two of these . They are loud , not `` whisper quiet , '' and work well to block noise , as we live on a busy street . Both started to die around the same time , about a year after we bought them . They began making loud rattling noises to the point where we could no longer use them . Buy another brand !	-1
Pros : Moves a good amount of air , even at speed 1 setting ( lowest speed ) .Cons : Speed 1 . It 's way too loud for me . I set the fan about 8 ft away from my TV , near a sliding patio door . The TV volume had to be turned up quite a bit .	-1
Feb 2012 : My review below was before they swapped the original motor for junk while pretending the unit 's unchanged . It only looks the same but on opening my newest for 1st periodic cleaning bits flew out that proved to be cheap plastic tie-downs that could n't stand the heat and the motor windings seemed similarly downgraded . Check the web for fire hazzard recalls.Jan 2010 : To my original review which follows , I 'm just adding this note that Lasko says this model only draws [ when new ] 83 watts @ High , 69 @ Medium & 56 @ Low Speed . The 170 watts reported elsewhere is in error.I also note neglecting to mention my need to avoid blocking daylight as much as possable , thus clear plastic for the 'shroud ' mentioned below.With no range hood in my city apartment , I 've run these [ at Mid Speed ] virtually 24/7 in my kitchen window for decades , sucking fresh air thru the rest of the apartment while expelling stove heat & air-borne greece , etc.I 'm comfortable with this because it 's relativly easy to take the motor apart for a simple cleaning about once every 9 months [ or so ] . I 've also added 2 4 '' circular layers of the old , cheap , black , 'washable ' air-conditioner filter material between the back of the motor and the interior protective grill to lessen the amoung of gunk sucked into the motor.What with the cooking , this filter and , for esthetics , the inside grill are also removed & cleaned in the bath tub 3 or 4 times a year . The grills are a pain as soaps are only partly effective & brushes do n't quite serve for the tiny grill opening.With all this beating , the fans have all lasted an astonishing 5yrs++ ! BTW : To deaden vibration noise , etc . I hang the fan from 2 springs at the top of the window . I noted that with the fan running I could feel air being sucked in from outside around the sides of the fan so I 've made a clear plastic shroud to block these areas for greater efficiency . I 've also taped bits of this plastic on the 4 corners of the inside grill wher some more air circled in & out .	-1
This review is for : Lasko 3733 20 '' Box FanHow on earth do you choose a box fan ? Well really they mostly choose us do n't they , we choose the first box we see . The product descriptions are n't much help , they mostly all say they are quiet , powerful , low cost to operate , etc . Are they really all that different from each other ? When looking for a replacement fan I found 2 of our fans were recalled in 2005 for fire hazard , so now I am replacing 3 fans . I guess in-plug mini-fuses became universal for a reason . Let 's get started ... The 20 '' box fans we 'll compare are : A - Aerospeed BX100B - Holmes HBF2002AC - Kenmore 32002D - Lasko 3720E - Lasko 3721F - Lasko 3723G - Lasko 3733H - Lasko B20201DESIGN AND DETAILS : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -All have white fans and grills , gray enclosures , 245-260 square inch areas the blades pass through , and 70 '' -73 '' cords.A - Aerospeed BX100- Wavy grill ( BX200/BX400 have other grills ) .- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Little smaller enclosure ( you would n't notice unless side-by-side ) , though the blades pass through an area near to the highest square inches of the bunch.- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.B - Holmes HBF2002A ( Target ) - Simple grid grill , blades have circle connecting them.- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK . This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.- Looks exactly like the Kenmore 32002.- NEGATIVE : At top speed it vibrates like crazy , enough to move itself.C - Kenmore 32002 ( Sears/Kmart ) - Simple grid grill , blades have circle connecting them.- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK . This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.- Looks exactly like Holmes HBF2002A.D - Lasko 3720- Circular grill , blue logo on the front , blue speed dial.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT ( not weatherproof ) .- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- This is a wider ( 4 3/4 '' ) and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.- Should be mostly the same as 3721 , except this has the blue logo.E - Lasko 3721- Circular grill , blue speed dial.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT ( not weatherproof ) .- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- This is a wider ( 4 3/4 '' ) and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.- Should be mostly the same as 3720 , except no blue logo.F - Lasko 3723- Circular grill , blue speed dial.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Although it physically LOOKS LIKE one , this is NOT one of the rain resistant ones like the 3270/3721 ( larger size , blue dial , etc . ) .- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- This is a wider ( 4 3/4 '' ) and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.- LOOKS just like the 3721 , larger enclosure and no blue logo . But again not a rain resistant model.- NEGATIVE : Rattles a little at all speedsG - Lasko 3733- Simple grid grill.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- NEGATIVE : Shakes a lot at settings 2 & 3.- NEGATIVE : Listeners thought the hum tone was more annoying than the others.H - Lasko B20201- Simple grid grill.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- NEGATIVE : LOUD at highest setting , listeners thought annoyingly so.- NEGATIVE : Little more of an airplane hum/whine sound . `` ( yelling over a fan ) THEY SAY THEY ARE ALL QUIET ! `` aka NOISE : -- -- -- -- -- -First some things that may help you get more out of this section on noise..- It takes +10dBA to be perceived as a doubling in LOUDNESS.- It takes just under +6dBA ( 5.85dBA ) to be perceived as 50 % ( half-again ) LOUDER.- It takes just over +3dBA ( 3.22dBA ) to be perceived as 25 % ( quarter-again ) LOUDER . ( Note : When you read that +3dBA roughly doubles `` sound pressure '' that 's different than perceived loudness ) Most sounds 50dbA on up have more of a potential to annoy , for example when while trying to talk , and especially starting at 55dbA ( highly subjective , but gives you an idea ) .Okay , now onto the comparison..SUBJECTIVELY listeners liked the WHOOSH of air sound much more than that of the HUM of a rotating object .

If a little additional on-going expense for a fan makes this much less costly alternative to air conditioning more palatable , then that 's probably a good investment.However , being green is an important factor for some folks , so here below is a comparison in electricity usage I measured .

The fan surface measurement was done roughly 1/2 way up the fan blades right against the grill.On fan surface air velocity half-way up a blade at one point is , of course , just a sample point , and air velocity at a distance can be greatly affected by the degree of focus/dispersal . Nevertheless , I hope this air velocity info helps us get a better sense for the differences between the fans .

That is , when comparing points where air velocities are roughly equal for the fans ( at the same distances ) , the loudness difference is so small I can hardly tell which is louder and the numbers support that.So there it is , my favorite three and some ways to compare them.SUMMARY : -- -- -- -- -- In the end these are just classic 20 '' box fans which are more similar than they are different . Hopefully whichever you choose wo n't be a lemon and will work for many years . Perhaps somewhere above you 'll find information you can use to choose the best fan to meet your needs.Whatever you get , if it rattles , shakes like crazy , makes an annoying hum , etc. , try exchanging it for another , do n't settle , there are less annoying fans out there and you 'll be listening to them for many years to come.I hope this helps someone : ) .SHOPPING NOTE : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Millions of 20 '' box fans are sold in the U.S. every year . Review sites can not get anywhere near a statistically valid user sample , so although we learn from comments about DEFECTS and EARLY FAILURE , I suggest not filtering out a model based entirely on them.There are also old reviews that have already been acted on by manufacturers to improve the product or fix a description , thus the review may no longer be accurate.That said , defect and early failure comments with details are great for FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURER ( or author ) and to help us all much more quickly SPOT SIMILAR ISSUES and thus get an exchange while it is quick and easy to do . Again though , I would n't use them to filter out a model entirely .	-1
I was considering buying the once reputable White Mountain Electric Ice Cream Freezer until I noticed all the dissatisfied buyers who purchased from 2009 to present ! From 2009 to present not a single review is positive as all have stated that the machines broke down . They are now MADE IN CHINA and JUNK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull . It is now practically impossible to peel an apple with it , although on straight peels , like carrots , it still works like any other mediocre peeler . Also , the `` swivel '' never really worked well . It was always difficult to peel a curved surface like an apple with this thing .	-1
I saw this product on a cooking show being used to core pineapple slices and thought it would be easier than coring the pineapple with a knife . It turns out I was wrong . Save your money and use a knife . To be fair , I have not tried this device on apples . I will give it a go and post another review .	-1
I 've gone through two of these and wo n't purchase another . The first one broke after using it a three or four times , but since I like Oxo products in general , I assumed it just a fluke . The second one I simply threw away . As other reviewers have pointed out , it uses tiny , metal teeth to grip the lid , which slip and could conceivably cause injury . It was worthless , so I 'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a spoon . Works better than Oxo , that 's for sure .	-1
Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen . The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid , but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched . Well , this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way . Like other reviewers noted , it does n't secure well enough to the lid , slips off the lid , and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar . I 'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward , uncomfortable , dangerous product .	-1
Bought two of these , one for my mother and one to keep . What a total waste of money . Even my husband could not use this device easily . We finally just trashed them both as no use allowing junk to take room in our kitchens .	-1
I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed . It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use . My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble . The opening is way too big to accomplish that so , back it went to the supermarket . I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it does n't , I am rating this only one star .	-1
I have arthritis in my hands & wrists . My daughter-in-law knows how difficult some kitchen tasks have become for me . OXO has a good reputation for ergonomic products . I think this one needs to go back to the drawing board . I could not open a single jar with this .	-1
I have always trusted OXO products , but this time I was woefully mislead . The internal ejector blade broke with the very first scoop of ice cream . Bad , Bad product . Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends . Although it worked well as a muffin disher , it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve ( I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that ) . Waste of money . Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only , of any degree of hardness , try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop .	-1
I bought this because it was the only scoop BB & B ; had in stock at the time . I needed a # 20 cookie scoop as recommended by Alton Brown . Turns out this is significantly larger than # 20 . As such , the scoops were so big the cookies did n't cook evenly - undercooked in the middle , overcooked along the edges.Not only that , the little metal scraper broke off on the second or third use . Fortunately , I was able to reattach it , but a cookie or two later , it broke off again . It did this same thing for ice cream , too . What were the designers thinking ? ! I replaced it with Oxo 's Good Grips Cookie Scoop ( large size ) from Amazon and could n't be happier . It 's sturdy and scoops the perfect amount of cookie dough so the cookies are cooked evenly throughout and consistently sized.I ended up tossing this Oxo Good Grips ice cream scoop in the trash . If you need an ice cream or cookie scoop , get something else . This thing will just frustrate you and fall apart .	-1
Much like most of the other reviewers ' experiences , the trigger mechanism in my OXO ice cream scoop broke almost immediately , as well . And then , to add insult to injury , when I kept using it despite the fact that it did n't work properly , the metal it was made from pitted/eroded horribly.Although I 've always been a fan of OXO 's products and ca n't recall using any other OXO kitchen gadgets I 've bought that I thoroughly disliked , this is definitely one to avoid .	-1
I could not use this scopp . The squishy parts of the grip seemed to be on the wrong sides of the handle . I could not get the right leverage with the pointed part of the scoop . It made it painful to get out the ice cream . I love Oxo tools however so tried the round ice cream scoop with the bail to pop out the ice cream . It works great .	-1
My son works at a ice cream shop , and when I recieved this ice cream scoop , he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work . Until he actually used it . It looks metal , but feels like it 's plastic . When I used it for the first time , I was scooping out very hard ice cream , and it felt like it was going to break . I had to turn it in circles to get anything . I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one . At least I know it wo n't break in my hand .	-1
This is the worst ice cream scoop ever . The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter . It 's a total scam ; they made it look thicker , by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide . You ca n't tell by looking at it , because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle . I found out when the handle broke off in my hand , while trying to scoop some hard ice cream . Oxo , you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk , which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer . I 'll likely never buy an Oxo product again .	-1
I LOVE OXO products . I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market . I started using OXO knives when I found a 6 & quot ; utility knife . That is a great knife . OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money . I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy , it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife . I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife .	-1
What exactly does stainless mean ? How about dishwasher safe ? I think that means you can put it in the dishwasher and it wo n't come out with rust spots , but that 's what it does every time . Nice concept , cheap execution .	-1
The spreader is much larger and wider than I wanted . I have found it useless for buttering bread sticks , which is why it was ordered.This is my fault and not that of the spreader .	-1
I love the size and utility but after you wash it - it looks disgusting and has white spots etc ... I didn ` t put it in the dishwasher it is not dishwasher safe ...	-1
I love OXO utensils and have many of them . But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher . Pound raw meat ; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water , right ? The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum . Now this one looks like old aluminum -- it 's gray and nasty looking . Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel . It 's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils .	-1
This hammer is a thing of beauty , but ( to my surprise ) you ca n't wash it in the dishwasher . That 's an instant fail for a utensil that gets regularly contaminated by raw meat . I returned it .	-1
This does the job fine , but if I had it to do over again , I would have gotten an all stainless one . Not being able to put this in the dishwasher is a huge drawback . My two favorite words are `` dishwasher safe , '' but to not be able to put something that touches raw poultry in the diswasher is insult to injury . I am pricing others and it looks like I 'll be dropping at least $ 18 .	-1
This must be the worst product I 've ever purchased that sports the OXO label . And I 've got a lot of the stuff , and have been generally satisfied with it . I needed a channel knife , wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife ( instead of pulling it long-ways towards you -- look at other channel knives , you 'll know what I mean ) . This gadget cuts the raggediest , least-attractive lemon twists ever , and it 's hard to pull through the rind as well . So I thought OK , it 's still a good zester . And ... ..No-it's-not . Get a microplane , or maybe a different zester , but this one is a turd . Finally , the handle is not `` comfortable , '' it 's too hard and too big for my ( fairly small but not outrageously so ) hand . The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy .	-1
The tool works okay enough for zesting , but is terrible at peeling for cocktails or drinks that need a twist . The scoop cutting device on my unit was dull and it did NOT cut into the skin of the lemons , limes , or oranges . So , half of the functionality of the device is lost . Therefore , the OXO Lemon Zester is not worth the expense . No matter how I held the zester or oriented the fruit , it did n't cut . I was left with having to find alternatives and the OXO zester is used only for the thin strips of skin used for recipes ( not for cocktails ) .Perhaps I got a ( USED ) dull one . The blade is not sharp to the touch . But Amazon should not be selling used devices as new , and the blade should not be so dull so fast . Or , it could just be a design flaw.Considering the OXO version is more expensive than other options , I would request my money back , but I spent so much time trying got get it to work , it is even more dull and useless than when I started .	-1
I usually love the OXO Good Grips line of kitchen tools , but this one let me down . The bowl is smaller than my old plastic ricer , and the handle is n't as long , so it 's harder to squeeze . I thought the stainless steel would work better , but my old plastic one is easier and more efficient , especially when I make a half-gallon of homemade applesouce . I 'll keep this one as a backup for smaller jobs and softer foods .	-1
I boiled potatoes to make mashed potatoes however when I used it , the potatoes just remained in the container . They did not go through the holes or sieves even when I pressed it down with the top part . I do not know if I overcooked the potatoes so they were too soft to go through the sieves when pressed but I have not used it again so far .	-1
That disappointment , today I got the apparatus and is incomplete , missing the rubber of one of the handles , if I start it back who knows how long it would last and that would cost , to send me or I replenished by another .	-1
I own this set and it was a complete waste of money . I was originally attracted to these knives because I own a number of other Oxo Good Grips products and , with the exception of the garlic press ( which has a mediocre design and rubber handles that fall off ) , I have been very pleased with the quality of their products . There are two problems with these knives:1 ) The blades are made from cheap stainless steel that will not take or keep an edge . They are dull to the point of being dangerous and notwithstanding several attempts with my diamond sharpener , could not be made sharp . I would use a serated steak knife before I would use one of these knives.2 ) The handles are very poor in design and construction . They have a portion of rubber ridges that are very soft and so flexible that they prevent obtaining a decent grip on the knife . They also are not shaped in a particularly ergonomic fashion and appear , as other people have commented , as if they would not stay long on the knife under any sort of heavy use.Avoid these knives - there are a multitude of better alternatives out there . Although I have no recommendations for a replacement for the small chef 's knife , I do have a recommendation if you are looking for a good moderately priced paring knife : buy one of the Henckels or Victorinox plastic-handled 3 '' paring knives available here for around four dollars . These parers ( I have one of each brand and they are similar in design , shape and quality ) will take a nice edge , fit the hand much better and are less expensive , to boot . If you 're willing to splurge a bit , I can highly recommend Kyocera 's 3 '' ceramic paring knife . It will set you back thirty bucks or so , but it will have the sharpest edge you 've ever experienced on a knife , sharp enough to cut a grape into a slice that is a fraction of a millimeter thick , thin enough to be completely transparent .	-1
The thongs are a bit hard to handle for me and I have rather large hands . They also did n't come together perfectly nor did they feel too sturdy although I did n't really test them .	-1
I have owned mine for 1 month , I saw this morning it had rusted in several places.I am throwing them away and getting a new one .	-1
I gave up on plastic chip clips after my mom showed me an obvious improvement : Binder clips . All metal construction , and a box of 12 costs less than just one of these plastic clips . I use them everywhere . Only loss is that they do n't have magnets on them .	-1
I bought these , but there not as strong as Binder Clips , that I bought at the stationary store , and the binder clips are alot Less money , and you get a box of them , not just 4 ... I do n't keep a bunch of junk cliped on my refigerator , so I kept these OX0 clips in the drawer , they also take up more space then the Binder Clips do ... I 'm not impressed with these clips.But I gave them a 2 star for color ! ! ! Big deal lol ...	-1
I bought OXO wires to replace the wire that will soon break . This slicer is just another junk slicer . When the wire breaks , you throw it away . I think they make this junk on purpose . I am so tired of being hosed by companies selling junk.I am a little angry at Amazon for suggesting that I buy replaceable wires with this . Feels like a bait and switch deal . I did order the other OXO that uses the replaceable wires that I initially ordered with this junk one . You will be money ahead , buying the one that accepts replaceable wires . AVOID this one !	-1
I must say I was very dissapointed with this product . I got to use it about 4 times when it broke during the cutting of a piece of cheese.I hope this is not representative of all of these cutters . But I do n't intend to try one again.To return it and look for a refund would cost more in time and postage than the item costsw	-1
I had to return this item because after I removed the cork from the wine bottle I couldnt get the cork out of the corkscrew . The company sent me a replacement with an opening which makes it easier to remove the cork from the corkscrew . But my old-fashioned corkscrew still works the best .	-1
I expected nothing but the best performance from an OXO product . But this spinner is awful . After many , many spins , there is still a lot of water left on washed lettuce leaves . Does n't even come close to my older and less expensive spinner . A big disappointment .	-1
This is a fairly sturdy , seemingly well-designed piece of kitchen equipment that is supposed to dry your salad greens by spinning them in a colander . You press down on a pump at the top of the lid to get the colander spinning , then you can either wait for the colander to stop , or you can use a brake button to halt the action . I will break this down into the pros and cons that I have found : Pros : It is sturdy . It has grips on the bottom and pretty much stays in place even if you let go of it.The lettuce can be put in the colander , then water poured into the bowl to wash it , then the colander can be removed to drain it , saving the need for an extra washing bowl.It is fairly easy to get a good , fast ( ish ) spin going . Tip : make short , fast pumping motions.Cons : In order to get the fast spin , you must pump for at least a minute , maybe more . My arms got very tired after cleaning two heads of romaine lettuce.There does n't seem to be a need for the brake . I just lifted the lid off when I wanted to stop it . Why add unnecessary functions ? The lid comes apart for cleaning , but I found it extremely hard to get it apart . It 's definitely made for someone with huge , strong hands.And the big topper of them all : it does n't dry the lettuce . I thought that 's what a salad spinner was supposed to do . At first I thought I was doing something wrong , so I tried different things . I put less lettuce in the colander . I broke the lettuce in half to make smaller pieces . I lightly wrung out the lettuce before putting it in the colander . I pumped , let it stop , pumped again , let it stop , pumped again . No matter what , I still ended up with damp lettuce that I needed to pat dry with paper towels . So what is the point of this contraption ? If I just wanted to wash the lettuce I could have used a bowl that I already have instead of paying a lot for this thing . I wanted to give it one star , but because it is fairly sturdy and I can at least use the bowl and colander again , I 'm giving it two . Ca n't anybody make a decent salad drier ?	-1
This product was disappointing . It is a bit difficult to get the lid off and when I used it , it did n't do much to dry the salad . I 'm confused as to why it has gotten so many good reviews .	-1
Based on the video demonstration and other reviews , I thought the OXO Good Grips Green Salad Spinner would be a time , paper towel , and dish towel-saver . Not so fast . Well , actually , it does spin very fast , and you will have some water in the bottom after rinsing salad greens . But the greens are still too wet for salad use . With my old roll-them-in-a-towel method , the clean-up is easy and there is only one step . At least now when I roll my spinach in towels I will no longer wonder if I would be better off with a spinner . I 'm returning it .	-1
I love OXO . I thought they could do no wrong . But this apple corer/divider was a waste of money . We had an old stainless steel one without the handles , so I thought this one would work better . It does not work any better at all ! The apple gets stuck in it , and it 's a pain to clean .	-1
why is this designed to not go all the way to the bottom of the apple ? it makes it so much more dangerous , since you have to put your fingers near the blades to extract the apple sections and try to force the last 1/2 '' of cut.this is what i get for trying to be lazy when making pies , tarts and turnovers , and not just use a chef 's knife and paring knife ( and maybe a corer with a plunger ) .i 'll be doubly insulted if it starts cracking like a few reviewers have mentioned.to sum it up : do n't bother , it 's more of a hassle than a time saver . just get an 8-10 '' chef 's knife and a paring knife ( except for certain tasks which necessitate it , a 12 '' is a little unwieldy for my small hands ) . i know that a lot of people who have never used them seem to find chef's/ cook 's knives daunting , but even super cheap knives are safer , better and easier to use than this , and they certainly are n't single taskers , either . just buy an easy -to -use sharpener ( forget all those over-priced contraptions with `` fingers '' ) and you 're good to go .	-1
I bought 2 of these because I eat a lot of apples and pears . Both of them split on the sides within 6 months . These OXO units 'look ' like they are sturdier , better quality than other plastic units , but they are n't . If you use a corer/divider on a regular basis , do n't waste your money on these ; go for an all stainless steel unit instead .	-1
Most importantly bits of apple remain wedged between the seams of the blades . Hand washing or dishwasher fail to remove the bits . Having to pick at it with a toothpick or tweezer makes the tool a net time loss . In addition as other reviews stated it does n't cut all the way through on some of the apples . Sending it back !	-1
Although I like the design -- especially the non-skid feet -- I 'm ultimately very disappointed in this grater . Like other reviewers , I 've found that after less than six weeks of use , the plastic has started cracking.Contrary to what other reviewers have said , however , you CAN separate the two halves of the grater for cleaning or storage , but I was disappointed by how you can barely spread the grater 's feet out more than a few inches ... I wish it had a full range of movement . As it is , you can only position the feet about 4 inches apart . I was hoping for a wider foot print for things like quesadillas.Overall , a disappointing product . Neat design , bad materials .	-1
I bought one of these , thinking that the price is pretty reasonable . I got what I paid for.When you try to slide out the grater , so that you can clean inside of the ridges that hold the two plates into place , it 's awkward , because you have to align it just so , or else it wo n't come out . I 'd toss it in the dishwasher after using it . After the first round ( we do n't use the drying cycle , because it costs so much electricity ) , it came out with multiple cracks along the side . A couple months later , the plastic underneath the fine grater broke off . That made it so that the black piece up top is absolutely useless , because now it wo n't rest comfortably on the table . Then , the wide side broke.I went to walmart , and got an $ 8 box grater . That thing is solid .	-1
I am usually a fan of OXO products but I have noticed lately that they are not as good as they used to be with shoddy execution or questionable workmanship . I , like everyone else , was hoping this would be the solution to my storage issues with graters but it proved useless less than a year later and with little use to stress the thing out ( almond paste and cheddar cheese were the only things I used it for ) . It developed cracks in the plastic that are impossible to repair . Also , I do not think this is a good grater for the supposed market of arthritic people - it can be difficult to put together.So , in short , it stinks for those suffering pain in their hands and for those who cook . Save your money and just buy a KitchenAid grater .	-1
I had hopes when I bought this one , as I have usually had success with OXO products.Sadly , this grater was not one of those successes . I did n't pay a lot for it , around $ 10 and it lasted about 6 months . But the plastic gave way on the sides , so now I only have the side that is for finer grating . Which I do n't do that often . The cracks start at the corners of the steel grating piece and eventually they just break completely.It needs a stronger design and then it would be much better .	-1
I was disappointed that this grater only lasted for a couple of weeks . At first it broke into two pieces , so I could only use one half ( even when it stood upright as pictured , it never did stay open or grip the counter- it was never stable , and either closed or fell down while grating ) . Then I was left with a flat grater that was difficult to use . The piece that was left cracked on the corners , and broke apart within a couple of uses . Usually Oxo makes great products . This is not a good product . Save your money and buy a different model grater . You will be happier with an all metal model for sure !	-1
The only good thing about this grater is that it does n't take a lot of space , but after using it few times it cracked on the bottom .	-1
When we got this grater , it was nice , the grip is nice . It is hard to fit in a bowl , so we used a plate . Now the plastic has broken , the plastic is very thin , and apparently this item was not made to last . I have always thought of Oxo as being a good product , but lately several Oxo items have been junk.Do yourself a favor , and get an all metal one , with no plastic to break .	-1
I have owned many other Oxo products and purchased this based on my satisfaction with those items . However , the Multi-Grater failed miserably . Within weeks of moderate use , the plastic shell cracked . I continued to use it gingerly for several more weeks until the entire product snapped in half . Not recommended at all .	-1
I like the design of this grater : it does n't take up much space and is easy to clean because it comes apart . Unfortunately , the white plastic broke in several places after only a few months of use .	-1
I was looking for a grater that was easy to clean . This one seems like a good idea ... until it collapses on you . The sides do n't spread apart far enough , so it is unstable and without proper pressure it folds up . With proper pressure it works until the plastic breaks . I 'm surprised Oxo designed this . I 'll be going back to the old fashion `` box '' style grater .	-1
Bristles too short and too soft . Did not last very long . Eat a whole food , plant based diet so scrub lots of vegetables every day . Did like the shape of the brush , fits nicely in my hand as I work .	-1
I do n't like this at all , it is hard to use compared to the handle vegetable brush that I do use . It is hard to hold on to and scrub the vegetables at the same time . I did n't return it because it did n't cost very much and seemed silly to return it , but I do n't use it .	-1
I just love this fexible spatula . I just bought a new frying pan and decided it was time I learned to cook eggs over easy . Well I tried the expensive flexible one from Sonoma and the eggs broke in the pan . My kitchen-aide spatula could n't do the job either . I just happened to see this spatula in the grocery store and figured I 'd give it a try . Well , lo and behold , it does everything I ever wanted a spatula to do . I can flip eggs like a pro now.Oxo Good Grips Silicone Flexible TurnerMarylynEdited to add , Beware the spatula will bend and can not be fixed . Ours bent in the front making it useless . I would n't buy it . Never mind my first review , do not buy this spatula .	-1
I found the Spatula too flexible to support the food that I was cooking . Fish fillets fell off and broke apart.Not what I was expecting .	-1
This is my fifth different kitchen gadget made by OXO that has ultimately failed because it broke . Not a good track record , if you ask me . As a masher it worked fine on potatoes and whole tomatoes , the non-stick coating was a nice feature , the grip work fine . Recently I noticed the handle seemed a little loose . Then while we were cooking Thanksgiving dinner my husband was using it . He pushed down to mash and the whole thing came apart ! The side pieces are inserted into the handle and appear to use tension and some type of bonding agent to hold it together . The repeated force of mashing things was too much for the masher , which misses the whole point , does n't it ? It was amazing my husband did n't cut himself on some of the pieces of exposed plastic , which were sharp . Could I glue it back together ? Maybe . Is it worth it ? No ! 11/26/12 update : Replaced this masher with the Jamie Oliver Stainless Steel Masher . Fabulous five star product , works much better than this ever did ! ! ! It looks like OXO may have updated their design a bit from my version , but the ergonomics and function of the Jamie Oliver is far superior . Check out my review .	-1
This does mash nicely , but if you use it in more than a very small pan , you get your fingers covered with potatoes ! The handle is really too short , and I do n't actually find it ergonomic . It makes you get in a slightly strange position , since your hand has to be clenched on the top rather than gripping from the side . I 'm buying something else !	-1
I 'm a huge fan of OXO , and own lots of their utensils , but these are terrible . The cube ports do not have a lip , so water spills constantly on the trip from the counter to the freezer ( even if you fill well below the rim , which results in a very small cube ) . The plastic cover , supposedly designed to keep out odors , leaves a gap all the way around the tray , making it easy for odors to penetrate the cubes ( and adding to the spilled water annoyance ) . Do n't waste your money ; you will only be frustrated .	-1
I LOVE OXO items . They make some great products , unfortunatly they make some bad ones too . This is a bad one . I bought this so store leftover chicken stock in ( I saw someone making leftover stock into stock cubes and saving it for another day ) . Well I filled up the tray and started to put the lid on , which make the stock start spilling out . After fighting with if for like a mintue I decided , well there is no way I 'm going to be able to carry this perfectly level across the kitchen so keep it from spilling so I gave up . OXO should discontinue this item .	-1
Mr. Scholl 's and all other negative reviews of the OXO covered ice tray are right on the mark . I bought two of these and although I agree the concept is great , they are sooooo poorly executed and a pain to use . Not only are the lids difficult , the trays are hard to fill without spilling water ( whether from your kitchen sink or from a pitcher ) . The curved shape indeed makes novel shaped ice but because of spillage you end up with many of the ice cups partially filled . You end up with ice that melts quickly . It would have been much better to make square cups and a flat bottom on the tray . Getting the lid off is another major production . It does not slide easily to fill or to remove ice . Good idea , yes but totally awful execution . OXO gets an `` F '' on this one . I 'm giving mine away . I bought a couple silicone cube shape trays at the same time and I am going to stick to them until someone comes up with a really great user friendly tray that makes generous sized ice .	-1
Instead of a typical review , I urge you to read the one submitted by Blake Scholl above . He said basically everything that I was going to , and I feel it 's a 100 % accurate account of the product.I love OXO , but this ice cube tray is a pain in the arse . Its only redeeming quality is the fact that I can stack things on top of it because it is covered .	-1
I do n't like the way this thing works ... Luckily , after I ordered it , I found my old cheapie that had been misplaced during our move.I would suggest saving your money and buying one of the cheap plastic ones that work on the push stroke , and peels the shrimp by breaking the underside instead of cutting the shell down the back . I ruined more shrimp than I peeled with this one . I am hoping to find another use for it ! Maybe a grout remover ... .I find that rather sad , because I like the other OXO products I have purchased . The large handles prevents my bad finger from locking trying to hold something of small diameter ... ; 0 ) ) PK	-1
We love OXO products , but this one is not one of them . Shrimps get mangled . Might be good for very large shrimp though , but not for medium ones . My wife found it faster to just use her nails .	-1
I had this for about two weeks . It leaked dishsoap everywhere , and I did n't find it helpful for washing at all . I guess I 'm a sponge girl .	-1
I usually find the OXO Good Grips products to be great ... good quality and designed in such a way that they work better than many other brands . Well , not with this little guy.I was really only looking for a brush that will help me get my dishware and pans ready to put in the dishwasher . Not fully cleaned , but at least with any dried or baked-on food removed . I 've been using a little gizmo that I buy from our grocery store -- basically just a sponge on a hand-held stick -- with no area to add dishwashing detergent . It works fine , but the sponge gets pretty cruddy looking after just a few uses ; so I decided to replace it with one with brush bristles instead.The problems that I 'm finding is that the bristles flatten with minimal scrubbing and the dispensing feature does n't work so hot . It leaks a bit when I 'm not using it -- and occasionally wo n't dispense when I am trying to use it . Also , I realize now that I really want/need one with a longer handle if I 'm to keep my hands from getting fully immersed in detergent and water . The squat design of this one does n't allow you to scrub the inside edge of soup mugs or other limited spaces either.OXO makes anothermodel with a longer handle , but I 'm not sure that I 'd trust the dispenser on it either . I think I 'm going to replace it with anon-dispensing brushsince I 'm really only trying to get the dishware and pans rinsed for the dishwasher . I can add a squirt of detergent for those times when I need it .	-1
overpriced for what you get and it came shipped out bent up with all the brisles . Not worth the price .	-1
This is a good looking brush and it is certainly functional , but it is not cost effective , especially when there are much better options . For this brush , the brush head is permanently attached to the unit . When the brush hair get old , you will have to toss it away . Believe me , the brush hair will get soft or dirty pretty fast . Even if you are frugal/saving , you will need to replace the brush hair once every 6 months if not more often . When the time comes , you will have to throw the entire thing away.There are cheaper brushes sold by other companies . Even Oxo sells two other palm brushes where the brush hair component can be replaced . One looks very similar to this but it is difficult to find . The other one is theOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush . Yes , the SteeL brush is more expensive , but you will save money in the long run because you can replace the brush head withOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush Refills , 2-Pack . Here is a quick math , three of these permanent brushes ( $ 18 ) cost more than one SteeL brush with two replacement brush heads ( $ 15 ) . If you believe you will go through three of these brushes , than you might as well get the SteeL version . Now , it would be even cheaper if you can get hold of a non-SteeL replaceable palm brush.I am giving this a 2-stars .	-1
My wife needed to replace her 6 '' plastic strainer . Based on reviews I bought this , but it useless . It measures 6 '' across but has a thickish rim so it is actually less . In addition it is very shallow and holds minimal amount of food . Much shallower than the one we had . It is more like a big tea strainer .	-1
This brand is pretty cheap and the handle is flimsy . It should also not show up in the fine sieve category since it is not really a fine mesh sieve , it is a strainer .	-1
I have to agree with the reviewer that said it takes too long to peel a potato with this peeler . The cover over the blade is supposed to keep the peelings from flying up , and it does that . But instead , they get caught under the cover and slow down the works . It 's broad and obscures your view of the blade . I 'm a fast peeler -- thanks to all of those potato peeling contests my mother used to have her children do -- and I did not like getting slowed down because I could n't see exactly where the blade was going , or getting peelings caught under the blade cover . In addition , the sharp end for gouging out potato eyes is kind of rounded . On my old peeler it 's pointed , and works much better . I 'll keep looking for the older style , so I can get my peeling done faster .	-1
I own a number of OXO products , and most of them are fairly well-designed and functional , but the OXO SteeL ice cream scooper an exception , as it does a very poor job of dispensing ice cream . The curved piece inside the scooper that is supposed to push the ice cream out , does work fairly well if the ice cream is frozen and really hard , but if it is soft and sticky , you might find yourself reaching for a spoon to scrape the ice cream out.Constructed mostly of stainless steel , this scooper is solidly put together , but it & # 8217 ; s mostly for naught , as this is just a marginally useful utensil . Given its performance , I don & # 8217 ; t understand why it is rated so highly at Amazon , as it not a product I would recommend buying .	-1
This is crap . I bought this because it looked sturdy and the OXO name . It bent the first time I used it on a relatively light piece of pie . It is just a flimsy piece of steel stuck in an OXO handle .	-1
This product really surprised me because I was a great fun of Oxo products . The Oxo Steel Cheese Plane is a terrible product . I purchased this one about three weeks ago . The first use of this product made it bent where the handle meets the steel . The second use it completely snapped off in half ! ! I still like the most of the Oxo products however , I strongly suggest that you purchase different brand for your cheese slicing needs !	-1
I was hoping to wear these for a wedding ... they look great from far away but you can tell they are cheap if you have a good look .	-1
I have a food truck business and purchased this can opener to open mostly # 10 cans of tomatoe products . It just does n't cut it for that purpose . It worked great for a 14 1/2 oz . can , or the small can of tomato paste , but slips off the rim of the larger can .	-1
This is the first OXO product to disappoint me . Normally their stuff is good quality and lasts well . The handle came off after 7 months . It had probably been used less than two dozen times and had not been abused . I 'll still buy other OXO products but I 'm replacing the can opener with a different brand .	-1
My first OXO can opener lasted for years and then ... ... it disappeared.Fortunately , Amazon got my replacement out quickly.That was June . By December it needs replacement ... ..	-1
I have the 3 qt bowl , and I LOVE it . I love it so much I ordered the 5 quart bowl for when I bake in bigger batches.But honestly , I still reach for the 3 qt bowl , and rarely use the 5 qt . My issue with the 5 qt is the shape . The sides are shorter than the 3 qt , so there is a lot more splashing and spilliage , especially if you 're using a mixer . If were the same shape as the 3 qt but bigger , I 'd love it . But because of the shape ( it basically has a very flat bottom with short sides , while the 3 qt is a true bowl shape with a rounded bottom ) , I hardly use it .	-1
Sequence of events that led to this review:1 . I exchanged the first Oxo kettle I bought because the lid ( not the spout ) did not fit right , and the steam escaping from the top burned my hand.2 . I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout . ( This made cleaning it impossible. ) 3 . The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots.I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle , They were kind enough to send one to me . This kettle was great -- at first ; but , after awhile , the handle loosened up and , yes , steam began to escape . It now sits atop my refrigerator looking down on my ten-dollar kettle that has lasted me for years.Save your money . It 's a great concept but short-lived .	-1
I have most of the popular OXO products , but for some reason these did n't work out for me , they snapped and broke in half ( the white one ) and the Green one ( mini ) the top slipped off and fell into the disposal and got chewed up.I still have the purple one , I would not buy it again , possibly next time I will go for solid 1 piece model or I should glue the top part myself using silicon glue .	-1
I liked these , so I purchased a couple of them . But after about 6 months or so , the bottom half of the two-piece handles came unglued , first one , than the other , rendering them useless . I tried to find a way to glue them , but the handle is ridged inside with large hollow spaces , so I could n't come up with an effective repair . Also , I did n't like that the handles trapped dirt and water , which would slowly leak out . The blade , which is removable ( for cleaning ) is too stiff and inflexible and rather thick , so it does not scrape cleanly . It is too stiff and cut very rounded on the end , not very spoon-shaped , so does not seem to fit the corners and rounded places in bowls very well . Because it is removable , it will sometimes fall off during use . I would have preferred a more squared-off spoon blade . It is good for cooking , as the silicone wo n't scratch a non-stick pan and it is stiff/large enough to stir effectively , but it 's hard to scrape the bottom of pans , since it 's so rounded . The handle is comfortable , but very bulky , taking up much more room in the drawer than a flat one . The spatula is slightly over 12 '' , end to end , so may not fit in some drawers . I would not buy again . I hope this helps .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be better than all the cheap supermarket spoon/spatulas . It is worse - the head is not sealed to the handle and batter / food / grease / whatever gets in the slot where the head and handle connect and is impossible to get out - soaking , dishwasher on heat boost - nothing works . Also , 400 deg limit is iffy when using on the stove - 600 deg limit is much better . Mine curled a bit when used on the stove , but since it had a permanent reservoir of filth , I tossed it anyway . Better to splurge on the ones from Pampered Chef .	-1
I guess I did n't have an understanding of the product . so I do n't know if it is good or not . But I do n't like it and its clumsy feeling in the hand , I have difficulty using it for anything . Could be me , but I just do n't care for it .	-1
Lately I 've been replacing a few kitchen gadgets that just do n't work right , and this is one of them . The wire cutters are too weak , they bend out of the way instead of blending ingredients . I do n't know if all wire-style dough blenders have this problem but I think I 'm going to try a bladed type .	-1
This dough blender grips nicely in your hand , but the wires are n't sturdy at all and bend and warp when used on dough that is even slightly thick . Pretty useless , since the point is to use this to blend harder chunks of cold butter or thicker dough . The harder pieces just push the wires aside instead of blending them into the dough.I 've also tried bending the wires back to where they should be and they 're just left wavy and out of place .	-1
Usually OXO products are fairly tough and durable , but not this one . It is impossible to cut cold butter and flower with this blender because the wires just clump all together . You would have better luck with a fork and that is n't saying much.I have n't found a replacement product , but I have seen ones that have solid metal stripes rather than wires .	-1
I bought this blender to make pie pastry , and I was thoroughly disappointed . The wires do n't cut because they just widen and the pieces of butter slip through..I spent a lot of muscle to obtain a very poor result . The handle is nice but it just does n't get the job done .	-1
This one feels cheap and flimsy . I rarely use it and will probably buy a different style of sifter .	-1
I have had this sifter for 5 years . Until this holiday season , I was an occasional user . I like how the small sift area . I like how this did n't rust . I like the top and bottom covers a lot . However , today my sifter fell apart from all the sifting ! I guess I was giving the handle too much stress . I am amazed that this is n't a better sifter out there -- other styles rusted , or the flour flew out while cranking , or the squeeze handle caused hand cramps . I may try the electric sifter next because my hand tends to cramp easily , but that will only work with AP flour or bread flour . I ca n't believe someone has n't invented a much better sifter for the baby boomer generation .	-1
I used my new sifter yesterday for the first time . What a disappointment ! It was extremely slow to sift 1 2/3 cup of flour , taking about 4 minutes . The side to side , shaking motion was tiring , so much so that I had to move the sifter to the other hand . I was surprised at that as I think I have strong hands and wrists , typing a lot and being a keyboard musician.I quickly ran downstairs to the trash and retrieved my old , reliable and fast crank-style sifter . I 'll try the new one again but suspect it will end up in a garage sale ! !	-1
Everything in my order that was from OXO was well designed , but made in China . If I had known , I would have avoided it .	-1
This is a great whisk , until the plastic handle starts to disintegrate ( perhaps from the heat of the dishwasher ? ) . All of my oxo whisks had to be thrown out after about 2 years due to the handles starting to break down .	-1
I got this because I needed something that wo n't tear up my non stick pans . I love the handle , but it is a lot bigger than I thought . I mainly use this for gravy , and it 's just to big and flimsy . I 'd prefer something a little smaller . Also , it has little groves at the bottom of the handle that hold water after washing , because of this it 's better to hand wash than in the dishwasher .	-1
This whisk was highly disappointing . Perhaps I just expected more from OXO but I do n't think it will whisk anything thicker than liquid . I used it the other night to make pudding and it started out find but be the end just could n't hold up to the thickness of the pudding .	-1
Whisking thicker consistency food is a challenge . E.g ; cake batter . It feels flimsy . I rather use a metal whisk if you are planning to have only one .	-1
Oxo has designed many nice things , and their customer service is first-rate ... a rarity these days . Having said that , they have had a few misses , and this is one of them.Who would think a set of measuring spoons could evoke much of a reaction ? Certainly not I , but ... I 've had a set of Tupperware measuring spoons for over 20 years that I consider to be the benchmark for measuring spoon design . If you search ebay for `` Tupperware measuring spoons '' and scroll down to find a set of seven rectangular spoons on a triangular shaped ring ( in burnt orange ) you will see what I have . Ever since I received these as a gift nothing else compares . The fit snugly on the ring , nest tightly , and hang properly.I thought this Oxo set was similarly designed and would be a nice extra set . I was wrong.What I like : - The spoons can be detached from their ring . This is a must for me . I 've gotten so used to this feature I ca n't use a set where all the spoons are on a ring so they ca n't be separated.- The design of the attachment to the ring feels sturdy . The spoons will stay attached until needed.- The selection of sizes . The 1/8 and 1/4 tsp sizes are surprisingly useful.What I Do n't : - First and foremost , the attachment ring . I hang my measuring spoons from a hook under my cabinets for easy grabbing . The oval/rectangular shape of the ring causes the ring to hang `` the long way '' from the hook . This means the spoons settle at the narrow end of the ring and do n't stay nested . They splay all out when hung up and the bulky spoon design exacerbates this problem . If they had a triangular ring similar to my Tupperware set , so they hung better , I could live with the other faults . As dumb as this seems , this a deal breaker for me.- The thick , half-round handles feel clumsy and bulky to me . Because they are rounded on the bottom , they do n't feel as stable as flat-handled spoons . This shape also means the spoons do n't nest as completely as most sets . This could be a disadvantage if you store them in a drawer.- I would prefer molded markings so when the painted on markings wear off the spoons are still usable.I have a small kitchen with limited hanging space and limited drawer space . The ring design means the spoons take up too much space when hung up . The bulky design that does n't nest completely means they take up too much drawer space . I do n't say this very often , but I would recommend a friend not buy this set .	-1
I generally like OXO products for a number of reasons -- ease of use , solid construction , and ease of care . These measuring spoons are generally easy to use , although the depth of the spoon bowl and the shape make it a bit difficult to get some viscous liquids out without the use of a narrow silicone spatula . My steel measuring spoons work better for this purpose.I also find that spices like cinnamon and finely ground ginger tend to cling to the plastic much more than other measuring spoons . There is a lot of thickness to the spoons , probably for sturdiness , but sometimes they do n't fit well into spice containers . They take up much more space than my steel spoons that fit inside each other , as well.Good traits -- I like how tough they are . I also like the plastic ring ( although they 're tough to remove from the ring with one hand ) .So , overall , I was disappointed by these spoons and tried them several times to make sure that my results were n't just flukes , in terms of usage . I 'd definitely advise purchasing a good set of stainless steel measuring spoons instead . These are the ones I use : Cuisipro Stainless Steel Measuring Spoon Set .	-1
I thought I would add an observation seemingly not made by others : these spoons are too lightweight for a dishwasher with any real power . Unless you take care to entangle them inside or under heavier items before you start the dishwasher , they will fly around inside ! After discovering this , I purchased heavyweight stainless steel measuring spoons , which I do not have to worry about when putting them into the dishwasher . As a result , these plastic spoons from OXO never got used enough for the labels to wear off , so I have n't had that problem.My advice : DO N'T EVER buy plastic measuring spoons , unless you WANT to clean them by hand after each and every use .	-1
My husband and I received these as an unsolicited wedding gift . I 'm pretty particular about my cooking utensils , but I figured , hey , they 're measuring spoons -- what can go wrong ? Well , plenty , as it turns out:1 . The measurement labels wore off within a year . Some of the measurements are pretty obvious ( tablespoon , 1/8 teaspoon ) , but for the spoons that are closer together in size , it can be kind of hard to hazard a guess.2 . They 're bulky . They do n't lay nicely in a drawer or fit through the necks of narrow containers.3 . They 're not long enough to reach the bottoms of taller containers.4 . Why bother with the cheesy plastic ring ? It never stays clasped , anyway . I just threw it away.5 . The plastic does n't wash up nicely when switching between wet and dry ingredients . Oils , for example , are quite a pain to get off the surface of the spoon.6 . They 're WAY overpriced for what they are . Just because it 's Oxo does n't mean it 's quality.As soon as I get myself a decent stainless set , these are going right into the trash where they belong .	-1
We are trying to rid our lives of all plastic , whether BPA-free or not , but bought these well before that change . They seem kind of cheap , but do function ok , which is why I gave them two stars instead of one.THE LABELS WEAR OFF EVEN AFTER A FEW GENTLE HAND WASHINGS . I never sent them through the dishwasher , and was careful not to scrub the size labels at all , to no avail.I would spend 5 more dollars and get some stainless steel ones . In fact , try to convert all your kitchenware into Pyrex glass , stainless steel , and bamboo . You wo n't regret the quality or the health benefits .	-1
The rubber grips are nice , but as others have noted , the capacity circles ( painted on ) starts flaking off pretty quickly . Also , they are relatively shallow , so it makes it hard to get an accurate measure . If you do n't want to dirty up several of them ( for example , you need 1-1/2 cups worth ) , the shallowness makes it difficult to `` eyeball '' a half cup . I found I used an older , cheaper , taller set that I bought 20 years ago ( for $ 1 ) more often . They also do n't have a good pouring lip like on some others . With the paint flaking off , they look ratty . I ca n't remember if I threw them out or donated them .	-1
I thought these would come in handy with the `` extra '' measuring cup . I found them too bulky for my kitchen drawer because of the slanted shape and the extra cup . I ended up returning the product .	-1
I have had the black and the white versions , and the colored dot with the number wore off very quickly , even though it said on the package that it was `` guaranteed not to wear off ! '' So , of course I called the company , who to their credit promptly sent me a new set , whose numbers again wore off . I 'm still left guessing if I 'm using the correct cup because now , a couple years later , there is no sign that there was ever even a number on them . I 'm writing this review today because I 'm finally buying a new set in a different brand . I also had trouble with OXO 's stainless steel cups .	-1
I do n't usually bother writing negative reviews , but when I saw that these had a five star review , I had to give my input . For the first week I owned these measuring cups , I loved them . They seemed to hold up well in the dishwasher , and they served their purpose well . Then I started doing some more baking , which involved using the cups to scoop flour and sugar from the bag . Immediately , almost all the handles bent . You can take these in your hand and bend them with little pressure ! I am not impressed . I would rather use plastic measuring cups .	-1
I really like OXO products . I have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and I enjoy that they have nice big handles . Since I started getting gadgets for my kitchen I always wanted these measuring cups . Well I finally got them . I was very excited to use them for the first time . Well I went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending . I was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are . I think I 'll stick to my plastic ones from OXO , I had better luck with them .	-1
What can I say about these measuring cups ? Well , for one thing , I think the design is overkill . They are very well made , but I 'm only measuring something here , not eating out of them . Also , there are not enough of them . Missing lots of increments . The next is the handle - okay on the plastic but you 've put enough effort in to have made them all little saucepans . Does anyone need that in a measuring cup ? These are not the measuring cup a true cook would want due to the lack of increments . Maybe you can make the saucepans first , then these ?	-1
As previous reviewers have already noted , the handles are not strong enough and they bend easily when scooping out brown sugar or even flour . While you can bend them back , it 's still an annoyance and makes these unacceptable . The basic idea is great , since there are times when you need measuring cups that will scoop ( unlike glass Pyrex measuring cups that are better for ingredients that you pour ) . However , since these do not really do the job , look elswhere . All Clad and MIU France ( made in China , in spite of the name ) make similar measuring cups and they receive positive reviews .	-1
I must have missed the oversized part in the description , but these are crazy big . Maybe my petite Asian hands are at fault , but I can hardly hold these monsters let alone imagine cooking with them . Even my pots are too small to hold them . I 've since bought the Joseph Joseph Elevate Carousel Set and those utensils are normal sized and great to use . ( Note : my hubby said they were fine but agreed we would need bigger pots . The quality seemed fine . )	-1
This utensil is too long , thick and bulky . The tines are too thick to adequately grab thinner foods such as bacon . Disappointing .	-1
I do n't really like it must because my children finds it bulky to use and thus we have not used it anymore .	-1
This is awkward . It is sturdy and easy to grip , like all OXO products , but it does n't fit into a utensil pitcher well . It is hard to get out of drawers because of the size and the shape of the handle . I rarely use it and that surprised me because normally I 'm a pretty big fan of this company 's products .	-1
It seemed ok until I put it in the dish washer . The first time I washed it , it came out with a huge rusted area right in the center . That tells me this is very low quality stainless steel . Will not be buying any more oxo stainless utensils .	-1
I purchased this BonJour frother to replace my old AeroLatte frother . The difference between the two brands is startling ! The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk . This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down . I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it wo n't last long . On the othe hand , the Aerolatte frothers ( also widely available with several models on Amazon ) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create . I 'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that do n't need thick foam ( like mixing salad dressing ) .	-1
I absolutely hate this can opener . We gave it a long , long trial and a lot of forgiveness , but in four years of ownership it has ALWAYS required two or three trips around the lip to actually cut all the way around . Nowadays it never cuts all the way around , even with six+ times around . I used to own a Pampered Chef can opener that cut all the way through on the first trip then lifted it right off . Wow , I must have been spoiled . Perhaps the folks rating this thing five stars feel OKI about it taking so long , but if you 've ever had a good one , this thing is garbage . I 'm sorry to leave such a bad review , but enough is enough ; now i 'm off to order one that does n't suck ... Kuhn Rikon , you 're fired .	-1
The pressure cooker cooks very well and is whisper quiet . My complaint ? For $ 178.00 I would expect a pressure cooker to last longer than 4 years of minimal usage ! I did n't use it every day . I used it once in awhile and the other day I took it out of my cabinet and the metal disc going around the pressure indicator had fallen off and the plastic was cracked ! I 'm really annoyed ! The company is oh , in SWITZERLAND ? ! how does one get it fixed ? I wo n't be buying another one again . I 'll stick with the US from now on .	-1
I am shocked at how much my boyfriend spent on this pot ! This pressure cooker is beautiful and really REALLY heavily built yet the user 's manual says this cooker is not dishwasher safe ! Not even any part of it ! I find it hard to trust this Kuhn Rikon pot with steam under pressure when it ca n't be washed in the dishwasher ! My mothers old Presto pressure cooker was always washed in the dishwasher , and my daughter , who is still using it to cook for her family , is dishwashing it nearly daily to this day . I 'm going to ask my boyfriend to send this Kuhn Rikon back and buy a Presto pressure cooker . He 'll spend a fraction of the money and get a multi-generational classic . Maybe the Kuhn Rikon is just a level of `` fancy '' above my interest .	-1
I relied on this pressure cooker to prepare most of my food for years , but around year 5 the handle began to fall off as an internal plastic component wore out . The handle can be replaced , but like the silicone valve I also needed to replace , it is only available from a couple of small specialty retailers at a high price . I 've had other pots whose handles came loose , but that was decades after they were purchased for less than $ 10 . Kuhn Rikon 's pressure cooker design might outclass its inept competitors , but its construction quality is nothing special .	-1
I was hoping that this would be more substantial . If you need this type of whip you may find it acceptable at its $ 10 , or so , price point .	-1
I bought this so that I would n't have to buy the stores Stale Fried , taco shells . But since most of the tortillas either break right down the middle and fall off of this baker , or the get REALLY HARD . I would n't recommend it to anyone at this point .	-1
We followed directions exactly ( preheated corn tortillas in microwave with damp paper towels ) , but all the tortillas remained almost flat and unfoldable and when we tried to put them on the racks they just slided off ! ! We tried bending tortillas , but they only broke . We tried spraying tortillas with butter spray , but that made it worse.I was going to buy a steamer , but seemed expensive just for tortillas . Then I googled how to steam tortillas . Easiest method THAT WORKS is to put slightly damp paper towel on plate , add stack tortillas then put another damp towel on top . THEN put ANOTHER same size plate upside down over all . Microwave 45 sec to 1 min and NICE SOFT TORTILLAS that DO LAY OVER the racks . I have n't tried cooking them yet , but at least there is now a chance this may work .	-1
I wanted to cook my tacos without using grease so I got this to cook them in the convection oven . The problem is that the tacos either break when I fold them over or they slide off onto the bottom of the oven . If I were to use this to hold my tacos as intended after cooking it might be alright but I think I would prefer a wire rack so the grease would run off .	-1
This product arrived with shipping damage , but I elected to return it for a refund rather than a replacement.It is n't as thick and substantial as I had hoped . I needed a sheet for baking cookies , and I ended up going to a local restaurant supply store and buying an eight dollar aluminum `` half sheet pan '' that makes beautiful cookies .	-1
With some products , you get what you pay for , and this is one of them.I think Wilton is overcharging at $ 12.This sheet is worth about $ 1.50.The edges are not finished , and so are unnecessarily and dangerously sharp.Not a good quality in something you have to handle a lot.I think this is where they got the price down to $ 12.The coloring is too light ; a good cookie sheet needs a perfectly balanced finish color , dark enough to brown cookies , light enough to not scorch them , not too light so as to not provide any color to edges and bottoms.It 's heavy , but that does n't mean it 's good ; that just means it 's heavy.It 's not usable at this weight for this size.Save your money and your time , and get a decent cookie sheet at double the price.It will make every cookie experience a joy , instead of a headache and a guessing and hoping game .	-1
The design does not protect rendered fat from the heat of the broiler which spatters the fat all over the oven and often starts it afire . Putting water in the bottom of the pan helps but the pan is so shallow the water soon evaporates.However , it works well for roasting .	-1
One of the best parts about this ( and actually draws some fire from other reviewers ) is that it 's plastic , which means no meniscus when measuring water . It 's actually easier than a glass measure because of that.There is , unfortunately , a downside . It does n't matter how easy it is to measure when it 's not accurate . Because it IS so inaccurate , this piece is almost worthless for being more than a decoration.It 's a 6-star concept . With so many possible ways to measure this thing could have been awesome , but the practical realization falls far short .	-1
I bought two of these and they both met the same fate : a small crack in the bottom that rendered them useless . At this price I expected a little more . They did n't last more than a few months .	-1
So much hype about the name that the product I received was disappointing . Made in china with cracks in many places . I will search out a german proofing basket that has the quality I am looking forward . Not a fan .	-1
I have been a fan of Breadman machines for at least 10 years now.So my existing Breadman Ultimate was starting to get pretty old . I figured I 'd treat myself to a new one . Same buttons , same model number etc . Identical.Bought one at a local store . Hmm ... . it burned everything on the sides . And this was using Breadman 's own recipes , as well as some of my own . Exchanged it . Same thing . I tried making the crust as light as possible , and even using a custom program to reduce the baking time . This just was not right.So I just got my third one today , this time from Amazon.com . This one seems OK , thank goodness.Anyway , I wish I could give the product 5 stars because when they work right they are fantastic.But having two defective machines in a row is unacceptable . Therefore , for now , it only gets two stars . If I have any trouble at all with this third Breadman , I will be switching to the Panasonic bread machine instead .	-1
Bought it brand new . Tried 2 of their recipes , one Krusteaz bread machine mix , two of my own recipes . None turned out right . This was my 4th bread machine , wore out the previous 3 , so have lots of experience with bread machines , this one was the worst I ever had . Contacted the company , did n't get much help , just kept saying do a dough ball test , I explained that I had never had to do one before , in years and years of using bread machines . Just too much trouble ... so , got myself a Zojirushi , even though lots more money it works like a champ ... first time , every time , right out of the box !	-1
I am an experience bread machine user having owned several bread machines over the past 25 years . My TR2200 Breadman Ultimate died last week . I do have a spare one for backup use.I decided to buy a new machine to accompany my spare one . I bought the TR2500BC Stainless steel . WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK ! It is cheaply made , noisy , the pan is much smaller than the original machines and the paddle sticks in the baked loaf of bread even when sprayed with cooking spray.I have made 3 loaves of bread using my original recipes and one that came with the machine . They are mis-shaped , under baked with a doughy texture and heavy as lead . I am returning this piece of junk to Target tomorrow.I am so sorry they discontinued the TR2200 machine , it was a real work horse . I loved it so much I bought my 2 daughters each one and recommended it to my 3 Aunts who purchased them . Now I am not sure what to purchase . I dread experimenting with different brands of machines only to be disappointed again.Sorry but I can not give the TR2500BC a favorable rating . I would not recommend this to anyone.A very unhappy customer .	-1
unless you eat hamburgers as your main meat entree , save your money . After cooking a magnificent rib eye steak ( aka `` delmonico '' ) .which I rub with myfavorite White Swan soy sauce ( arguably the best in the world ) a trace of garlic , I subjected the steak to 7 minutes of this highlytouted cooker for a rare finish , I swore off this `` champ '' as thesteak ended up almost tasteless . Due to circumstances , I . no longer haveaccess to a regular charcoal or gas grill . I returned to a `` lodge '' brand cast iron `` griling pan ( ribbed botton ) which approximated the BBQ grill taste by burning stripes in the meat . a mess to season andclean but the food becomes tasty , unlike the `` champ 's ' results . salmon filet and chicken breast suffered the same fate as my steak .	-1
I 've had about 4 of these type of grills , a few of them George Foreman . All were annoying to some degree . This one has some positives although more negatives , unfortunately.Positives : *Cheap ~ ( IF you find it below twenty five bucks , preferrably a sale below twenty or you 'll feel ripped off ... ) *Light ~ For those who ca n't lift the bigger more burdensome ones the weight is good*Small ~ For easy storage although small was n't always a positive..*Chicken and Fish ~ that 's all I use it for as I do n't cook much red meat and it seemed to cook nicely and evenly from both frozen and thawedNegatives : *Cheap ~ Cheaply made , cheaply and poorly designed , rickety*Non-removable grill plates ~ ALWAYS a pain in the butt , even on a small one such as this . ( I 'd like to leave it to cool , come back in awhile and just dip them in a little soapy water for a quick wash. ) Who wants to have to paper towel these things as that does n't get all the grease so I result to soapy paper towels or soapy sponge , trying to rinse with the sprayer from a distance so it does n't get into the electronics , paper toweling again to dry ... PAIN IN THE BUTTINSKI ! ! I 'll mention I 'm a germ freak and will NOT use it with residue . No , no , no . That makes it stink anyway when preheating ... ! *Small - too small . Even if you are cooking for one it 's not big enough for meat and veggies ... well..barely..but I 'm always cooking for 2 and it 's not working ... how many times did I have to try and towel it off while hot for what was left to cook of the small meal.. ? Annoying . *TOO Slanted ~ Ugh this was a problem . My frozen items slid off frozen , slid off thawed , slid off half cooked , slid off while I was arranging them to cook , slip..sliding ... slithering ... and many times right into the muck in the muck dish . Pointless . *Non-stick surface ~ does n't last and who knows what it 's doing to you after you eat it which you will as you never notice that first few tiny chips ... Save your money for one with removable plates that has a good reputation or you 'll find yourself storing it and cursing yourself for the waste of money.That 's my opinion and I 'm stickin ' to it .	-1
We 've gone through two of these percolators in the past year . Each worked very well for a few months , and then problems with the heating element started . On the first unit , the element failed completely after six months , and on the second unit the failure was gradual and insidious . Our coffee gradually became weaker and cooler over a couple of months until one day I realized the pot was not heating the water properly.I note that the price is higher now that what we paid . Too many warranty claims Faberware ?	-1
When i researched ( apparently not well enough ) , and got this 2-4 cup Farberware perc , i could n't have been happier ... after using a mr coffee , this coffee was HOT , and delicious and did n't take long ... .a couple months ago , it blew the GFI plug , and i thought it was someone else 's a/c or something ... well , it did it three days in a row this week ... .it no longer works , cuts off before it 's done , blows the circuit and therefore , brown water ... i 'm so disappointed ... and now , 20-20 hindsight , i 'm reading the one star and two star reviews and see that this is a common element ( no pun intended ) ..amazon , stop selling this piece of crap , please ... i love to order everything from you , and always look to amazon first , but this is such a widespread issue with farberware , you should give them the boot..thanks	-1
This percolator makes really great , rich , hot coffee ... .and in about four minutes ! ! That 's the good news.The bad news is I have owned two of them in the past year and a half ... as they die in about eight or nine months . RIP , Farberware .	-1
To be honest , I do not own this specific model . My review is about what looked like and was sold as the exact same pot a few years ago . Correction , the three pots I bought a few years ago.When three pots failed ( coffee not hot , electic sparks , heating element went ) I did a little research . I do not have all the detail handy anymore , but I remember , the origial Farberware company was a privately held company located in the Bronx , NY . The original owners chose to sell the company instead of giving in to the landlord ; do not believe it was a product or employee issue.I believe licensing / ownership of the brand name changed a number of times . Today it is owned by Lifetime Brands , Inc. , and the Meyer Co. holds the license to market products under the Farberware brand name . I think I got all this right ; who owns and who licenses the right to market products under a brand name gets complicated.Serve it to say , the Farberware brand our mothers knew and loved is not the brand you see on the shelves today . It 's a darn shame . That pot made the best cup of cofee you could get , and it was HOT ! P.S . I purchased and had to replace/ eventually return the Presto Percolator I purchased at WalMart as well . I no longer trust electronics sold by WalMart as I do not believe they meet the same spes as a similar looking models sold in department stores . I might be wrong , but too many returns to trust further.An interesting read : Go here for some history on ownership of the Farberware brand-name : [ ... ]	-1
Now the maker stops prematurely , leaving the coffee weak . I 'm having trouble finding parts to fix it.Also the pour hole is too high . Sometimes it 's hard to get the coffee to pour out ... almost like the air needs a way in . So you have to tilt it a lot . When you return it to the counter , coffee goes through the grounds again .	-1
This Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator worked great initially , for abut a year . Then the temperature of the coffee started getting lower . Over a relatively short period of time , a matter of months , the temperature dropped so low that the coffee was no longer fully brewed.I bought another one , but had the same experience.I then bought a Pr***o coffee percolator , and it is still performing just like new several years later ! I definitely do not recommend this Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator !	-1
PERC 'S GREAT ... ( BUT ) ... IT BOILS ALL OVER THE COUNTER AND HARDLY NO COFFEE IS LEFT IN POT ... SHAME ON U FARBERWARE ! ! !	-1
I 've used these percolators in the past and they are simple to use and convenient . The only thing that remains to be seen is how long this one will last as this product is now made in China.Update : After about a year and a half this product conked out . The previous pot I had was made in America and lasted close to 20 years . It seems that Farberware for the sake of profits has foregone quality control .	-1
It seems I go through these things like I drink coffee . Everytime I buy one it shortly & quot ; burns out & quot ; . My last one , a 4 cup lasted about 3 weeks . I was so happy to have a new one but was quickly saddened when it went poof , made a fire , shorted out my circuit breaker AND scared the crap out of me ! I will now look for a stove top model . It seems the design of it is too open to getting the plug outlet wet . The slighest drop of water will blow it up . The cord that comes with it is also very & quot ; cheap & quot ; and I have gone through many of those also .	-1
The first time I washed the dial , all the printing came off ! I have to take the user manual out what I use it to be sure that I have the dial at the proper setting . I should have returned it right away and gotten my money back , but I just did n't get around to it .	-1
follow instruction 100 % , waited for one week . Not working at all , tried again many times and still same result . Save your money for food better . Do n't make the same mistake like I did .	-1
I do not like this sifter at all because it starts out sifting while using the spring action handle and then it stops sifting after a few pulls and you end up having to shake the sifter to get the flour out . Now I see why it 's up as a clearance item . Do n't waste your money if you are buying it for its intended purpose . You might get by with doing a cup , but no way will it do more without shaking it and hitting it against your other hand . This one was a let down . I ended up ordering the hand cranking kind because I know they work pretty good .	-1
I bought this wire style Wok ring because we have a high end restaurant quality gas range with 18,000 BTU burners , and the more typical sheet metal Wok Rings get red hot and deform when cooking at high temps with our various Woks . This ring looked in the photo to be what we were looking for and Joyce Chen stuff tends to make good products , but on receiving it were disappointed to discover that the ring was poorly made and was also much shorter in height than other Wok rings . I assumed based on the selling price that this would be a high quality product , but instead the wire was not spot welded at the joint and did n't match up to the other end making the ring not sit flat so it wobbled when placed on the stove grate.In the end we returned this to Amazon for a refund and bought a much higher quality wire Wok ring from The Wok Shop in San Francisco for only $ 2.95 plus shipping ! ( Just type the name of the shop into Google for a link ) So ... Save you money on this junk and buy what we ended up buying instead !	-1
The cookie sheet came in unwrapped with some other items I ordered stacked on top of it ! The cookie sheet was scratched all over ! The sticker on the cookie sheet says `` made in England '' , not Germany . No cook book !	-1
After reading the numerous glowing reviews , I bought two of these as a Gold Box item for $ 10 each . If they had performed as billed , it would have been a good deal . Unfortunately , these pans are worth a few dollars at most.The pans are billed as nonstick . They are indeed coated with something , but it does not noticeably reduce sticking . Everything I 've cooked so far ( biscuits , cookies , hot dogs , fries ) has stuck like glue . A $ 1.99 aluminum pan I got at the supermarket releases better than this thing.The pans are billed as being insulated . But the design is ineffective . Everything I 've cooked so far has browned excessively on the bottom . I have tried Airbake pans ( plain , not coated ; I 'd still be using them except the oven I have now is too small for them ) , and found that they really did work in preventing overbrowning . They make a nonstick pan in the same size as this one : AirBake by WearEver Nonstick 14 by 16-Inch Large Baking SheetOr go for the uncoated pan : AirBake by WearEver Ultra Large Baking Sheet , 14 x 16It releases better than Kaiser 's nonstick , you do n't have to worry about scratching it , and it actually protects the bottom of what you 're cooking.The Kaisers are billed as warp-proof . This definitely is n't true . I opened my oven to find the pan skewed out of flat by about 2.5 inches . ( See the picture of this above ! ) My Airbake did warp , but not to this degree.In short , I would highly recommend against this pan .	-1
Mine has never worked properly -- it took a while before I noticed , but the way the probe is plugged into the unit ( not the meat side , the machine side ) affects the temperature reading . Wiggle the wire slightly and you have an entirely different temperature.From reading other reviews , it sounds like mine is worse than most - but there 's something wrong with the design and manufacture of the probe if these kind of problems arise .	-1
This timer is just a little more complicated than it needs to be . But my main complaint is that it uses a hard-to-find button battery that in my experience does n't last particularly long.I 'd recommend one of the timers here on Amazon that use AAA or AA batteries . They last longer and when you need a new battery , it is cheap and readily available.That said , if you need a timer that can time 4 different things , there are n't a lot of other options out there .	-1
I had high hopes for this popper . I read other reviews about the stirring bar getting jammed so I bent mine up just a hair and did n't have too many issues with that . It does n't pop all ( or enough ) of the kernels before starting to overcook the ones already popped . So you end up with a bunch of unpopped kernels in your bowl.Another issue I had with it is melting the butter . The corn is fully popped before the butter begins to melt . Some suggested putting the butter in the top and running it before putting the kernels in , but that is such a messy way because you have to remove the lid holding the melted butter in order to add the kernels . I just melted my butter in the microwave then poured it in the drip cup area after the kernels started to pop.It 's such a mess to clean up too . I rarely use it because of all these issues . I would not recommend it to a friend .	-1
I purchased this because I LOVE air popcorn and quit eating microwave a few years ago . I read many of the reviews about how to make great popcorn and adjustments in the arm . First , you may need to adjust the arm . The whole thing is cheaply made . Even after reading all these great reviews and strategies for using this.I liked the idea of having popcorn made and just flipping it and using the lid as the bowl.I have two types of popcorn and tried both with recommended oil . Both left many kernels in the bottom . I went and bought premium popcorn , which did better . But this take awhile to make and you have to watch it carefully . There are still a few kernels in the bottom even with premium popcorn.I have an air popper that shoot it out and I think that one is so much better than this . It makes it quickly ( faster ) and I am not as afraid of fires and with this one.Final analysis : Does not pop as fast as air poppers such as presto poplite.Most generic or store popcorn does n't pop well ( you have to buy premium ) .Having oil in it and having the popcorn directly on the base makes it dangerous.Popcorn does not taste as good ( even the good stuff ) .I should not have to read through a pile of reviewer comments to figure out how to use an air popper . What a waste of time !	-1
I make popcorn almost every night , and got tired of microwave popcorn , so I bought this hoping to save a little money in the long run . It makes good popcorn and almost every kernel pops ... that 's the good part . The bad part is the clear plastic dome is soooo flimsy that only after 11 months of use it has cracks all over it . It obviously either ca n't stand the heat from popping , or it hates my dishwasher . Not sure which of the 2 caused it , but it 's pretty much a hot mess . I can still use it because it has n't cracked all the way in half yet , but I feel for $ 30 the dang thing should last longer than one year .	-1
We bought a Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper over 15 years ago . It worked great and made great tasting popcorn . It finally gave out and started to leak oil from the motor . Because of the long and good performance of our old popper , there was no question what we were going to purchase to replace it . So we bought a new stir crazy . BIG MISTAKE ! It is a cheap piece of junk . It squeaks and creeks when the motor turns . The quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less . Worst of all the popcorn does n't taste half as good . I never stopped being a loyal customer , West Bend stopped being a trustworthy manufacture . I 'm going back to popping corn the old fashion way , on the stove . Do n't waste your money on this thing , they have cut way too many corners .	-1
i never made popcorn because within 30 seconds of turning it on the whole kitchen stunk like the smell that comes from burning a teflon coated empty pan ! i immediatly unplugged it and put it outside , and felt sick for hours ! dont even think of buying it unless you want to poison yourself ! im not certain but i believe it has some nonstick coating . either way im certain it stunk of chemicals and certain it made me illFYI : '' Conventional non-stick cookware is achieved through a coating of PTFE ( PolyTetraFluoroEthylene ) , a synthetic substance that has waxy properties . At very high temperatures , PTFE begins to decompose and release fumes which are documented to be lethal to birds and small pets , and which can be harmful to humans . In addition , traditional pans incorporating PTFE are manufactured with the aid of PFOA ( PerFluoroOctanoic Acid ) , which the EPA has classified as a 'persistent pollutant of the environment ' '' i hope amazon boycotts this product from being sold on its website !	-1
I bought this popper based on recommendation of a popcorn fanatic friend who owns the same model . Reading the amazon reviews I knew to watch and make sure the stirring rods did not scrape the bottom out of the box . Easy , right ? Well , following the directions I added the cup of corn and recommended oil to the bottom . The motor was so weak that the stirring rods could not stir the popcorn . I gently wiggled the bottom using the handles hoping to keep the kernels from burning and the handle came off in my hand . Without the handle , it was nearly impossible to flip over the popped corn into the cover/bowl . We had many unpopped kernels . Our friends were mystified as to how we ended up with such a lousy machine , as they use theirs 2-3 times a week and it works perfectly.I can not recommend this machine unless you have an easy way of exchanging it for one that works properly . Personally I have better things to do with my time , so I 'm switching to a hand-crank stovetop model .	-1
It seemed to work , but little to no popcorn popped . I tried multiple times , all with the same result . It must not have gotten hot enough ? I had one like this in college and I loved it , the whole bowl filled up but I think it was a Hamilton Beach . But Amazon was great as usual and the return was easy !	-1
We were given this popper as a gift and maybe it was just an off day at the factory , but the popcorn is wretched . It does n't fully pop -- maybe it does n't get hot enough ? -- so the popcorn is small and has hard kernels . I have to throw out half the batch because I 'm afraid of breaking a tooth . I wish it worked better because cleanup is a breeze , but so far I have n't found anything that beats old-fashioned popcorn made in a pot on the stove .	-1
I recently purchased a new Stir Crazy to replace one that had given up the ghost after years of faithful service . Unfortunately , I wish I had the old one back ! The new Stir Crazy is flimsy , the stirring rod continually hangs up on the popcorn kernels , and the rod has already worn off the non-stick surface of the base . The Stir Crazy idea is just fine ... I only wish they had n't been such cheapskates and lowered the quality .	-1
The humidity buildup in this thing is way out of proportion . I tried less oil , i melted the butter in the microwave instead of on top , but the only thing that would work is simply not using it.Who wants popcorn that sticks to your teeth ? it 's disgusting ! If you want crisp delicious popcorn , stick with a pot and a splatter shield . it works way better than this thing , anyday .	-1
My last two West Bend Stir Crazy popcorn poppers lasted 3 years or more while this one lasted less than 3 months . Guess its like everything else they do n't make them like they used to . I bought a Orville unit at K**L 's when it was on sale and its been working great for almost a year now .	-1
As someone who owned one of these myself , I can confirm the design flaws : * Teflon was used instead of a more durable surface* the stirring rod is metal instead of a non-stick surface utensil* the stirring rod automatically rotates across and - yes - against the Teflon surface , with minimal options available for adjustment . Thus , you can not prevent the rod from scraping off the Teflon surface after repeated use.It 's dumb.I bought mine from a local retail outlet . When the Teflon surface quickly started flaking off , I took advantage of the manufacturer 's warranty replacement . Unfortunately their only redress was : they shipped me a brand new unit of the same flawed design.Sad .	-1
These are now made in China so the quality of the materials is like there baby formula not so good.The first one of these I owned lasted for three years , and the second one six months.The last one I purchased lasted a week.We have actually moved away from purchasing this Item all together .	-1
Bought this to replace my old one that I 'd had for several years now.Either my popcorn is not good or the popper is not working well . So far I have yet to pop a nice batch of corn.My other one popped very well , so I want to give this one a good try , but I have used it 6 times now and have yet to get a bowl full of nice popped corn ! I am very sad about this , may have to return it for a new one , maybe this one is faulty.Want to try different corn in it first to see how that works .	-1
I used a number of recent suggestions on this thread for oil , popping etc . I followed the manual directions exactly.I used Orville premium gourmet corn.I much prefer Popsecret Homestyle.This is so much trouble , and produces nothing I admire in popcorn ... neither did Whirley Pop , which I also tried . I found the corn chewy and not crunchy at every level .	-1
If you do n't mind replacing this machine frequently , then you will probably like the popcorn it produces . Our first lasted about a year , before an internal part popped off and could n't be repaired . In good faith , we bought another , but it lasted less than 6 months , before we the heating element began to fail , producing lots of under-popped corn . Would be great if they could just make them last longer ! We 're going to get a Whirley-Pop to use on a new gas stove !	-1
I trusted this name brand and good reviews and got this unit , less than 6 months and the faucet assembly is leaking from 2 places . emailed customer support and got no answer in a week.Called them after a week and they said yes we are still behind on email from holidays , I have no idea which holidays they are talking about . the lady was very rude and said that yes probably the faucet is crackled or a washer is missing and I have to buy a faucet assembly from them and pay for it . I used this urn for 3 months or less before the problem started and the unit is still under warranty.she was very unhelpful and condescending . very unprofessional.If I wanted a water urn for 3 months I could have bought the 25 $ urn sold at the dollar store and save my self 100 $ and the pain.P.S . inside my urn has turned really black and no matter how I clean it does not go away , vinegar did n't do the trick as recommended in the manual.P.S.S if you really want your water hot go with something else this keeps it warm but not hot.Update : Westbend offered to send me the faucet part at no charge after a second call , hopefully that will fix it.Note : if you use this just for water the metal parts should still stay inside or the water wont heat correctly and your device might burn out .	-1
I bought this brand kettle a few years ago , it was a top notch kettle with a pleasing whistle.I was boiling some water for tea and I guess I went outside and did n't hear the whistle.The heat on an empty kettle of any kind will warp in that situation.I still used it but we bought a new electric stove , and were told a pots had to be in good order to work properly.It should n't be a problem as Amazon still offer the same kettle.Not so , it is not really the same one , though it looks the same ( sort of ) .They made everything a little cheaper , the kettle whistles , but boils over and by the time you get to it there is boiling water spilling on the stove top.The rest of the kettle just seems more Chinese than the original.Why would they replace the kettle spout since the older model was working ? I 'm using the old one now , the new one is with some of the other Chinese junk , I have bought , bound for Goodwill or recycling center.I suppose one has to go to Viking or some other high end store to get something good .	-1
I bought this kettle in September of 2009 , so I 've had it for about 1 1/2 years ... not veryt long for an expensive tea kettle.Today I flipped up the whistle and the whistle `` innards '' flew all about . There are two tiny parts , a screw and a spring , both rusted out , which could easily have gone unnoticed back into the teakettle and have been a choking hazard . As it is there is no way to reinstall the whistle part and I 'm lucky I found the spring , tenuously hanging from the spout cover , before it dropped back into the pot.Beautiful to look at , but it should n't have failed in this way and so soon after purchase .	-1
I purchased this item at TJ max -- for 2x time amount it is for sale on amazon . It says dishwasher safe in the manual and on the storage container it comes with . So I washed it before use and it is not dishwasher safe . I will be returning it tomorrow .	-1
I just chimed in to add a one-star rating . The product is flimsy , a pain to change blades ( & they pop out anyway ) , and lost sharpness after 2 or 3 uses . Everything now gets stuck under the blade halfway thru a slice . This thing is landfill fodder .	-1
This mandoline received top ratings from Cooks Illustrated , which ranked it above the more expensive budget ones like the Borner , so I bought it in spite of my skepticism . At an old-fashioned department store , it was a bit less than the price here.The safety guard does not grip vegetables adequately -- - the spikes are too short to hold the vegetable . Even if you could grip , the vegetable must be oriented perpedicular to the slicer , which limits the types of slices . When I did use it ( without the guard since it did n't work ) , the carrot slices were uneven and looked more torn apart than cut . The julienne function did not fully separate the julienne into separate pieces , so you had to intervene by hand afterwards . The gripper sometimes worked on a sweet potato since it 's softer than a carrot , and the slices of the sweet potato were more even , but I still had to push too hard to feel like it was entirely safe . The plastic also stained yellow from the carrot juice despite being washed immediately afterwards . I 'm going to return it because it 's too much of a safety hazard due to the dull blade and lack of safety guard , since I mostly wanted it for carrots . If you are looking solely to cut potatoes , it may be okay .	-1
Good tool if you are trying to decide if you want to buy a real one . The blades are sharp enough but the spacers fall out pretty easy . You ca n't do waffle fries with it 's attatchments , which was my whole reason for oredering this . Worth this price .	-1
After having some difficulty peeling a clove which it never really did a good job , i have come to the conclusion that bashing the clove with a large knife or cleaver or a chop and bash tool is better and faster than this method . The peeler is a bit too large in circumference and did a poor job when i tried it . The amount of rolling the clove took was excessive and it took longer than it would have had i just bashed it . That is probably the reason that professional chefs dont use a device like this and just go for the speed and simplicity of the knife bash . If you want to spend the day rolling cloves then buy this but i would not recommend it as a serious device and technique .	-1
This item is a joke . It does not work very well . Use a knife blade flat on a garlic clove and hit the blade with you hand . This technique works better than anything . Watch any chef peel garlic and that is what they do . You will never see a chef use this useless device . Save your money	-1
I do n't know why anyone would need this . Does n't do what it 's designed to well enough to justify its drawer space.Pros : - It does work , though not with the miraculous ease other reviewers suggest- prevents garlic smelling hands ( though you 'd probably end up having to touch the garlic to chop it anyway , so garlicky hands are unavoidable to some extent ) - pretty easy to cleanCons : - Needs to use some force . The silicone is not very sticky ( a little slippery ) so unless you press a little hard nothing happens to the garlic skin- A pain to use for many cloves of garlic . Little papery garlic skins get stuck after a while and the roller loses what little stickiness it had to begin with . Then you need to clean and dry this thing out to continue using.- Much more time consuming than smashing the garlic with the flat side of a knife- Uni-function . Literally does not have a single other useful purpose in the kitchen . I 've tried to open jars with it ( does n't work , too slippery ) , use it as a potholder in a pinch ( rolls around , barely avoided a burn ) , and as a nonslip trivet ( too narrow )	-1
This currently resides unused in my junk drawer . I initially bought it to ease the pain of peeling garlic when I make 40 Clove Garlic Chicken . After 5 or 6 cloves , it 's a waste of time because you have to get the skins out and they seem to like it inside and wo n't just come out with a sharp rap on the counter . I have better results putting the cloves in a plastic container with a lid and shaking it vigorously or blanching the garlic and slipping the skins off . I 'm glad others find it useful .	-1
I should have listened..Great for straining pasta but hard to transfer into bowl . Cleaning is another story-gallons and gallons of water are used to clean and rinse-even then it 's not clean . Went back to old colander-too time consuming to use .	-1
Missing a rubber grip on one of the cups . Amazon 's order information tells me the name of the seller , but the seller says they were bought through amazon direct . Not sure about this so I have to send them back . Besides , if the rubber grip comes off one cup when the set is brand new I think that means trouble as time goes on . I wo n't order a replacement set from the same manufacturer - probably will go with a solid stainless steel set . The weight on this set is just ok .	-1
On the bottom of this cup it states that it is made of 18/10 stainless steel . I stored the cup in a moist area outside , but in an enclosed outdoor cabinet that was sheltered from rain , etc . After about 3 months of very infrequent use the cup started to rust . After 2 years of use the cup has rusted so much that it can no longer be used for any purpose . Cleaning it and trying to reuse it has been futile so I had to discard it.Btm line : this product is total waste of your $ , buy another product instead that is made of real ( i.e. , 304 or 316 ) stainless steel !	-1

America 's Test Kitchen is wrong . Extensive experimentation could not yield good rice results . Pasta this way is a joke . It works as an overpriced vegetable steamer.Put rice with less water in a bowl inside a pot with water in the bottom . Cover and steam . Forget the microwave .	-1
The instructions are no help , so it has been trial & error.I have not yet tried cooking rice , I hope it will go better than pasta.The instructions say to cover with water & cook as directed on pasta package . Well , it did n't even heat up in eight minutes . I tried again & again & wound up with farfalle which was still too hard.Next time , I tried boiling the water in the microwave , which took more than fifteen minutes in this cooker . Then I cooked the spaghetti eight minutes & it had not begun to cook . So I stirred & put it back four more minutes . Still far from al dente . But the water had boiled over into the microwave.Another four minutes & it was a little too hard , but I did not want to risk overcooking . Also , about a third of the spaghetti slipped through the basket & stuck to the bottom of the cooker.I would not recommend this unless you 're willing to put in a lot of time searching for the formula . Takes more time than just boiling pasta on the stove.It does look like a good container for taking to pot-lucks .	-1
Just about every russet potato I 've tried to cut on this thing has been too big . I 've had to cut the potato lengthwise or through its width ( and sometimes both ) in order to make it fit . This is ridiculous . This is a french fry cutter , and russet potatoes are the de facto king of french frying spuds . Simply put , this is a poorly conceived product to begin with.Furthermore , the build quality is cheap and flimsy . This will be fine for someone who makes french fries once a month , but for anyone else , it 's going to end up in the garbage soon . Too bad , cause the little 4 '' fries it does manage to put out are quite perfect aesthetically ( other than the length ) . I will be looking into one of the commercial quality cutters not sold on Amazon .	-1
It was way to hard to use , bought it a few months back and watched videos of how to use it and after all that , used it once .	-1
I bought this at another store and used it to cut 20 pounds of potatoes at once . We used this cutter exactly as described and the screen that cuts the potatoes was twisted and bent about 30 % of the way through our stack of spuds . It is going back tomorrow and I am investing in a restaurant quality machine .	-1
This product would have been perfect if it could have fit large sized potatoes . I had to cut all the potatoes smaller to fit in it . It worked well but I wouldnt have purchased it if I had known you could only use small potatoes .	-1
It works fine and comes with 2 blades but why in the living h3ll would you make it 4 '' capacity ? What If I want fries or veggies longer than 4 '' ? Why would you limit your customers to such a finite capacity ? Plus there are these little plastic halfmoon rail guides that leave 1.5 '' of empty space behind the pusher plate just unused . If I cut my potatoes in half I get 2-3 '' fries ... yay ... color me unimpressed . If I just cut them to fit the slicer I end up with .5-2 '' fry stubs left over on the counter . This is a horrible product that could have easily been a 5 star if they had made it 3 '' larger ( that 's including the 1.5 '' of wasted space it already has ) .	-1
The cutter is a good idea in theory and `` should '' work well . Mine failed on it 's third potatoe . The large fry cutter screen bent and fell apart leaving me with only the small cutter . I did not overload it or put to large of a potatoe in it . Now I cut potatoes using the small cutter no longer than 1 1/2 inches and no larger than about 40 % of the screen cutter area.Seems to work well that way .	-1
The blade bent on the very first use ! Very poorly made . I was only able to cut 2 potatoes . Do n't waste your money .	-1
