I would n't say that this would replace your favorite nuts or seeds . But , it is an interesting additive to foods or even smoothie meal mixes . It takes a little getting used to . When the seeds soak a little , they expand and become slightly gummy . But , the purpose it to make you feel fuller , longer . I 'm going to keep trying them . Alone , they do n't have much taste . If you are & # 34 ; texture sensitive & # 34 ; you probably wo n't like these . But , if you 're the average Joe , they are just fine .	1
This has become part of my diet in a way I did not expect . I tried these as part of changing to eating all organic and now order regularly so I always have it around . I find that I eat a lot of yogurt and add the chia seeds with granola for extra flavor . I add them to vegetables and salads too because I love the crunch .	1
I 've been hearing how great these chia seeds are for you and decided to try them . While they do n't have much flavor , they add crunch and texture to yogurt , smoothies , oatmeal , etc . Plus they are high in protein and omega-3 . I made a pudding with them ( a Giada recipe ) and it was fantastic !	1
This is the only way I can go to the bathroom : ( I was born constipated and usually go once a week , or even longer . When I eat this and flax meal and my bran , I go by the next morning . I eat it with breakfast cereal or just mixed with milk or plain yogurt . I also eat them just in water..I mean drink lol . These will do the trick even when not teamed up with all the other mentioned foods like bran flakes . Do recommend .	1
Was reading some health books samples on my Kindles and read about so wanted to try..Did not want to buy a giant bag in case I did not like , but came fast , and there are black and tan seeds in the mix , tried this morning 1 tbsp . with eggs and was great..no weird texture or taste just as I read about so will be buying the big bag next time !	1
Fantasitc price on these seeds , plus the fact they are organic . I use them daily , after finding info on Mayan culture using the crushed seeds for wound care . I had suffered a hobo spider bite , and after a doctor visit , three antibiotics , and months of pain , I crushed the seeds , made a paste , bound them onto my leg overnight , and in the morning the wound had drained into the seeds . I am hooked ! And my spider bite is healing well.Alwasy seek medical advice , first .	1
By far a great edition to my kitchen . I make Peanut butter sandwiches on whole wheat bread for breakfast and jam pack chia seeds in between the bread and toast it ... .I literally do n't even feel/taste the chia seeds .	1
Good price . Good quality chia . It lasts up to 5 years so I am going to stock up . I use it daily in smoothies.Super good for you .	1
These seeds have several health benefits and many uses in a variety of vegan recipes and smoothies . I will buy again .	1
Love the Chia seeds in my morning smoothies & oatmeal . Use it daily & will definitely buy again . It 's a great fiber source & keeps the colon clean .	1
After you dress a salad with your wets , sprinkle on a tablespoon ( or more once you try it ) . The result is a wonderful crunch and perfect delivery system of powerhouse nutrients . They swell up in tummy , and make you feel full longer . Plus offer a vegetarian source of omega 3s . They are a seed if you have seed issues . Otherwise try them . You can hide in frappes or smoothies too . But , I happen to enjoy the breadcrumb-less crunch they bring to the greens melange .	1
My 3 year old loves these & # 34 ; special sprinkles & # 34 ; on his yogurt ! I 've put them in my water as tossed them in about everything i 've cooked lately .	1
As a somewhat new vegetarian , I 've been struggling to keep enough protein in my diet . I find that soaking a few of these seeds to form a gel , then mixing in some yogurt & fresh fruit , makes for a surprisingly filling , healthy breakfast.I also sometimes like to make my own salad dressings , just to avoid all of the additives found in storebought . These seeds make a great addition to those as well.Personally , I can not taste them at all . So they do not adulterate the flavor of your other ingredients , they just add some healthy goodness to the mix.The Amazon price is by far the best that I have found , to date .	1
I ca n't say these are tasty alone , but in smoothies they are great ! Especially if you have strawberries in the smoothie , you wo n't even know they are there . They have so many good nutrients in them , I love that I can hide them in something yummy to get my son to eat them ! Also , these are the same things that are in Chia pets . I had no idea !	1
Product tastes good , seems to be of good quality . I like the packaging and it seems to be free of extraneous debris.I will definitely order it again .	1
Great product from a great company . I 'm a big fan of chia seeds so the question was really which company to buy from . I 'm a big fan of nutiva and have tried several of their products . Top quality and reasonably priced .	1
This is an awesome product ... certified organic raw chia seeds . I enjoy them on yogurt or in my oatmeal or in baked goods but especially like them in my smoothies . I read soaking 2 Tbsp of chia seed for 5 minutes in 3-4 oz of water to produces a nutritious chia gel that can be added to hundreds of recipes like banana or chocolate pudding or even protein chia bars . There is also a chia ceral on the back of the package that uses chia seed , hempseed , coconut manna , water , fruit of your choice and honey ... .. So very good . The price is exceptional too for the amount you get . I 've added the ingredient list below just so you can see all the yumminess you are getting in every tablespoon ! ! ! Highly recommend.Ingredients for 1 tablespoon : Calories ( 60 ) , Total Fat ( 3 g ) , Polyunsaturated Fat ( 2.5 g ) , Potassium ( 60 mg ) , Total Carbohydrate ( 5 g ) , Dietary Fiber ( 5 g ) , Protein ( 3 g ) , Calcium ( 8 % ) , Iron ( 6 % ) , Magnesium ( 10 % ) , Omega 3 ( 2375 mg ) , Omega 6 ( 875 mg ) , Omega 9 ( 290 mg )	1
WEll i think they give me more energy and i found this brand to be equal to other brands that i have chosen .	1
This is a great buy and good quality . Should have ordered more than one . I combine this with flax and hemp seeds for my cereal .	1
First time that I have used Chia seeds , in a fruit drink or in cooking ... very fascinating and delicious . Try it is my recommendation .	1
This chia seed is so handy and we sprinkle it on so many of our foods ! I will rebuy this -- if the price beats the others !	1
Chia seeds make a great addition to my smoothies . I use them at least once a day ! They are a great bulk filler .	1
I love chia seeds . You can do a quick google search to look over the benefits of taking it . There are so many recipes you can make with it as well . If you like pudding and want it to be packed with nutrition just add coconut milk and a few dates and cocoa powder , etc ... I also add it to my drinking water . I normally do not like just drinking water , but having a bit of texture in there helps me to drink more .	1
In the past , Dr. Oz has recommended chia seeds . I eat them for health and also because I enjoy the crunch they add to certain dishes . Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds seem like a good choice to me when considering quality and price .	1
I make a morning shake every day and this is a great addition for its Omega-3 and fiber . As others have mentioned already , pre-soak the seeds in water . I keep a jar in the fridge , and just spoon some out into my magic bullet , along with the other goodies . This will continue to be part of my shake formulation for the foreseeable future !	1
I 've been using chia seeds for years but always bought them locally at Trader Joes . I 'm currently on vacation and needed them and no TJ 's in sight so I ordered these . Great price , great quality , seem exactly the same to me . I love to use them in smoothies , or make chia pudding , or just drink them daily in water .	1
Fresh , and a great deal . Package comes with a zip lock closure . Did I mention it was a good deal ?	1
Great way to easily include both protein and omega 3s in my diet - these are virtually tasteless . I add them to my scrambled eggs , smothies , and even make a banana-coconut mils-and-chiaseed pudding with cocoa powder !	1
I 've read about problems with Chia seeds over the past few months and am happy to report that the Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds in the 32 ounce package I received is fresh , looks like and tastes like organic chia seeds , and this bag contains Organic Chia Seeds grown in Bolivia . I see that the price now is higher than when I purchased a few days ago , so I assume that this is one of those products which price fluctuates greatly depending on how much is sold . For your chia needs , this brand is reliable and the product tastes as it should . The only problem I had was that the line on the resealable bag designating where to cut was too high on the bag , so I needed to cut it twice in order to open the bag . I 've vacuum sealed mine in smaller packages , labeled them with number of bags and the date , and have them stored in a cool , dry closet .	1
I LOVE the Nutiva brand . I use their Unsweetened Coconut Chips which are FABULOUS ! , their Coconut Oil , & the Chia Seeds BUT the 32oz size is $ 18.71 here on Amazon while it is only $ 9.99 at Costco . Amazon 's price is almost double ! They are super good for you and can be used in so many ways . Since I have cut sugar out of life , I find these helpful in keeping me full , satisfying my sweet cravings & also keeping me regular ( fiber ) . I add 4 tablespoons of chia seeds to 3 cups of water and put in an airtight container in the refrigerator . They will stay fresh up to 3 weeks . Leave it sealed overnight & you will wake up to a gel-like tapioca that you can make chocolate pudding with . Just add unsweetened cocoa powder , 1 pack of Sweetleaf stevia powder & you have chocolate tapioca . You can switch it up & use unsweetened almond milk & add Sweetleaf Vanilla Creme flavored stevia drops . That 's just 2 examples but there is so much more you can do with them , just google chia seed recipes !	1
Chia seeds are considered to be one of the super foods , and I add them to our NutriBlasts.. I wo n't get into the numerous benefits of chia seed because you can do research on the internet to find out what they do for you . This is a link to a site that talks about some of the benefits . [ ... ] Can I tell you that this particular supplement did anything special ? - no really . I add a number of the `` super foods '' to our health drinks . So it would logically be impossible to separate any one as to the benefits . I can only tell you that we all feel better since adding these foods to our diet . Really , can anyone truthfully say that any one ingredient of a healthy diet is responsible for all improvements in feeling healthy ? I believe that chia seeds help , but it takes a few nutrients to feel the full effect in all aspects of our health .	1
Good price and now I get it regularly instead of waiting for it to go on sale at my local store .	1
In my country we use seeds to make a drink called & # 34 ; Cebada & # 34 ; . After 30+ years I 'm glad to rediscover them again . I used them everyday in yogurt , oatmeal , drinks ; I especially like them in my lemonade . The best part is their healthy/good for you .	1
We love chia ! This is a great price for organic chia seeds . I 'll definitely be buying these again . For sure .	1
I use this in my smoothie and have always used Chia Seeds . Bought this because of the price . It 's as good as any others I 've purchased .	1
For breakfast , these give you a lot of energy and when I add them with raw chocolate powder and protein and frozen blueberries to smoothies I an lose 2 pounds a week and forget to eat lunch.You can make no-cook puddings out of them too which is fun . These are clean and tasty at a nice price point . Way cheaper than Whole Foods Mark Up !	1
Great product , I like to add some to my morning oatmeal and have used in a coating for fish as well . Very versatile and I like the handy resealable pouch .	1
There are a great , nutritious addition to almost anything . I love to make chia pudding for a sweet , fiber filled dessert that is also healthy !	1
I use Chia Seeds in smoothies and recipes and have a hard time finding organic brands . Amazon offers a good price on these .	1
I add this to my smoothies , or I just add a couple tablespoons to some liquid ( water or aloe vera juice for me ) , and let it gel , and drink . Fiber and protein and fatty acids ... what more can you ask for ? Just make sure you have floss or a toothbrush handy .	1
Ca n't go wrong ... I add it to smoothies . Just make sure you have enough water to soften the seeds to make it easier to digest .	1
I 'm on my second pack of these Chia seeds . I love Chia seeds for how good they are for your body . They help to absorb and remove the nasty things from you body that should n't be there . They 're like little absorbent brooms ! You should try the Chia cereal recipe on the back of the bag ! I love it for breakfast . I 've altered it though , so here 's what I do : In a breakfast bowl , mix:2 Tbsp Chia Seed2 Tbsp Hempseed2 Tbsp unsweetened , shredded coconut1 tsp . cinnamonBoil ( or heat to the temp you want ) 3/4 cup water with 6 - 12 drops vanilla stevia , depending on how sweet you want your cereal.Stir the water into your seed mix and let it sit for 4 -5 min . stirring occasionally . Top with some fruit or walnuts , or both !	1
I never thought in a million years I 'd be eating chia seeds . But here are my reasons , and to me they are good ones . Fiber . Fiber can make my tummy wonky , I have IBS . But I need fiber as I am a Type 2 diabetic . These seeds help immensely . They do n't bother my stomach . Not only that but they 've become addicting . I do n't know why that is . I normally stir them into yogurt but lately am adding them to my coffee as well . They have a nice , mild faintly nutty taste . This particular brand is of good quality AND a good price . That 's a nice combination .	1
These seeds are awesome ! I love these for making almond milk pudding . If you add vanilla , glucomannan ( natural thickener that adds fiber ) , and some stevia it tastes like tapioca pudding ... it is so good and so healthy . I have also added them to homemade crackers and smoothies . They are little nutritional power houses and they do n't taste bad either . A little bit goes a long way , especially when adding them to puddings and smoothies , because they expand to a jelly sort of . I recommend these to health conscious people who would like to try something new . You will not be disappointed .	1
I put some in a mason jar with sring water and shake it up.. sip a bit here and there.. even good just to eaat out of your hand	1
I take these , alternating with my flaxseeds , for fiber . I have taken flaxseeds for years now and have added the chia seeds because I figure variation has more health benefits . Particularly If diabetic , having ample fiber , especially with heavy meals , lots of carbs meals or sweets ... the fiber goes a long way to synergize the sugar with the body . Just like oranges ( which naturally has the fiber along with the juice ) the body processes it lots better than just drinking orange juice.With juice , the body sky rockets the sugar overload and throws a real problem into our health . It 's no wonder there are so many diabetics today - because we are not told of these truths , unless of course we research the facts . Through the years I have learned from my body that this makes a big difference in my sugar readings . Just proves it makes sense to eat what is natural as much as possible instead of letting all these processed items in our stores ( that are so convenient and easy ) take us into trouble . We can not totally omit all bad foods , but when overdoing it , let the fiber help keep the body synergized as much as possible . I must add : I am NOT connected with medical field in any way ... just learned what works and what does n't .	1
I use a tablespoon or 2 of this every day in an organic smoothie and we have n't been down and out sick a day since we started 2 years ago.The price of chia everywhere has gotten ridiculous but this is one of the best available especially with Subscribe and Save and an extra 20 % off for doing several of my regularly consumed items on S & S ; .	1
I use these in my near-daily breakfast smoothie - I love them and will continue to purchase them . I use subscribe and save and receive on bag every two months ! LOVE LOVE LOVE Subscribe and Save ! ! !	1
This is the only brand that i have bought so I have nothing to compare it to . I thought they were good and bought the larger size .	1
We already reviewed this as super . We are using these organic chia seeds in everything from breakfast to dinner . Chia has more omega 3 good for all body systems than fish oil , and no fish were harmed .	1
Even the kids like it . I use it in fruit salads , almond milk , juices , parfaits , etc . and I 'm a big fan of the company .	1
These are great added to cereal or vegetables ... I really like that pop . As for the health benefits , I 'm sure they 're great but ca n't help but feel that I 've wasted my money with all the other sources of these nutrients . I love 'em though !	1
I started buying chia seeds at the health store a couple years ago . We use them in lieu of cereal , and add additional whole foods , such as sunflower of pumpkin seeds , along with fruit , to add to the health benefit .	1
I put hemp seeds and their chia seeds on my salad . It is tasty and organic while being full of Omega 3 and Protein .	1
Great quality chia at a fair price . I was paying extra for their white ones for awhile , but why when these are just as good !	1
I purchased the Chia seed after learning about it from Nutiva.com . The seeds seems relatively harmless and do n't have much of a taste in dry form . I put a little water to them to make a gel and was a little grossed out by the texture . The thought of making a food out of it was a little off putting . I have n't actually made anything yet but Amazon asked me for a review , so here ya go . They are starting to put Chia into foods and I actually purchased a chocolate chia bar from my food co-op that I have n't had a chance to taste yet . I 'll get back to ya.Update : 1/18/2011- Okay Chia gel is not for me . I tasted the chia bar and decided to donate it to the trash gods . I will try consuming the rest of my chia dry as a food topper , etc . Good luck to you chia triers and chia lovers.Update 6/12/11-I 've been experimenting with my chia seed and have made a great tasting granola . I use 3 cups of old fashioned oats , 1 1/4 cup hemp seed 1/4 cup of chia seed , 1/2 Tbsp . of pumpkin spice , 1/4 cup grapeseed oil and 1/2 cup honey . I whisk the wet ingredients and mix them into the already mixed dry ingredients , then bake in a 325 oven for 20 minutes stirring every 5 minutes or so . I eat this in my fruit & yogurt parfait , as a snack and as a breakfast cereal . So happiness for me and the chia seed .	1
Chia seeds have been around for a long time . We use them as eggs in some baked good like pancakes . I like to mix with water and keep in fridge and add into smoothies . The kids seem to stay full longer !	1
these chia seeds are delicious and you get a good amount for the money . my kids eat them daily for breakfast .	1
Great value for the size of the package and its organic certification . I make my own chia drink by mixing 3 Tbsp . with 2 cup of warm water and refrigerate overnight . The next morning I mix it with 1 cup of juice ( any kind ) and it makes 2 servings . I feel so energized and refreshed after I drink it -- -- its an everyday requirement for me now !	1
I really like this brand of Chia seeds . Made by the same company I get my coconut oil from . It grinds up real nice in my smoothies . It suggest that you let it soak 10 to 15 minutes before you use it , and it would grind up better , actually it 's supposed to be a gel then . I have n't had the patience to let it soak as yet ... .maybe next time ... .	1
I do n't know what makes these chia seeds different from other brands but I 've tried a few and always prefer this brand . I use them in my yogurt , for baking and to make chia pudding . I make chia gel and use it to replace butter in baked goods . I 'm still learning what all can be done with them .	1
I read about lots of benefits from chia seed , so I decided to give it a try . The seeds are tiny and have no flavor of their own . I add some to breakfast every day , oatmeal or toast with peanut butter . I tried them with eggs , but eggs just should not crunch . My chia pet is not getting any of my chia seed .	1
Really a great product . I add these chia seeds to my cereal , pancakes , muffins and smoothies . They are good in manyof my recipes . I add them to as many as I can .	1
I soak the seeds for a few minutes , and add to my morning smoothy . Amazing nutrition and a convenient way to keep it in stock	1
ABC News has posted a video for chia claiming `` '' Be cautioned , you should only eat a small amount , maximum one ounce a day . '' '' I consume chia only for calcium and magnesium . Not interested in the fiber since the fruit fiber is healthier for me and I consume many seeds as well . Chia seeds are very high in the Omega-3 fatty acid ALA . However , humans are not good at converting this into DHA , the most important Omega-3 fatty acid.Let 's look at some facts since I like to get the most nutritious foods for the best price available.WEIGHT : One pound of muscle burns six calories per pound per day . One pound of fat burns two calories per pound per day . That four calorie difference may not sound like much , but for most people , that 's the difference between living lean and living obese and even morbidly obese ( defined by those who are 100 or more pounds overweight ) . Cardiovascular exercise will result in weight loss , but it will come at a cost as 60 % of the weight loss will be fat ( that 's good ! ) while the remaining 40 % will come from muscle ( that 's really , really bad ! ) . After the age of 20 , the average person loses one-half to seven-tenths of a pound of muscle a year . That 's 5 to 7 pounds a decade . After the age of 70 , the average person loses 3 pounds of muscle -- per year ! As women approach menopause , the rate at which they lose muscle doubles , which is why so many women begin to gain weight right around that time of life . Why is this weight gain happening ? It 's simple -- muscle loss . When you lose muscle , your metabolism is destroyed . Your successful weight loss formula is dieting plus strength training . Period . No food helps you lose weight , it helps you gain weight . The only way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories , period.CHOLESTEROL : Cholesterol lowering drug , Lipitor with $ 13 billion plus in annual sales is a top selling drug in the world . Phytosterols which is helpful in lowering cholesterol can be found in many foods like sesame seeds , sunflower seeds , watermelon , onion ... no Phytosterols in Chia seeds so no reduction there.FISH OIL , OMEGA-3 ( EPA/DHA ) : Greens , nuts , seeds , fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3 ( EPA/DHA ) since it is an animal source . Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia for $ 1.99 a pound not $ 15 a pound , 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr . There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets : One type is alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , which is found in plants the other type , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , is found in fatty fish . The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA . There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA . You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3 ( EPA/DHA ) . Blood test is the only way to see the affects . I get omega-3 from sardines although flaxseed is important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients . But more importantly Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio for flax is 38.71 but for chia only 3.03.PROTEIN : No seed or green offers complete protein other than quinoa and soy . Soy is not my choice since soy is processed and comes with estrogen . Chia is an incomplete protein since it is missing few amino acids . I get 25gr of complete protein with all amino acids in one scoop of pure isolate or 8gr from one cup of quinoa . Those are excellent amount of protein since after all human body does not digest more than 30gr of protein at a time.FIBER : There are two different types of fiber -- soluble and insoluble . Both are important for health , digestion , and preventing diseases . * Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion . This slows digestion . Soluble fiber is found in oat bran , barley , nuts , seeds , beans , lentils , peas , and some fruits and vegetables . It is also found in psyllium , a common fiber supplement . Some types of soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol , but the effect on heart disease is not known . * Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as wheat bran , vegetables , and whole grains . It adds bulk to the stool and appears to help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines.If you happen to have certain health issues especially digestion issues then insoluble fiber is what you would reach for but if you want to feel full for a longer period of time then soluble fiber becomes the priority . Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol , blood pressure , etc . and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body . Chia is the highest fiber but with higher price and less nutrients.HYDRATION : Ask yourself , would n't you just be getting the same amount of water regardless whatever added to that water ... Water helps hydration not chia or whatever added to water . Water is the best liquid to drink to hydrate but green tea , coffee and squash are also hydrating . When you drink coffee , your body is retaining much of that fluid - especially for people who are habituated to drinking caffeine , as the body adapts , resulting in a reduced loss of fluids . Chia has nothing to do with hydration and never helped hydration only a marketing tool.MONOUNSATURATED FATS : 7.5g in 100g serving of flax and only 2.1g for chia . Mono is the same healthy oil as you get in avocado fruit.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of ; FENNEL__SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES345__565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT0__34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM % 120__99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM % 96__89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM % 48__14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC % 25__48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER % 159__47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS ( mg ) 66__714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0CONCLUSION : With a healthy diet of seeds , nuts , fruits and vegetables , the last thing on my mind is FIBER , a fiber with constipation when I can get healthy fiber in many food items for $ 2 not $ 10 a lb and especially with upset stomach as claimed correctly by ABC NEWS `` '' Be cautioned , you should only eat a small amount , maximum one ounce a day . '' '' ( link provided in comment section ) . Despite all the claims , chia does NOT even break down that easily in the stomach due to its shape and size just like many other seeds so I ground chia just like I do with all other seeds . I consume chia for calcium in organic form in very limited amount since as I described , it is very expensive for limited nutrients but I need to get as much calcium as possible from DIFFERENT foods . I consume higher amounts of hemp , fennel , sesame , flax , amaranth , quinoa than chia . Only for calcium and magnesium in limited quantity .	1
I use this for so many different things , mainly as a supplement for protein . I am happy with the product .	1
Far as I can tell these are great . Ca n't taste them in smoothies . I pulverize in the Bullet then add remaining ingredients . The bag is easy to close . All seems great to me .	1
Love these seeds . very healthy food and easy to add to anything . I put in yogurt , ice cream , my shakes , anything i can think of . great way to add some extra health to any snack .	1
My sister introduced me to chia seeds recently . Just add them to your drink , let them sit for about 15 minutes , and they 'll develop this gelatinous tapioca-like shell around the tiny seeds . They have virtually no taste but are really fun to nibble on as you drink . They do n't cause your drink/food to thicken at all . I also recently started craving boba drinks , and this chia seeds is a really awesome alternative.1 tablespoon = 20 % of daily fiber recommendation . Wow ! I can attest that just a small amount does really help with regularity.The best drinks to add these to are drinks you really want to savor . The seeds are perfect with fresh coconut juice . It 's almost like they were made to go together.The only thing I 've added these to that did n't turn out well so far has been tea . I do n't know exactly what kind of tea it was , but it was fairly bitter . The seeds force you to nibble so that really makes you really savor the drink you 're drinking . The bitterness of the tea was n't conducive to savoring.The fact that Nutiva 's chia seeds are organic and non-gmo makes them virtually perfect .	1
In my opinion all Nutiva products are great . I have never been disappointed . I prefer the white ones over the black .	1
The short-chain omega-3 fatty acid , alpha-linolenic acid , is close to useless in improving our health . The average American can convert only about 3 % to 5 % of it into what he or she really needs , the phospholipid-based long-chain omega-3 fatty acids , EPA and DHA . So what are the real reasons why chia seeds are healthy for us ? ( 1 ) Chia seeds are high in soluble fiber . Soluble fiber partly blocks the absorption of calories from fat . Also , soluble fiber feeds the good bacteria in the human digestive tract and greatly increases their numbers . The good bacteria manufacture beneficial chemicals which ( 1 ) kill the bad bacteria , ( 2 ) lower blood pressure , ( 3 ) cause weight loss , ( 4 ) prevent cancer , ( 5 ) prevent clogged arteries by improving cholesterol numbers , and ( 6 ) prevent constipation . ( 2 ) Chia seeds are high in lignans . Lignans are phytoestrogens that prevent heart disease , cancer , and many other killer diseases . To derive the full health benefit from lignans , we only need to eat an extremely , extremely , extremely small amount of chia seeds or ground flaxseeds every other day . ( 3 ) Chia seeds are high in phytate . Phytate is a powerful antioxidant that prevents heart disease , cancer , osteoporosis , and many other killer diseases . Phytate partly blocks the absorption of calories from starch and protein . Phytate partly blocks the absorption of toxic heavy metals such as mercury , lead , arsenic , and cadmium . Phytate partly blocks the absorption of iron , which is a cancer-causing and artery-clogging pro-oxidant . Phytate is greatly helpful to diabetics by partly preventing the breakdown of starch into glucose . Phytate slightly reduces the severity of flatulence . ( 4 ) Chia seeds are high in phytosterols . Phytosterols partly block the absorption of cholesterol from our intestines by mimicking the chemical structure of the cholesterol molecule.Product of Paraguay .	1
Wow , when I priced these at Whole Foods they cost 3 or 4 times as much . Not only that , Whole Foods is a 25 minute drive . This was a win-win .	1
Perfect . They 're organic and they have a great price . I use them in my smoothies , 500 times the calcium of dairy milk !	1
I never would have though to eat these . I saw these in Dr Oz . They do keep you full . I put them in my morning smoothy . I really like the texture of them and the high fiber you get with it .	1
Nutiva has great quality products . I especially like the chia seeds . There are so many uses for these healthy little seeds .	1
It 's so nice to be able to buy these on Amazon at a good price . These have always been fresh and good tasting and I have ordered them a few times . Chia seeds make great healthy crackers ( Mix with grated carrot or zucchini , let sit for an hour , then spread thin and dehydrate or put in a low oven for a few hours until crisp and dry ) .	1
Not sure if they really are as beneficial as my friends say but I 'm game . Having a smoothie right now with my daily dose of Chia . At least they keep well ... ..	1
it 's great for breakfast , healthy and filling ... .i love it , it 's good for the mind and body , nourishes me from head to toe	1
I bought the Chia seeds because I knew that were healthy . I wanted them organic and this brand was . The price was right . Since I 've never ordered them before , I did n't know what to get , but I do n't regret getting Nutiva brand .	1
Was suggested by a friend to try chia seeds for their nutrient content . Ordered this pack since the grocery I visit does n't sell chia seeds . I am so far satisfied with the taste but I do n't have a measure to compare it against . As informed by my friend , this pack is a little pricey .	1
I use these as part of a breakfast cereal consisting of : CurrantsCranberriesChocolate nibsHemp seedsChia seedsWalnutsPumpkin seedsBrazil nutsOrganic OsMillet rice flakesAll from Amazon , of course ! Milk comes from the local grocery store.I also use them in oatmeal , and sometimes I really get creative , mixing them with spaghetti sauce and putting them on things to make little pizzas , for example .	1
I can get Chia Seeds at the local market , but not at such a fantastic price . Also , these chia seeds are Organic , which means a LOT to me . These seeds are delicious mixed in with whatever you choose to put them in . I sprinkle them on my morning oatmeal and add some blueberries and organic coconut oil . This combination delivers a very healthy , and delicious breakfast .	1
This is something you can put on any food to add some real nutritional value . I put it in smoothies , oatmeal , and salads .	1
I have to admit I was a little concerned about trying these . But what an eye opener . I add them to my daily smoothie and get such a nutritional boost ...	1
great supplement for your health . I love chia seeds . this was a good price . good quality seeds . I like it .	1
I got into chia seeds thanks to my mother in law introducing me to them & green smoothies . I 've since learned that these protein boosters can be added to soups , as well . So I put them in my blender when making smoothies and pour them in my soups ... no one even knows that extra protein is in there ! : )	1
I bought these Chia seeds initially to add more soluble fiber to my diet to help keep me regular . I started adding two tablespoons a day to my meals and after around six months I noticed my LDL Cholesterol levels were lower and a slight raise in my HDL . I attribute these changes to the soluble fiber and natural EFAs in them . I also found they give me more energy so I usually have a serving before I run . They really do n't have much of a taste so they are easy to add to just about anything . I usually make a gel out of them . I add two tablespoons to a small amount a water , shake them up , and then let them sit for around 15 minutes . The seeds gel up nicely . The less water you use the quicker they gel up . Then I just add some protein and almond milk and it makes a good energy drink for me . Keeps me full for hours !	1
I use this product in my protein shakes . I only eat them for the health benefits . There is no real taste to the product . If you leave the seeds in liquid for a few minutes , they 'll start getting gelatinous . Other than the consistency that is only slightly noticeable , you barely know they 're there . I would purchase again .	1
A good source of extra nutrients . This is my first bag of chia seeds I have ever eaten before . Their not bad . I like the taste of hemp seed more , but these have quite a bit of nutrients as well .	1
Approximately one year ago I learned of the health benefits of Chia Seeds.I purchased these and am very happy with this product . I soak mine in Coconut Milk ( vanilla flavor ) which makes the seedsplump-up and become soft and easier for digestion.They have helped me tremendously with digestion and energy.I will be reordering this product , no doubt .	1
This is a great source of protein and fiber . Chia seeds can be eaten without grinding them up so they can be sprinkled over salads and cereal and anything you like.I prefer them in smoothies as they tend to make it a bit thicker.Chia seeds are an excellent item to add to many foods and to make crackers etc with.Good price and fresh when they arrived ,	1
I was a little iffy about buying this product . I am trying to make better choices in what I eat . I 've been hearing so many great things about Chia seeds , so I decided to give it a try . I am so glad I did ! I put my Chia seeds in my yogurt , smoothie , oat meal even my cereal . I decided on this brand because I buy their coconut oil and love it . I am happy I did . I have no complains .	1
Chia seeds at a decent price . these are active - the sprout in damp paper towels and potting mix alike . Perfectly flavorless crunch added to whatever - sprinkled on moring fruit cup , swirled in the mayo on my sandwich , and so on . very filling , good for conquering the need to snack between meals.Ca n't yet say about the effects on blood pressure , but will post again next time I get my BP tested	1
I like this dried version because it lasts longer , takes up much less space , and is so easily customizable . I bring a little 2oz bottle of this , mixed , to work daily and it provides a little boost of energy that 's so needed in the afternoon . ( 1/2 tsp . or so of coconut powder used for that size ) I have found that to mix it well I need to use a little warm water first to dissolve the powder , then add cold . No problems there.Also , I added contents of the package to a small screw top container for easier measuring and access . There 's a zipper seal on the bag , but the powder gets in there and makes it harder to zip closed . The bag is great for storing unopened coconut powder though.I like that there 's no added vit . C. ( Why is this added to coconut water ? Preservative ? ) Aside from wishing the bag was bigger for the cost , I like this coconut water powder and will definitely purchase it again .	1
Saw all the good reviews on this , so I thought I would try it instead of Gatorade powder mix for our hike .	1
Excellent natural electrolytes . Great for hard training- cheaper than buying coconut water ! You can mix this with any performance drinks- no GI problems	1
I like the price better than bottled coconut h2o and it is easy to just dump a teaspoon full into a smoothie . I would recommend it .	1
I love coconut water and have been drinking it since I was a kid , when the only way I liked it was from the coconut . When the explosion of coconut water in tetrapaks and cans came about a few years back , it was a boon to me . I 've tried so many brands I 've lost track , but in the past few months , I 've settled into a few faves -- Taste Nirvana and some raw version Whole Foods sells that totally tastes like it came out of a shell within minutes of purchase.I bought this because I thought it would be good to add potassium and minerals to smoothies and to have on hand for when I wanted coconut water but ran out of cans . ( Subscribe and save is a monthly thing and Whole Foods charges more than I wan na pay for my fave brand . ) Since it 's organic , that 's a big plus.Well , surprise . This is pretty darn pleasant.Mixes very nicely and easily , too . And you can CUSTOMIZE , which I think is the bonus of reconstituting it yourself . For a stronger flavor , add more . Simple.I 'm not aware of the origin of the coconuts , but the flavor reminds me of South American coconut water as opposed to the Thai/Asian . It 's not that sweet and it 's a little salty , saltier than the Thai-origin brands I 've enjoyed . Saltyish like O.N.E . and VitaCoco , but actually nicer than both those . Reconstituted , this baby 's better than some non-dehydrated brands . Imagine that ! Surprised me , for sure.I 'll definitely rebuy . This is a very handy thing to have in my pantry , cause I hate being out of coconut water.This goes on my list , another Navitas product that satisfied this customer .	1
I like the product . It has a good taste . i wish it came with a measuring spoon/funnel to enable you to put in bottle water . The product is great . Thanks	1
I love popcorn and I sometimes want to be able to add a bit of spice to it . I wanted to try the Kernel seasoning but had no idea what I would like so I did n't want to purchase a single flavor . Online the single flavor comes in a pack of three and all I could envision was not liking the one I got and wasting a lot of money . This little grouping is perfect ! It gives me enough of a taste to know if I like it AND I can mix and match the flavors . Overall I 'm thrilled I decided to try these and so far they are yummy !	1
I discovered quickly that I only enjoy three of these flavors but my husband loves those that I do not . So this was a great way to try the different flavors without wasting those that you do not like .	1
We love snacks , especially chips and popcorn . Chips with their salt , fat and carb ( the unholy three ) count way up there has been set aside for special occasions . For years we only used microwave popcorn . In many cases that is all we could find . Just bought a hot air corn popper and a bag of Bob ' s Red Mill white popping corn . Saw these samples of flavorings and decided to try them before we buy a larger container . At over $ 3.00 per wee little container , you can almost consider these seasonings powdered gold . The carmel was only half full , the rest about 2/3 . Already have one favorite and will be ordering a larger size .	1
this is a gift for son-in-law . These flavors are really good and low calorie . They add just the right hint of flavor without being over powering This sample pack is the way to go if you are unsure of your gift recipients preferences	1
This is a great variety pack for flavorings . My favorite is the white cheddar . Each flavor will get you about 10 uses for a large bowl of popcorn . I use olive oil first , toss , then sprinkle the flavoring on so it sticks .	1
These are very sweet but very good pumpkin cookies . I am glad they are n't available all year they are habit forming .	1
I just love these cookies . They are so good . They are Ritch in flavor so I only eat 2 once in awhile .	1
I could easily become addicted to these cookies . They are just the right blend of pumpkin spice and creamy cheesecake yumminess ! Of course , they are horrible for you - but oh so good !	1
Well , how can you go wrong -- -a cookie and pumpkin . A winner all the way . Pepperidge makes a good product I think .	1
I am obsessed with anything & everything pumpkin and pumpkin-related . A friend let me know she saw these cookies at her grocery store . I found them at my local Walmart.If you like the taste of pumpkin , seek out these cookies because they do taste like pumpkin . I 'm guessing the cheesecake part of the cookie is what I originally thought were white chocolate bits . Great combo . It 's a shame they have to be a limited edition item because they should be available year round.Tastes really good .	1
I would highly recommend this product to anyone that cans fruit for pie fillings . It is recommended from all major universities in canning fruit for pies . The product is higher priced than corn starch but I 've done the corn starch route and it creates a lousy canned product . This is the best !	1
Great product at a good price . We made 40 quarts of pie filling . We really like the product to make pie filling .	1
I made several quarts of apple pie filling with this cooktype clearjel cornstarch and it made a delicious sauce . Regular cornstarch will get clumpy or runny when canned so this is the type you want if you are making your own pie fillings .	1
for pies and preserving . Times have changed and this is the product you need for putting up your preserves not corn starch .	1
I 'd give it 10 out of 5 if i could ... .i could NEVER make a decent jam without it being too runny ... .this stuff works in the background , so to speak ... .it gels up nicely without adding that starchy flavor ... now i know what the pros use ... .i 'm purchasing it again	1
Oh my ! What a delicious grain . Nutty , sweet , complex . I cooked it simply in stock , with ginger root. , a little scallion to finish . It is amazing . The color is truly black and on the plate presents wonderful contrast .	1
This was recommended by Dr. Oz.More healthy than white rice and hasa pleasant , nutty flavor.I mix it with beans or eat is forbreakfast with honey .	1
I ordered this to try something different from normal white rice ( and even brown ) . It 's good ! Does seem to take a few minutes longer to cook , but it 's worth the wait . Good company , good quality and packaging . The 64 ounce bag lasts a while and has a resealable top .	1
I discovered this Black Rice purely by accident when I purchased a bag at Costco . My husband is diabetic and I strive to cook things always with the glycemic index in mind . I had done some research and found out this type of rice was much better in that regard . It is a very hardy rice and takes longer to cook than white , but is a delicious and healthy alternative to starchy white rice . Excellent in a rice cooker ! ! !	1
i love variety in my beverage choices and this one is great . i have only tried 3 so far but they have all been delicious . this is by far the best instant cocoa i have ever tried .	1
I love this so much I got it for my friend 's birthday ! Both of our favorite is the Warm Oatmeal Cookie ! Oh man this stuff is good !	1
I purchased these as a option for Girls at a Girl Scout Mother -Daughter Tea for those who really do n't like Tea . this is the first year we have done this . It was a great choice . Because of the different flavours , everyone was able to find one that they would try and like.Lots of good comments made about choice . I was asked numerous times where I got them .	1
After trying several different brands of cocoa mix , my husband decided that he will never use anything BUT Land O'Lakes . This stuff is DELICIOUS , and we love the variety of flavors .	1
I love this hot chocolate ! I just wish it was cheaper and you could choose which flavor packets came in the pack of six , so I could get my favorites . But all are great flavors .	1
Our family has used Land O Lakes products for generations and the cocoa is a big favorite . It takes a 50 mile round trip to the nearest store selling this delicious cocoa , so Amazon shipping is wonderful . With the variety pack , there 's a flavor for everyone and every mood . Always delicious .	1
I had never seen Land o Lakes cocoa mixes.. and received this variety .. well My experience with cocoa mixes that tell you to add water is .. you get exactly that watered hot cocoa ... but not theseI made the first one with water as I was out of milk and I have to tell you I do NOT NEED milk.. these are amazing.Then I started to try the various varieties.. and it just got better and better..Land o Lakes where have you been all my life ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Package arrived promptly and exactly as described.. I now have some wonderful cocoa to help me get through the brutal winter months..I will definately be getting more once I make my way throught mix ... will definately be getting more of these and sharing my FIND with my friends and familyThank YOU ! ! !	1
I first stumbled onto Land O'Lakes Cocoa Variety Packs at my local branch of a national warehouse store . As some other reviewers have noted , in retail stores this product is treated as a seasonal item , so by the time the winter holidays have passed , you may not be able to just run out and purchase it . It 's a pity that it sells for so much more online because it is a really delicious hot cocoa.All the included varieties are made with real powdered milk , which makes such a difference in your final cup . There are n't many instant cocoas that can compete with homemade , but this is one that might . The varieties included in your pack do seem somewhat inconsistent , since different sellers claim the same `` 7 Variety Pack '' but have different pictures and item descriptions . ( This one even claims `` 6 different flavors '' in its description while still picturing seven . ) The sampler I had contained Supreme , Arctic White , White Chocolate with Peppermint , Caramel , Raspberry , Dark Chocolate and Vanilla . The other flavors that appear ( either in product descriptions or photos ) are Tiramisu , Graham , Cinnamon and Mint . Generally speaking , all of the mixes are quite good . I found the Dark to be a bit too dark for my tastes , and the Arctic White a bit too sweet ; I solved the problem by mixing the two powders together , half a packet of each per cup , and loved the result.Another nice thing about these Land O'Lakes Cocoa Packs is that the individual pouches are all tin , not just paper , so they stay fresh a long time . In my house , they did n't last a terribly long time regardless , but the last cups were just as creamy and warming as the first ones . I highly recommend trying out the Variety Packs . They 're perfect for large gatherings ( just add hot water ! ) and there really are n't any bad flavors .	1
The chips are good and came on right on time.Every trader Joe 's product I have bought have been good in taste and delivered on time too . I have tried other coconut products and ended up throwing them away . But trader Joe 's I have kept and ate them.I think you will like them too .	1
These are the best ! Nice and crunchy and just a tad sweet . I really like them in my granola or just plain but they could be added to salads or most anything to get that bit of coconut flavor !	1
Very nice company . They accidentally sent me wonderful almond cookies and they let me keep them and sent me the coconut immediately after . I have not eaten it yet because I ordered coconut from a bunch of companies but I am sure it will be wonderful .	1
I always buy these in multiple quantities as they are that good . Whenever I am thinking I would really like to eat something crunchy , I usually decide on either mac nuts , SunBiotics Truffle Almonds , orTrader Joe 's Roasted Coconut Chips - 2 Pack . These are delicious and good for you . Coconut is a very healthy fat and has anti-viral , anti-biotic , etc properties . The ingrediets are coconut , salt , sugar , coconut milk , coconut juice . Amazon , like many online stores , fluctuate prices so make sure you are getting a price you can live with . TJ 's does n't fluctuate the price - they are always $ 1.99/bag .	1
Fresh roasted , and full of crunch with flavor . I love coconut but find it hard in my stomach pouch . This roasted chip has crunch and all the flavor . Very yummy and tasty.My husband , who did not like coconut also loves this roasted coconut . Now if it would just get added for subscribe and save ... ..	1
This is the tastiest snack I 've had in a long time . I love coconut . Having grown up in South America as a kid , I used to love getting a big juicy coconut and chomping on the sweet meat . This brings me back to those days . This is n't the fake shaved coconut used in toppings . This is delicious and pure.For those that do n't live near a Trader Joe 's , I wish you luck on getting the seller to give on the price . For those that do , this is a total ripoff . Stop by the store .	1
Way better than say chips . There are few brands of toasted coconut chips , and these are the only ones I can get without going mail order . The price is just ok .	1
Too bad these chips are so darn expensive ... They taste fabulous ... I could hardly stop eating them . Even my 2 year old grandson loved them ! I 'm going to try make some myself ... Maybe I 'll come back and edit this post when I do ...	1
I am obsessed with these coconut chips . I love coconut products in general ( oil , chips , macaroons , water , milk ) so I am a big fan .	1
Dired Pineapple + Dried Bannana Chips ( Dry Vacuum ) + Coconut ChipsThis is a delectable and mouth-watering journey that takes you south of the equator where these exotic fruits thrive and grow in the jungles of foreign and beautiful lands.TJ 's - kudos to you again for another amazing treasure !	1
It 's good on its own -- but some mornings , I need a JOLT so I fix this and add a shot of espresso . Omigosh , what an engine revver-upper ... .	1
I LOVE THE TASTE OF THIS ESPRESSO , IT IS PERFECT EVERY TIME , THE PODS ARE EXPENSIVE , BUT INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING ONE CUP AT STARBUCKS YOU GET 12 FOR THE PRICE OF ONE ... .	1
I find it pretty amusing that people would spend $ 200 or more for an espresso maker , which Starbucks staff was more than willing to demonstrate and provide samples from , and then slam the pods that they bought from Amazon.The pods work exactly the way they 're supposed to . Does the milk taste like perfectly creamy fresh-from-the-cow-this-morning milk ? Of course not . If you sit at your breakfast table and savor your latte , then yes , it can taste a little watery , although this can largely be prevented by not leaving your cup there for the last final drips . But Starbucks chose a good quality dehydrated milk ( I 'm a backpacker ; I 've drunk plenty of dehydrated milk before ) , so yes , it does taste like actual milk.And the whole point of this machine is that it makes a good latte in about a minute . You do n't have to learn how to froth milk or wait around for the machine to prime . You just push a couple of buttons , and voila ! a latte at home ! The machine is what it is . The milk pods do what the 're supposed to , consistently . I have n't received a bad batch yet.There are other machines for people who want absolutely perfect lattes and are willing to invest the time and effort . Or heck , just go to Starbucks and wait in line every morning.I really like my Verismo , and these milk pods are fine .	1
I like this very much . I only drink decaf , so I was delighted when Starbucks came out with the Verismo . This is a nice , strong cup of espresso with a good layer of crema . I also make a larger cup with this , which is still good . I only wish they would come out with more decaf products .	1
my only complaint is that these are expensive . but i knew that going in to the use of the Verismo . Oredering from Amazon make life much easier : )	1
This Guatemala Antigua espresso MEDIUM pod is my favorite for making lattes . The DARK version is a bit too bitter . When I use this , the milk pod , and the pumpkin spice sauce ( purchased via Starbucks.com ) , it gets closest to the store-bought Pumpkin Spice Latte.Some info on the Verismo system : It was taking me about 20 minutes and $ 4 every morning to go to Starbucks and get my favorite , a no toppings tall pumpkin spice latte ( or a hazelnut macchiato Feb to Aug ) . I 'm very picky , I ca n't drink other lattes besides Starbucks or the really amazing lattes you get in the small but popular Cambridge/Boston shops like Darwin 's Ltd . Therefore I did not hold out much hope for the Verismo , but much to my surprise , it has completely supplanted my brick and mortar neighborhood Starbucks.TASTEI find the espresso to be a very good match for the espresso at Starbucks stores . The milk pods are not . Although they are creamy , they have a side taste . I do n't find it bad , but I know I 'd get sick of that taste in short order were it not disguised by the pumpkin spice sauce that I ordered from starbucks.com . I end up with a tasty , creamy pumpkin spice latte ( I never get toppings so I appreciate it exactly like that ) .PRICEThe Verismo units go on sale here and there , and the current one gives you 6 boxes of pods for free with purchase . As a box of pods is ten dollars and a new Verismo in the store is one fifty , that 's effectively ninety bucks for the unit . Seeing as I was spending $ 4 to $ 8 every day and I 'm now spending $ 2 to $ 4 every day , the unit has paid for itself VERY quickly . And I got back 20+ minutes of my life every morning.If you want to maximize your drink , you can skip lifting the lever to release the pod and hit the espresso or coffee button a second time . Sure , it is a bit watered down , but I was surprised it was n't as significant . We use newer Boston Bean units at our office and with just one run-through , that coffee is way waterier.Other items that you would need to re-create your idea latte or other drink are also available at the online Starbucks store and on Amazon , like their amazing and decadent caramel sauce ( I just ca n't get myself to order it , that stuff is dangerous ! ) . Of my two neighborhood Starbucks , one carries the kind of pods I use regularly , so I get them there sometimes if I need them more quickly than an Amazon order or want to avoid Starbucks.com shipping costs.Try before you buy - almost every Starbucks store I go to has a Verismo there and they will make you a free sample .	1
I no longer work near his original location so I have n't had his soup in more than a decade . I was hesitant to try this variation but it was on sale last night at my local supermarket . I was very happy to find that it tastes EXACTLY the same but without the generous chunks of fresh lobster meat of course . At least , I can have this soup plain or with pasta shells and it will still be better than the other prepared soups out there or I can add raw shrimp to it and make my own version of seafood bisque . Why not ? I 'm not interested in his other flavors but since this is the first time I remember seeing these in the store , I am going to stock up before I find out `` no more soup '' for me .	1
A little tastless , good consistency & packaging , would have liked a little more than 'essence & # 34 ; of Lobster ! I will not buy this again .	1
I tried all 4 flavors and this was my opinion . Listed below by order of my most favorite vs my least favoriteLobster Bisque.- The best of a bad lot . Does n't taste anything like the lobster bisque at his soup stores but better then the other soups . 3 1/2 starsTomato bisque - flavorful sweet taste 2 1/2 starsLentil- good but to me only marginally better then Progresso . I 've had the lentil at his soup store and this did n't taste like it . 2 starsChicken noodle-this was my lease favorite and the only one I would recommend to steer clear of.. Way to salty . better then Campbell 's but then what soup isn't.its ok , but nothing i would buy again . 1 starRecommendation- The Lobster Bisque is the best of 4 not so great soups . In his soup stores , the Lobster Bisque cost twice as much as the other soups , but is 10x as good..The other flavors are worth trying.but to me did not taste anything like they do in his soup stores	1
For the quality , brand and quantity the price was far better than anticipated . I have purchased this gum in bulk from a physical store and with the price and almost 10 % tax rate buying on Amazon has saved me a considerable amount of money .	1
For taste , I give this 5 stars . I only reduced it a star , because of the uncertainty of aspartame . I chew it anyway .	1
Really tasty and long lasting ! I will buy again . Helps with sweet cravings .	1
Its like I say , I love citrus , this gum also allows me to blow bubbles ... .a big plus for me ! ! ! ! ! ! Well I had a warning that I needed to add one more word so here it is . ONE	1
I was happy to find this flavor of trident , it is getting harder to find in the stores . It should last a long time	1
This is my very favorite sugar free bubble gum . Lasts a good while and while it lasts it is so YUMMY . I do find however , that I should n't chew more than three pieces a day due to the artificial sweetner ( too much gives a intestine ache - no kidding here ) .My dentist does n't want me chewing much gum , at all ( dental work ... .you know the drill ) .GREAT tasting gum . Recommended highly . Thank you .	1
This is my favorite trident flavor , I 've been chewing this for years . I will likely choose this seller again in the future .	1
This is the first time that I had this flavor but I really enjoy it and it lasts a good amount of time .	1
You would n't think 3 leafs on a Twinings of London can would mean strong , but it definitely is pretty strong ! A good wake up call too ! Brings you close to Britain if you 're not there . Recommended for anyone who likes tea !	1
winings was founded in London , England in 1706 , and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas . English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka , which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea . Though often served during breakfast , this tea tastes excellent all day long.OK , let 's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea . Harder to over-steep than some of the teas I have known , it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup . Highly conventional in its taste , English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk , which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea . Plus , I must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar , and you 've got the right tea for a hot afternoon ! And that 's my review . If you want an excellent all-round tea , hot or iced , one that goes well with any food , then English Breakfast tea is for you . If you want tea from a great tea producer , them Twinings is for you . I highly recommend Twinings ' English Breakfast tea to all , even those not normally into tea drinking . ( Or , perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking ! )	1
I usual was a tea bag guy but am hook on loose tea now . A great tasting tea every time . I like mine with milk and sugar as mid morning drink .	1
Twinings is a name you can rely on for terrific tea . Starting the day with English Breakfast makes the rest of the day go better !	1
This reminds me a lot of those audio cassette holders I had when I was a teenager- the hard plastic kind that you slid tapes into and stacked up against your wall to show off your music collection . It 's almost as if the person that designed & # 34 ; The Wall & # 34 ; called up the 1980 's and said they wanted the SAME plastic , the same metallic-plastic trim , etc . on this coffee holder.No doubt about it- it 's a sturdy holder . And it holds a ton of K-Cups . And you can sort of drag it all over the counter ( which you have to do because it does n't spin , which would make it ENORMOUS ) without the K Cups falling out.But it looks like a K-Cup holder that you could buy at your local Sam Goody back in 1989- it sort of screams & # 34 ; HEY CHECK OUT MY COFFEE AND A BUNCH OF BLACK PLASTIC ! & # 34 ; But my husband uses it , so that 's all that matters .	1
Before purchasing & # 34 ; The Wall & # 34 ; I just had multiple boxes stacked on my counter . Not bad but not good either . It took up more space than I wanted and was n't very pretty to look at . So , I went looking for a holder but most only hold 24 k-cups ( which is less than a box full ) and are round and/or nearly as wide as the boxes it is meant to replace . Then I found & # 34 ; The Wall & # 34 ; and this holds 50 k-cups is about 1/2 the width of a K-Cup box and the black and silver styling fits well in any setting . I love things that do what they say they will and this does !	1
We just got this yesterday . It 's wonderful ! Looks sharp and classy and holds 50 kcups , which is a lot of storage compared to what else is on the market . Before we got this we had one 27 count kcup carousel which works great , it 's just not enough storage for us as we have numerous kcup flavors . I could n't be happier with this unless it rotated . Still , it gets the job done and looks very nice on the counter while doing it . Love love love . Including the price . : )	1
I love this ! Does n't take up a lot of space , looks nice and holds 50 cups ! The cups do not fall out ! Seems to be made well . Much better than having the kcup boxes all over the counter .	1
Love this ! It is low profile and keeps my k cups organized and at hand . I know what I have and I know when I need to get more ! It 's double sided and easy to load up and care for ! I love being able to see the kinds of coffees I have available !	1
Thin , fits in our small coffee bar space , holds a lot of cups . We are very pleased with this purchase . It looks well-made and it 's easy to fill . Cups stay in . Very happy with this product .	1
This is great for the space that we have to put it in . It might not work for other people but it does for us .	1
Great way to have decaf .	1
I like drinking decaf at night and this is the best I 've come across . The flavor is superb and the roast is perfect . Not too strong and not too weak . Just right and Starbucks ahs the best tasting coffee in k-cups .	1
My wife and I drink decaf coffee most of the day and we have been trying a lot of different flavors . This is an excellent coffee and it was strong and smooth with a bold rich flavor . My wife and I both enjoyed it . This is a medium roast coffee but the flavor was robust.We brewed it on the medium cup size and I used a little cream and sweetener in mine and I liked it a lot and will be buying more . I rated it as a 5 star decaf coffee .	1
I ordered this for my husband and he loves it - he 's even requested I reorder them whenever we need to refill out decaf coffee supply . He said they have an excellent flavor without being too acidic .	1
I love Tully 's Italian or French decafs the best , but I like to have an assortment on hand so I do n't get bored . The price was too good to ignore via Amazon warehouse and enjoying my first cup as I type . Fullbodied , not bitter at all . Very nice aroma .	1
What can I say , only positive reviews for this product . I just can not get enough of it . will be back for more . Thanks	1
I 've searched a long time to find a K cup coffee that is rich and smooth and decaffeinated , and I think the Starbucks Decaf Pike Place Roast fits the bill . The K cups are extremely convenient , and this is a great option when I do n't have the time to grind my own beans and use my ekobrew cups.The price is right here on Amazon , and it 's great to have this delicious coffee delivered right to your door with no extra shipping charge .	1
I like V8 juice and I like lime flavor and I LOVE this ! It 's a great start to a meal or for between meals . It 's good with chips or crackers or popcorn . It 's good by itself . It 's just good !	1
v-8 vegetable juice is absolutely the best there is . full of healthy ingredients . delicious with a hint of lime . shake well before consuming . reasonably priced . resealable container for repeated storage . refrigerate after opening . can be purchased thru subscribe & save for even more savings . bon apetit !	1
I was happy to get V8 Juice through Amazon so reasonably priced.I find I save money shopping on Amazon from the comfort of my home with my Prime Membership.It tasted like Regular V8 juice ( the `` hint '' of lime was non-detectible ) , but it tasted good .	1
I was so happy for this candy , it is so good , if you have never tried Hersheys pot of Gold , you are missing out on some good candy , gave a box of candy to all of my family for valentines day , the price was excellent , thanks	1
I was so enjoying these chocolates , and just like Fez from & # 34 ; That 's 70 's Show , & # 34 ; I was bummed when I finished the top rank , sure there was no more , when I realized the rack lifted out , showing a full rack below , waiting to be devoured . The Pot of Gold is heavenly delicious , and for around $ 5 , it 's a bit high , but worth it . Besides , you pay way more for worse at Valentine 's Day .	1
Good shipper , fast shipment , great chocolates . Good variety of chocolates ... .. worthy of the name , & # 34 ; Pot of Gold & # 34 ; . I will buy it again .	1
Like all of Nutiva 's offerings , this is a high quality product . I have been using coconut sugar for over a year now and we love this stuff at our house . We first tried a bag from a health food store and found we preferred it over all other sweeteners and loved the taste . I ordered Madhava Blonde coconut sugar from Amazon in a six bag quantity and enjoyed it for over a year . We used in everything from coffee to baked goods . As I went to reorder , I had a nasty surprise in the price area . It had really increased in price . I started looking for alternative suppliers and I found this one . I thought , wow , I get Nutiva quality at this price - that was a winner for me . I received my order extremely quickly and in perfect shape . This is a quality product from a quality vendor .	1
i wanted a sugar not basic white so i found this coconut sugar great cookies and all baking . i use in coffee a new taste .	1
Great in coffee and other baking goods . It has a bit of flavor like brown sugar but better ! I love it !	1
I have cut back on using refined sugar , and have found that organic Coconut Sugar from Nutiva helps me greatly to do that . I use it on my organic cut oats cereals , and sprinkle it on buttered toast instead of sugared and corn-syruped jellies and jams . I really do like the re-sealable package of the Nutiva 16oz size . Great for storage .	1
I read that this is not quite as sweet as brown sugar . I however , found it to be just as sweet , and use just a small amount on cereal , or for carmelizing butternut squash , carrots , pumpkin and the like . Very good , and I am pleased with it . No more 'fake ' brown sugar from the store for me . This is a very welcome healthy replacement .	1
Black walnuts are certainly a luxury , but occasionally , like during holidays , these nuts are worth the extra coast . Taste one of these , and then taste a walnut found in most grocery stores , and you will immediately understand how great these are . They will be a holiday addition from now on !	1
I was n't sure about these as I had never seen this brand name before , but it is difficult to find black walnuts this time of year , at least in Oklahoma usually only can find them at Christmas time and I was pleasantly surprised that these were as good as any I have ever purchased , if not better .	1
Black walnuts makes the BEST cookies ever.I have to recipes I only use the black walnuts with it makes those two bake goods taste heavenly .	1
Fantastic walnuts ! They have more omega3 acids than salmon , and are delicious to boot ! Will definitely buy again and recommend them to friends .	1
These taste just like the ones from my dad 's yard . Fresh , meaty , but none of the mess of shocking and picking . The price is awesome . I use them mostly in nut bread and so many people have never had black walnuts . Ca n't findthem in stores i go to , probably could n't afford them there anyway . Yes , , cost more than & # 34 ; regul ar & # 34 ; walnuts , but oh so much better . Taste isstronger , they are meatier and more moist andtender . I 'm on my 4th bag of HAMMONS Black American Walnuts . Hope they keep supplying them here on Amazon .	1
I was worried that nuts ordered on-line might be rancid . With oils that nuts contain , they do n't have a super long shelf life , though walnuts seem to be better than , say , macadamias which go rancid notoriously fast . These came quickly and taste pretty good . Black walnuts have a unique taste which is naturally a little bitter ( in a tasty sort of way ) and for not coming right off the tree these are pretty good . We had a black walnut tree when I was a kid and I still remember picking and eating those . Black walnuts are the only nut in the completely beneficial column of the type B blood & # 34 ; Eat Right for your Blood Type & # 34 ; chart . I found this out recently and realized I had n't had black walnuts in years -- and went looking for them in the regular and health food stores with no success . I was happy to be able to get some with two day Prime shipping and have them be of decent quality .	1
I am the quickly disappearing American Middle Class . Trust me when I say I have had to take and store the horrible , nasty staple white food bank rice distributed throughout the nation . I could write a book about what is wrong with that and why no one should try to eat it , but this is a GOOD RECOMMENDATION for Taste of Bombay Basmati Rice . At first I gaped at the price I paid for this small jar of rice . But after cooking and working with it , I am REDEEMED ! I love rice , but over the years , I 've enjoyed it less and less . Having this lovely fragrant light as air delicate rice from India to eat was a real treat ! Worth every cent I paid ! THANKS !	1
Wonderful rice and easy to prepare . Has a flavour not to be beat . I ran out of it and made regular white rice and what a difference in the taste . This rice is so good it can be eaten alone .	1
Taste good , easy to prepare and I will buy again . I recommend this rice brand and it ' s a great buy .	1
This rice has such a good taste compared to other rices . I will order it again if it is still available .	1
I love rice and am always on the look out for good rice . This rice had excellent reviews.My children love rice pudding , but it has always taken such a long time .

Can be used in sweet or savory dishes . Calls for a rinse and presoak , but comes out perfect and I can eat this without butter , just a bit of olive oil and salt and pepper .	1
This is the perfect savory snack ... with only 30 calories ! Each pack contains 5 delicious olives . Unopened can be stored at room temperature.TASTE : the hint of garlic is very mild , just right.Awesome snack on the go !	1
We need the gluten free balance and taste in our family and these Mario olives give that for the school lunches and snacks at the office . These 1oz bags deliver just enough olives to fill you up without having too many that you ca n't eat . Easy to pack and go , great idea .	1
Liked this product . Was handy to have for snacks . Beware they can be addictive . Would buy more of but for the cost it I can get a bigger jar and divide out myself .	1
I can barely justify these at the subscription price , but I wanted to try 'em & am glad I did -- if you 're looking to snack less & keep it healthier when you do , give these a go .	1
These are extremely delish . Everyone who has tried them that we have shared them with absolutely LOVES them , however , they are just too expensive . If amazon lowers the price we would purchase them way more often , now they are just a speciality item we get on occasion .	1
THESE ARE NOT CHEAP , BUT BOY ARE THEY YUMMY.LOVE THE LITTLE BAGS WHICH ARE NOT FULL OF JUICE . ALMOST ALL OLIVES . THEY ARE PERFECT	1
These snack parks are a terrific way to take a few olives with you for a lunch addition or a quick snack ! These olives are firm and delicious without a lot of juice or bother ! If you like olives you 'll want a packet of these in your pocket or purse and the hint of garlic just adds to a terrific olive snack ! YUMM !	1
This is the best snack , just the right amount of olives in a single package . There are 12 to a pack so I always order more . They are great !	1
These olives are great , we like both the bigger bag and this smaller one 1oz vs 2oz gives a little better amount of olives for the kids lunches . It is just a great snack and with no pits and no juice it is a clean and natural snack for the kids to eat.We have learned you can also spread over salads which gives it a better taste overall as well . Highly recommend .	1
I love olives and when I get into the jar I ca n't stop . These pre measured packs are the perfect size for taking with me for a snack without going overboard . Love the added herbs . I had to make my sister get out of my cupboard and quit taking my olives !	1
Good snack . I did find the bits of Thyme to be a bit annoying texture-wise . The olives were whole and packaged nicely to take with for lunch or when running errands .	1
These are great for packing with a lunch , perfect size for a single serving , even though the package says it serves two . Personally , I do n't eat half a jar at a sitting , so the 10 to 12 olives you get in the package are just right . And the price comes down to about $ 1.10 , if you are a Subscribe and Saver , like I am . Good deal , no waste ! They do n't need to be refrigerated , either .	1
Mario is the king of olives in my mind and these little snack packs are the best way to have a snack of olives during the day at the office without creating desk mess . With no brine and no pits these are a great way to get some fuel in the afternoon without a lot of calories , less than 50 in the entire pack.Great idea and great olives .	1
Black olives with a touch of Thyme - GREAT ! These are delicious ripe olives with just a hint of juice and a great snack pack ! Another excellent addition to a lunch box or a terrific light snack right out of your pocket ! We love 'em !	1
You will be very pleased with the quality of these grits . Absolutely delicious and rich in flavor . I found it best to cook at a slow simmer .	1
These Girts are very good . Very nicely packaged in a fabric bag . U get a delicious tasting Grits & a re-usable bag . I think it is great . Give these a try , I think U will love them .	1
I love these yellow grits for savory dishes . Because they are yellow , seasonings are less likely to discolor them than the white grits . Also , I like how my cheesey grits come out with this better than the white counterpart .	1
Searched high and low for yellow grits without butter in them , grandson has a Milk protein allergy so he cant eat anything from a hooved animal . But he love yellow grits .	1
Slow-cook grits are n't an option here ( I lived 11 years in the deep south and my wife went to University in Alabama ) , so when I needed a choice for quality grits , I went on Amazon , fingers crossed , and hoped I could find what I was looking for.I consider myself a 'foodie ' , have been eating ( slow-cook ) grits for over 25 years , and thus feel I 'm qualified to render an opinion . We 're very happy with the white and the yellow ( though my wife greatly prefers the white ) grits from Palmetto Farms , and look forward to purchasing them for as long as Amazon offers them . Highly recommended .	1
The only way one could improve on Hellman 's mayonnaise is to spend the time to make fresh mayonnaise , and few have the time to do that ! I have no idea what others were complaining about . It is delicious , and has never let me or me family down in over 50 years ! It is the ONLY brand of mayonnaise that has ever been in my refrigerator , or my mother 's !	1
In my opinion , Hellmann 's Mayonnaise has all of the others beat in taste and texture . You ca n't go wrong with this one .	1
Hellman 's is a little sweet , so good to use in some recipes that require a touch of sugar . I bought this large size for when the family is around . Large family .	1
This is a great tasting and great addition to making a really great sandwich , I would n't enjoy eating one without it . I also use it to make chunk white in water tuna and sliced hard boiled eggs , or for egg salad sandwich 's too ... ... ... ..	1
This product is a favorite of mine , so I have no issues with that . The producy arrived quickly , securly packaged , undamaged and fresh . No complaints at all .	1
I started receiving this with the Subscribe and Save program which was very nice ... until they ran out of the product and I had to replace it . S & S program works great ! Once a month , or whenever I request it , my order is sent out in a timely fashion , arrives at my door , well-packaged and without damage . I 'm very pleased with the products on S & S and with the shipping . Thank you for making life easier .	1
Same Hellmann 's that we all know ... ... ... but in bulk and delivered to your door ! FYI - it does still fit in a standard fridge door .	1
I love all of the flavors . This has become a fun treat to for children.In stores I have struggled to find many of these flavors , so it offers a chance to try them all .	1
Had these on a family get together last Sunday - they were a hit ! The grands tried them all ( I have 4 left lol ) and had most had a second glass before they left.Perfect for the children that are not fond of milk - good in lunch boxes and for snacks at school - they can use them in the milk cartons for a change of pace . Getting ready to place an order so I have them over the rest of the holidays .	1
These straws are a great way to put milk in young bodies . My nephew loves then and is always ready for another glass of milk !	1
These straws get my daughter to drink her milk and for that I 'm thankful . Here favorites are the chocolate and Cookies N Cream . Got Milk Magic Straws also contain less calories and sugar than syrups and powders that are often added to make plain milk more kid friendly . I 'm not sure how cost effective they are and how environmentally friendly it is to throw away a plastic straw after every use , but I suppose that is the trade-off . My son LOVES milk and does n't need anything added to it , but the Strawberry and Wild Berry versions corrupted him none-the-less . I guess they are that good . I tried the Neapolitan and really liked it , so for the sake of self control wo n't try any others.Got Milk has a winner product on their hands here . I just wish it was easier to find locally , and that they did n't cost quite so much.~ Kort	1
I always end my day sipping a cold glass of milk through one of these delectable straws . The strawberry is my favorite , but this time around I got some new flavors , so I 'm eager to taste them all : ) These straws are gluten free as well , btw . Enjoy !	1
I like this almond butter , it is great on toast or rice cakes with a bit of raw honey or jam .	1
Buy this barney butter instead of your 2 coffees at starbucks . It is SO good . Eat it with a spoon or an apple or bread . Whole 30 approved ( not with bread obviously ) and excellent .	1
Love the texture ! It does n't separate like other almond butters do . It 's creamier than the Marantha brand , and the color is more like that of peanut butter than that of almond butter .	1
I am the only one in the family who has tried this so it does get eaten more slowly . However , I do like the taste and flavor of it and would probably order again when the first one finally gets eaten .	1
less sugary tasting than peanuts and made in a peanut free facility . This butter is delicious . I eat it on bread like peanut butter with preserves as well as using it in hummus in a pinch when I 'm out of tahini . Great delivery time and not more expensive than almond butter I find in the store that is comparable .	1
This is the smoothest , best tasting Almond Butter I have ever tried . Great substitute for peanut butter . I would n't bother cooking with this one as it is expensive . I cook w Trader Joe 's or others . Now I need to find it around here .	1
Only thing that makes me balk is the price . But spreadable and just yummy . I do n't have the jar in front of me , but as I remember this has palm oil . I was n't sure that 's bad news , but gather all nut butters that are blended have palm oil . I guess okay if sustainably harvested .	1
Smooth , good-tasting and it does n't have to be refrigerated after opening . If they have Cashew Butter , that 's what I 'm buying next !	1
I love that I can buy this almond butter without any cane sugar.It 's delicious and smooth just the way it is without any additions .	1
It has the consistency of smooth peanut butter . I wish it did n't have the palm oil . I did n't miss the sugar .	1
I like this almond butter , I personally like & # 34 ; chunky & # 34 ; butters better but this was my first almond butter try and i love it .	1
This is SO good ! What a tasty product . My only problem with it is how fast I use it up .	1
A fantastic almond butter , so creamy and so rich and so smooth . My husband and 2.5 year old toddler finished it in a few days !	1
I have trouble digesting peanuts for some reason ... But almonds have become my best friend ! Barney butter is my favorite brand of almond butter . The price at Amazon is good , so I have signed up for a monthly shipment . It always disappears at my house , because my husband loves it , too .	1
This almond butter is delicious . I used it up really quickly making paleo pancakes , putting it on apples and bananas , and baking .	1
I am so THRILLED with this product . I am a migrainer and can not eat peanuts or any other nut ; except almonds . BUT they must be blanched . I recently did a search for Almond Butter and found this product ; Almond Butter made with Blanched almonds ( skin free ) and I could not believe my eyes . Well , it came today and let me tell you , I think I have died and gone to Heaven ! It 's THAT good . No salt or sugar added . Incredibly smooth . Delicious ! Thank you so much for making this Barney ! And Thank you SO much , Amazon for offering it . It has changed my life !	1
Barney Butter is the best , especially the bare with no added sugar . You should buy some . You will not regret it , even though its 10 $ .	1
Wow ... everyone should try this terrific almond butter . It is SO good we could eat it by the spoonful . [ We sometimes do ] . I highly recommend this almond butter to everyone .	1
Thought I would try this as a substitute for peanut butter which I eat too much of . It is deliciouson crackers , or as a veggie spread . My family really loved it , and will be needing another supply of this butter .	1
I like this almond butter , I previously bought the creamy one but I like crunchy better . The one jar I received was n't sealed properly so there was oil all over the jar but amazon is shipping me another one . I am always impressed with amazon 's customer service and this is a great product .	1
I simply ca n't say enough good about this almond butter . I will try and keep this brief , but want to say that I can not eat peanut butter due to migraine triggers . I can eat almonds , IF they are skinned , or blanched . Barney Butter Bare Almond Butter uses skinned , or blanched , almonds . BINGO ! I can it it and it 's heavenly . It really is an answer to my prayers . The flavor is absolutely DELICIOUS ! And the texture is phenominal . It 's so creamy with chuncks of skinless , crunchy almonds in it . PLEASE NEVER STOP making this ! Both the crunchy and the creamy Barney Butter Bare Almoond Butter are really OUT OF THIS WORLD ! So happy ! : )	1
This has a great taste to it and usually it is difficult to find crunchy almond butter so it was nice to find it on Amazon .	1
I like these little peanut butter flavored crackers and they make a great snack . I wish I could eat more of them . I divided the crackers up in 2 oz servings and put them in small snack baggies . There are not too many crackers in a bag but sometimes you just have to savor the finer moments .	1
Awesome but addicting little crackers	1
I have enjoyed these for some time . They have a real peanut butter taste . They are great added to a dish of instant pudding , etc .	1
It is just way too salty.American Farmer , please make this product with less salt and more sugar . It is at least twice as salty as it should be . And it has about half as much sugar as it should to really be like kettle corn.This popcorn is n't all bad , though . The popcorn itself ( ignoring the seasoning ) is a very good quality . It is very light , airy , crispy , and has almost no hard kernels in it . Still be careful , of course ! But it is easier on your teeth than other brands . For example , I have eaten the Trader Joe 's Kettle Corn ( pink and cream striped bag ) and found it to be almost nothing except hard kernels that could easily break one of your teeth.If only American Farmer would get the seasoning right on their popcorn , it would be a very good product.I noticed another reviewer say that they thought the American Farmer Kettle Corn was bland . That is odd . Maybe the batches are inconsistent ? My first bag ever was good and I did n't notice the oversalting . So I went to the store and bought four more ( they were on sale ) and every single one of them was horribly salty . None of them had enough sugar , which I could forgive when it was not salty because I told myself it was healthy . But when the popcorn is basically a salt lick , I 'd like an adequate amount of sugar as well ! It really is such a shame that the flavoring is so off with this ! The texture is so great . I did a consumer taste test of white cheddar popcorn for a company that I wo n't mention by name since I now work for them ( paid to taste food -- not as great as you would think ) . Their popcorn was HORRIBLE . The white cheddar seasoned popcorn tasted like dirty socks . I suspect they upped the cheese aroma using a chemical . But worst of all , the popcorn was chewy/hard and full of hard kernels . Every bite I thought I would break a tooth ; basically similar to the Trader Joe 's Kettle Corn texture but maybe worse . Anyway , popcorn texture is probably hard to get right , especially when it has to last in a bag . American Farmer got that part right . Would it really be that hard for them to just stop oversalting their popcorn and add a little more sugar ? Or at least just stop oversalting it ! And , no , I am not a person who does n't like salt on my food . My neighbors are on a low sodium diet and do n't keep it in their house . They keep salt substitute . Every time I eat at their house , I have to add salt to my food . And I am always kicking myself for forgetting to bring some because I have to add so much of their fake salt and I have no idea what I am adding since it looks like salt and tastes like almost nothing.In sum , I LIKE salt , but give me a break American Farmer ! Not THAT much salt .	-1
There is NOT an ingredient list to show exactly what is in this mess ... .BUT I bet its solid artificial sweetner . Very LITTLE chocolate favor , nothing close to caramel either , JUST a ugly tasting sweetness . I made it on several different Keurig settings trying to see if that would help is did NOT . I wasted my money beware here ... .perhaps they should sell a sample size so more and more people are not disappointed .	-1
I had hoped I 'd love these , but the chili flavor is overpowering and I like spicy foods . I ate 3 chips and threw the rest away . I think these would be good in a parmesan flavor , sour cream and onion or something like that .	-1
No , seriously , do NOT eat just one . Power through the whole bag , or else you 'll start to notice the bloody horrendous aftertaste these awful `` chips '' leave in your mouth . I was extremely pleased ( I thought ) to have found a tasty , high-protein snack that I did n't have to dissolve in water . Sadly , I was so , so wrong . I have tried two bags of these Frito-like pea protein products , and each time I have eaten only three or four pieces before the rancid taste took over my mouth . Since I bought an entire case of these based on the reviews alone , I am about as bitter as the product itself .	-1
I received this item as a free add-on with some unrelated item I purchased . Even at the cost of 'cheap as free ' , this stuff is beyond foul and clearly manufactured by trolls in hell . Why ? It tastes like vomit . Not kidding . You would think that a packaged sauce with a fairly short and minimally chemical ingredients list would be tasty- but no , Writing this review makes me queasy from just thinking about the cloying tart , sweet , sour , sauce and rubbery mushroom pieces with aroma of bum wine . Please make this go away .	-1
Amazon has been offering these as an add-on , free shipping with qualifying purchase . Maybe you got a packet . Anyway , I 've seen worse ingredient lists -- this one boasts no artificial flavors -- from major food producers , so I wo n't say this is the worse convenience food out there , but honestly , if you 're gon na bother to make Chicken Marsala ( one of my fave dishes ever ) , just buy the wine , mushrooms , butter , etc and make it fresh . You still have to cook the chicken anyway , right ? This packet ca n't speed up the time chicken cooks , so the only convenience is that you get it in the package . If that 's important to you , well , yeah , go for it . But prepackaged ai n't ever gon na taste as good as fresh .

My first impression of the MatchaDNA product was very good -- -the package looked nice , the reviews on it were good , there was even a `` money back guarantee '' listed . Singular packets of Matcha to make single servings ? Sounds really convenient.The moment I opened the package , I immediately knew something was wrong . The Matcha did not smell like the quality Matcha I 'm used to from Maeda-en , and when I opened a packet ( two , in fact ) I was shocked to discover that the Matcha was not green like on the package or in the description , but a muddy olive green color . My experience has taught me that Matcha of that color is an inferior grade -- -I 've purchased Matcha from Thailand ( Healthyway brand ) and it was of a similar odor and consistency . Consistency is also very important for Matcha to properly dissolve in hot water . This Matcha almost turned into a sludge , whereas higher grade matcha either completely dissolves or becomes gritty if improperly mixed.This product is a far cry from the quality of Maeda-en and I would not recommend it unless you want inferior goods . It 's been proven to me time and time again that with Matcha , you get what you pay for.I will be requesting a refund based on the claim that this product was sold under false advertising pretenses.PS : The reason I gave this product 2 stars rather than 1 is because I have had worse Matcha . The taste is not completely unpalatable , but it is not what was advertised .	-1
I wanted to try kale chips so strongly promoted by cooks and health shows as a healthy alternative to potato chips . Gads ! I guess I 'm too old or my taste buds are living in the past , because I felt as though I was just a little removed from grazing in a field , Ick ! I 'm on to tasting sweet potatoes ...	-1
Note : only one flavor in here , English Breakfast . Different teas are portrayed on the tin . But that is just decoration . Inside it is just one kind . 40 tea bags . Made by Unilever , a gigantic industrial company that also makes soap.I am not sure it is `` good enough '' to use as a gift.I ca n't think of a single person to give it to without feeling embarrassed.I think $ 12 is a rip off price for 40 tea bags of so so regular American tea.The tin is cute but it is not *that* nice .	-1
This is a strange product because the Amazon description states that this is a Lipton Heritage Tea Tin , filled with 40 English Breakfast tea bags . And as a matter of fact , that is what this tin contains . However , mine had a sticker on the bottom specifying English Breakfast tea but when I peeled the sticker off , the print underneath said that the tin contained 'Kericho Estate Tea ' . I have uploaded a picture showing the discrepancy - very much in contrast to what the Amazon product picture shows the bottom of the tin to be.As best as I can figure , this tin was originally used for a different type of tea , and then Lipton ( or : Unilever Food Solutions , as it also says on the bottom ) simply re-purposed the tin for their Lipton English Breakfast tea . Not sure that I really like that ... I just imagined giving this as a gift and then the recipient peels off the sticker and finds out that the tin was actually to contain a different type tea - not cool . It looks a bit like a cheap closeout deal , to be honest.As to the taste : It is Lipton tea in individually wrapped tea bags , nothing special . No particular flavor , a typical , bland hotel breakfast bar tea and definitely nothing to make a tea lover 's day.I do like the nice quality and tightly closing tin regardless of what it says on the bottom , but I would not order this again .	-1
I was attracted to this item mostly because of the cool tin , which can be used for storage after the tea bags are used up . The tea itself is fairly ordinary -- not bad ... just undistinguished Lipton English Breakfast tea . My wife keeps a variety of teas in the house , so I thought she would be happy to add this one . However , she was disappointed by the routine flavor . She said there a lot of other types she prefers.I drink tea rarely -- I 'm a coffee guy -- so I am far from a connoisseur and defer to my wife in evaluating this product . Like many foods , tea has its fans who know what they like . I tasted a cup of this tea myself , and thought it was fine , but I do n't have a wide basis for comparison.In any case , the tin makes something mundane seem much more interesting . It makes a nice gift , though folks who enjoy tea might find the taste of this one kind of bland .	-1
We did not like these at all . The chocolate was waxy and the espresso beans were not flavorful . I ended up tossing them . I have had other chocolate espresso bean brands and they were delicious . Try another brand .	-1
The flavor of the chocolate and beans is very good , but once the smooth , delicious chocolate has melted and been swallowed , you 're left with a gritty residue that does not dissolve after the bean is chewed and swallowed . It 's annoying to have to vigorously rinse your mouth out or brush your teeth every time you eat a handful . Yummy , but not worth the trouble .	-1
Absolutely no coffe taste at all.Just do make out that its chocolate.Sorry Product.There are more choices on Amazon that are much better .	-1
... is horrendous without tons of cream and sugar . If you like black coffee ( read : quality ) then do n't bother . Move along .	-1
Nope . Never . Do n't do it . Not even close ! ! ! ! ! Nutella is very good , this is a major fail . : ( : ( : (	-1
The ingredients and the flavor are too artificial . To me , this tastes more artificial than Minute Maid lemonade , which , I think , tastes like soap.Additonally , the liquid does not come out from the bottle in drops contrary to its Dasani DROPS name . When I simply turn the bottle over , nothing comes out , but , when I squeeze it , it squirts a stream of liquid . It is hard to measure if you want consistent flavoring .	-1
I was really excited about this product , but once I tried it , yuck ! I did n't like the taste at all . I gradually added it to a bottle of water until I got the sweetness I desired , but it was too tart . I tried again , and when the tartness was n't too much , the sweetness was lacking.. tasted too watered down . I like Crystal Light much better than this product ( it has the best sweetness / tartness balance ) . Will be throwing this stuff away : ( Very disappointed !	-1
Desani Pink Lemonade Drops may be & # 8220 ; Naturally Flavored With Other Natural Flavors & # 8221 ; , what ever that means , but it is definitely not naturally sweetened . Dasani uses Sucralose or & # 8220 ; Splenda & # 8221 ; to sweeten this product , which leaves an aftertaste that stays with you for hours after consuming the flavored water . It also contains several other chemical preservatives as listed in the product photo - Acesulfame Potassium , Sucrose Acetate Isobutyrate , Medium Chain Triglycerides , Potassium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate ( to protect taste ) as well as artificial coloring , so this product may not be appropriate for health conscious individuals.The flavor isn & # 8217 ; t bad , I guess it is similar to Country Time or Crystal Light , and you can vary the strength based on the amount you squirt into the water . I really don & # 8217 ; t mind the taste of the product ; just the lingering aftertaste that lasts for hours after the water is consumed . I think I will pass on Desani Drops .	-1
Dasani Squirt does n't sound as good does it ? It does n't drop , it squirts . I often make homemade lemonade from my parents ' home grown lemons and know that there is plenty of sugar in each batch . I was excited at the thought of having a little lemonade flavor in my water with 0 calories but I kept squirting thinking it would get better but never did ! It never really tasted like lemonade but definitely had a lingering artificial sweetener taste in my mouth . With that being said , if you are used to squirting flavors into your drink then you may like this . But for me , I 'd rather have a glass of water or homemade lemonade . I 'll skip this stuff .	-1
This would probably be okay for some ( my son likes it ) but it does n't float my boat . It has a strange aftertaste that I ca n't abide . I am used to artificial sweeteners so am used to some lingering taste , but this is really unpleasant . I threw it away as I just could n't drink it .	-1
I 'll be upfront and admit that I dislike artificial sweeteners and avoid them whenever possible.Dasani Drops has not changed that attitude.This does not taste anything like lemonade , it has a tartness to it but it 's not lemony by any stretch of the imagination . Whatever else it is flavored with is overpowered by the artificial sweeteners Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium ( the chemical names of Splenda and Sweet One ) . The aftertaste is strong and lingers well over an hour . If you 're used to that taste , you may not mind it , but I find it unpleasant .I would have liked to have had some guideline as to how much to use . Saying & # 34 ; add to taste & # 34 ; is n't helpful . Trying a squirt at a time ( no drops despite the name ) , tasting and repeating is a drag , you may find a decent concentration by the end of the glass , but you ca n't replicate it . I want a drink , not a science experiment.I suppose if you can tolerate the artificial sweetener aftertaste and have water that 's foul tasting , I could hesitantly recommend Dasani Drops , but otherwise , I suggest giving this a pass .	-1
I 've been looking for a pink lemonade water enhancer to replace another sugar free brand that 's no longer available . Dasani 's version is barely tolerable that I 'll give it to someone else to try . Granted , I 'm picky about sugar-free enhancers , but this does n't even stir up thoughts of pink lemonade . And it 's true what everyone is reporting : This squirts flavoring into your drink . They 're not drops . I can understand what Dasani was thinking , but it 's still misleading. & # 8203 ; I hope you found this review helpful and show it with a quick click of yes . If you have unanswered questions , please comment so I can update the review with answers to your questions. & # 8203 ; & # 8203 ;	-1
I was immediately put off by the odor of this fluid . The smell has a hint of grapefruit smell to it ; but it also has an off-putting chemical nature to it . I found myself wondering . & # 34 ; Do I want to drinkthis stuff & # 34 ; I decided to because I had agreed to review it ; and I was sure it would n't do any harm.The instructions say & # 8531 ; of tsp . to and eight ounce glass of water . I followed instructions and gotwhat I found to be an unsatisfactory imitation of a glass of pink lemonade ; that had an after tastethat was n't something I wanted . Pink lemonade is thirst quenching refreshing drink . I did n't findthe Dasani Drops to be either of those things .	-1
I have had other low-cal pink lemonades that I like very much , so I was looking forward to the convenience of this product . It is easy to use & dissolves quickly , but the taste is just not very good initially , plus , it leaves an after taste .	-1
Let me start by saying I love a good sweet/sour tasting lemonade on a hot day , but this product does not make it sweet nor sour.I assume to squeeze flavor into such a small bottle , and to appease traditional water drinking people who are conscience of their calorie intake , the designers of this product decided to use Sucralose . If you do not mind the flavor of sucralose , maybe this product is meant for you , but I personally dislike artificial sweeteners and this product added to a bottle of water makes it taste just like Sucralose in pure form.Even at high concentrations of x3 or x4 times as much as recommended , I could not get the sour taste of lemonade to come out.I personally would stay away from it .	-1
My wife is diabetic , so we do a lot of these low-sugar or sugar free flavor enhancers with water rather than soda or juice . Having tried them from a pretty big range of brands & # 8211 ; Lipton , Crystal Light , Mio and so on - I can say that Dasani 's is probably my least favorite on the flavor front.The pink lemonade flavor definitely has much more of a noticeably & # 8220 ; artificial & # 8221 ; taste than the other brands , and it has a slight sour and bitter aftertaste . If you really dig pink lemonade this may be worth trying , but honestly there are much better options out there for jazzing up a glass of water or taking a water bottle on the go .	-1
These things seem easy enough . Put some coffee in them , and brew to your hearts ' content . Save money , make your own coffee , sing happy songs.Except these did n't produce a single cup of drinkable coffee . I 'm not sure if they 're defective or I am , but the first batch was a dark , flavorless water . Close to coffee , but without the flavor . The second batch did n't do anything different . One of the batched had a few grounds of coffee in it . I have a Mr. Coffee K-Cup brewer , but K-Cups are standard so it should n't matter the brand.At any rate , these are a great idea but did n't work for me . It 's difficult to say they 're defective because they 're so simple ... but it 's more difficult to rate them even average if , even after the 6th and 7th failed attempt , I still was without a single cup of coffee.The Newman 's Own and Starbucks K-Cups ( single use ) still work fine , so if you were worried about how I was going to get coffee , you can relax now .	-1
I LOVE my Keurig -- got it at Christmas , and use it daily.I DO N'T love tossing out dozens of those little plastic cups , so I try to use reusable ones whenever I can . I 've been using the ekobrew cupsEkobrew Cup , Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewer , Brown 2-countsince I first started using my Keurig , and I 've been quite happy with the result . They 're still going strong , clean up easily , etc.So , when offered the opportunity to try these Melitta E-Filter Reusable K-Cups , I figured I give them a shot.Actually , I gave them 10 shots . The score : 0 for 10 . I NEVER got a decent cup of coffee from them . In every case , the coffee came out weak , more like coffee-flavored tea.A little background : I like my coffee `` robust , '' but not so strong that it practically walks out the door by itself . I use the `` middle '' ( 7.25 oz ) brew size on my Keurig Platinum , and it consistantly produces good results for me no matter what coffee I use . I grind my beans just a bit finer than if I were using a traditional `` drip '' system and I get a great cup of coffee.For my trial run with the Melitta E-Filter cups , I used the same coffee I 've been using with the ekobrew cups , same grind , etc . My first attempt , I just spooned the coffee into the Melitta cup per instructions , just up to the lip , snapped the lid shut and dropped it into the Keurig on the same setting I use every day.Out came -- well , it was n't coffee , that 's for sure . Pale , caramel-colored water . OK , so maybe I did n't put enough coffee into the cup.Second try : spooned in the coffee and packed it as I added it , up to the lip , snapped the lid shut , and dropped it into the machine . Out came -- slightly better , but still not even close to `` real '' coffee.OK , so maybe the brew setting needs to be adjusted . Dropped it down to the `` small cup '' setting ( 5.25 oz ) . Filled another Melitta cup , into the Keurig , and ... nada . Still nothing like decent coffee.Tried several other coffees , tried it with the extra-small cup setting , still no luck . After 10 tries , I gave up.I really wanted to like these ; they 're less expensive than the ekobrew cups ( which I know will need to be replaced eventually , but after 5 months of use , still show no signs of wear ) , etc . But if they ca n't produce a drinkable cup of coffee , what 's the point ?	-1
I have the Keurig single couple . The itty bitty tiny one that you can have on your desk at work . I was SO hoping that the Melitta filters would work with my Keurig but unfortunately it did n't . I know in the description , it said that the filters would work with MOST Keurigs . I was so hoping it would work with mine . It was too big and I could n't close the lid in order for my coffee to brew . Oh well . I gave them to my dad and they work perfectly with his .	-1
I suppose taste is truly an individual thing so please do take my review with a grain of salt . I 've had a lot of energy bars , and very few have tasted GOOD to me . My favorites are Lara Bars and my latest discovery , Balance Bar which I Just reviewed because it tastes AMAZING : http : //www.amazon.com/review/R1GTSIOJ26LFWD/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permBut I could not stomach this . I love peanut butter - ANY kind of peanut butter - and I love dark chocolate . The consistency was good but the taste was just awful , sorry . I ca n't give it more than 1 star . Oh and it 's not exactly a cheap bar , so it 's my honest opinion . Sorry - wo n't be eating this one again even if I 'm starving ( as I was when I got it at the airport at 11pm at night . Sigh ) . I hope this helps .	-1
Gringo Bandito Hot Sauce , 5 Ounce Bottle ( Pack of 4 ) Gringo Bandito sauce is a habanero based sauce with good complexity- a lot going on there . It is quite spicy butI am sensitive to spicy foods . I think it has a bite to it but I did n't find it too pleasant.There are smoky overtones and would compliant umami ( savory ) dishes namely beefy tomato dishes and not muchelse or I would n't enjoy the dish very much.We usually have four or five bottles of hot sauce going at one time and I have to say this is the middle of the road for me.Not my favorite by far but not my least liked flavor . I prefer more of a sweet edge to my sauces . I do like the thickness of the Bandito sauce .	-1
I love spicy foods and this Hot Sauce has the perfect hotness to it but I did n't care for the flavor of it . I found it to taste a bit like a Spicy , Sweet BBQ Sauce . I was hoping for a nice Buffalo type Sauce but this did n't seem anything like that to me . I 'm not big on BBQ Sauce and something in this made me think of that . It was weird too that there was something Sweet tasting about it.I see that most people really like this sauce but it 's not something that I 'd recommend .	-1
I will never , ever buy these from Amazon again . I do n't care what the expiration date is . I do n't know what happened in Amazon 's warehouse . I only know with each bite of these granola bars I found myself hoping to God I would not break my teeth , I kid you not . I 've eaten these before and have never had this problem . Every bar from every package was like this . I would suggest not buying these from Amazon . Especially if you have to pay the shipping to return these when the product is gross and disgusting as this was.I am a huge Amazon fan , so you know these were really terrible to give such a bad review . Unless you 've got great insurance for or a lot of money for dental work , pass on these and go for something chewy .	-1
Something is not right with this juice . Every time that I drink it I get quite an upset stomach . This is the third time that I order Ceres juices and the same has happened with the pomegranate as well as the pear mix . Ceres has been found in the past , as far back as 2005 , to contain high levels of yeast . In 2005 students at a Park Forest , Illinois , middle school were sickened by the juice with the same symptoms that I experience every time that I drink it . High levels of yeast point to an unclean processing environment and perhaps even an inadequate juice pasteurization process . I microwaved a glass for 15 seconds and I did not experience any ill effects . However , when drinking it without microwaving , it turns my stomach upside down .	-1
I love chocolate and really love Scharffen 's chocolate . However , this bar has citrus fruit flavors and pineapple , hints of vanilla , pear , spice and bananas . The after taste just kills the flavor and fun of this product . Ca n't recommend this particular chocolate bar . As a further test , my wife , who adores chocolate and my daughter who ca n't get enough dark , dark chocolate agreed with me stating that they did not like it at all . As a testament to my above thoughts , the second half of the bar is still un-eaten on the kitchen table with a house of chocolaholics .	-1
I was interested in trying a high-cacao chocolate bar because I 'm low-carbing , and many low-carbers swear that it 's a great way to get their chocolate fix without getting too many carbs . Though I prefer milk chocolate , I generally enjoy dark chocolate , too , so I figured I 'd be okay with a 78 % bar.But I really was n't . Is it this bar in particular , or would I not like ANY high-cacao bar ? I 'm not sure , so take my observations with that in mind.First of all , I did n't find the texture to be smooth . The bar did n't melt readily in my mouth , and once it did , it felt dry and almost powdery.I do n't know how this chocolate comes to have `` fruit notes , '' but it does to an unpleasant degree . I first noticed the banana , which was okay , and then I noticed the pineapple , which I really did n't like . It just was n't a good combination.I let my son and daughter taste the bar . My son took a small bite and said he immediately tasted the fruitiness of it , but he did n't like it and gave me back his unfinished portion . My daughter liked it a lot more , though . She said she 'd give it four stars.But I just was n't impressed . I was n't happy with the way it was packaged ( wrapper did not seem very secure ) . And I REALLY do n't like the way it is scored . Rather than being in blocks , the two halves are lightly scored with two big X 's . But because there is a scoring all the way around the perimeter of the bar , it is difficult to break even on the X 's . When I tried , it broke into a random chunk . This would n't be a good bar to keep around for a little `` square '' every now and then . You 'd have to take a knife to it to get even , clean pieces.If you love `` gourmet , '' high-cacao chocolates ( especially those with fruit notes ) , I 'm guessing by all the positive reviews that this would be a bar you should try . But I personally just did n't like it , and even though I 'm quite a chocolate hound , I have no interest in eating any more of this bar.Nutrition information : Half a bar has 220 calories , 19g fat , 17g carbs , 5g fiber , 10g sugar , and 5g protein .	-1
Maybe I 'm just too used to Americanized sweet milk chocolate , but this was way too bitter for me . It 's 78 % cacao which runs up the bitterness factor a bit too much for my personal tastes . I got the fruit notes and it does have a very complex , interesting taste . But no one in my house could eat it .	-1
I guess I do n't have a sophisticated chocolate palate because I did not enjoy this very `` gourmet '' chocolate at all . For my taste it was too bitter and I did n't enjoy the citrus `` notes '' either ! However , `` gourmet '' chocolate lovers might enjoy it .	-1
I knew when I got this chocolate bar that Scharffen Berger is supposed to be making some of the best there is . I did n't care too much for it so I felt like I must be unsophisticated until I saw a number of others felt the same way . The choclste was hard and did not melt too easy in your mouth and there were too many fruity flavors going on in there . I 'm sure Scharffen Berger knows their stuff , but I will stick with Hershey nuggets for my coco fix .	-1
I love dark chocolate but my experiences have been limited to the more popular American brands with the occasional holiday treat of a foreign variety . I 'm not a chocoholic or a very discerning chocolate lover . That may disqualify to judge something as complex as the Scharffen Berger brand , but still , I know what I like and I do n't particularly like this.For lovers of chocolate who are n't choco-rubes like me , this may be a heavenly experience , but for me it was overly bitter and had a flavor overload on the back end that did n't work for me at all . Take my advice for what it is - my favorite candy bar is Milky Way Dark . Probably understandable that I did n't care for this luxury chocolate .	-1
What is the big deal about putting some decent coffee in these discs ? I have n't had one good cup of black coffee from this Tassimo machine , starting from the first time I used it . I spent about $ 100 trying to find a good coffee for it , that can stand on it 's own , without the aide of sugar . This one tastes bitter like the smell of wet cigarettes in an ashtray . That pretty much sums up how they all taste . Their nasty flavor has to be camouflaged , into a meld of sugar , spices , and milk , before it can be enjoyed . I gave it one star because they would n't let me give it a zero . The only good thing I can say about it , is that it has a very nice aroma .	-1
A little bit weak for my tastes , but would probably be good for people that do n't want a strong cofee .	-1
Our black glass cooktop is about 15 years old , and we really like to cook . So it really gets dirty with cooked on stubborn spots . This needs serious cleaning , and the Scotch Brite product just is n't meant for that kind of use . It 's fine for finger marks and light cleaning . It 's not useful to me .	-1
I use my stove top a lot and I try to clean it after every two or three uses ( if no spillage has occured of course ) ... I was really excited about this product because it never fails that even with light cooking , I seem to have the `` burnt around the edge '' stuff happening with my burners . I have used pretty good products in the past that with some scrubbing and hassle can get it clean , but this product was promising to clean without scrubbing . THINK AGAIN ! While the concept and thought process was good behind this product , the delivery is bad . It did n't clean well , and there is not a `` streak-free '' shine - had to use multiple paper towels and buff out the remainder of cleaner from the pads , and even then , there was a film - not impressed . Will continue doing it the hard way cause at least that gets my stove top clean !	-1
I was looking forward to getting this in hopes it would do the job I hate , cleaning my glass top stoves burner area . It did n't clean any of the outside edges where it gets burned on the most . The handle was easy to hold and made it quick to put pressure to scrub but it just did not clean it . The removable pads just stick onto the velcro bottom of the cleaners handle . I can clean it better and easier with a wet paper towel , bounty of course , and the creme `` WHINK '' brand cleaner I bought online here a long time ago . I wo n't bother using this again because it 's a waste of time and effort ... .I get the feeling , after reading other reviews , that those that gave it a high rating must not ever cook on their stove tops or just did n't really try it at all . I even bought all new pans when I first got the stove so nothing would be on the bottoms of them from previous cooking and this stupid stove still makes scorch marks and burn marks , especially around the outside of the biggest burners area . That 's the part that is the hardest to clean and this did nothing for it at all . There is just no way , if they really used this , or their stove , that anyone should say this cleaned their stove because the only thing it can clean is where you do n't have burners or do n't use it .	-1
When I found out I had this product coming I let our stove-top go for a couple of week and made sure we fried several meals on the stove so I could give the Scotch-Brite Cook Top Cleaner a good workout.My previous soft cleanser required me to scrape the stove-top with a blade-scraper to remove heavy build-up and debris . I did not do this with the Scotch-Brite Cook Top Cleaner simply putting the pad on the scrubbing handle and going to work.The Scotch-Brite Cook Top Cleaner actually did a good a good job of picking up the build-up . Getting the residue that burns onto the edge of the cooking rings was another story . I went over the main burner that we use numerous times , twice scrubbing extremely hard . The burned on mess was unaffected . I had to break out my blade-scraper and clean around three of the burners . Better than having to scrape the entire top but still not what I 'd hoped for.They claim this `` Leaves a brilliant streak-free shine . '' It does n't . The first time I used it I buffed the stove-top four times with four pads of paper towels , twice with a clean towel and again with another bunch of paper towels . There was still a visible streaky haze on the glass stove-top.I used the Scotch-Brite Cook Top Cleaner a second and third time in the past week and while it was easier to buff off the haze as I did n't have to scrub as hard and put down as much cleaner as I did the first time I have not yet gotten a brilliant streak-free shine . I 've gotten a clean stove-top but that 's about all.This really is n't that impressive as cleaning products go . I 'm going back to blade scraping the stove-top and cleaning with liquid cleanser . I get a much better shine cleaning it that way.I 've uploaded two sets of before and after pictures for this product .	-1
I use a lot of Scotch Brite products , particularly when I need to scour some tough areas in the kitchen . So I literally leapt at the chance to try this Cook Top Cleaner . I do n't know about you , but we make the stovetop an absolute disaster with great frequency . I try soaking areas of stuck-on grime and grease and then scour them with powerful cleanser and abrasive pads ( even when I know I should n't ) . There 's a lot of work that goes into doing things right ! Despite my excitement over something that had the potential to make my life easier , I was instead disappointed by this product . Why ? It does n't address tough cleaning problems , instead it just sort of wipes things down . Oh look , there 's a smudge . Get the Cook Top Cleaner ! Please ! Truthfully , I really did n't need to obtain a new product just to do that ! I 've been surviving for years just using a rag ! In addition , the pads are pre-loaded with cleaner which leaves a residue everywhere so I 'm still wiping the stove down with a rag . Big fail.The product comes with a small plastic handle and four packs of six refill pads ( 24 total ) . The pads attach to the handle much like a Swiffer product and you 're ready to go . It 's certainly easy enough , but I ca n't imagine someone going to the added expense of bringing this into the home.Here 's the promise : This says it Scrubs , Cleans and Polishes Glass and Ceramic Cook Tops.Here 's how I see it : Scrubbing : 1 StarCleaning : 2 StarsPolishing : 3 StarsMaybe I 'm being unnecessarily harsh , I probably am . I just see this entire product to be completely unnecessary . I 'll use up what I have , but would never consider buying refills ! KGHarris , 8/13 .	-1
I expected to review this product more favorably since I generally liked Scotch-Brite 's stainless steel appliance cleaner . Like that product , this one comes with a handle and then small pouches of cleaning pads . Apply a pad to the handle and start cleaning . This product does a decent job cleaning off grime , but unfortunately it also leaves behind so much of its cleaning solution that there is a highly visible film once the cook top has dried . Just for kicks I also tried using this product on my bathroom mirror , and that was a total disaster . It took a lot more Windex and paper towels to clean the residue off the mirror than it would have to simply clean the mirror in the first place . Back to the cook top , it also took several wet paper towels to finally get all of the residue removed .	-1
I was really looking forward to the Scotch Bright Cooktop Cleaner . I love anything that can make cleaning easier . The idea behind the product is good , but the problem is in the cleaner itself . It left my cooktop a hazy streaky mess . It was worse than using plain dish detergent . It did n't cut through grease and the film that was left behind made it necessary to clean it again in order to get the shine back . I tried just buffing it with paper towels , but that did n't work . I tried using the cleaner in different conditions like when there were different food splatters or just grease without any change . The product is way more hassle than it is worth . I would n't recommend it .	-1
I was excited to try the Scotch-Brite Cook Top Cleaner . However , it soon became clear that this product is not up to par with most Scotch-Brite products . The surface is not gritty enough to really clean and required a fair amount of elbow grease to clean the cooktop . Also , a white film was left over that I had to wipe off using another cleaner . So , it not only did n't clean well , but it required me to clean the cooktop twice ! Definitely do not recommend this product .	-1
When I received the Scotch-Brite Cooktop Cleaner , I was excited to try a new ( to me ) product . I thought the cleaning tool/handle was ingenious . I figured it would allow me to put more force behind my scrubbing to get up the cooked-on stains and would keep my hands cleaner than what I was using ( CeramBryte ) . Well , it did keep my hands cleaner ... but that 's about where the benefits ended . This review compares the two stovetop cleaners.Cerama Bryte Cooktop Cleaner 18 Oz.was recommended to me by the builder when I bought my new home almost 6 years ago , which came with a glass-top stove . I bought the starter kit which comes with a reuseable scraper , the reusable scrubber and a small bottle of CeramaBryte at my local Lowe'sCerama Bryte 27068 Cooktop Cleaning Kit . I found it a super product and have been using it ever since . I am tough on my stove and CeramBryte gets up 99 % of anything that 's ever gotten burned on . For the toughest stains , I rub the Cerama Bryte in with the scrubber and let it dry , then scrub it off . Amazing ! If you have ever used the product SoftScrub , Cerama Bryte smells and looks very much like that . The smell does not bother me , and I am very fragrance sensitive . The starter kit is under $ 9 here on Amazon and the 18-oz . bottle I bought when the kit 's 10-oz . bottle ran out is under $ 6 . A pack of 10 reusable scrubber pads is under $ 7 . Cerama Bryte is biodegradable , is not tested on animals and contains no phosphates . The only ingredient listed on the bottle is Citric Acid , which the bottle notes is an eye irritant if you get it in your eye.In contrast , the Scotch-Brite Cooktop Cleaner kit comes with the reusable handle and four packs of six disposable ( one-time use ) cleaning pads . The kit costs almost $ 15 . A pack of 6 disposable ( one-time use ) refill pads is under $ 4 . The concept is much like the Swiffer . The handle is reusable but you only get one use out of each pad . The smell of the cleaner on the disposable pads is , to me , more caustic , though there is a lemon scent to the chemicals . I found the odor of the pads less bothersome in the package of multiple pads , oddly , than while I was using one pad to scrub the stove . While using the pad to clean the stove , the smell reminded me of oven cleaner , which I find a very caustic smell . The back of the package containing the pads says to wash hands after use and that they can also cause eye irritation . They contain calcium carbonate and isopropyl alcohol . It says to refer to Material Safety Data Sheet 22-4589-2 for more information . There was nothing on the packaging about whether it was biodegradable , was tested on animals or contained phosphates.As for the efficacy of the cleaner , it did n't take off any of the cooked-on greasy stains on my stovetop ( the rings around the outer edge of the burners ) . It took off some of the surface food splatters but otherwise did n't seem to do much at all . The packaging suggests that after cleaning you just use a cloth or paper towel to buff to a shine , but I did n't feel that was enough to get the chemicals off my stovetop , so I used Windex and a paper towel to wipe off the cleaner.If the Scotch-Brite Cooktop Cleaner worked better than Cerama Bryte , I might be willing to overlook the smell , but it does not even come close . As a result , would not purchase refills for this product.Based on comparison with my current stovetop cleaning product , I can not recommend this product .	-1
I cook a lot , I 'm pretty messy , and I hate cleaning . Theoretically , that should make this product perfect for me . But I was underwhelmed . It did n't work any better than my usual green scrubber and soap combo . In fact , after a few minutes , I gave up and went back to that . And `` streak-free shine '' ? HAHAHAHAHA . It left a dull film on my stove that I had to buff out with a paper towel and some muscles.Also note that the Vine reviewers ( myself included ) got several packs of free pads -- it does n't look to me like this $ 14 version contains any cleaning pads at all . To get that , you have to buy the starter pack for $ 20 . You can get a pack of 40 reusable green scrubbers for less money .	-1
This set did a mediocre job . It was great at polishing and got a good shine on the glass top but it did n't actually clean anything off of it . I had to use my straight razor as usually to carefully get the spots from cooked on drippings and wash it with a hot soapy cloth . Then I used another one of these scotch brite clothes to go over it again and it made it shine and look brand new and polished . Probably could have been done just the same with a little vinegar on a cloth . Personally , I would n't spend the money on this as there was no added benefit since I needed my old methods to actually make the stovetop clean before polishing it up . Save the money and use Vinegar to shine it up .	-1
Thinking 100 % Kona coffee would be a full flavored body coffee , this is too weak for my taste . Everyone has different taste and expectations , but as a coffee lover , I want the real full taste of coffee drinking black , no sugar , w/o bitterness . For me this is too watery	-1
I 'm a huge fan of Kona ever since our first morning in Maui . Had high hopes for this , but found it to have an off flavor and way too light . Maybe a good choice for others - was still a decent cup of joe , but just not for me .	-1
I normally but organic extra virgin coconut oil , i decide to try this in my deep fryer to avoid using soybean oil . What I got was some strange yellow , like banana yellow oil . I have 4 gallons of these , they are all like this , not white ! ! ! I also notice it takes a while to melt , like if it was hydrogenated ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! What I mean , is that it melts like if it had jello in it , it really holds its shape , shortening and extra virgin coconut oils have always melted like a candle , just turns to liquid , this does not . It melts like some cheap lard I bought , that I did n't realize it was hydrogenated . It is tasteless and odorless , but not colorless . And please do n't tell me I have the yellow butter flavor , I have the exact same one from here , verified purchase ! It even says white on the bottle , but its yellow . I guess its the chemical extraction methods they use . I had hoped it was some cheap grade of coconut oil that used heat extraction methods . Like the super cheapo coconut oil they sell at wally 's world , its white with a slight hint of coconut .	-1
These did not have the flavor I was hoping they would have . More bland than a cheesy flavor . Will not buy this brand again .	-1
I think I just got these spur of the moment as an add-on . No cheese flavor , not crunchy - kinda crumbly , biscuity texture .	-1
Unless you like the taste of cardboard I would not recommend these . Packing peanuts taste better than these and they are too small to even use with dips .	-1
Bob 's Red Mill makes a very good Muesli ... and I have enjoyed it so much however THIS gluten free option is so bland I do n't even know what to do with all the packs I bought . It 's not bad , but if you have tried the one that 's not gluten free , this one will taste sooo bland ! !	-1
The base tastes like essentially raw rolled oats . I ca n't seem to come up with anything to add to it to make it taste decent . On the plus side , I could use the word unadulterated to describe it ; if what you 're looking for is something raw and unprepared , then make this is what you want . I do n't like it .	-1
I find that all of the Knorr Rice Sides products are easy to prepare , cook nicely and have a good texture for a microwave rice meal . However , I would rate this Thai Curry variety as a lame duck when it comes to taste when compared to the rest of the line . The balance of sweetness and spice was a bit off . We could n't finish off this bag .	-1
Knorr Rice Sides , Thai Curry alas just is n't my favorite . I 'm a huge fan of authentic Thai Food and this meal barely scratched the surface of the Thai flavors I love . There is a recipe on the back of the pack that would likely kick the flavor up a bit but we only tried the rice side as is . We like that this product contains no artificial colors or flavors and that it 's quick to cook in only 7 minutes time . I would n't recommend it if you are looking for more authentic tasting Thai food and a kick of curry flavor .	-1
My family and I love Thai food . I was very curious about trying out this product . And now I am no longer curious and no longer interested in it unfortunately . In all honesty it does not taste bad , but if I never saw the bag it came out of , I would never guess it was supposed to be a Thai Curry flavor . I mean , looking at the ingredients , the only resemblance to Thai Curry is coconut solids ( ? ) , turmeric and soy sauce , and I suppose the garlic also . What about some ginger , lemongrass , lime , fish sauce , chili spice ? And imagine if it had been made using jasmine rice , yum.For the people new to Thai flavors , this product will be very misleading . It in no way resembles anything you would get at a respectable Thai restaurant , so please do not judge Thai food from this rice mixture . I suppose you could spice it up yourself , but you might as well make it from scratch , using jasmine rice to start with.This is a fail for Knorr , but if they had named it something else , maybe it would work as it does n't have a bad taste to it . And mine did not come out mushy , mushy rice is often the result of how it was made , so ca n't blame Knorr if that happens to you .	-1
Any resemblance between this side dish and Thai food is purely coincidental . If you 're going into this hoping for something that actually tastes like a Thai curry you will undoubtedly be disappointed . What this tastes like is a spicy rice side dish . I feel like flavor was sacrificed for generic spice , and that 's what 's left- rice and spice . If you like spicy rice it 's not terrible . I can deal with heat in a dish if it has a nice flavor , but I felt like this had no flavor other than spice . It does get points for being easy to prepare .	-1
Do you remember the old joke about the two old ladies who go to a resort in the Catskills and complain about the food ? `` Oh , it was awful , just disgusting -- and such small portions ! '' Well , that 's pretty much how I feel about this stuff . This is n't Thai and it 's not curry . It 's just bad . The only spice I could taste was clove , and too much of that . The texture was awful . It 's so mushy you ca n't tell the difference between the rice and the noodles . And the package says 'serves 2.5 , based on a 1/2 cup serving . That 's pretty mingy . Remember when a box of stuff served four ? Or more ? Fixing a decent meal is n't hard and it does n't take hours . That 's a myth created by the people who sell us this ` convenience food . ' How hard is it to bake a potato and put a little butter or sour cream and a chopped chive on top ? Or toss some leftover cooked rice into a frying pan with a saut & eacute ; ed onion and garlic , add a tablespoon of curry powder , a little bit of coconut milk , and stir it around for three or four minutes ? Thai Curried Rice ... not quite , but better than this stuff . The people who make this processed junk convinced us we 're not worth the time or effort it takes to make a decent meal , that 30 minutes is too much time , and chopping a tomato or dicing an onion is too much work . They 're wrong . We work hard . We deserve a decent meal at the end of the day . We 're worth more than seven minutes and a box of overprocessed factory food .	-1
I love curries , love Thai cuisine.Perhaps that is precisely why I did n't love this instant rice mix.As far as easy and fast , this nails it . Less than 10 minutes and it 's on your plate . Unlike Knorr 's Creamy Chipotle , this one was filled with all the lovely dehydrated bits that Knorr is known for . Nice aroma as it boiled up then simmered.Unfortunately , it falls far short in the flavor department . While one of the most important components of a good golden curry is turmeric , if it is n't balanced well or too much is used , it 's astringency leaves a dry , powdery feeling in the mouth . That is exactly the problem with this otherwise good mix.It has a nice healthy heat , but even so it slams you with that overpowering turmeric.If I catch it on sale , I might try melting some coconut oil , and then frying the whole mix along with some of the non turmeric curry spices ... .ginger , coriander , etc. , and only after brown and fragrant pouring in the water.At that point I might as well make it from scratch.I generally like Knorr products . Knorr bullion cubes are always in my pantry , and most soup and sauce mixes are pretty good.This one , in my most humble opinion , needs some tweaking .	-1
This mix does not taste like curry . At all . Zero , nada , zilch curry flavor . Perhaps there 's an eighth of a teaspoon of curry powder in it , so they can proclaim it to be curry on the label ? Curry has zing ! Curry has FLAVOR . This tastes like the Knorr dehydrated chicken soup mix that my grandmother used to feed me back in the 60s . YUK.If you want to eat curry at home , do n't waste your money on this stuff.SOOOO disappointing ... .	-1
This side dish product contains two flavor enhancers , disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate , that are similar to monosodium glutamate , MSG . Hence my dislike for this rice product .	-1
We made one package of this and ... meh . Tasted like Mac and cheese with some extra spices and rice instead of macaroni . Kids may like it , but why ? It is n't terribly healthy , so if I 'm going to eat or serve pre-packaged convenience foods and risk all of the bad stuff , it better taste pretty darn good . This does n't meet that standard .	-1
Dry and tastless . I cooked according to the instructions on the back but mine was not creamy at all . Plus the chipotle flavor was very bland.Would not purchase !	-1
I am more of a make my own rice sort of person , but in a pinch these packaged sides can be helpful . This tasted good , but was too salty for me .	-1
This rice and vermicelli side dish ( rice-a-roni style , ) in spite of the name , does not have a Chipotle flavor . I used a stove to prepare the packet and by following the directions the result was perfectly textured rice and vermicelli . Slightly creamy , and light orange in color , the end result is shockingly bland . No heat , no smoky flavor and nothing even resembling Mexican food . Big food companies create Americanized ethnic-style convenience foods and in the process , sometimes leach out the very essence of the dish . That 's seems to be what happened here . This is a salty mash of pale orange rice and vermicelli , and nothing more.Convenience foods usually contain an incredibly long list of ingredients , and this one is no different . I suppose it is a trade-off for shelf-life , ease of preparation , and portability ( camping , backpacking , etc . ) and I tell myself that as long as I do n't eat these things very often it is n't a problem , but I do expect a somewhat tasty product .	-1
This Creole Garlic Butter rice tasted like ... nothing . It did n't taste like garlic at all , and basically had no flavor nor seasoning . I usually expect `` Creole '' flavored stuff to be pretty spicy and flavorful . This was just bland and disappointing . We definitely wo n't be buying this again ! Lipton makes some AWESOME other sides and my husband and I probably eat a couple each week , but this one is just no good .	-1
Two bites and I threw it out . It is so very bland and the texture is off . Creole ? Garlic ? Where ? I 'm not a novice cook by any stretch of the imagination . I followed directions exactly . Very disappointed by Knorr , a name that used to equal quality .	-1
Apparently `` Creole '' means smokey to Knorr , because that was the only flavor that came through in this side dish . I smelled it immediately upon opening the package and it was so prominent in the taste that nobody in my household finished a serving . Because I have tried other Knorr Rice Sides , I do know that I like some of them , Thai Curryfor example , but for me this one was far too artificial tasting to enjoy .	-1
This rice is quick and easy to make and only takes about 7 minutes . That makes it a quick and easy side to serve up . I love rice , garlic and butter so I thought that I would like this rice a lot . It also has a hickory smoked ham flavor and a Cajun sauce . I am not sure if it was the garlic or the Cajun sauce but nobody in my family liked it . I could only tolerate taking two bites because it tasted so bad . In addition we cooked it according to directions and the rice was a little mushy .	-1
There are several of these Rice Sides that I really love . I have purchased and enjoyed more Cheese and Broccoli Rice Sides than I can even count . This particular Rice Side will not be going on my `` favorites '' list though.When I grabbed this , only a small picture was available so I failed to see the word `` ham . '' I have been a vegetarian for twenty-seven years ... and if I am going to `` fall off the wagon , '' it will be for lobster ( not for a bit of ham flavor in a Rice Sides ) . Therefore , those whose religious or personal convictions do not permit the consumption of ham will want to take note . ( The good news is that this new , huge picture should solve the problem ) .Since it was unusable by me , I relied on my family to provide feedback ( yes , I am totally cool with them eating meat ) . The report was that it was `` tasteless '' and `` bland . '' My boyfriend tried some fresh cracked pepper and shaved parmesan on his ( it 's our go-to solution for everything ) . He finished the little mound , but did not return for seconds . And , my brother simply left his on his plate.Some of these sides are great , some not great . For the minute investment , you should sample them all ( from your grocery store ) and then return here and buy in bulk ! ( That 's what I do ! ! )	-1
This side dish is a combination of rice and vermicelli ( just like rice-a-roni ) but from that point forward whatever the company was attempting to accomplish is lost on me . There was absolutely no garlic flavor in evidence , or Creole spices . The prepared dish did taste a little buttery ( I added none ) and there was an odd smoke flavor in the background . The high sodium level is n't good for anyone.I realize dry mixes like this have a mile long list of ingredients , which is why I only use them occasionally , but the flag on the front of the package alerting the user that the contents are `` Made with a hint of hickory smoked ham flavor '' was not only inaccurate ( no actual ham flavor - just some chemical mish-mash ) but pointlessly misleading . If the main concern was creating a side-dish that tasted buttery and smoky , why not just label it properly - `` Artificial Smoked Hickory Ham and Butter Flavor '' rice side.The Thai Curry rice side dish by the same company was better , but this one is a colossal fail .	-1
I have tried other Knorr Rice Sides and they were OK , but this one was a total disappointment . I was expecting at least some flavor since it has garlic , but the only flavor that was noticeable was a hint of smokey flavoring . With the mediocre texture , high sodium and no flavor , this one is certainly a side dish to pass over ! Not recommended !	-1
One wonders how something named creole garlic butter can taste so flavorless . 'Since I love those flavors I planned on using this as just a side dish , after one taste I put it aside to be mixed up with something else.I usually like these side dishes , but have also become accustomed to these being very watery , even with following directions . With this I added less water and it still was soggy after letting it sit for the required time.This was a real disappointment .	-1
I think I 've tried most of the Knorr sides and most are fairly good . Handy to keep in the pantry when you need something fast . This one cooks fast and the texture is n't bad but the taste is the problem . The artificial ham flavor is over-powering . Like all the other flavors , this one is close to 300 calories per serving and way too high in salt content like most pre-packaged mixes . Of course , everyone 's taste is different and you might like it . I did n't .	-1
If I 'm going to eat candy , I at least want it to taste good . These do n't . I will never buy again !	-1
I made an error in my first review . I knew something was not quite right about these , and I brushed it off to thinking I had tasted these after eating other foods moments before ... .. Well I just found out Albert 's Ice Cubes today have a different recipe from the ones you remember in the 80 's . The blue and silver wrapper was not the only change . The very ingredients have been altered greatly . That is why they do n't taste or melt the same any longer.You now have LOW FAT COCOA and SOY FLOUR added to this chocolate . Those right there were NOT used in the 80's.No wonder the taste is not desirable as they used to be . I will never again buy these . Unless the original recipe is returned , I will do without . You can get the same flavor as the original ice cubes chocolate on ice cream pops . Just peel off the chocolate shell and enjoy . Soy and low fat anything do n't belong in pleasure foods !	-1
This chocolate taste way too much like cocoanut . My husband wo n't eat it and I 'm not thrilled with it so it 'll last a while . Also , it melts too easily and we 've had to keep refrigerated so it does n't melt in our hands .	-1
I was thoroughly disappointed with this - not a great flavor , not good for making lattes ; I like the Barista Italian Roast MUCH better ! ! They are actually both more expensive on Amazon , which is surprising - you get a better deal on Bon Ton and the Keurig website . But that 's off topic : - ) Not much more to say about this coffee - it 's a bit bitter and just not that flavorful , tastes nothing like coffee in Italy ! !	-1
Werther 's Original Baking Caramel , 9 Ounce . This item arrived quickly , well packaged and undamaged . My problem with it was that it was horribly stale and as a result , tasted very bad , even after cooking . It was a HUGE disappointment because I love Werther products .	-1
I was excited to try these baking caramels because Werther 's buttery Chewy Caramels are my favorite caramels . These have a softer texture so they would be easy to cut into small bits if you wanted to add chunks to a cookie . There are two recipes on the package ; Caramel Apples and Caramel Pecan Brownies . For both recipes you melt the caramels with a little liquid ; milk or water . The caramels have an unpleasant sandy texture to them that does not go away when melted . The melted product tastes overly sweet with very little buttery caramel flavor and in addition has a strange astringent mouth feel . I made a caramel apple with half of the bag and my intention was to make a half recipe of the Caramel Pecan Brownies but after tasting the caramel apple I decided not to use them for brownies.I think you would be better off using the Chewy Caramels melted with a little more liquid to compensate for the firmer texture .	-1
Werther 's makes some of the best tasting hard candies so when I saw this I figured it had to be just as good ... ..not so ... I did n't like it at all . It tasted the way candy tastes after it has sat around for about 6 months or more . I wo n't use it on my caramel apples . I 'll make it from scratch as always . This just does not taste like caramel . Really disappointing .	-1
Not a big caramel taste . Yes , they are easy to unwrap . And they are n't a hard caramel , they are soft and easy to eat . But I did n't taste much . I melted them to add to an apple dessert I was making . They are ok. Not very easy to work with , do n't pour well when they 're melted . Not a lot of flavor . I wo n't ever buy them .	-1
When I bake something with caramels , I usually use the caramels available in the fall candy aisle for making caramel apples , which I stockpile for using other times of the year . I thought I 'd give these Werther 's Original a try , partly because I think it 's great that they 'll be available other times of the year , and partly because I enjoy the flavor of the Werther 's candy.As a stand alone candy , these were soft but slightly grainy . The flavor was a little bland , and did not live up to what I love about regular Werther 's candy.Unwrapping a bag full of caramels for a recipe is a somewhat tedious chore , especially with ultra-thin cellophane wrappers . However , Werther 's were fairly easy to unwrap , with papery wrappers that are twisted at each end.These melted down easily and smoothly . Unfortunately , they hardened too quickly for my recipe for caramel buttercream frosting , rendering the frosting more stiff like fudge . I salvaged it and used it to fill the cake instead of frost the whole thing , but even then the flavor is still unremarkably bland.I 'm not very impressed with these baking caramels , which is too bad since I expected more from Werther 's .	-1
I was looking forward to getting this raspberry syrup . I had several recipes that called for it . I tasted it and it was n't very good , but thought perhaps it was just concentrated and would taste better when used appropriately . It did n't . The flavor was n't like raspberries at all , but like artificially flavored , generic cough syrup . I was disappointed that I paid a premium price . I ended up throwing the whole bottle away after trying it in several preparations to avoid wasting it . I even tried it is a cocktail to no avail .	-1
I was a bit disappointed in this product . I use all these syrups in Iced Tea , I 'm a coffee person but I do like Iced Tea through the day . Smells like melon and is n't horrible but I may not purchase again .	-1
This syrup is pure sugar with a few spices added . No pumpkin flavor . A complete waste of money . Get some simple sugar , cinnamon & nutmeg and have the same thing for a lot cheaper .	-1
There is no information on the container to tell me so I can not evaluate it based on my research findings : & # 34 ; not all refined coconut oils are alike ! Most are refined using a chemical distillation process dependent on lye or other harsh solvents , or they & # 8217 ; re made from the rancid oil byproducts leftover from creating dessicated ( dry ) coconut flakes . Sadly , these are refined , bleached , and deodorized in an effort to create a palatable product that can be sold to consumers . Many coconut oils are even hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated ! & # 34 ;	-1

First , I see many reviewers claiming this is raw honey . I do n't see anything on the packaging to indicate that it is raw honey . This is a problem because heat processed manuka honey loses most of the beneficial properties you 're hoping to get.Next , there is mention that the honey is `` tested '' but the lab is n't named . Nor is the assay method described to let us know how they got to the 15+ rating.Lastly , it is in a plastic container with recycle code 1 . This is a plastic type that is known to leech BPA which may cause cancer . This might be BPA-free plastic but we just do n't know , nothing on the label.When I went to the website to look for answers I was surprised to see that this product is n't even listed on their website . They appear to be a skin care company so I 'm not confident they know anything about producing a quality manuka honey that can be used to treat certain conditions when it is prepared properly . I think they need to work on their labeling and get this product up on their website with more information .	-1
I ordered this on a whim , knowing nothing about the dubious health claims but always interested in trying a new type of honey . It tasted fairly good -- a little more floral than the clover honey I usually eat , but tasty on both toast and in my tea ( I 'm currently drinkingLipton Black Tea , Bavarian Wild Berry , Premium Pyramid Tea Bags , 20-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) ) . However , when I did a little research on those health claims to try and figure out why the honey was so expensive , I was not impressed.As far as I can tell , there is some evidence that treating wounds ( as in coating cuts/scrapes/etc . with it ) with this honey helps fight off infection -- which is nice , but I 'm not particularly prone to getting cuts and scrapes and have no trouble healing from them on my own anyway . Beyond that . . . as far as I can tell the whole Bio Active numeric rating system is completely made-up junk science , and ingesting the honey does n't have any health benefits whatsoever . I am definitely interested in seeing what medical science ends up discovering about this honey and the treatment of wounds -- especially if it ends up aiding the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria ! -- but I really ca n't recommend this honey for home use , as it seems like nothing more than snake oil .	-1
I love exotic honey and I often shop specialty stores and farmers markets for a variety of delicious raw honey . Looking at the honey , you can tell it 's not filtered . I like that.I was excited to try this and started with a slightly larger than usual first bite . At first I thought it was only mediocre , then it felt a little gritty . I was disappointed that it did n't taste good at all and had such an awful grainy texture . I was relieved as I swallowed - until the awful medicine-y aftertaste kicked in - yuck ! Maybe this is only supposed to be used topically ? I 'll keep the jar around for now in case there 's any wounds that need packed with honey , but I ca n't endorse eating this . I have tried all sorts of honeys and never tasted any I did n't love - until this one .	-1
Manuka honey comes from bees that feed on the New Zealand Manuka flower . It has been described as having antibacterial properties as well as other healthful properties such as digestive health , overall health , wound and ulcer healing , and even pet care . As far as I can tell there are no medical studies and the above claims are from anecdotal evidence.Manuka Doctor has not provided information on the Amazon page on how to use this honey nor does it describe what it is supposed to do . This is strange and does not assist me in using this product . What does `` Bioactive '' mean anyway ? As a food I do n't really care for this honey . It has a strange almost medicinal taste and is very thick and slightly grainy.Overall I find this to be a mediocre product which provides me with little incentive to use it .	-1
Not sure why people are raving about this . Yes it is low cal/carb/fat but if people would have honestly said it tastes like dry unsalted roasted peanuts in powder form I would not have been so surprised . It is ok hidden in chocolate milk , but straight mixed with water or milk is very bland and untasty . All well .	-1
Okay . I have to say at first I was skeptical of the negative reviews reporting that this product causing flatulence/gas , but after using it for over a year now and watching my diet extremely carefully , I must truthfully agree and say that although this product tastes amazing in my protein shakes and the like , it causes me to have frequent , horrible , smelly gas . My husband can concur . I 'm so sad to have to be so graphic and to report that it causes gas , but it 's true . When I stop using it in my shakes , my gas stops . All I can suggest is that you try if for yourself and see if you get the same results , but I have quit using this product . : (	-1
My all-time favorite coffee for the Keurig used to be Tully 's Kona . I was heartbroken when they stopped making it , so I was really excited to see this Hawaiian blend . What a disappointment ! It takes like burnt , bitter garbage run through a bunch of paper filters . If you like Starbuck 's , you should may like this , but if you are a coffee connoisseur , you will want to spit it out .	-1
We bought the 12 pack and 6 were thrown away because 5out of the other 6 had black GUNK in the bottoms .. Yuck ! I was shocked ! Kept opening another one and another one with the same results . Will never order coconut cream from a can again ? ! Do n't know if it was BOA or not but it was gross ! BUYERS BEWARE !	-1
Most of the cans in the box were damaged . It is not safe to use cans that have severe dents in them due to the risk corrosion amelioration at the grain boundaries of the substrate ( formation of rust ) . I had to throw most of them out . Amazon you lose on this one - I do not recommend this product and must add that on recent deliveries Amazon 's packaging is less than satisfactory . Deserves a 0 star !	-1
I am a diabetic and my blood sugar shot sky high after eating these crackers . The only way this can happen is if the fiber claim is not correct . I subtracted the listed fiber content when calculating my insulin for this snack , and when I tested my blood sugar over an hour later it was 280 ! ! ! Insoluble fiber will not raise blood sugar because the body does n't digest it and convert to glucose , therefore I find it highly doubtful that they really contain the stated quantity of insoluble fiber .	-1
These are 3x3 sheets of seaweed . So do n't expect actual & # 34 ; chips & # 34 ; . Very fishy after taste and smell . Can not say I would not recommend because I am sure these are for those who understand the uses for these . They remind me of the mouth mint sheets that dissolve in your mouth but larger . Probably a good product but not for me .	-1
Update January 30 , 2014 : I discovered why Japanese seaweed salad tastes so good . It mixes seaweed , whether dried or fresh , with rice vinegar , sesame oil , soy sauce , just a little salt and sugar , a little ginger juice , sesame seeds and finely chopped scallions . No corn oil.End of update ... .This product has way too much corn oil.When roasted seaweed products first got marketed in U.S. major stores , they contained sesame oil and later started mixing in canola oil and recently a lot of corn oil . They use so much that the thin squares are very greasy - way greasier than usual for seaweed snacks.Corn oil does n't work as well with the natural seaweed taste . The best seaweed snacks use only olive oil but they 're expensive . The next best use only sesame oil . Then comes sesame mixed with canola , then sesame mixed with corn oil.I notice when I eat some , I am disappointed with the taste compared to other seaweed snacks but my hands actually get very oily . Everything I touch gets oily . Also , this type of oil is n't agreeable with my stomach.Update January 10 , 2014 : Whenever I had guests , I 'd open one of these packages and have them try . Nobody would try more than one or two . I could not give away unopened packages . I threw out the remaining packages yet I continue to buy several other Kirkland brand items when I 'm at Costco .	-1
These are tough crackers that do n't taste as good as they could . I 'm not sure for whom they are targeting this formulation.The cracker base is sort of like rye-crisp in thickness , but a bit tougher . The base is a bit cardboard tasting ( rye-crisp tastes better ) .The `` parmesan garlic '' topping is n't as good as the cheap grated parmesan that I buy at a nearby restaurant supply store . I suppose the idea was to cover over the cardboard taste , but the parmesan flavor is not as good as real parmesan . Cheddar might taste better.There is a bit of garlic , but it does n't seem that strong to me ( ymmv ) .I like the general idea of these crackers , but this particular version could be better . On the plus side , the thickness of them can make the process of chewing them more satisfying than crunching more quickly through other easier-to-eat snacks .	-1
My first thought was who had substituted bricks in the bag of crisps ? Each serving ( approximately 9 of these mini bricks ) does boast of 5 grams of protein , 3 grams of fiber , 0 grams of sugar , and 12 grams of whole grain ... but who cares when the flavor is something like Parmesan-flavored cardboard ( the hard industrial strength cardboard ) ? Maybe if I soaked them in some kind of garlic dip , they might taste a bit better but I doubt it . I think I 'm going to try the same experiment another reviewer did by handing them out to coworkers to see if any venture past one um , `` crisp '' . At least then I 'll gain amusement from this bag since I 'm obviously not going to eat any more .	-1
We love all crispy crunch crackers , and these have some very healthy ingredients so we thought to try them . We were dissapointed , these were not crispy crisps , they were hard . Too hard to break by hand so you can imigine the toll on our teeth . Reminded me of hardtack . These are way too hard for kids . The garlic is a good flavor but over powers the pramesan , so I only tasted the garlic .	-1
I loved the nutritional profile of these . I try to make sure that I get lots of fiber throughout the day because I just feel so much better and more energetic when I do . It just makes sense to trade no fiber snacks like crackers for a higher fiber version.But these were a bust for me.I did not taste cheese at all . There was n't the rich round flavor of parmesan . These just taste like garlic and lots of it . Unfortunately they are just hard . Not crispy hard . They are gnawing hard . I would really have liked a nice snappy cracker . But these feel like garlic flavored versions of the denti bone I get my dog to chew on .	-1
How hard are these crackers ? Well , the bag ( same like what potato chips come in ) was shipped unprotected in a mailer envelope . I expected to see crumbs when I opened it . But , no , all the crackers were still all nice little squares ... .They lack salt and flavor . When chewed , they become gummy in the mouth . Yuk.My aim is to eat healthy , while at the same time , enjoy what I eat . I consider these so-called `` krackers '' to be a total waste of calories .	-1
Doctor Kracker Parmesan Culinary Crisps somehow manage to taste stale even when fresh out of a new bag . They have the consistency of a nice piece of toast that you forgot to take out of the toaster oven for a few days . Plus the flavor is mild but inoffensive . They look a lot better on the package and having some seeds on top might have made these more enjoyable . Despite the 12g of multigrain , these just taste like baked flour with a bit of Parmesan and a hint of garlic .	-1
These taste a lot like garlic-parm croutons , except much harder and crunchier than I was expecting . They 're basically very hard sourdough crisps about 2 or three times thicker than a typical cracker , with a strong garlic powder flavor and a fair amount of parmesan baked onto the top.I did n't enjoy the texture , and the flavor was ok but not tremendous . I think these would be pretty good as croutons in a soup , and was able to eat good handful before I got tired of chewing them , but wo n't be buying more.There are six servings of nine crackers each in a bag , with a total of 110 calories per serving .	-1
So I got a bag of these for free though the Amazon Vine program , and boy am I happy I did n't pay for them . They are just about the most bland crisp things I 've come across . Seriously , there 's pretty much no flavor to these -- they MIGHT ( and I stress might ) be worthwhile doused in dip or peanut butter or something similar , but at that point one might as well at least be using something cheaper because the topping is all you will taste and the crisp will be used as texture.What 's most odd is that they claim to be parmesan flavored , and even list that as the first ingredient . I do n't detect that at all . There 's plenty of garlic yes , but as much as I absolutely love garlic , in a case like this that just makes it worse -- dried garlic is not a particularly pleasing flavor on its own.So yeah , one star . You can get $ 1 bags of garlic-parm croutons with much better flavor .	-1
I would describe these crackers as hard , although the bag describes them as `` crunchy perfection . '' I like crispy and crunchy -- hard not so much . It 's similar to croutons : I love my croutons crunchy and not soggy , but not hard ! The flavor 's good and familiar , though I could n't place it ; I know it 's garlic parmesan , both of which I like , but it reminded me of something else -- possibly another flavored cracker . It 's certainly not overwhelming.The package suggests eating them with a dip , among other things , so I tried Lay 's French Onion Dip . Very good ! I loved that and enjoyed Doctor Kracker 's crisps much more . I also tried Tostitos Creamy Spinach Dip . I 'd advise trying that with something else . I 'm not sure what . So , not recommended , but some people might prefer that hardness . ( I could n't help thinking of the biscuits I feed my dogs 'cause it 's good for their teeth . )	-1
I usually do n't mind eating dry crispy crackers or cheese twists . But these were really bad . They were dry and did n't have great flavor . I do n't plan on finishing the bag but I have gone back to them a few times to make sure I really do n't like them.The flavor is just lost in the dry , almost dog biscuit consistency ( as I remember them from trying them as a kid ! I know , bad analogy ) .Not recommended at all . But I 'll give it an extra star for low fat and high protein content .	-1
Honestly , I 'm glad I got these free . I have a family of five people and we all tried the garlic parmesan `` Culinary Crisps '' and nobody liked them . I think the idea is to eat these instead of potato chips because they certainly have the crunch that many people crave , almost to a fault , but the flavor is really lacking . While the flavor lacks , the after taste does n't , in fact the after taste goes on and on.Before I throw out the rest of the bag , I may try putting these on a salad instead of croutons . This may redeem them a bit , we 'll see .	-1
This review is based on a sample provided by the Amazon Vine program.I ate these crackers with a bowl of soup ( pasta e fagioli ) about a half week after recovering from being ill . The crackers themselves are surprisingly thick . Thicker than a saltine . They are crunchy and tough , but not overly hard . I would say it is a good texture . The pictures seem to imply that there are seeds on top , and there are a few , but that 's it , and you do n't notice them in the taste or texture . In fact , I found the taste to be overwhelmingly cheesy , and not in a good way . They are supposed to be garlic as well , and there 's a hint , but its not too obvious .	-1
Taste is a personal thing . I really did not like these crackers , but apparently lots of other people love them . All I can do is explain why I did n't like them.Normally I like garlic and I like Parmesan cheese , and I like them combined . But the flavor of these crackers completely turned me off . I do n't know if the balance of the flavors was n't right for me or if the garlic or Parmesan had a funny taste , but I did n't even want to finish my first cracker . I tried them again later to see if anything changed , but I still did n't like them.In addition to the flavor , I did n't like the texture . They are thick and hard and I did n't like chewing them . Leaving nearly all of a bag of crackers uneaten is rare for me , but I had no desire to finish them .	-1
I was hoping for a flavored cracker when I received them but they are pretty stale and hard right out of an freshly opened bag . They really remind me of croutons but just in the shape of a cracker with some Parmesan cheese and garlic ( much more the latter than the former ) . The flavor was so strong I had trouble eating more than a couple in one sitting and much like many garlic flavored food , the taste sticks with you for a while after eating . So I ended up crushing them up ( which is hard because they are really hard themselves ) and put them on my spaghetti which was much better than eating them alone .	-1
I 'll be honest , my first bite made me think of tree bark . After about a half dozen or so , it improved slightly . The biggest plus is the crunch ; somewhere between a hard sourdough pretzel and a kettle cooked potato chip . The flavor covers up some of the barky vibe , but it has an artificial taste . If paired with a dip or some topping , it gets better , but then again , so does a saltine.From a health perspective it 's not bad ( 12 % of your fiber , low in sodium , and 9 of these fairly large crisps is 110 calories ) , but in the end I do n't buy snacks for the health benefits . If I wanted to snack healthy , I 'd eat vegetables or fruit . Given the gigantic snack food market , if I 've got to get a snack on , I 'm not likely to choose these .	-1
The description of these crackers sounds perfect ... whole grains , artisan baked , parmesan , and garlic - all my favorite tastes.So it was with disappointment that I ate one , then tried some more . They are extremely dry , even with a dip or topping that dry taste came through . It overwhelmed any other flavor ; in fact they tasted over baked . My conclusion is that they would be an outstanding choice for a bar to serve , because customers munching on these would definitely want more to drink .	-1
this just reminded me of how much I hate Lays potato chips ... ..how do I forget this fact ! -Kettle chips are by far superior & Kettle chips have a lot more potassium ! ( if you like lay 's : the quality of the shipment & the quality of the product was actually very good ! )	-1
I like most ramen and have been eating a lot of them recently . I like fish flavors but this just had a difficult odor and unpleasant flavor to me . I 'm glad I tried a 6-pk rather than buying a 12-pk .	-1
I expected to really like these chips since I am a fan of the original . What a disapointment ! No flavor or real taste that would make me want to consume the entire bag . As another reviewer said ... .tastes more like a rice cake !	-1
I have had several other brands of kettle chips before , all of which are delicious and rather addicting . These chips , however , did not live up to expectations - they tasted like lightly flavored cardboard ! I did n't even finish the bag , and ended up throwing it out . If you 're looking for flavorful kettle chips , look elsewhere .	-1
This snack food reminded me of rice cakes flattened to a chip . It 's a highly processed chip with a flavor I did not care for and a texture I cared for even less . I believe the texture was the most off-putting feature of this snack food . It 's an interesting concept , but I did n't care for it . I even shared these with some young teen-aged boys , who pretty much eat anything . They tried it and did not like the flavor or texture ( even though they 're great fans of kettle corn flavored popcorn ) . I applaud the makers for making something that may be usable for folks with gluten sensitivity , but this was unpalatable to me , fake tasting .	-1
I am a big fan of popchips and have tried pretty much every flavor , so I was looking forward to trying this new one . Sadly , the Sweet and Salty is only present in the description , since the product has very , very little taste . There is a small hint of sweetness , and the salt is lost . Just so you know , I am not one of those people that adds salt to his food in restaurants , so these definitely lack flavor , it 's not a consumer problem here . This is probably the worst product I have tried from this brand . Such a shame , but at least you have many other great popchips flavors out there .	-1
Yes , it 's 100 calories , so it 's got that going for it.But there are a LOT of 100 calorie items that either taste great or give better nutritional benefits.The calories in this are mostly carbs . It 's got some fiber , but not a lot . It 's got some protein but not a lot.But the taste is not great . It 's tolerable , but it really tastes like nothing so much as a very thick very artificially sweet protein shake ( that again , does not have much protein ) . I found it highly artificial and sweet and slightly metallic and did not enjoy the flavor at all.Also not very filling.So I do n't really see any particular reason to eat it vs. some other 100 calorie snack that either ( 1 ) is more filling , ( 2 ) is more enjoyable or ( 3 ) actually give me more fiber/protein or vitamins .	-1
I have tried a few diet smoothie type drinks and have yet to find one I enjoy . This was not too good . It had a chalky texture and metal taste to me . Maybe one of their other flavors would be better ?	-1
I got these as a vine product because I was excited to see 8 ounces 'pack a lot of punch ' with protein , fiber and low sugar for a 100 calories.While smooth and non lumpy , the taste was not chocolate like and had a very weird , unpleasant after taste that sticks around for awhile.My dog also accidentally spilled one . As with other whey products , it was hard to get out of our light colored carpet ... so be careful ! And extremely overpriced . At $ 29.54 for a package of 4 , it 's not worth the $ 8 , $ 9 per 8 ounces . I 'm hoping that is a typo .	-1
Right off the bat , I 'm not crazy about the taste.After the initial chocolate flavor fades , the after taste reminds me of diet soda..and has the consistency of something synthetic , not & # 34 ; smooth and creamy & # 34 ; .Does n't really leave me feeling satisfied , so I 'd rather just have a cup of coffee , even if it is a few more calories.The packaging on these bottles is wrapped up tighter than a snare drum.Forget about opening this with one hand , if you were on the go . The outer plastic wrapping leaves little as an easy starting point , and then the twist off plastic cap is just ok. ( not a lot of pressure required , but under the cap is sealed with a silver lining that is not easy to remove . All that add up to me not wanting to make much of an effort to drink these at the start of my day .	-1
These are the pros of this product : It has a decent taste . It has 6 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber . It is sweetened with stevia rather than some awful artificial sweetener , and secondarily with evaporated cane syrup rather than high fructose corn syrup.These are the cons of this product : It contains maltodextrin and natural flavor , which are moderately unhealthy . It contains carrageenan , which is awful for one 's health . For more detailed information on these ingredients , see below.I can not see any motivation other than ignorance or greed for a company claiming to offer the public a supposed `` healthy , '' chocolate drink to flavor it with `` natural flavor '' rather than with actual chocolate ! South Beach missed a major opportunity to use real , dark chocolate or dark cocoa that is actually greatly beneficial to the health and instead decided to utilize unhealthy , lab-created chemicals that merely mimic the taste of chocolate.In addition , there was no need to add maltodextrin as a thickener , when the drink already contains the more healthy ingredient of guar gum.Worst of all , there is no excuse whatsoever for using the thickener carrageenan , a truly awful ingredient that ought to be banned.As far as I 'm concerned , this is a product to be avoided . And I see no real point to it . It only takes about 2-3 minutes to make a chocolate smoothie in a blender , and there are multiple ways to do it . ( I will be glad to post suggested recipes for anyone who wants them . ) If time is the issue on a work day , then you can blend one up the night before , store it in the refrigerator ( preferably in a glass or stainless steel container , rather than plastic such as this product is stored in ) . When it is time to use it , simply shake it well -- exactly as you would have to do with this product -- when you 're ready to drink it.Ingredients : Water , Protein Blend ( Whey Protein Concentrate , Nonfat Dry Milk ) , Soluble Corn Fiber , Evaporated Cane Syrup , High Oleic Sunflower Oil , Cocoa ( Processed with Alkali ) , Natural Flavor , Locust Bean Gum , Guar Gum , Maltodextrin , Carrageenan , Soy Lecithen , Salt , Rebaudioside A ( Stevia ) .IMPORTANT : Must be refrigerated after opening to maintain safety . Serve chilled . Shake well.Nutrition Facts : Serving Size : 8 fl ozCalories : 100Carrageenan : This common additive in food and cosmetics is extracted from a red seaweed called Chondrus crispus , commonly known as Irish moss . Carrageenan is used as a thickener and emulsifier . Much research over many years has shown that repeated exposure to carrageenan causes inflammation , which is viewed as the root cause of most serious disease , including arthritis , bowel disease , heart disease and cancer , among many others . In fact , drug investigators frequently use carrageenan to create inflammation in tissues in order to test the anti-inflammatory properties of new drugs . Finally , exposure to low doses of carrageenan for as little as 18 days can create profound glucose intolerance and impair insulin action , which are precursors to diabetes.Maltodextrin : This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet . It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler , to improve the texture and appearance in processed food . As a relatively cheap ingredient , it can also add more bulk to a given product , thereby increasing profits for the company using it . In the U.S. , most of the time it is derived from rice , corn , or potato starch . Through a process called hydrolysis , the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids . Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further , resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water . People who are allergic to gluten should be aware that maltodextrin can sometimes be derived from barley or wheat . Per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act ( FALCPA ) , all FDA-regulated food products that contain maltodextrin derived from wheat must include the word `` wheat '' on the food label . In the case of USDA-regulated foods ( meat , poultry , and egg products ) , this warning is not required on the label , so beware of products such as soups with meat in them which say they contain maltodextrin . However , products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin , are required by law to say `` wheat '' in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor : The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is : `` The essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product of roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or similar plant material , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional '' ( 21CFR101.22 ) . That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food , but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is .	-1
I have tried some of the other south beach snack items , so thought I would give the smoothie a try . First , it does n't really seem to be the thick consistency you expect with a smoothie . Basically , it seems like drinking chocolate milk . I found the taste to be off , sort of artificial , and with a nasty aftertaste . After I saw the ingredient list , with all the chemicals in this , I decided it 's not for me . Check the ingredients before you order , there are tastier and healthier products out there .	-1
This tastes of chocolate , but not in an appetizing way , and it has a nasty aftertaste . I did n't find it particularly satisfying as a meal replacement either . Considering the high price on this item , it is not one I would recommend .	-1
This drink is satisfying as far as keeping hunger pangs at bay when on the go . I would prefer a glass of milk and a slice of turkey breast if I were at home . @	-1
There is Stevia in this drink and that is not written anywhere in the promo for this smoothie , the ingredients list was not in the product page and the South Beach Diet website only has nutritional info . The smoothie is creamy but that is all that is good about it . It tastes like Milk of Magnesia mixed with & # 8220 ; Mockolate & # 8221 ; . I actually had to spit this smoothie out . I am not keen on Stevia ; even a tiny amount tastes bitter to me . The taste also lingered , that I had to clean my mouth ( Brush and mouthwash ) . I do not recommend this product to Stevia sensitive persons .	-1
My husband and I have both had the gastric sleeve procedure and that means we have limited stomach capacities . The first thing we 're supposed to eat is protein - and we 're always looking for new flavors of high-nutrition , low-calorie meal replacements so we can get the most out of our capacity , especially when we 're on the go.I do not like chocolate , but ironically - I do like chocolate milk ... but I got this for my husband , as he is a big-time chocolate fan . He likes milk chocolate and dark chocolate - and the darker the better . Chocolate Truffles are richer as a rule than simple milk chocolate , so I thought this would be a great alternative for my taller half.He took one sip and responded , & # 34 ; Ewww , yuck ! Here - you 've got ta try this. & # 34 ; I took a whiff of it . Admittedly , I am not a chocolate fan - and the darker the chocolate , the more I dislike it ... so I 'm not a connoisseur of chocolate . Mine is not the palate you 'd want to have judging a chocolate dessert competition , that 's for sure ... but I reluctantly took a sip . My first reaction was , & # 34 ; Hey - this is n't that bad , it 's like chocolate milk ! & # 34 ; Then , within a fraction of a second , came the chemical after taste . It was very weird and hard to place at first . I looked up at my husband and said , & # 34 ; Eww ... tastes like chocolate milk and Pepto Bismol ! & # 34 ; and his face lit up in instant recognition and he said , & # 34 ; Yes ! Exactly - that 's what it tastes like. & # 34 ; He then lamented on how hard it was to get the foul taste out of his mouth so it would n't ruin the next thing he planned on eating.I 'm seeing very mixed reviews here - some people say it 's yummy - so I 'm guessing they 're not getting the after-taste . Our tongues react to various chemical stimuli to give us 'flavor ' - so it could be that it reacts to some folks this way and not to others - but my husband 's palate and mine could not be more different . We have completely different tastes in foods . Many things he eats , I can not stand and vice versa - but we are in total agreement on this drink . It has a chemical taste.I was n't thrilled to read the ingredients and find the common additive carrageenan in the list . Carrageenan has been linked to digestive problems and cancer in many studies . It 's used as a thickening agent - but this 'smoothie ' drink is n't even thick - it 's the same thickness as chocolate milk.Needless to say , we wo n't be getting this product again .	-1
I 'm a chocolate lover , admittedly , which is why I need to try something that will help me lose weight . So these & # 34 ; chocolate truffle diet drinks & # 34 ; looked like they were worth trying . I like the Southbeach diet , and at only 100 calories , I thought this drink might be a really good solution for when I 'm on the go and do n't have time to get lunch or whatever.Unfortunately , the flavor of these is fairly awful . I 'm told its flavor is typical for a & # 34 ; diet drink , & # 34 ; but to me it tastes like a watery chocolate liquid , with something else added to give it a little substance . It 's not the rich flavor you hope for when you hear the word & # 34 ; chocolate truffle , & # 34 ; that 's for sure . It may not even be real chocolate flavoring.Putting it in the fridge to keep it cold before opening it made it only slightly more tolerable . Unfortunately , I still ca n't get through an entire bottle of it without wanting to barf .	-1
This is n't as terrible as most diet drinks . It 's just not much different than chocolate milk . It 's not even thicker than chocolate milk . i do n't see how anyone can justify spending the extra price on a drink that advertises having only 100 calories per serving . The problem with that come-on is the fact that Coke has the same amount of calories per serving and I am quite sure that chocolate milk has less.I would leave it at two stars , but there is a chalky aftertaste that ruins whatever good will I might have to the drink .	-1
Taste is standard dry skim milk flavor ... but very difficult to stir intoanything just using a spoon ... or fork . do n't even try adding to a hot liquidsuch as coffee or tea ... it turns into cooked clumps.Im sure it would be fine for mixing with a blender , etc ... but thats not whati wanted it for	-1
Bought to give as a gift for Valentine 's Day . Very large box of delicious Lindt chocolates were well received , ... until they were opened . The chocolates were all melted and smashed . Uploaded a picture to this page to show how they looked when the box was opened . I 'm embarrassed having given this as a gift , should have just gone to See 's Candies instead like I have done every year . : (	-1
These had a funny aftertaste , all of them had the same flavor - with a couple being yummy with the aftertaste , but most being bitter or blah , but with the same aftertaste.I would not buy them again because they all taste the same but with different textures , in general and the aftertaste was just horrible . It looks great , it was a nice idea , but the taste is what matters and they failed the taste test .	-1
Every one of the individually wrapped packages inside the box were virtually powdered - in pieces with nothing bigger than a nickel .	-1
I bought this at Wal-Mart because I had a coupon and it was cheaper than here at Amazon . I wish I would have spent the money for other coffee . Out of the 12 count , only 3 did n't put coffee grounds in my coffee . The 3 I had were really good , great blend of coffee . Just not what I paid for . I wo n't be buying this product anytime soon .	-1
NOTE : This review is for the Signature Blend.Really good coffee . I definitely like these better than Starbucks House Blend when they do n't spew grinds.My 1st box : I have not had issues with the design of the k-cup in my Keurig B70 Platinum brewer , nor issues with coffee grinds in my coffee . If I have any of these issues , then I will update this review.By the way , I am not considering the price in my review ... . there might be better/cheaper sources for these k-cups.UPDATE 2014-02-04 : My 2nd box : I bought another box and this box was mostly useless as I got a lot of grinds ... there must be some manufacturing issue with these . I 'm dropping my rating to 2 stars because I wo n't be buying this anymore as I do n't want to hassle with the chance of getting some bad k-cups and having to return them .	-1
I bought these last week since my in-laws were visiting and I knew my mother-in-law was a big fan ; however , her Keurig machine has recently stopped working so I figured this would be a nice little 'treat ' for her visit . We made 3 or 4 cups on Saturday , then went to make a cup on Sunday morning ... and for the first time in 2 years OUR Keurig machine did n't function properly . It was acting the same way my in-laws had been ( unpredictable coffee sizes , grounds in coffee , coffee / water mess everywhere ) , I believe it may be something in the ridges of the K-cup that Gevalia uses that does n't allow the Keurig needle to function properly , which eventually leads to a broken machine . We switched back to our regular coffee and we 're back in business since I do n't think enough damage was done with the 5 cups of Gevalia we brewed ... Do n't get me wrong , the coffee IS good , but if you MUST have this brand I would recommend buying the ground up stuff and a reusable Keurig coffee dispenser until Gevalia fixes the shape of their K-cup .	-1
This is really nice tasting coffee . It is not bitter in the least . Some complaints of the cups can be overcome by just pressing the cup onto the bottom spike before you close the top cover . Never any problems then . Buy this , you 'll like it if you like smooth , basic coffee.Update : No sooner I posted this than I put a cup in the ol ' Keurig and pushed it down . Unbeknownst to me , it did n't penetrate the bottom and the water began to back up into the maker and the reservoir . It no longer functions . Looks like it cost me over 200 $ .I have to vote 1 start now . Do n't recommend using the Gevalia cups . San Francisco Bay has a wonderful design for a Keurig cup . Works every time and is less wasteful .	-1
I do not know what is wrong with these kcups , but out of a pack of 12 over half have resulted in a cup full of coffee grounds . The remaining kcups have worked and the grounds were not serious enough to be noticable until the last swig of coffee , however the others quite literally released the entire kcup worth of coffee into the resulting brew.Terrible terrible . If I could give zero stars , I would .	-1
The coffee itself is smooth , mild , and flavorful - no complaints there . But there is something wrong with the k-cup design . The sides are ridged , unlike most k-cups ; I do n't know if that 's the cause of the problem . But it takes several attempts for the brewer to puncture the bottom of the cup . By then , water has been injected into the cup , and the result is a bit of a mess .	-1
I have to say I was surprised how cardboard-like it was . I enjoy bacon I supposed I am not part of the & # 34 ; bacon-crazy & # 34 ; club . Maybe I got a bad batch , there were several pieces in my package that were literally seared black ! It 's a food item , so non-returnable . It was an add on so I 'll put it to a learning moment . I looked through the whole package and after 4 burnt pieces and 2 cardboard hard to chew awful tasting pieces ... the rest was tossed . Hopefully you 'll all have a better experience . My sister and I talked about Oberto products because we attended school with two of the sons and we like to promote hometown products , but over the years , the consistency has put us off them . It is a shame , because they used to have the best product . I hope they improve it .	-1
Being human , I love both bacon and jerky . They are irresistible . When I saw that someone had make bacon jerky , I was thrilled . What could be better ? Anything . Anything is better . This is a sad product that is neither bacon nor jerky . It is like buying precooked bacon and eating it without heating it up . The fat is thick and chewy . The bacon taste is lacking . And I have not yet figured out what element of this product makes it `` jerky '' .Clearly Oberto tried to fly too close to the sun .	-1
This was too greasy and unappetizing to eat as a snack . We tried it , but it tastes a lot like the pre-cooked bacon you can purchase at the store . I ended up just using it as a casserole ingredient since it was n't good enough straight from the package to eat as a snack .	-1
Knorr Pasta Sides , Chipotle Rosa did n't work for me as a convenience food . I did n't like the boiling for this and boiling again . That took almost 30 minutes . I admit that 3 minutes of that time was used to fix some frozen vegetables to go with it . But to be convenient , it would have to have less time standing over a hot stove.OK , now for the flavor , I ca n't drink milk so I used almond milk and that kind of messed up the flavor some . I wanted to try this mix because I have never had anything with Chipotle in it . It tasted hot but not overly spicy . So I now think I like Chipotle the hot pepper.I would n't buy this because of the amount of work it takes to fix it .	-1
I tried this and the Smokehouse Bacon and Parmesan . I disliked them both and for the same reasons.First it tricky annoying to make . It calls for milk with the water and then boiling for 8 minutes . So basically , you have to stir it the whole time to avoid the milk scorching . Second , it is mostly sauce . At no time did it thicken into anything resembling the picture on the front . Third , Holy Sodium Batman . A 2/3 cup serving ( who eats 2/3 cup ? ) is a third of your daily allotment of sodium . Fourth , after being a pain to make and an indulgence to eat it does n't taste that great . It was kind of gummy and definitely not `` chipotle '' . It just needed a lot more flavor .	-1
After serving Knorr 's Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan Pasta Sides to my family at dinner last week , they insisted that they would not ever try another Pasta Sides flavor . So , I cooked this up during the day , just to give it a try . I tasted a few spoonfuls to confirm that my pre-conceived opinion was correct , then I dumped the rest . I did n't even want to give it to the chickens in the yard , because I felt the wimpy noodles and excessive salt were not healthy for them.This package makes two cups prepared pasta . One cup is considered a serving size . I was appalled to see that one cup of this stuff contains 31 % of a person 's recommended daily salt intake . And I could only stand at the counter and shake my head when I read that two cups of this weighed in at 580 calories -- and this is just a side dish ? ! ? If you try this product , remember to not exceed the 12 minute boiling time in an effort to get the sauce to thicken ; your noodles will be mush . Thickening occurs during the two minute resting period after you take it off the flame.I do n't know why anyone would bother with this product , as it is n't even a true `` convenience '' food that you can pop into the microwave at work .	-1
I was really hoping to like these pasta sides . This is probably my favorite out of the 3 I 've tried but I still did n't really like it . I also was looking for something a little faster to cook but you still have to wait on the pasta to fully cook . You can tell that this is a cheap boxed type meal by the flavor . Would n't recommend buying .	-1
I 'm a sucker for anything `` chipotle '' flavored ; i love spice and i love smokey . But unfortunately I 'm not the best person to review this product . I hate processed , packaged foods . I 'm an excellent cook and never actually buy this kind of stuff because i can make it better and healthier myself . I 'm not bragging , just setting this up so you understand why I do n't like it too much . I 'm just simply not used to eating this kind of food . It tastes okay , the spice is alright , but it all just tastes fake . Processed . Over salted yet bland . Cooking things from scratch really is n't hard , i promise . People are so daunted by the idea . But once you try a few things out on your own you 'll find that what you can make tastes way better than what comes out of a package . So that 's my PSA : Do n't get this , try real cooking , you 'll be a lot happier and healthier .	-1
I wo n't be eating this again . It was spicy enough , maybe even too spicy for me . The big downer is that it was all heat and no flavor . I 'm not sure how that 's even possible but my tastebuds were quite disappointed.This brand in other flavors is great . Read all the reviews here , too spicy for some , not spicy enough for others . It 's a big chance to take on a 12 pack unless you have tried the `` Chipotle Rosa '' flavor before and are sure you will like it .	-1
I followed the instructions but ended up with a watery mess . The taste is n't too bad , but you 'd be better off making your own pasta and adding butter , garlic , olive oil , herbs , etc.It 's not even much of a timesaver because you have to get the liquids boiling , cook for twelve minutes , and then let it sit for two minutes.I would never buy this product .	-1
I have liked and used Knorr soups for years . They have a full flavor . I tried this pasta and it had a slight hot taste but that was as far as the Southwest flavor went . I added some canned tomatoes with spicy red bell pepper , more pasta ( since so many reviewers said it was too watery ) , and some cubed steak and it still was barely acceptable . This is just not up to Knorr 's previous standards .	-1
This pasta side has absolutely no flavor . It was beyond bland , and I tasted absolutely no chipotle whatsoever . There was a tiny little spice flavor as an aftertaste , but it certainly was n't chipotle . You make the pasta and use the cooking water to make the sauce , which is minimal . I added a little extra milk than suggested and used butter instead of margarine ( which we do not use in my house ) because the sauce was so minimal . Unimpressed . Wo n't buy again .	-1
I like a nice blend of flavors but I do not like heat and this was way too hot for me . It cooked up okay and my daughter and hubby liked it but even they said it was a bit hot and they both like hot . I do like Knorr Products and will buy them everytime over their competition but never again on this one .	-1
It 's just pasta with chipoltle flavoring - nothing more to it . I love chipoltle , so I was excited to try this , but it seems pointless ... you could easily whip up this up yourself from plain pasta & chipoltle sauce . Maybe if it had some veggies or something added to it , but even regular mac & cheese seems more tantalizing than this side dish .	-1
If you like hot spicy foods this side dish is probably not hot enough for you ; however if you just like a slight spicy flavor this will be too hot . The main complaint though is that it is not really a sauce . I added less water than the directions called for and this still comes out resembling a watery soupy consistency - coloured water with noodles.There is no tomato taste or colour much less flavor . The liquid is yellow with the slightest pinkish cast and then only if you are looking for it . This would be much more of a success if it made a sauce instead of a watery liquid with a not very appealing spicy taste .	-1
Well , I now remember why I gave the local food bank all my remaining packages of knorr sides ... ... they just do not taste that great . And the white flour noodles sit in my stomach like cement for hours . This variety is supposed to have bacon and parmesan flavor but I did not notice those flavors at all . I 'm glad I only got this one package because now I really KNOW not to buy this cheap , flavorless side dish . The picture on the package looks scrumptious but be forwarned ... .it is not ! Perhaps if the noodles were made of kamit or amaranth or TEFF or even millet I 'd enjoy the flavor better but not the way these are made for quick and easy cooking . Plus , I have to be careful about eating salt ... ..this is loaded with salt ... . a company 's cheap way to try to fool everyone into thinking there really is flavored food added . No , I can not recommend this product to anyone concerned about their health .	-1
Although we usually enjoy easy to prepare pre-packaged pastas like Knorr Pasta Side 's Smokehouse Bacon , no one in our family of four liked this flavor . The `` smoky '' flavor tastes artificial but mostly these noodles taste like milk . The also look bland and grey . The bacon bits are itty bitty and too scarce to be of consequence . The pasta is short and the servings are very small . There is enough to accommodate two people . The sauce was also very runny even after sitting for a few minutes .	-1
This side contained bland pasta swimming in a watery white sauce that tasted of strongly of bacon . It was so pronounced and harsh it tasted fake , even though the ingredients list bacon as an ingredient . If there was any parmesan in there , we certainly could n't taste it . The noodles had a weird texture , somewhere between hard and rubbery . It was too salty.On the positive side , it is quick and easy to prepare . The package contains two servings so you do n't have to worry about leftovers or insuslting the dog.If your idea of gourmet is a school cafeteria or an very bad all you can eat buffet , you probably will like this . But for the investment of little more time , you could prepare a pleasing fettucine dish with an enjoyable sauce .	-1
I microwaved this product according to directions and added the ingredients required . When I took it out of the microwave it was very watery and inedible . I let it sit for fifteen minutes and it firmed up . The taste is very bland as though it needs more cheese and bacon . I had several tablespoons of it and decided that I just could n't eat it . It was unappetizing to look at and tasted pretty bad . I would n't recommend this product .	-1
I was disappointed in this product . I thought I 'd like this pasta , as I love bacon . However , the bacon and smokehouse flavors were not good . The package reads , `` Great taste of real bacon '' and the actual product did not taste like real bacon.The smokey flavor ruined the entire experience , for me anyway . Because of the strong smokey flavor , I do n't think it would pair well with most food as a side dish.The noodles were fine and they would have been good without all of that artificial bacon and heavy smoke flavor . But unfortunately , those flavors ruined the entire dish.Not recommended . 2 stars .	-1
Although I 'm a big fan of Knorr products , this one was not appealing . The bacon flavor tasted very artificial ( even though the package said `` real bacon ! '' ) and there was WAY too much of a smoky taste . The smokiness overpowered everything , making it impossible to enjoy . And the parmesan must have been in hiding , since it ( or any measureable taste of it ) was nowhere to be found.It was also rather watery , even though I followed the directions to the letter . The pasta was cooked properly , but the sauce did not thicken up much.On the plus side the noodles were OK , and it was very easy to prepare - a single saucepan dish that takes less than 15 minutes from start to finish ( including bringing the water to boil ) .But the taste ... .pretty poor . I 'll give it two stars for the attempt , but it 's not something I 'd get again .	-1
I 've tried a variety of these sides for quick side dishes and generally the are pretty good . Not so with this one which i prepared for lunch today as a side with last night 's leftover roasted chicken.Cooked according to instructions , the sauce was on the runny side . I ended up cooking it nearly 3 minutes longer over a higher flame . It thickened up just slightly due to the evaporation of liquid . It tasted sort of bland and had the slightest parmesan flavor . Ditto for the smokehouse bacon flavor which was anemic at best.I wo n't be buying this at the store	-1
Normally you can rely on a number of things when using a Knorr product ; It 's quick and easy to make , and it normally tastes pretty good . These Pasta Sides normally make a decent side dish.The quick and easy part is still true . Add water , milk and optionally , some butter . Bring to a boil , add the contents of the packet and let it cook it for 8 minutes . And of course , you can add more items to it to make it a main dish instead of a side.Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan certainly sounded good to me . Unfortunately it was really bland . The bacon is in tiny tidbits that are chewy . So you do get some Smokehouse Bacon flavor . But you have to concentrate to pick up any hint of Parmesan.Without adding anything additional to this , you get a fairly bland noodle dish.And as with most of the Pasta Sides , it can become gummy as it sets . If you reheat , add a little water or milk to thin it out .	-1
I love parmesan cheese and bacon so I thought this pasta dish would be good for sure . Unfortunately this pasta was a serious let down from the start.It 's easy enough to prepare . Add 1 1/2 cups of water , 1/2 cup of milk and a 1 Tablespoon of butter if you wish , depending on your taste . Bring it to a boil , stir in the package of pasta , stir frequently and cook for 8 minutes and you are done . That 's that nice and easy part.The bad part is the smell . The second I opened the package I questioned whether or not I would like it because it did n't have a very good smell to it . But for better or for worse I would give it a try . Once the pasta began to cook the smell got almost unbearable . We have two adults and two kids in the house and everyone thought it smelled horrible . My kids ran upstairs because they did n't want to smell it anymore . I was really quite shocked how bad it smelled and it caught me by surprise . The package says it will make two servings but I would consider it one . It would be an extremely small serving to only have half of the package.The noodles are flat and sort of like fettuccine noodles but they are cut very short and only about 1 inch long . The pasta did n't taste nearly as bad as it smelled but it was nothing special either . The smoke flavor tastes fake , the bacon is extremely small and they are hard little pieces like bacon bits . I would not recommend this pasta dish .	-1
One would think that with bacon and parmesan nothing could go wrong . Sadly Knoor Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan pasta proves that wrong.First it is annoying to make . It calls for milk with the water and then boiling for 8 minutes . So basically , you have to stir it the whole time to avoid the milk scorching . Second , it is mostly sauce . At no time did it thicken into anything resembling the picture on the front . Third , Holy Sodium Batman . A 2/3 cup serving ( who eats 2/3 cup ? ) is a third of your daily allotment of sodium . Fourth , after being a pain to make and an indulgence to eat it does n't taste that great . I could not taste the cheese . It tastes salty and it is oddly sweet . But it does taste like bacon.I could n't finish this . I had to foist it off on the garbage disposal/teenage son .	-1
We had high hopes for this side dish ... I mean who DOES N'T like bacon and Parmesan cheese ? Apparently we do n't , at least not in this dish . The bacon overwhelmed all other flavors in the dish , plus the hard little pieces of bacon were disconcerting in an otherwise smooth textured dish . The noodles tasted pasty and rather gummy . This it not a side dish I would serve again .	-1
My family tasted this and said , `` What is this supposed to be ? '' It was sure hard to tell what it was , because it did n't taste like anything we recognized . I like Knorr bouillon cubes , so I had hopes that this would give us Kraft Mac & Cheese comfort in a different flavor.No cheese flavor.The bacon bits were offensive in texture and in fake flavor.The noodles were wimpy.The sauce tasted like a tangy milk -- not , not good.The after taste is not nice.Knorr made this thinking people would like to eat it ? That 's sad.People do eat this stuff ? That is an even sadder thought.One tip : Do n't let it cook over the recommended time , thinking it will thicken up . It only thickens after it comes off the heat.I 've got two other Knorr Pasta Sides flavors to sample . My family has told me flat out that they want no part of the taste testing . They do n't want to see any more Pasta Sides on their dinner plates .	-1
I get it , bacon is the hot item and everyone wants to get in on it . I personally love bacon , as do our kids . This product has the dubious honor of being the first bacon-related foodstuff that I have spit out . Avoid if possible .	-1
I was really excited to get this . I mean pasta with a bacon Parmesan flavor . They take a little longer than I thought to make . I thought these would be very quick but you still have to wait for the pasta to cook . The taste though was really bad . I would not buy again .	-1
The directions produce a bunch of noodles in a heavy , dairy-based sauce , but what it does not produce is noodles that taste like smokehouse , like bacon , or like parmesan . The bacon consists of small nodules of what I assume is some kind of soy , or bacon that has been boiled and and then flash-dried ( My son , who 's in kindergarten , assumed they were lumps of bread ) . The parmesan is . . . somewhere , presumably , though I never found it . And smokehouse ? Forget it . There is none.What 's particularly disqueting is the the Knorr sides are usually quite tasty and flavorful . Choose any one of the others instead .	-1
Was there something wrong with the package I used ? The smokey parmesan/bacon flavor was good but weak . Also , the bacon bits were few and far between . The problem was the ingredient/liquid ratio . Instructions call for 1.5 cups water .5 cup milk and this created a very thin , watery sauce , with instructions followed exactly . I am going to buy another packet and try it again . Perhaps I got a sample with powder-to-pasta ratio incorrectly packaged ? I will let you know . Until then , this was unacceptable .	-1
I made this according to the stovetop directions adding 1-1/2 cups of water , 1/2 cup of milk , and 1 tablespoon of butter instead of margarine . The butter/margarine is optional . Once everything came to a boil I added the package contents , cooked it until done , and then let it stand for 2 minutes as indicated.When complete , the pasta dish was extremely soupy . Since I did not want a soup , I drained most of the liquid and ate it . It tasted okay although the bacon pieces were more like tiny granules half the size of a peppercorn.There are two servings per package at 300 calories each . There 's 13 % saturated fat after preparation , 34 % sodium , 2 % cholesterol , and 9g protein.Depending on how one reads the ingredients list , the first 3 ingredients in the package before preparation are enriched macaroni product , niacin , and ferrous sulfate . Bacon is the 7th ingredient in the list . However , if I assume the 6 ingredients in brackets that follows `` enriched macaroni product '' are actually one ingredient , then bacon would be the second ingredient in the list . Apparently , all the additives listed between the brackets are supposedly referring to enriched macaroni product . I 'm not sure if this is a marketing ploy or not but in my opinion , I would not call this a wholesome food and by my count bacon is at least 7 down in the list.This is an okay product for making a flavorful side . However , being that I found the taste just okay , the ingredients nutritionally questionable , and the prepared product soupy , this is not a food that will be found in my kitchen .	-1
I am not opposed to quick convenience food , and there are even a couple of flavors of the Knorr pasta sides that I enjoy using in casseroles . This one , however , I could not even stand to eat three bites . The overpowering `` bacos '' smell -- not BACON but the famous soy bacon substitute for salads -- drove me to open a window while it was cooking . And then upon tasting , I found nothing but a thin , fake cheese taste and that fake bacon taste . Terrible , no one in my family ate their portion , absolutely do not recommend .	-1
I have liked and used Knorr soups for years . They have a full flavor . I tried this pasta and it was bland to say the least . I added vegetables , powdered cheese , more pasta ( since so many reviewers said it was too watery ) and bacon bits and it still was barely acceptable . I 'd give it one star but the spouse liked how I had modified it . This is just not up to Knorr 's previous standards .	-1
Although I love other Knorr products , this pasta side unfortunately is not one of their best items . The flavor is inconsistent-there is an overwhelming fake smokey flavor , with small bits of bacon ( that are much like crunchy bacon bits ) . There is not enought parmesan flavor , I ended up adding quite a bit of real parmesan to the finished product to make it taste better . Also , this is supposed to be a side for four people-that is a too generous estimate . At the most , this will be a side dish for three people.I made this with chicken broth instead of water-normally that improves the flavor of the recipe-however , it did n't do that much good in this case.A really good pasta side is Pasta-a-roni . This is available for 1.00 at many grocery stores . It comes in many different varieties , including a parmesan blend . Pasta-a-roni is easier to fix , and has directions that you can follow that make sense . That is what I would recommend , rather than this product . Knorr pasta side , smokehouse bacon parmesan is a waste of time and money .	-1
Truly not what I would expect from Knorr . Their rice products are quite good , but the noodle ones are needing a lot of improvement , especially the Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan . Going exactly by the package directions , the final product was very watery . I ended up tossing a handful of dry noodles to absorb the left-over liquid . I got the texture to an acceptable level but the taste was still pretty awful . It had some sort of icky aftertaste to deal with after the icky forward taste.The reason for the 2 stars and not 1 star is because one of my kids will eat anything if noodles are in it and I ended up scraping my noodles off my plate onto hers to eat , so they at least did n't hit the garbage can .	-1
This pasta has a good texture and there are bacon bits as advertised , but all I could taste was a mine of salt . Also you have to watch it when preparing , and it 's mine burn a bit ( if you use milk and have an electric burner ) .	-1
The taste of these noodles were very bland . I did n't really taste any `` bacon '' flavor , and the parmesan cheese taste fell flat . Plus , the noodles smelled weird while they were cooking , which did n't add to our enthusiasm when eating them . In fact the only people who did finish their servings of the noodles were my two year old twins , and they would n't even eat a second portion . My family has used and enjoyed other flavors of the Knorr pasta ( particularly chicken flavored ) but this Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan was a huge bust at our dinner table . I could not recommend this flavor to anyone at all .	-1
Upon opening the bag of Knorr Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan powder , I was taken back by the intense smell of artificial bacon bits . It was not appetizing , but I grew up eating bacon bits on salad , so I gave it a shot . Unfortunately , that is about the only flavor in the easy to prepare dish . There is not much cheese flavor , and going by macaroni and cheese prices , I do n't think it would have been too costly to add . As a whole , it tastes like bacon bits and salt sprinkled on plain pasta . It might work marginally well as an addition to a recipe , but even for that I would suggest looking at other soup or spice packs .	-1
My GF is German and loves Knorr products . If she has a choice , she prefers Knorr . Not this time I cooked it on the stove top with water , milk and butter . After bringing to a boil I added the product . After a few moments it smelled pretty good - more Bacon than Parmesan . Took about 8 minutes until all the liquid was gone and I had a thick sauce developed , and the pasta was done . At this point it smelled `` eh '' - not something where you 'd say `` Oooh - that smells great ! '' In the mean time I cooked some chopped up chicken strips ( about 1/2 `` cubes ) then added them to the pasta . Stirred in and let sit for a couple of minutes . Divided up into two bowls and we dug in . My GF hated it . She thought it tasted fake and bland . Her comment `` Man am I disappointed in Knorr . '' One star.Me - I would not get it again . If this was served in a restaurant , I would not send it back - but I would not order it again . Three stars . It was more `` smoke '' than anything else , not much bacon and way too artificial.Serving size : One main course for an adult , four small sides .	-1
My family enjoys a nice pasta dish now and then , and having a readymade product on hand to serve as a side or even to doctor up for a main dish , is a good idea . This was a simple dish to prepare . You just need a few ingredients , chicken , onion , parmesan cheese , and green peas . It was quick and easy to make.Unfortunately , I felt the taste was a bit average . I had to doctor it with some fresh basil to give it a flavor , but even basil did not counteract the insubstantial quality to the noodles , the bacon-bit taste of the bacon and the overall cafeteria quality of the dish.I thought it was merely okay . I would not buy this again .	-1
Watery as opposed to creamy . Bacon smell was horribly fake . Noodles pure white flour . The only nutritional value comes from added chemicals . This sounded like it would make a great side dish . I am very disappointed , and I do not recommend this product .	-1
I usually love Knorr products , but the Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan Pasta Sides simply did n't match up to the quality I expected.I made the pasta dish according to directions , and the sauce simply would not thicken as it was supposed to . I ended up with a creamy soup over noodles that were okay , but not the best.The flavor was not true . It simply tasted like bottled smoke with bacon bits added . Not my cup of tea.This is one time I can not endorse a product .	-1
The package has a dialogue box and arrow saying `` great taste of real bacon '' and then an arrow pointing to what I suppose is bacon . I sure did not see anything in mine that looked like real or even artificial bacon.The taste was very artificial and off putting , even though I made the recipe on the back , adding chicken and peas . It would have been very good except for the off putting artificial bacon taste . I love bacon and am adverse to something that does not taste like the real thing .	-1
Thai Sweet Chili Pasta Side , its neither Thai nor sweet nor chili and barely pasta.I know Thai food , and while I did not expect to be eating a gourmet international meal out of a paper bag in 7 minutes , I did expect it to taste like food.1 1/2 cups of water , one tablespoon of vegetable oil , bring to a boil , dump the weird fish food smelling dried pasta and dried vegetables into pot , simmer for 7 minutes and you have a bowl full of disappointment.It has the strangest texture , like gummy plastic . It tastes of freeze dried and paper , an odd after flavor of green pepper . `` straight from a restaurant menu '' well only if your restaurant is in Guantanamo Bay . Its gross.I can not even recommend this to build up your storage of dried goods for the zombie apocalypse , you will eat this and throw yourselves into the arms of the walking dead .	-1
The Knorr Pasta Sides Thai Sweet Chili tastes great but smells disgusting . Before we opened the package , it made the cabinet smell every time we opened it . I wonder if another package leaked on it , because a sealed package really should n't smell like that.Once we opened it , the entire kitchen and surrounding rooms immediately stunk like some kind of funky mix of spices . The rest of the family quickly began complaining , and we had to open windows . Cooking it made the smell much worse . I was very skeptical that it could possibly taste good with such a nasty smell , but I was determined to try at least one bite.I started with one bite with the expectation of throwing the rest away , but I took another and another . It tastes great . After lunch , I was out of the house for about an hour . When I returned and opened the door , I was assaulted with the stench once again despite having left 2 windows open in the kitchen . Even a couple hours after that , the whole house retained the smell.It tastes so good and smells so bad . I could n't possibly bring this back into the house . Maybe , it 's something to cook when you go camping .	-1
I am not what you would call a picky diner , and I love almost anything with an Asian accent . That being said , the Knorr Thai Sweet Chili pasta sides failed to pass my most basic test : `` would you ever deliberately put this in your mouth again ? `` While described as being in a `` Spicy Sweet Chili Sauce , '' my overwhelming sense was simply that the taste was sour . There 's a hint of sweetness , but not enough to counterbalance the pucker factor of the tartness . As far as spicy heat , there was no initial sense of it - though after a few bites , my tongue discerned a slight warmth from the `` touch of real ginger . `` The Lo Mein Noodles are indistinguishable from basic spaghetti , and taste somewhat pasty . And you 'd better eat or serve them while they 're fresh , as the noodles will soon bond into a single gelatinous mass.I found the addition of some chicken , peanuts , and hot sauce an improvement ... but truthfully , I 'd still have been better off adding those condiments to a 15 pack of Ramen . In general , I like Knorr products - but this one is n't going back on my shopping list .	-1
When it is just as easy to make it from scratch ? In fact , not only as easy , but way better tasting.This can be as simple as buying lo mein noodles and a bottle of Thai Sweet Chili sauce and mixing to taste . Add some chopped scallions and carrot , or sugar snap peas , or whatever veggies you have on hand -- or none at all . It would still be better that this packaged stuff . Get creative and do n't buy a bottle of sauce , just toss a little Sriracha sauce , quality fish sauce , vinegar or lime , and a bit of sugar and you have your own version of it . If you like Thai flavors , you should really stock these items in your pantry anyway.The noodles in this packet turn out wimpy and the seasonings have no pizzazz . Pass it by . It 's not like it is a true `` convenience '' food that you can whip up for lunch in the microwave at work .	-1
I was really hoping to like these pasta sides . This is my least favorite out of the 3 I 've tried I did n't really like it all . I also was looking for something a little faster to cook but you still have to wait on the pasta to fully cook . You can tell that this is a cheap boxed type meal by the flavor . Would n't recommend buying .	-1
This side dish was too sweet for me . it also takes a bit to prepare . I think with Thai food I will stick to my favorite local restaurant , this pasta was n't even close .	-1
These noodles were a disappointment to me . I was kind of looking forward to a tasty side dish that was easy to cook . I got the easy to cook part , but the taste was not great . It was an overpowering flavor , but not in a good way.The real problem with this product is how unhealthy it is . At a whopping 350 calories per serving , you have to expect there is a lot of sugar , and there is -- sugar is the next ingredient after noodles . Even worse , there is a lot of salt . One serving has 820 mg of salt , which is more than a third of the daily recommended allowance.You would be better off cooking some `` real '' noodles ( which might take 8 or 10 minutes instead of 7 ) and then add your own pepper sauce according to your personal taste . Skip this one , it is n't worth it .	-1
I did n't enjoy this side dish . It really was n't similar to any kind of Thai dish you 'd get in a restaurant . It tasted more of artificial flavor and salt than it did of actual Thai sweet chili . And that makes sense - check the sodium content ... it 's very very high.I would n't serve it or eat it again . It was n't repulsive ... just not good .	-1
I made this today for lunch and it was easy enough to prepare using the microwave . Took 9 minutes instead of 12 and that probably depends on the wattage of your appliance.I honestly did not care for it . I did n't get that it had a Spicy , Sweet Chili Sauce taste - I got some bitterness and an aftertaste . I notice other reviewers added different condiments to enhance the taste and maybe that makes the difference or maybe this particular side dish is just not for me.I am glad I got to try it , but I would not buy it .	-1
Easy to prepare via the microwave method , however , I found the finished dish to be a bit to spicy for my taste .	-1
I love spicy flavors , but this simply tasted wrong . I 've been trying various flavors of the Knorr Pasta Sides , and I have yet to enjoy any of them .	-1
The absolute worst sweetener there is . You have to use tons of it and it leaves a very bitter aftertaste . I wanted to use this to make some low carb teriyaki chicken , ended up having to use real sugar to cover up the horrible taste this left .	-1
the spout clogs each time and is very maddening ... ..no time to waste on this bottle and its flawed spout design ... do not plan to ever order from these ppl again	-1
The taste just does n't cut it . It 's sort of like watery sugar . But is not satisfying in any way . Go with the real thing ( sugar ) or your favorite artificial sweetener .	-1
I have a ultra-sweet tooth . I need to wean back that need , but this stuff is n't going to help . I agree with those who said it 's not sweet at all . Not only that , it 's not just sweet but has a fruity flavor which I know sounds silly when you consider the name of the product , but the fruity note is artificial and overwhelms what minimal sweetness there is . Taste is so individual it 's possibly pointless to review food products , but for what it 's worth ( nothing ? ) there it is ! The search continues ! ! ! !	-1
I 'm all about healthy , but this did not work out for me . I tried to make gluten free bread by a previous recipe , but is was't good . I probably need more practice.I will let the experts use this one !	-1
Whether or not you like these I suppose depends on what you are looking for in a diet bar . The amount of protein in them was enough to keep me filled between breakfast and lunch , which was a good thing . The amount of fiber and protein and the low amount of sugar ( compared to some diet bars ) is pretty good as well . The taste leaves something to be desired - the chocolate part was n't too bad but there was just the smallest hint of raspberry , I would have preferred more raspberry taste.My biggest issue is the texture and this seems to be the issue with any protein-rich bar that I have tried . This one was like eating chocolate-flavored cardboard , I just did not like the texture at all . If I were in a pinch and could n't find anything healthier to eat I would likely reach for this , but if I had a choice of something else healthier I would definitely pass this over .	-1
I expected much more from Lipton ! The soup did not mix well with hot water and even with frequent stirring was very lumpyThe texture was sticky and bit like paste , add more water than directed and it tasted watered down but had lumpy 'paste ' spotsThe soup tastes very starchy ( the noodles ? ) and the noodles never really softened up and had a chewy texture that was off-puttingThe soup tasted 'old ' even though it was well within its expiration date	-1
Lipton really messed up a great soup that has been the same for over 30 years . The `` bigger noodles '' taste cheap , doughy and they take forever to cook . The also absorb all the flavor from the broth . And where is the parsley ? I see it on the box ... Should n't it be in the soup too ? I call that false advertising ! The nutrition label is also dumb , why does it list `` 3 tablespoons '' as ONE serving ? Is that for mice or humans ? I refuse to buy this product until they change it back to the original noodles . Whoever at Lipton thought this recipe was okay should seriously lose their job over this . 6 people in my house ALL said this soup tasted wrong and wanted to know why I switched brands . The noodles now fall apart when I use them in a recipe and they never used to do that before . Whatever was done to this product , they made it completely disgusting tasting and it tastes nothing like the original.Changing a classic product is never a good idea . Coca-Cola learned the hard way then they tried to change their formula and everyone hated it and demanded they change it back . Sound familiar ? That is pretty much what Lipton has done here . They ruined a great product that everyone used for years . I hope Lipton gets SO many complaints that they change the soup back to the original formula and NEVER try to do this to their customers again . What were you thinking Lipton ? And did the person who taste-tested this have ANY taste buds at all ? Or do they just assume customers are dumb and we wo n't notice a gross , cheap , bland tasting substitute ? BAD JOB LIPTON ! Never buying this soup again unless they change it back ! **side note ... They supposedly LOWERED the salt content but for some reason it tastes a lot more salty and I find that odd . If they were trying to make some `` health '' decision for me , FYI ... I do n't CARE about the salt content of the old product . I eat healthy and I do not salt my food so if I have some salty food once in a while , I do n't have to stress over it . I also POUR off most of the broth so that cuts a lot of salt . OR I add one packet to a huge soup pot with chicken and vegetables . With 10 cups of water , instead of 4 , this would cut the salt per serving by a LOT ! With the `` new '' soup formula , the soup I used to make is bland and does not taste the same . I hope they change it back SOON ! This change is horrible !	-1
As a pregnant woman with a side effect of morning sickness all day and a perpetual bad taste in her mouth , I was looking for gum without artificial chemicals and without sugar . I was so hopeful this would be good , but one taste and I spit it right out . I wanted a nonmint gum , and now I know why . Pomegranate and mint should not be combined as a flavor choice .	-1
DO NOT waste your money on this . This is not gum , I do n't know what it is . The little pellets are SUPER hard , no matter how long you chew them , and they do n't even taste good . The package sounds big , but it is actually really small . Like smaller than those plastic packs of real gum at the gas station , and twice as expensive .	-1
It did n't taste like apple to me . It had a sharp spicy-like taste to it , so do n't expect a sweet apple flavor . It wo n't satisfy a sweet craving ,	-1
I ordered Fiber One 80 Calorie Chocolate Squares and received instead 4 boxes of Hershey 's Cookies and Cream Cereal.. I will never order from this company again and they make it so hard to return it is not even worth it . I will just give it away !	-1
If I had know before I ordered this that it contained sweeteners and was instant tea , I would of saved my money . I 've only had the spiced chai and it looked so weird in the cup that I opened the K-cup to see what was in it . To my surprise , there were no tea leaves or spice - it was empty , which means that it was just an instant tea mix put in a K-cup and the price jacked up.Do n't buy .	-1
I used the 10oz water setting , which was a mistake . I got very weak coffee . When I used the 8 oz water setting it was better . I can smell the cinnamon more than taste it . It also tastes a little burnt , but not bitter . I drink my coffee black , unsweetened , it might be better with a little sweetener . It 's not bad , just not the rich coffee I 'm use to .	-1
If you like very weak coffee , than you might like this . I could only detect the very SLIGHTEST mocha taste and the coffee almost tasted like just hot water . I could n't return because it was a food product , so I made VERY small cups and that worked a little better . But I would not buy again .	-1
Too weak for me	-1
Trader Joe 's has a medium roast Winter Blend coffee which is delicious . I do n't normally like flavored coffee , but this was exceptional . You could see the chucks of spices in the coffee . Unfortunately , it 's not for Keurig.That 's why I decided to try this coffee . First and foremost , this is definitely a & # 34 ; flavored & # 34 ; coffee , meaning you do n't see any chunks of cinnamon in this coffee . And it SMELLS like artificial flavoring . It has that cloying smell you get from flavored coffee.Finally , the coffee itself was WEAK , very light in color , and generally unappetizing . I drank about 4 sips and poured it out.Thumbs down .	-1
This coffee is very weak . It is even weak when made on the smallest Keurig cup setting , which would normally produce a more concentrated coffee . There is a slight cinnamon taste but to me , it 's like drinking a blonde coffee with a dash of cinnamon . Even its appearance in a clear mug shows how weak it is . I do not like it at all .	-1
These k-cups are ok when brewed at the lower setting , but are just flavored water when brewed at the Keurig 's 'grande ' level . However even at the lower level these are n't very robust .	-1
As a fan of flavored coffees and cinnamon , I had high hopes for this . While the smell was nice , with the cinnamon flavoring . The coffee had a burnt taste . I kept drinking , hoping it would get better , but it 's definitely not for me . I wont be getting this flavored coffee again .	-1
I 'm not really sure why this coffee is so highly rated -- it did n't really seem strong enough for my tastes . I think if they made the coffee stronger it could have had an alright taste to it but given how it was I just wanted to get back to my normal brew and forget about these.The only thing worse than having coffee you dislike is having 39 other cups you 're stuck with . I 'd suggest avoiding unless you really like toasted cinnamon enough to give it a shot or if you like weak coffee .	-1
it 's good to add flavor to your sauces , but dint think it will replace the real thing in any way	-1
Got this as a free sample . Knew I would n't like it , but my wife thought she could tolerate it , believing it would remotely resemble chocolate milk . Nope ! One sip and it went straight into the trash . She wondered if it was infant formula with flavoring , sugar , and extra vitamins . If so , she feels sorry for all the babies on formula . No wonder they 're giving it away . Truly disgusting .	-1
My children thought it was terrible . My chocolate loving son made a horrible face and could n't get it down so I wo n't be rebuying it .	-1
These were tiny , tiny portions that were not even equal to one regular brownie . They also did n't really taste all that great . Wo n't buy again , not worth it .	-1
I did not care for these at all . Did not have the taste I would be looking for in a good brownie .	-1
Nothing interesting in these like fruit , nuts , or seeds leaving a somewhat preservative flavored oatmeal bar . I like Kashi ( honey , almond , flax ) quite a bit and I 'm going to try some others , however , I wo n't be ordering these again .	-1
Just ordered some of this , the chocolate flavor . Terrible disappointment . I understand they 're-formulated ' this gruel , which apparently means they watered it down to make more money on what may have previously been a tasteful and worthwhile product . This stuff is thinner than skim milk , but unfortunately with not as much taste -- unless you count the unpleasant powdery aftertaste . I 'm recovering from some pretty major surgery and had hoped it would be a good boost of the protein I need for healing and suitable alternative to the 'Boost ' manufactured by the inhumane Nestle Corp. food-like product engineers . It is n't . Probably too much trouble to send it back , so maybe I 'll just put some real , organic chocolate syrup in it and try to choke down the remaining 11 containers I 'm stuck with .	-1
I just went to another site to find out the nutritional info for this product as it is not listed here on Amazon . Per serving : 255 calories , 32 carbs -- Unbelievable ! No vitamins and lots of additives with corn syrups , etc . I still stick with my 90-140 cal protein powders ( Body Fortress and Syntrax Nectar ) Sure , I have to mix them but it only takes 5 seconds . 0 - 7 carbs and delicious and much much less $ per serving . I saw the coupon for this orgrain and thought I 'd check . No way will I use this Orgrain . I want good stuff and I 'm apparently using the best .	-1
It 's just my personal opinion but I really do n't like the taste of these , although I like the taste of both strawberries and cream . Somehow this flavor tastes a bit like plastic to me . I recommend buying one of these at a grocery store and trying it before you order a dozen of them . Maybe you 'll like them . As an aside , the chocolate and the vanilla Orgain are both very tasty .	-1
I tried it at Sam 's Club for much higher price . It tasted like bleached cheap stuff . I have used coconut oil for decade , many different brands . This is more chemical taste . Great claims for such bad taste .	-1
I purchased these , along with another , less expensive brand to compare . I have to say , the less expensive brand is head and shoulders above these . And , what the heck is that stuff coating the nuts ? I 'd also like to know how it is , I received both brands of rice cracker mixes in the same box , and the Kirkland had a lot of crushed pieces in the bottom of the bag , but the 8 Mate did n't . That tells me it was not a shipping problem , but rather a quality and care problem with Kirkland . Besides , some of the pieces are so sweet they reminded me of candy . I like my rice crackers to be mostly savory and salty ... with maybe just a hint of sweet . I will not purchase these again .	-1
Do n't believe the 5 star reviews ! They only review items for Julian Bakery , they are paid shills . Do a google search on this company , low carb scams dot com , lots of info on the owner and his deceitful ways . I bought some of the bread , it was the worst stuff I 've ever tried to eat . Then I started checking out this company , and found out that the owner lies about carb counts , so who knows what else he is lying about . If company ethics mean anything , do n't support this company .	-1
These are terrible , and went back . Given the price , they are doubly terrible . Crumbly , dry and unlike any cookie or biscuit , I am amazed they made the market .	-1
These were just bad . They had zero flavor , and the texture made you feel like you were eating ash . No cookies are better than choking these down .	-1
WEAK ! Take `` Hot '' off the label.Maybe I got a bad batch but this tastes like watered down Tobasco.There is zero heat.I gave this only one star because it has been falsely inflated by WAY too many 5 Stars.Disappointed.Edit to add one star .	-1
HIT OR A MISS . MINE WAS VERY BLAND . NOT EVEN SALTY . BUT THE NEXT DAY I WAS PUFFY . TRIED THE WHITE CHEDDAR AND THE BUTTER FLAVOR ON POPCORN .	-1
Truly nasty , no flavor ! Kernal Seasons is the best , No way to sprinkle it on my popcorn because it has no sifter top	-1
Would never purchase this product again as it does n't take like white cheddar at all . It 's entirely to , to mild . I like a mild white as a popcorn topping but this disappoints in ever way .	-1
This is not real cheese . It is a chemical confection that does n't even melt like cheese . The label makes it sound as if it comes from a `` real '' farm . It does not . I wonder how far fraudulent Amazon storefronts have to go in mislabeling products before they are arrested for consumer fraud .	-1
It tastes bad so I returned it . Too sour ! Was really looking forward to a Stevia drink without chemicals in it .	-1
My mother loved this but I found ot had a strange off aftertaste . Better off just eating a small amount of real candy . Their other chocolates are better though .	-1
