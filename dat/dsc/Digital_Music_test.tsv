I bought this cd on a spur of the moment . I 'd heard `` I Know Who I Am '' on subterranean on mtv2 , and thought it was ok ( not great . ) When I saw the album for $ 5 , I decided to give it a try . I love the alternating male/female vocals on many of the songs , and it has just enough stomping guitars . `` Honest '' may be one of the best ballads I 've heard in a long time . Buy this album .	1
I have been having a hard time lately finding new good music to listen to . I just found out about these guys . This band has a very diverse sound . The first few songs are very upbeat and then the rest of the songs are more chill and they switch between lead singers . I recommend listening to all of the samples instead of one or two . Overall , good band and I am glad I found them ! I have n't had a chance yet to listen to their second album yet but I am looking forward to it .	1
7 to 9 winners found here , although I ca n't say any of them is really a classic . But it 's great fun for a season or two !	1
I LOVE this album and band . Now for all who compare this band to White Stripes ... Yes there is a SLIGHT and I do mean SLIGHT similarity ... but also something utterly different as well . This album is Fresh and timeless ... has sounds from the 1960 's , 70 's , 80 's and 90 's as well as today ... .utterly brilliant . Love it . Folks who would like this ablum would be anyone who likes Led Zepplin , The White Stripes , Wolfmother , Bloc Party , The Pixies , Primal Scream , and indie/Rock Bands in general.thanks !	1
This group is DIFFERENT.I 'm amazed , and I 'm buying this CD TODAY.I just saw them on Letterman , and heard there song `` Home , '' and LOVED it.I ca n't wait to hear the rest of the record after seeing this band .	1
With Oasis technically breaking up I needed a new favorite band . Many auditioned many failed . Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros did n't audition , they just sang songs that made them happy . that made me happy , I love this band and loved the follow up album Alexander	1
When it 's time to name the Song of the Year , list-makers who do n't put `` Home '' in their Top Five may come to feel ... sheepish.That 's because there 's a medicine show coming your way , guaranteed to cure whatever ails you . And the best service someone like me can provide is to prepare you for it . That 's simple : you 're going to dance . Pretty much from minute one . With whomever you 're with . With strangers . And with a massive , how-did-this happen grin on your face.Maybe you could know a bit more . Like : there is no `` Edward Sharpe '' in the 9-to12-member band that that calls itself Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros . Alex Ebert . the lead singer , looks like a guy who 's just back from an ashram in India : underfed , long hair up in a bun , loose white shirt and pants , and bare feet . The female lead singer is so enthusiastic and awake -- - a knockout in a thrift-shop dress , cardigan sweater and running shoes -- - that you ca n't take your eyes off her . `` A beautiful woman , '' Proust wrote , `` is an invitation to a happiness she alone can fulfill . '' That is Jade Castrinos.I love everything about this crew -- - its large cast , its back story , and , most of all , its simple formula for happiness.Okay , so the lyrics are mostly unabashed cornball ( `` Alabama , Arkansas/ I do love my Ma and Pa/ But not as much as I do love you '' ) . I love how the song starts with a whistled echo of an Ennio Morricone theme from a Clint Eastwood western . I love the band and its soloists . Most of all , I 'm a sucker for the refrain : `` Home , let me come home/ Home is wherever I 'm with you . `` I have read the reviews , and it 's the same deal in every city -- - Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros are a traveling Woodstock , a throwback to the great lost days when bands thought of themselves as families and concerts were foaming whirlpools of joy.Who are they ? How did they happen ? What do they mean ? Pass the peace pipe , kids , and I 'll tell you a story that may make you -- - depending on your age -- - nostalgic or jealous.We start with Alex Ebert , lead singer of a band called Ima Robot . He is cynical and negative , drunk on a daily basis . Desperate to be someone else , he breaks up the band , leaves his girlfriend for a small apartment with a blow-up mattress and joins Alcoholics Anonymous . A year later , Ebert has written many pages about Edward Sharpe , who was `` sent down to Earth to heal and save mankind -- - but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love . `` Then , in downtown Los Angeles , he meets Jade Castrinos . They `` hit it off and made a run for freedom . '' They start writing songs . They acquire a school bus and a band.Want yet another reason to mourn Heath Ledger ? He gives the band seed money to record a CD . Which they do -- - using a 24-track tape machine from 1979 and bargain-basement reels of 2-inch tape . '' In July of 2009 , the launch party for `` Up from Below '' was , unsurprisingly a benefit , with the money going to help the Gulu Widows Group of Uganda start a farm to sustain their community . And then they went on the road ... .The young ` uns and the folks who missed it first time around know hippies only as caricatures . Ebert 's much closer to the real deal : `` If we go to your town , I can imagine a time when we 're rolling up to a parking lot and parking the bus and setting up the stage and the bleed from the audience to us , it 's just not even there . It 's like a river , you know ? `` Audiences do know . And they jump in . Ebert : `` The night I went into the crowd [ at the Echo ] and everybody was singing , you could almost feel their hearts . `` That 's pretty much any night for this band . Because what it offers is not being sold anywhere else -- - a reversion to childhood . He 's a child and she 's a child , and they have a childish belief that their love will last forever , and the band feels the same way . That 's a lot of permission on one stage.Enduring love , a family of friends , a place that felt like home -- - when I stumbled out of college into the Real World , I craved nothing more . Escapism ? Maybe . But also a recognition that the Real World is n't the only one , that there 's a door over here , and all you have to do is open it to feel the freedom you had as a kid.See Edward Sharp , if you can . But for the sake of your soul , at least spend a buck on the MP3 download of `` Home '' and keep it near you . Because there 's always a psychic emergency ahead . And if there 's a better First Aid kit , I do n't know it .	1
Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros : Up From Above.I never heard of them until about a year ago , and I came back acrossed the album again this week , and I feel back in-love with them . 40 Day Dream is my favorite song by them , if you like Panic ! at the Disco than you will like some of their songs , esspeically the '40 Day Dream ' Song featured on this album .	1
I spotted this on Amazon 'recommended for you ' bit and saw the positive reviews here and decided I would give it a go . That was the best thing I did that day , I am new to the glorious sounds of 'Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros ' , but I intend to become fully acquainted after hearing this.They have been compared to the hippy culture of the late sixties and I do n't think they would disagree . They reminded me in places of the aural joy you get in some of the songs of that time and the outpouring of love from shows like 'Hair ' etc . They all have a go at singing and have a plethora of instruments including harmonica , accordion , trumpets and even a viola , but I am sure they have a few tambourines too . This is in no way cacophonous ; it is a beautiful blend of nostalgia that is brought up to date exploding with the joys of life . I am a bit gushy there , but you have to hear it to get the full thing.Opening track '40 Day dream ' is all percussion , keyboards and a riff that will pull you along effortlessly , but the mood changes on every track . 'Jade ' is a low key love ode to , well Jade , who sings and plays percussion with the Zeros . Track 4 'Carries On ' is my current favourite , but I love all of them . What I really appreciate is the way they all burst into song at the chorus a bit like Polyphonic Spree used to do , but this is miles better . 'Kisses Over Babylon ' is Spanish I think and just oozes emotion and 'Black Water ' just keeps haunting me . This will not float everyone 's boat , but if yours do n't move then you really aint in touch with your inner child and have probably never hugged a tree let alone climbed one . I 'm off to listen again and do some recreational medication ( or have a cup of herbal tea - peace ) .	1
Edward has a great voice . This band is edgy , indie and refreshing . Definitely more upbeat and has very interesting lyrics .	1
It took awhile for this song to grow on me , but now I love it . `` I got ta feeling , that tonight 's gon na be a good night '' It puts me in a good mood , and that 's always important in a pop song . I grade this song an A , my only criticism is that the `` chorus '' should have been a little more prominent through the end of the song..other than that I love it .	1
when i would have a party i would always have this song then me and my friends would jam out all night long	1
Purchased this song specifically to add to my exercise playlist , as I need something real up-tempo to get and keep my workout going .	1
one of their best i liked the superbowl performance and it is a twist to a classic song give it a try you might like it	1
This was an MP3 download and it 's a great song for my exercise playlist . A well-produced song from a talented band . And hey , it 's just fun to dance to .	1
I LOVE THE CHORUS ! I LOVE THE VERSES ! I LOVE THE BLACK EYED PEAS ! I LOVE THIS SONG ! I LOVE !	1
This is a nice piece of music with a fun beat . I bought the music and play it often from my music library.It gives me a good feeling and lightens up a room . I can recommend this to anyone.My favorite radio station played this often during the day . Then my radio died and there was nothing for it butto go and buy the music . You might like to buy more of their music . This group has steadily climbed up in the music ratings .	1
Anther great come through amazon ! I really love this song , but could n't make myself pay a few dollars on one song , when I found it here , it was n't but a dollar , ca n't beat that if you wanted to ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
A great song to blast in your car or to put on when you cleaning . Fun and fast and makes you wan na dance !	1
Boom-Boom-Pow is the kind of unique dance music that comes along every so often . It has an infectious beat , one that makes you want to get up and start bopping away ; throwing your hands and fists into the air to accentuate every Boom Boom Pow sung by the Black Eyed Peas . The song is all about ENERGY , Dance Energy , getting onto the dance floor and letting yourself get into the music , letting yourself get lost in the music . With every beat of the song , your heart , your entire body beats to the beat.As such , this song , Boom Boom Pow clearly delivers.The downside : the lyrics do contain a few cuss words . This song is not differentiated into a Radio Edit and an Album Version . You only get one version from Amazon ; the explicit version . So Parents , if you 're buying this for your young children thinking that you 're going to get the Radio Edit version , think again . You 're going to get the Explicit Version , with every profanity clearly heard over the heavy beat of the music . What kind of profanities ? Just the word we consider to be the profane slang word for excrement , poop , feces , crap , dirt , bowel movement , BM , bum nuggets , caca , crapola , dump , scat , and turd . We all know what it is , so if you do n't want your little ones saying it , or repeating it , look elsewhere for the Radio Edit of this song .	1
Boom Boom Pow is one of 2009s most catchy songs . Why so much people hate it , i have no idea . This was my favorite song for a while . It deserved to be # 1 for all that time .	1
Anyone who appreciates roughy yet melodic female voices and a very talented meaningful writer of her own songs , plus being a talented player of multiple instruments , will MOST CERTAINLY enjoy and appreciate this cd by Brooke White . For me , what separates her and brings her near the top of former Am . Idol contestants is indeed her versatility in the music arena . And she does them ALL well ! That is why I feel this CD is well worth the purchase , and that she is deserving of and would be most appreciative of that & her fans . Read her liners & song lyrics included in the neatly & uniqely packaged CD , & you 'll understand why . `` High Hopes and Heartbreak '' , enjoy !	1
Brooke White is a singer you 're going to fall in love with . I loved watching her perform on American Idol . Brooke sure does have talent . I think Brooke is something different , I like the way she sings to your heart , and gets your attention while listening to this album . I love the songs on this album . I think many people are going to like this album . Brooke reminds me of Jewel , so if you like Jewel you 'll like Brooke . High Hopes and Heartbreak is a laid back album , this is a CD you can relax to.My favorite songs on High Hopes and Heartbreak are:1 . Out of The Ashes2 . When We Were One3 . Smile4 . Radio Radio	1
Love it or hate it , for better or for worse ( and you 'll find many opinions on either side of the fence ) , `` American Idol '' has really shaped the pop music culture in this first decade of the 21st century . And quite frankly , I really have n't found anybody who has appeared on that show to be grilled by the caustic Simon Cowell , the `` dawgish '' Randy Jackson , or the seemingly under-the-influence Paula Abdul that really makes me believe in its supposed good points ... at least not until now.Brooke White , who , although she did n't win , did manage to finish inside the Top 5 during `` Idol '' 's 2008 season , did , in fact , stand out from practically everyone else that ever appeared on the show . With the seeming obsession amongst the `` hip '' judges towards overwrought vocal showboating , be it R & B ; , country ( yes , I do mean you , Carrie ! ) , or Top 40 pop ( Kelly Clarkson ) , Brooke caught everyone 's attention with a very credible version of Carly Simon 's classic 1972-73 # 1 smash `` You 're So Vain '' , and revealed a 1970s California singer/songwriter sensibility . And with HIGH HOPES & HEARTBREAK , her second album overall ( after the pre-Idol SONGS FROM THE ATTIC ) , she channels that influence into her own style , based in the past but with a refreshingly contemporary sound.Randy Jackson , getting away from the `` dawg '' days of `` Idol '' , serves as executive producer of this album ; and with the exception of `` Use Somebody '' , a Kings of Leon cover , everything on HIGH HOPES & HEARTBREAK was co-written by Brooke . If her voice does n't have quite the heft of those she emulated during `` Idol '' ( Carly ; Joni Mitchell ; Carole King ; Linda Ronstadt ) , it 's nevertheless much better than average , with no extreme vocal gymnastics , arrangements redolent of Southern California 's glorious past , and a solid songwriting intelligence ( `` Radio Radio '' ; `` Hold Up My Heart '' ; `` California Song '' ; `` Phoenix '' [ an ode to her home town ] ) that you really do n't get a whole lot of anymore on the radio.For those contemporary radio listeners who just want something different , this should really be essential . And for those who missed , and still do , those glory days of 1970s-era Los Angeles , Brooke White 's retro approach is just the ticket .	1
My youngest daughter and I were hooked on Brooke White from the first time we saw her on AI . I had `` High Hopes '' for a return to an era of the great American Singer~Songwriter . In Ms . Whites first CD , `` Songs From The Attic '' there were some glimpses of what kind of artist she could become , it was a very good , but not quite great CD.Here in `` High Hopes and Heartbreak '' , Ms. White comes over as a great new talent , one who has been hurt and overcome the pain , and put it out in wonderfully emotional performances . I think `` High Hopes '' is destined to be a favorite of those who are having fixable relationship issues , as I said there is a lot of remorseful hurt here , so much that I hope Ms. White is pulling these lyrics out of somewhere besides her own relationship.This CD is really so good and so emotive , that I am thinking I would really like to go see her live , and I am getting a bit old to be seeing concerts with kids singing , but I doubt she will be playing at any Jazz festival I 'd be likely to be attending , so I may have to make an exception.So here 's the deal , `` High Hopes '' may not be `` Tapestry '' , but she is getting closer , and I think she will get there.4 * Good stuff !	1
This American Idol top-five finalist 's first post-show album slipped out with surprisingly little hoopla , and that 's a shame , because she brings her retro-70s singer-songwriter vibe in spades . There are hints of country in the piano and guitars , but White relies in large part on the Carole King style she brought to her performances on AI . Unfortunately such a nakedly retro album would have little chance in the modern radio market , and so her producers have dressed things up with orchestrations that , despite the drippy George Harrison-styled guitars , tend to generic modern.The album opens promisingly with the retro styling and starry eyes of `` Radio Radio , '' a tune whose quivery emotion and chorus hook would fit perfectly between top-40 hits by Carly Simon and Gilbert O'Sullivan . White 's heartfelt emotion threads through other tracks , but occasionally finds itself competing with the orchestrations . Particularly egregious is the dance beat and disco style of the title track . Still , she uses her upper range to add terrific emotional trills on `` Out of the Ashes , '' and sings with a directness that is enchanting . Similarly , her lower range on `` Phoenix '' is tremendously warm and inviting . White co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs , offering up mid-tempo numbers and piano-based ballads , and adds a cover of Kings of Leon 's `` Use Somebody . `` Having taken the indie route , rather than releasing her album through the AI machine , one might have hoped she 'd stay true to her unique musical assets . Unfortunately , the record industry 's ADD dictates that you find a sound already friendly to radio , rather than build career momentum over three or four albums . That said , there are enough of White 's charms here to please those who enjoyed her pre-AI releaseSongs in the Attic , even if they 're occasionally buried or sidetracked by the production . What made White compelling as an American Idol makes her compelling as a recording artist , just not on every track . [ 2009 hyperbolium dot com ]	1
Brooke White was the `` Carly Simon/Carole King '' finalist on `` American Idol '' a few years ago . Back then , the judges complimented her for her throwback , singer-songwriter sound . What America never got to hear , though , was White 's debut release after Idol , `` High Hopes & Heartbreak . '' This CD is chock full of first-rate songs and great production ( courtesy of Randy Jackson ) . Song for song , one of the best albums I have heard in years , from the title track to `` Radio , Radio '' and `` Use Somebody . '' Sample it and buy your own copy .	1
I honestly thought we had heard the last of The Fruit Bats when Eric Johnson joined up with The Shins ... I 'm glad I was wrong.The Ruminant Band is very much in the same songwriting style as their other albums , only with a little more instrumentation this time around . Electric gutiars and pianos are all over this album . Do n't worry though , there 's still the trademark acoustic sound throughout , like the song `` Beautiful Morning Light '' which sort of borrows from The White Stripes ' song `` We are gon na be friends . '' `` The Hobo Girl '' is a nice little Beatlesque piano romp of a song while `` The Blessed Breeze '' sounds like a song that should 've been on The Shins ' first ablum.All in all , this is a good album , almost as good as their others , and a must have for any and all Fruit Bats fans.Key Track : Primiative Man	1
Eric Johnson , the singer-song writer and main force behind Fruit Bats has been busy in recent years , touring with the Shins as a touring guitarist and also being involved with Vetiver . But finally , after the excellent 2005 album `` Spelled the Bones '' , and again many personnel changes , his band returns and turns in its 4tuh studio album . `` The Ruminant Band '' ( 11 tracks ; 40 min . ) continues the free-flowing indie-folk-rock sound of earlier albums , as if time has stood still . The album kicks off with a great `` Primitive Man '' , followed by an equally enticing title track . `` Beautiful Morning Light '' is a beautiful 'quiet ' song , just Eric and his acoustic guitar , and if you wonder where Fleet Foxes got some of their inspiration , look no further . On `` The Hobo Sound '' you find yourself back into a honky-tonk country bar 100 years ago , and it works great . The up-tempo `` My Unusual Friend '' features some electric guitars , to spice things up . `` Feathered Bed '' reminds me of early Neil Young , somehow.In all , this is a most excellent and long-delayed return of Fruit Bats . At 40 min. , this album clips by in no time , and you 'll find yourself playing this again and again . I hope to see these guys at some point in concert , and ca n't wait to see how these songs will resonate in a live setting . Meanwhile , if you wonder where you can hear Fruit Bats , look no further than WOXY ( BAM ! The Future of Rock and Roll ) , the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country , bar none . Meanwhile , `` The Ruminant Band '' is highly recommended !	1
Over the course of a decade , Eric Johnson has lead the Fruit Bats through musical terrain both poppy and experimental , mixing Americana folk with bubbly indie , alt-country with melodic chamber-pop . With their fourth release , The Ruminant Band , Johnson & Co. continue to live up to their reputation as musical blacksmiths and the title itself . A ruminant is a mammal with four stomachs , giving it the ability to digest and re-digest food to extract the maximum amount of nutrients from a single bite , and with The Ruminant Band , the Fruit Bats have again created a record of many disparate angles , Johnson 's viewpoint on the past forty years of music chewed and re-chewed into a distinctly Fruit Bats release.Johnson has always been a hard talent to pin down , but his penchant for combining many different styles into a seamless whole remains intact . It 's been four years since the Fruit Bats ' last , but those four years ( four stomachs , anyone ? ) , which have had Johnson become a member of the Shins and the Fruit Bats fall by the wayside , seem to have only ignited Johnson 's creativity further . The Ruminant Band runs the gamut from classic rock ` n roll in the Neil Young vein to light summer pop reminiscent of Elephant 6 groups , and while nothing here is mind-blowingly original or particularly revolutionary , it is a fresh , solid collection of intimate alternative.Opener `` Primitive Band '' stomps along a ` 70s rock groove and a completely unfettered solo , while guitars ring and twang like the Allman Brothers on the titular track and the country-fried , fuzzed-out `` My Unusual Friend . '' Johnson 's vocals , which call to mind a nasally mix between the Minus 5 's Scott McCaughey and Kevin Barnes with a more country bent , stay in a higher register for most of the time here . His rather twee , always emotive pipes make a hokey chorus like `` I 'll never snow on your parade / I 'll never bring a cloudy day '' on the excellent `` Tegucigalpa '' an earnest promise rather than a corny sentiment , and stand in perfect contrast to the rugged , full-bodied instrumentation on display throughout.The album peaks in the middle , beginning with the wistful acoustic strummer `` Beautiful Morning Light , '' which would have sounded perfectly at home on Fleet Foxes ' debut . `` The Hobo Girl '' and `` Being On Your Own '' are the record 's highlight , the first rollicking along a honky-tonk piano melody and a campfire sing-a-long chorus , while the latter is a jaunty pedal-steel exercise with a syncopated barroom piano backbeat.The Ruminant Band is a collection that could be looked at closely , noting the intricate licks and gospel shading of `` Feather Bed , '' the soft carnival synthesizers on closer shuffling closer `` Flamingo , '' or the way Johnson 's vocals occasionally bend towards the darker in lyrics like those on `` Singing Joy To The World . '' But it 's best looked at as a summer album , one that rides along an open , instinctively American highway into a future uncertain , but one defiantly promising and undoubtedly optimistic . In its celebration of music past and present , from the rangy guitars and pounding , Fleetwood Mac-esque piano riffs to Johnson 's undeniable modern pop sensibilities and jangly , sun-soaked melodicism , The Ruminant Band is a record that without a doubt recycles , but makes sure to waste nothing in doing so .	1
Not quite as ethereal as the transcendent `` Tripper '' and cheerier than the countrified `` echolocation , '' `` The Ruminant Band '' contains sweet , highly infectious , acoustic-based songs that are among the Fruit Bats ' best . One after the other , these melodious songs reveal a band hitting its stride in a big way.As an adjective , `` ruminant '' means contemplative , meditative . Though `` The Ruminant Band '' has plenty of tuneful spark , it would n't be a Fruit Bats record without poetic , reflective music . Singer-songwriter Eric D. Johnson creates mesmerizing vibes and tones -- even his catchiest , seemingly fun songs have an underlying melancholy that give the compositions added weight.About halfway through , the barroom piano on `` The Hobo Girl '' and `` Being on Our Own '' call to mind `` White Album '' -era Beatles . Elsewhere , the intimate guitar strums on `` Beautiful Morning Light '' and `` Singing Joy to the World '' ( which mentions Three Dog Night playing at the fairgrounds ) sound like they 're being played by your best friend . `` The Blessed Breeze , '' meanwhile , is positively gorgeous , a No . 1 FM radio hit in a perfect world.Beautiful lyrics , virtuoso electric guitar ( including some well-placed slide guitar ) , heartfelt singing and bouncy piano on several tracks for added kick make `` The Ruminant Band '' a truly sublime CD worth hearing .	1
Wonderfully anachronistic , it sounds like a lost great album from the 1970 's . A near perfect album front to back and even includes a few guitar solos . Yes , guitar solos in 2009 , and they 're good ! Part of the familiar feel is songs like `` Flamingo '' that seem to reference the piano sound from Neil Young 's `` Harvest . '' Also , a song like `` The Ruminant Band '' recalls a famous Doobie Brothers guitar lick . And even further , the album includes a more memorable ode to eternally long lost young love , `` Singing Joy to The World , '' which might be placed alongside similar great love songs like Big Star 's `` Thirteen , '' Wussy 's `` Trail of Sadness , '' and even Bob Seger 's `` Night Moves . '' A great record that tastes good on vinyl .	1
Colbie Caillat did awesome with this cd . Not only are the vocals amazing but the lyrics and the beat to the songs . I rated this 4/5 because I like this cd , and it was really worth it to buy it . Great job , Colbie !	1
`` Breakthrough [ Deluxe Edition ] '' is currently selling for the same price as this album . All the extra songs on the Deluxe edition are tacked onto the end of the album . If you are considering buying this album , you have nothing to lose from buying the Deluxe Edition instead . I have listened to both this edition first , and later listened to the Deluxe edition instead.As for this album , well , it 's slickly produced but has quite a good few songs on it . My favorites are , in order on the album , `` Fallin ' For You '' ( 4 ) , `` Droplets '' ( 6 ) , `` Fearless '' ( 8 ) , and `` Break Through '' ( 10 ) . As you can see , the best songs are spaced out well in the first two-thirds of this album , which allows you to get to know the filler in between . And the filler is n't merely filler , in my opinion . So I rate this very good , although the slick production may turn off some fans . Specifically , the lullaby-quality folk-tinged songs that Colbie is best known for , such as `` Bubbly , '' are n't apparent on this album due to the layered , slick production of these songs - except for `` Breakin ' At the Cracks '' ( 12 ) , which in my opinion is not one of the stronger songs on this album.In fact , `` Begin Again '' ( 2 ) is so overproduced that it ends up sounding like a country song . All it needs is fitting hokey country lyrics and a steel guitar or banjo - then it would be a run-of-the-mill Nashville song . `` Breakin ' at the Cracks '' ( 12 ) is the only song among these that does have an acoustic instrumental quality . For some people , there were too many cooks in the kitchen producing these songs , but I do think most of them end up sounding catchy and they do hold up to multiple listens . I 'll give it a 4 out of 5.Anyways , go check the Deluxe edition already .	1
Colbie Caillat 's second album Breakthrough is filled with a collection of pop melodies that will sure delight Contemporary radio listeners or those who miss the semi-mellow renderings of yesterday , in particular , the 1970s and early 1980s . Indeed , it is no surprise , especially with the 12 tracks that were produced by her father Ken Caillat and Jon Shanks , the album has that mellow acoustic tinge within each song that is reminiscent of not only of a time but a place , the California sound.The pop music listener will not go wrong with the memorable lyrics and Colbie 's upbeat vocals , especially with the first few tracks and thereafter , `` Begin Again , '' `` You Got Me , '' `` Fallin ' For You , '' `` Rainbow , '' and `` Runnin ' Around . '' But the rather emotionally charged songs off the album have to be the title track `` Break Through , '' with its very Fleetwood Mac feel , harmonies and vocals and `` I Never Told You . `` With Colbie 's back to basics approach to songwriting as well as others who follow in that tradition , it is an enjoyable respite from other genres of music that tend to be overproduced . And with that in mind , Break Through is one of those albums that can be played anytime more than once and one that you simply can not help but want to come back to .	1
Colbie 's initial offering , `` Coco '' , was well received , to say the least , and this should be , too . She may have matured a bit , but not enough to no longer be `` Colbie '' ... a beautiful young girl , with a sweet voice , who makes us feel good . A guy listening to a girl sing about relationships will either think `` I wish it were me '' , or `` Thank God it is n't me '' . Natasha Bedingfield is the first , and so is Colbie . You 're glad she 's `` Fallin ' For You '' , happy to `` Begin Again '' , eager to `` Break Through '' , and thankful that `` You Got Me '' . Even when a cloud or two darkens the sky ... '' It Stops Today '' ... '' Breakin ' at the Cracks '' ... we feel like everything is going to work-out OK ... she needs me back , and I 'll run fast to get there ! In a record store full of depression , sunshine is really welcome ! ! ( Of course it 's not always clear-cut ... Pink makes me think `` Thank God it is n't me , but it sure might be fun to find out '' ) ! The album production is all we could ask ... great back-up , excellent sound , nice booklet , cardboard case ( if you care ) . With some young singers , we look forward to the growing-up process , knowing ( hoping ? ) that their artistry will improve . With Colbie , I 'm not so sure ... I think she 's found her niche , and kind of hope she stays there . ( OK ... nothing lasts forever ... listen to Carole King attempting at 65 that which was the purest nectar at 25 ) . Colbie is a real joy ! If you liked `` Coco '' , you 'll like this . Promise .	1
Her first CD was basically Colbie , a guitar , a microphone and several catchy songs . Here , she 's surrounded by highly skilled studio musicians and top-notch production values that give the songs polish and depth but little personality . The star is still Colbie 's voice and solid songwriting skills , and it 's all very pleasant , but after 3 times through , very little of the material stands out or creates a unique identity . Overall , an above average effort that wears well but quickly fades from memory .	1
This is one of MC 's best albums ever ! It sucks that her beef with Eminem kind of took over the press she was getting for this album but thats ok . If people ignored the crazy media stuff and picked this album up they know this is a banger . My favorites are `` Obsessed '' , `` Candy Bling '' , `` Hate You '' , and `` Angel 's Cry '' . This album has great beats and fun lyrics and comes with a cool Elle Magazine booklet all about MC . The only downside to this album is MC 's `` singing '' . On some songs she was n't even opening up her mouth and I could barely make out what she was saying . She was trying to sound sexy with the baby talk but it was n't working . Overall this is a great album and if your an MC fan ( old or new ) you will enjoy this .	1
September 29th , 2009Mariah 's 10th studio album Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel is a slight grower . You might not love it initially but at the very least some tracks will grow on you if you have liked any of the recent work she 's done with Island Def Jam.Is this her best release ? Not by a mile . That title belongs toDaydream ( 1995 ) . But every track has something to add to the collection and flows very easily into the next . The lyrics on the album are OK to occasionally great ( see `` H.A.T.E.U . '' and `` Angels Cry '' ) . For modern Mariah nothing is bad , nor should you be surprised by any of the content.My favorite track here by far is `` Angels Cry '' which is towards the end of the disc . The song is a piano-woven ballad with a backbeat and vulnerable lyrics like we 're used to from Mariah . I could see this being on a future greatest hits collection for sure . The surprising `` Betcha Gon Know ( The Prologue ) '' shows the darkest side I 've probably seen in Mariah . It provides an excellent , descriptive opener but is n't completely what this mainly love-themed album is about . Other standouts include the highly anticipated `` H.A.T.E.U . '' which is one of the few ballads on the album ( and is one of the best ) , the stomping `` Standing O '' , the lush `` Languishing ( Interlude ) '' and the bouncy single `` Up Out My Face '' .The only problem I have with this disc is that it is almost pure mid-tempos . Mariah goes fast on a few tracks and there are like 4 or 5 ballads . The rest of the tracks are neither slow or fast really , they are at a medium tempo and start to blend after a while . Not that they sound exactly the same but I think that 's an issue.I 'm a huge fan of Mariah and expected a lot of this album . I anticipated it for months and months and months after the slight disappointment ofE=MC2 . The vocals here are n't bad at all and to be fair they are less whispery than they were on Charmbracelet . To all of the ones worried that her voice is n't gon na be the same as it was in the early-mid 90s - it 's true , it wo n't be that good again . And I 'm fine with that . Her voice does n't deter me much at all on this effort ( so try not to listen to the haters ) . There are also a lot of her prized whistle register notes.4.4 stars.DOWNLOAD : Angels CryH.A.T.E.U.Betcha Gon Know ( The Prologue ) Languishing ( Interlude ) Ribbonupdate : I expected `` Angels Cry '' to be epic and I 'm barely disappointed . I 've owned this album since its release date ( went to Wal-Mart early in the morning ) and have listened to it over 50x through . I 've edited this review so many times over that it 's getting ridiculous ! ; ^ ) If I was to rate it these days I 'd give it a solid 4.4 out of 5 so rest assured who have n't bought it yet . GET IT.DO N'T FORGET TO RATE HELPFUL ( OR NOT ) .	1
Giving WHITNEY a RUN for her MONEY ! A Game Changing Album Masterpiece Since Butterfly ! The RETURN of the REAL VOICE ! Mariah Carey is one of those artists that lives and breathes music . She has been one of those few artist who are consistent and releases a new album pretty much every two years.Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is Mariah Carey 's new masterpiece and it 's one of those rare albums that an artist can have a few times in their career . This album is reminiscent of Butterfly . It 's something different , something new , and yet it 's still classic Mariah Carey.Mariah usually does n't break the formula and always has her debut single as the first track on the album and then releases a ballad as the second , but this time around she has opted to have it be track number two . The album gets off to a great start with one of my favorite tracks `` Betcha Gon Know '' and then gets right into the fast paced energy of `` Obsessed . '' The album is pretty mellow and most of the tracks are semi-ballads , or mid-range up tempo R & B ; tracks . Obsessed is probably the only track on the album that is very upbeat , so to speak . Almost every track on her I can listen to without skipping , so that speaks volumes in itself . Betcha Gon Know , Obsessed , H.A.T.E.U. , Up Out of My Face , are ridiculous R & B ; tracks that are saturated with strong drug like hooks that just reels you in from the get go . I think Mariah has really channeled her creative energy into creating a splendid album that teeters on borderline masterpiece.I loved E=MC2 more then i did Mimi and feel a lot of the tracks were radio friendly . However , she did work with many different producers which lead that album to have a feeling of `` Being all over the place . '' Also , the fact that Cruise Control or Migrate was not the second single was also a big reason as to why the album did n't go ten times platinum . But on her latest release you do not get a sense of an album was all over the place . She works with two of the same producers on the entire album , so there is n't a feeling of a compiled mess on MOIA.Mariah has stated herself that she is giving BUTTERFLY on this album and in some respect , yes and then some , no ! The album definitely runs more fluid then her last album , but she does n't work with former longtime collaborator , Walter Atansieff . There is also no production by longtime friend Jermaine Dupri . I wish there were a few JD tracks on here because MC & JD always have great chemistry & always churn out the hits ! If you 're a fan of Mariah Carey , Pop music , R & B ; grooves then this album is right up your alley . U get a wonderful small ELLE Magazine booklet with her new album & its cute . Plus , you also get the music video for Obsessed . For ten bucks with all these extra - I am a happy camper . As stated before , Mariah really is an artist who lives and breathes music . You can tell this by the simple fact that she releases a new album practically every two years . Unlike Whitney Houston who seems to release an album once a decade . But I am a fan of both . But Mariah definitely blows `` I Look Too You '' out of the water with her new release . U GO MARIAH ! Give Whitney a run 4 her MONEY ! The entire album is a winner & i rarely skipped from track to track , but the Stand Out Tracks : Betcha Gon KnowObsessedI Want To Know What Love IsH.A.T.E.U.Standing OUp Out My FaceImpossibleAngels CryImpossibleAngels Cry	1
Mariah Carey is back ! Nope , not just Mariah , but her usual good music . I was so disappointed with E=MC2 because each song did n't really have any originality and most sounds alike in some way . The only good thing about that album was that Mariah sounded like she had fun . However , let 's move on to `` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel . '' This new studio album seems so personal to Mariah . The lyrics are so easily understood and indulged into . And also this time , the music is more original than the music she produced in the past . `` Emancipation of Mimi '' have been my favorite `` new Mariah '' era but I have to say that `` Memoirs '' is better than `` Emancipation . '' The album was very enjoyable from top to bottom . Songs that really stood out in the album were `` Standing O , '' `` Obsessed , '' `` Angel 's Cry , '' and the rest of the songs are equally as great as three.I am so proud of Mariah and will continue to support her ! I have enjoyed her music ever since I know music . Highly recommend this new album .	1
Mariah Carey really did her thing with this album ! Out of all her albums this one tops the charts ! ! Her voice is incredible on each and every song . She tells a story in every song and I truly believe she 's telling her stories past , present and future in this album.I bought this cd when it first came out and I have not taken it out of my cd player yet . I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album ! It 's hard to pick a list of songs that 's my favorite . I will say H.A.T.E.U . is one that I constantly keep on repeat ! This album is HIGHLY recommended for Mariah fans..HIGHLY !	1
On Monday the 21st of September I happened to receive an advanced copy of this marvelous release from the greatest vocal talent of our generation ; Mariah Carey ( a quick note to all you sticklers who think I 'm robbing the artist of her due by getting an ` advanced ' copy , I pre-ordered this from Amazon as well , so she got paid ) . After listening to this non-stop for a week ( and by non-stop I mean NON-STOP ) I can honestly say that I have not been this excited about Mariah since I first heard ` Butterfly ' ( which still remains the greatest R & B ; record of all time ) . This is by far her most consistent and cohesive album since ` Butterfly ' and is certainly going to win her quite a few Grammy 's this year ; guarantied.For anyone who was a little put-off by her last effort , ` E=MC2 ' ( an album I raved yet after repeated listens have found to be a solid yet less than truly impressive offering ) , have no worries , for ` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ' strips away the ` rap ' influences and delivers a solid R & B ; album that is reminiscent of late-90 's Mariah . Think ` Daydream ' with the modern touches of ` Butterfly ' . While ` The Emancipation of Mimi ' was truly Mariah 's comeback ; ` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ' is a superior album that will prove to be a career highlight for the diva above all other divas.The two singles off the album ( the Eminem directed ` Obsessed ' and the Foreigner cover ` I Want to Know What Love Is ' ) really help establish for the listener just what this album is all about . It has the layers of cheeky fun we expect from the same artist who dropped ` Honey ' on us all those years ago , but it also possessed the polished classiness that comes from years of refining your skills.Starting the album off fiercely , ` Betcha Gon Know ' is just that ; fierce . The track recounts Mariah 's dismay as she uncovers her lover involved in a tryst right there in her own bedroom . With pulsating beats that compliment Mariah 's delicate vocal delivery , this is a priceless way to open the album . What is wonderful about this album is that it really takes full advantage of what it has under its sleeve . By opening and closing that album with two of the best tracks on the album ( not the best , but two ` of the best ' ) it gets us hooked immediately and keeps us intrigued even when it 's nearly over , making us yearn to listen to it all over again ( which is what I 've been doing for a week now ) . ` H.A.T.E.U . ' is my personal favorite track on the album ; simply devastatingly perfect . Mariah has such a stunning control over her vocal 's here , going from soft whispers to deep and commanding sincerity and then escalating up to her dynamic powerful range without ever once ` overdoing ' it . The track is also a beautifully composed look at the death of love and the desire to make the one who 's hurt you feel even just a sliver of what they have put you through , with rich lyrical content that is moving and believable. ` Candy Bling ' has a coolness about it that carries the track from the stereo to your eardrums , resting easy in this syrupy sweet vibe that is easy to fall into . The snaps that help make up the musical melody are reminiscent of the feeling in your soul as you fall into Mariah 's trance and become engulfed in her manufactured mood . Tracks like ` Ribbon ' , ` Inseparable ' and ` More Than Just Friends ' take that classical Mariah sound and give it a modern update that makes it as relevant as anything accessible on the radio today , yet it remains slightly refined by Mariah 's otherworldly talents . ` It 's a Wrap ' has a laid back feel to it that suits Mariah 's vocals nicely ; even if I find this to be my least favorite track on the album . It is very ` Daydream ' Mariah ; for it possesses a familiarity about it that makes it almost slip beneath the rest of the album , which possesses a ` pop ' that this song does n't have. ` Up Out My Face ' is a fun , bouncy and energetic club ready romp that reminds me much of something off ` The Emancipation of Mimi ' or even ` E=MC2 ' ; like a combination of ` Shake it Off ' and ` Cruise Control ' . It is one of the most memorable tracks on the album , and it further proves that Mariah does n't need a think ballad to expose her marvelous vocal talents.BTW , that whole spill at the end about being Lego 's and having that Harvard graduating class of 2010 unable to put them back together is , in a word , brilliant.Next to the sublime ` H.A.T.E.U . ' stands ` Standing O ' , one of the most engaging and emotionally stirring tracks on the album . Mariah here again fluctuates with her vocal abilities , much like on ` H.A.T.E.U . ' except with a more upbeat musical arrangement which results in a very different yet equally satisfying sound . Just the way she hits `` I gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it '' is so reaching and affecting.Chills.What Mariah Carey album would be complete without a few heartfelt and moving ballads ? Well , leave it to Mariah to come through , giving us two beautifully composed ballads ( that 's not counting ` I Want to Know What Love Is ' ) . The first is ` The Impossible ' , which makes good use of its silky vibe and Mariah 's piercing whispers to deliver some of the albums most childish lines that work amazingly here , capturing the childlike purity of love ( lines like `` I love you like a milkshake '' may seem corny , but they are shockingly accurate when you consider the way true love makes one feel ; and that line about `` laying in the bed bumping Jodeci '' is flawless ) . Even better is the soaring ` Angels Cry ' which I 've even claimed to be the best song off of ` Butterfly ' , it 's that reminiscent of her most beloved work.So , my final verdict is this ; ` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ' is classic Mariah with all the right tweaks and twists to make it one of her most impressive and memorable efforts . Mariah has had her fair share of # 1 hits and high record sales , but this is certainly up there with ` Daydream ' and ` Butterfly ' as one of her best offerings to date . It flows effortlessly from track to track , as if each track was specifically written and placed for optimum listening experience creating a magical collection of superb R & B ; hits that will seduce and comfort you.Mariah Carey deserves nothing less than a standing ovation .	1
yo this cd is madd tight , and my boo is sexy as hell and deff a good singer not one bad song off this joint ... ..excellent ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Mariah Carey 's 12th studio album `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' is different from her most recent musical releases . Upon first listening to this release , I did n't like it . It lacked the upbeat , celebratory , playful Mariah that `` The Emancipation of Mimi '' ushered in ; the album did n't have as many radio friendly songs as `` E=MC2 '' had . `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' features a very mature-sounding artist . The pop/hip-hop sound that is heavy on her most recent releases , including the lead single 'Obsessed ' , is n't really present on this release . If I had to describe this to album to a Mariah fanatic , I would say this release is a hybrid of the ballad/slow jams from `` Butterfly '' , with a vibe of the `` Rainbow '' album . Vocally , it 's on level with `` Rainbow '' , `` Emancipation of Mimi '' , `` E=MC2 '' -- Yes , she still sings , and yes 'the voice ' is still there and very present but she stays in a mid-range/throaty vocal range with the high-notes being woven into the background rather than being up-front and on display . This may be a turn-off for some fans who want the Mariah Carey from the early 1990s back ; but I can say after a few listens , I think `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' has more of a backbone than `` E=MC2 '' and has a much stronger theme and concept that bring all the songs together , a strength that I felt was missing from `` Emancipation of Mimi . `` The Good : I like that this is Carey 's first real attempt at tackling a theme album . Each song deals with love or a relationship and in many ways , the album goes from heartache/breakup and pessimism toward finding love and a perfect lover to ending on a high note with , strangely enough , classic Mariah back on display with high notes , wide range and feeling more open and expressive . To me , the theme and the fact that every song deals with another aspect of love or a relationship made this album far more coherent and stronger than some of her more recent albums . In many ways , this is an album of ballads ; many that sound as if they 've been crafted over the course of the past few albums she 's done but are just now being released . I also enjoyed that finally Carey ventured into new musical territory . While `` Mimi '' and `` E=MC2 '' were good , they felt very safe and far too generic . The music featured on `` Memoirs '' is truly different ; you notice she 's taken a new musical direction from the very dark/moody 'Betcha Gon ' Know ' and on the gospel-tinged `` I Want To Know What Love Is '' and `` Angels Cry '' . There were only a few songs that felt boring . Unlike on `` E=MC2 '' , though you can tell Carey 's fascination of love and relationships is inspired by her personal life , the songs are n't all sappy and loving ; there 's the good love , the breakup , the anger , the hurt and optimism that comes with trying to find love and falling for someone all on display . Mariah 's song writing skills are also on display ; yes , some of the lyrics are simple and uncomplicated and a little child-like ( the many references and comparisons of love to that of food , for example ) but I found the music , lyrically and instrumental-wise , far more fresh and polished than on the past two or three albums.The Bad : One of my complaints is that while many of the songs are good , they feel as if they are building to something only to be clipped off or ended abruptly . 'More Than Just Friends ' is a fun , upbeat songs ( one of the few on the album ) and just as Mariah is getting into the song and letting her voice go , the song fades out and just ends and the next song starts up and leaves the last thought/song unfinished . It gives the album a big of a choppy feel . I 'd have liked it if the songs would have more easily segued into one another as 'Languishing ' fades into 'I Want To Know What Love Is ' . The sequencing of the album is okay but some songs felt a bit out of place in the line-up . To go from the moody/stirring 'Betcha Gon ' Know ' to the stark , hip-hop 'Obsessed ' when 'H.A.T.E.U . ' or 'It 's a Wrap ' better finishes the theme/thought introduced in 'Betcha Gon ' Know ' sort of perplexed me . Or , the album version of 'I Want To Know With ' edits out the sparkling , classic Mariah vocals and high notes in the closing section that 's present in the raido edit . Why ? Packaging wise , I was n't crazy about the cover or the fact that there 's a mini advertisement for ELLE magazine included with a feature about Mariah 's relationship with Nick Cannon and pushing some other products . I liked that this was 2-cds but I 'd have been more interested in either having more songs , or different takes , interpretations , remixes of various tracks than to basically be given the 'Obsessed ' maxi single . To me , it gives `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' a cheap , manufactured pure commercial product feel when that is n't the vibe of the album at all.In all , I highly recommend this album . It has a few 'imperfections ' but when you get down to it , I feel the music itself is some of Mariah Carey 's best work of the 2000s and showed how she 's maturing and starting to take a few more chances with her music . `` Memoirs '' feels like a bold statement and move for her ; there 's no carbon copies of the sound or music that made `` ... Mimi '' a big hit ; it 's less commercial than the radio-friendly `` E=MC2 '' . This may be what will make `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' either one of the best albums ( thus far ) of her career or the most underrated . Either way , do n't fall victim to the lack of promotion or bad press ; this album is not a flop , it is not bad , it is worth purchasing and listening to . Check it out.Listen To These Tracks : 'H.A.T.E.U . ' , 'Ribbon ' , 'It 's A Wrap ' , 'More Than Just Friends '	1
Indeed , Mariah 's 2009 offering had one thing wrong - the timing . Coming less than 18 months after E=MC2 , which was considered rather similar to the 2005 's acclaimed comeback `` The Emancipation of Mimi '' , even myself was not decided to give it a try . Apparently , I was not alone . Even with postponed release dates , `` Memoirs '' had a lesser commercial success than any of its two predecessors - and produced no No.1 single - something that the singer sometimes had too much emphasized in her career.This all aside , I was more than happy when I got a chance to listen to the album - Mariah cast all pretense aside ( the cover may be misleading , as there is no visible sign of breaking from the sexy uniformity of previous covers ) and made a classic r & b ; album , helmed by just one major producer duo , The Dream and Tricky Stewart . After a few listens it is really clear : Those who assert that this is the best Mariah since `` Butterfly '' ( 1997 ) are right ! The singer-songwriter 's knack for melodies is intact , as witnessed in the tracks like `` H.A.T.E.U . '' or `` Ribbon '' . The Dream and Tricky 's contribution is clearly audible as well , particularly on tracks like `` Standing O '' , which reminds of them-wheeled Rihanna 's super smash `` Umbrella '' . Less robotic than that 2007 hit , however , Carey 's album overflows with warmth , soulful grooves and is free of melismatic singing that used to put off many casual listeners.The lead single `` Obsessed '' is as catchy as the 2008 No.1 hit `` Touch My Body '' . Similar melodic and lyric motives show up every now and then , giving the album a satisfying sense of fulfilment . Finishing with `` I Want to Know What Love Is '' ( where the gospel choir is sounding strangely tame , as if going half-steam ) , the album is a testimony to Mariah 's often-underrated artistry and although it is probably not good enough to win new fans , it 's a cohesive bag which probably shows the singer in her real state , giving fans a chance to live things with her . Seems like marital bliss works well for Mariah ...	1
Mariah - just keeps getting better . Unlike the has-been Madonna , this music is fresh and high quality . Highly recommended .	1
Mariah is still talented but I would like to see her do more ballads and explore her vocal abilities . She is relying too much on her beauty and sex appeal to sell music instead . She now has a lot of talented competition . I think she is resting too much on her laurels and her reputation and the loyalty of her longtime fans of which I am one . I have every one of her CD 's ! and I will continue to support her and her music .	1
Here 's why I love Mariah Carey 's music : First and foremost , the role she plays in creating the music . She does not lay back and let other people write her songs for her . She writes 90 % of her material and has from day one . There is a reason that not many people cover any of Mariah 's songs . No one can do them justice the way she can . Yes there are other singers with range like hers and maybe they can even go as high in octaves as she can , but there really is no one JUST like her . From stepping on the scene when she was nearly 18 years old and to be still going this strong at nearly 40 says something . She has always played an active part in the creative process . The songs are truly HERS . While not possessing a 'perfect ' discography ( ahem , glitter ? charmbracelet ? ) there 's still no denying that Mariah 's talent is immense and she 's not going anywhere anytime soon . 'Memoirs ' is like a throwback to really great , classic r & b ; records of back in the day . I ca n't really compare it to any of Mariah 's other albums because its something different . Mariah 's voice has gotten this almost smoky quality to it that surely can only come from age . This is n't a bad thing at all though . It gives the songs this extra sultry , alluring layer ... I almost like it even more now than back when it was the ultra pristine Voice singing Vision of Love and Someday and Butterfly even . She has really come into her own on this new album.Do yourself a favor and listen to it from start to finish , as its meant to be . Mariah herself has said that this album is more `` story-like '' than any of her others -- she 's also said that it is her most personal and honest album to date.Before listening to this , I scanned the track list names and was kind of skeptical ... the actual song titles being kind of silly/cheesy at times . I looked at them and was almost expecting the worst , y'know like some obnoxious rap-collaboration that totally does n't showcase Mariah 's voice and songwriting . I was very pleasantly surprised when this did n't happen . So do n't let the titles discourage you.If I had to just use key words to sum this release up , I would say this : Smoothe , sultry , clever , original , catchy.I absolutely love this new album , and I hope it gets the appreciation it deserves . Mariah 's `` in love for the first time '' as she has said , and it shows . A happy Mariah equals sublime music.Highlights : Betcha Gon Know- Mariah witnesses the ultimate betrayal and plots her revenge -- '' Betcha gon know how it feels/When I get you back / Betcha gon know how it feels/When your heart 's been cracked/Betcha gon know how it feels/When we Fade to Black/ ... And you see your whole world collapse ... /I 'm a La-la-la-la-laugh '' , H.A.T.E.U , which stands for `` Having a Typical Emotional Upset '' , is a slow and sultry ballad that 's extremely addictive and trance like . The music/beats are reminiscent of Ciara 's hit `` Promise '' , but the lyrics and sentiment are completely different . `` I ca n't wait to hate you/Make you pain like I do '' . Obsessed has funny lyrics and a ridiculously catchy chorus -- `` Got you All fired up with your Napolean complex/See right through you like your bathin ' in Windex '' , `` I 'm a press conference/You a conversation/You a Mom & Pop ; /I 'm a corporation '' . In Standing O , Mariah mocks a shady ex `` You played the one that loved you the most/So here 's your Standing O '' . There are several others I could quote but you get the idea . All in all I would give it a B+ . ( Note : Die hard Mariah fans will definitely want to buy the physical copy and not just iTune this cd . The album packaging itself is beautiful and has a really cute `` mini magazine '' in place of actual liner notes . There 's lots of little personal Mariah tidbits sprinkled on the pages , and on the actual inside casing there are pictures of Mariah 'back in the day ' side by side current 'Memoirs 2009 ' photos ... she recreated 3 of her most famous photos , and it 's really cool to see as a big MC fan . )	1
Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , is Mariah Carey ' 12th studio album and her best since 1997 's Butterfly . The album has both some strong points and some weak ones as well . But overall the stronger songs really out shine any weak songs present here . The album starts out with the very mellow `` Betcha Gon ' Know ( the Prologue ) '' which is a song about catching her boyfriend cheating and vowing to get him back . Next up is the killer `` Obsessed '' with both killer lyrics and beat this was the reason why I got this album ( I did n't really care for her last two ) . `` H.A.T.E.U . '' is also a decent song too . `` Candy Bling '' and both `` Ribbon '' where both inspired and lacking . `` Inseparable '' a really sweet typically Mariah love song . The two songs are also worth a listen too with `` Standing O '' sounding like vintage 1990s Mariah Carey ( love how it sounds ) . `` Up Out My Face '' is a very clever it's-over-song I especially like the metaphors and the horns present on this song too ; and the Reprise I so wish it was a full remix of the song because the whole marching-esque arrangement is really good . The only two stand out tracks that remains are `` Angels Cry '' and a cover of the Foreigners ' `` I Want to Know What Love Is '' which both are really mellow and a great way to end the album .	1
Mariah gives you two CDs of great music her music makes you feel relaxed listening to her sexy voice +	1
Okay , my opinion ... the majority of the songs on this disc sounded alike . Outside of a note here or there , they really sounded the same to me . I did n't get it , yet it was a good cd to listen to and her harmony is still intact . Another gripe , the single `` OBSESSED '' ... .really ? This song was too young for such an established artist and it kinda did n't mean that much to me . I mean , it was a cute little tune , but it just was n't for her.Disc 2 : Remixes of the same song , in this case , `` OBSESSED '' , also did n't work for me , and after several spins , I just gave up . I think that had it been remixes of different tunes from the album , I could have warmed up to it more . Instead , it left me flat , because it became overdone.All in all , it was still a good recording . Better if you avoid the remix cd .	1
Mariah has already hit us with the summer smash `` Obsessed '' now she brings the cd that is sure to be on people 's playlist for some time to come . Whether it 's Betcha Gon Know , Standing O , Ribbon , Hate U , she more than varies up the song , vocals and everything else from track to track with ease and grace that continues to impress me . She writes from the heart and sings the same way..minus a track or two that i was n't into . Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel sets Mariah up nicely for the remainder of the year . With many radio worthy singles waiting to be released from her latest cd.This is one that is sure to be getting much play and sales for awhile to come . Excellent cd from start to finish even the interludes add a little something to the cd as a whole and normally i 'm just not a fan of them . But they really work here and i love it.5/5	1
I love Mariah Carey ! I always had , but let me focus on this record . I was listening to this album on Imeem but they removed the tracks . I was feeling the songs . Imperfections are in the eye of the beholder . You can see them as flaws , or as the very qualities that make us human - and that strive to be better people in search of a perfection that we know we can never fully achieve . The songs on this album shows Mariah exploring those aspects of our shared humanity with a rare depth , honesty and open-heartedness . The subject of this record is love at all its stages in our lives . Experiencing it for the first time . Losing it . Remembering its most painful moments , and also its times of greatest innocence and joy . Yearning for it . Learning from it . Growing as a result of its profound power . Finding it again and being grateful for so great so gift . And finaly , being humbled , filled with wonder and elevated by love 's mysterious ways . In that sense and more , this album is a full , immensely satisfying journey . She wrote and produced this entire album in collaboration with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart . This album is filled with sinuous grooves and instantly memorable melodies flow from track to track , while the wit and intimacy of the lyrics create the feel of one friend talking to another . As well-defined as each song is , This album plays with the beauty and consistency of a classic , start-to-finish album . She named this album Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel because she remembered that the Minnie Riperton album that contained `` Lovin ' You '' was called Perfect Angel . This album will sure be a hit like her previous releases .	1
Mariah Carey is back in a short little time , with Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel . This album is way better than E=MC2 . I really enjoy this album . I can listen to this album without skipping through songs , like I did on E=MC2 . I was hoping for her to show her voice more on this album . I wanted her to come back with The Emancipation of MIMI 2 . You 're either going to like this album , or not . I think this is a improvement , a step forward from E=MC2 , but a step backward from The Emancipation of MIMI . This is n't the best album by her , but is one on the good ones . I still think she can show her talent more than she has on this album . I say buy this album . This is one of my favorite albums of 2009 .	1
I was very excited for this album to come out many years ago . The song `` Obsessed '' was great , and I was hoping it would be as excellent as Mimi or E=MC2 . Unfortunately , when I listened to it , I hated every single song . absolutely hated them . to call it `` bland '' would be an understatement . After a few listens , I wrote it off and put it away . A few weeks ago , while discussing her last three albums , my friend Audrey told me in no uncertain terms that Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel was one of her best albums , and she loved ... . '' every . single . song . '' I laughed , told her she was wrong , but I promised to listen to it THREE TIMES in my car to & from work . The first listen , AGAIN , was awful , and I hated it . I really wanted to take it out of my player , but I remembered my promise . The second time , I was indifferent , and I kept it going . By the time I finished the third listen , I do n't know what happened . I started understanding every song and I grew to love them . This has never ever happened to me before . That CD has been in my car CD player since then and I 've listened to , and enjoyed it about 30 more times since.Oh Mimi ... .you sure did work your magic on me . And yes ... .I apologized profusely to my friend Audrey ! ! ! ! A short synopsis on the better songs : I enjoy the prologue , and obviously , I still love Obsessed . I have come to absolutely LOVE H.A.T.E.U. , Candy Bling , Ribbon , Standing O , Up Out my Face , More than Just Friends , The Impossible . I detest the interludes . WTF is up with those ridiculous ditties ? Nix'em Mariah ! They are silly ! If any of you can get to it , I really enjoy the bonus track that I found out about called `` Imperfect '' . good song .	1
Mariah Carey is back again and this time in a major way . Following the thoroughly disappointing E=MC2 , Mariah Carey has hit a homerun with her new release Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel . This album is comparable to The Emancipation of Mimi in my opinion and if you enjoyed that album then this one is in that same vein . Mariah 's vocals still sound great although of course she ca n't hit those notes she used to hit in the early 90s . The production is handled by some of the best , if not the best , in the business ; The-Dream & Tricky Stewart produce , write , and arrange the entire album . Needless to say that the album has that edgy attitude and tone that the tandem is known for . Towards the end of the album she finds her ballad magic again and it results in some truly remarkable songs.Listening to this album brings a huge smile to my face which is what music is supposed to do . Throughout listening to the album there was plenty smiles , snaps , claps , and foot tapping going on . It 's a mystery to me why this album was n't the hit it was supposed to be . Mariah 's not even Gold yet and that astonishes me ( even in the download age ) . But oh well , low sales figures does n't mean the album is n't good . I advise you to pick up a copy soon . 5 stars . *The album comes with a bonus disc of techno/disco remixes that are all horrible ... but if you like that kinda thing you might enjoy it . The booklet has all the lyrics as well as some magazine thing with lipstick ads and other useless trivia*	1
Over the last week I have been reading reviews , both professional and non-professional trying to get a sense of what the majority are saying about Memoirs . And while I typically do n't read many professional reviews when it comes to Mariah , I did come across a snippett of a review that I felt really says something.Allmusic states `` any Mariah Carey album carries a lot of weight -- fan dreams , commercial expectations , the prospect of genuine pop thrill , the star 's outsized persona -- and 2009 's Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is no different . `` Such a true and objective statement when it comes to Mariah . Memoirs is being touted as the modern Butterfly . Having listened to it first on her myspace page , I got the sense of where this may be true . Primarily because of the interludes and some of the club mixes . I really felt , as did a few others , that it was a cross between Butterfly and Daydream because that is when we got to see Mariah integrate pure R & B ; tracks on a predominantly pop cd.Make no mistake , Memoirs is pure R & B . ; The only thing pop about it from my perspective was the last track `` I want to know what love is '' . Memoirs is different in that she collaborated with the same producers throughout making the cd more cohesive than anything she 's done recently.Vocally , Memoirs showcases every moment in her career and I find that she easily weaves between different singing styles effortlessly , making this one of the most colorful vocal offerings that I 've seen . It is ever more clear to me how vocally talented Mariah really is.Lyrically , Memoirs is more hip , but I personally do n't feel that the hipness that she exudes is overdone or out of place . It is very current in this respect . Some , however , will not be pleased with Mariah no matter what she does unless she goes back to singing like she did in 1990 both lyrically and vocally . The interlude `` Languishing '' clearly shows that Mariah can sing songs like she did in 1990 , and while I enjoy those type of songs , I could n't help but feel that it could have been on any of Mariah 's earlier work . So I think I understand why Mariah does n't sing those type of songs anymore.Again , agreeing with Allmusic , a lot of expectations come from a Mariah cd . When it boils down , you will either love it or hate it . Personally , I love it . I too feel that it is better than E=MC2 . It is pure R & B ; and not as contemporary as Emancipation.Standout tracks : H.A.T.E.UBetcha Gon ' KnowAngels CryRibbonCandy Bling	1
As a Mariah Carey fan , I always get excited when I hear rumblings about getting new music from her . I was slightly disappointed with her last release E=MC2 but after hearing the lead single , OBSESSED ( which grew on me each time I saw the darkly comedic video ) , I hoped that I 'd enjoy the whole album as much as the single . I received my copy this past Saturday and have listened to the entire album a few times and wanted to add my two cents.First the superficial - the packaging . I 'm somewhat of a `` girly girl '' at heart so I loved the digi-packaging and the mini-Elle magazine included . I will always be obsessed with Mariah 's closet so any chance I get to see pix of it , it 's a treat ! Also the re-creations of her previous album covers was a fun touch - she looks so easy , breezy & happy in the new pix.On to the music - this album has and is growing on me the same way that CHARMBRACELET did and like with TEOM , I seem to have a new favorite track every hour ! On the first listen there were definitely songs that stood out to me in a positive way while others took a few listens for me to warm up to but overall this collection has been quite enjoyable to listen to . I 've said this about other `` veterans '' of this music biz but I applaud Mariah for still having enough `` fire in her guts '' to continue to put music out there for people to enjoy.Songs on repeat and ripped to my mp3 : CANDY BLING - despite the indulgent title , this is a really pretty trackANGELS CRY - this track reminds me of WE BELONG TOGETHER/DO N'T FORGET ABOUT US somewhat but I love everything about it both the musical & vocal production ( it also got me imagining a video treatment so I hope it gets a chance as a single ) LANGUISHING - this is a truly beautiful song , the lyrics & production are fantastic and my only regret is that it 's an interlude & not a full trackOBSESSED - this song definitely grew on me over the summer , it 's catchy and the beats do n't overpower Mariah 's vocalsRIBBON - once the digitized male voice stops and the song gets rolling I loved itINSEPARABLE - another song that is reminiscent of a Bryan Michael Cox track featuring a really pretty piano accompaniment but the booming beats used make it stand out differentlyUP OUT MY FACE - loved the way that the harder beats gave what could 've been just another pretty sounding track an edgeBETCHA GON KNOW - dark moody openerI WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS - solid re-interpretation of a classic tune but just as I was really diggin ' it , it fades outSongs that are growing on me but s-l-o-w-l-y : H.AT.E.U . - I like the vocal arrangement of the chorus but just do n't like it as much as a couple of the other balladsMORE THAN JUST FRIENDS - interesting arrangementTHE IMPOSSIBLE - personal lyrics	1
Now do n't get me wrong . This can never be called her best work , but it is still a huge improvement over E=MC2 ( or anything that she 's made in the 2000s , for that matter ) , and perhaps admitting that she is in fact imperfect may be an important first step towards regaining some of the credibility that seemed to be so lost during the last few years . To start with , she seems to have finally come to the realization that her music sounds more enjoyable without guest rappers , and though her voice is still mostly gone , she actually does try hard to show that there 's still something left of it on the tracks `` It 's A Wrap '' and `` Angels Cry . '' She also makes a surprisingly good ( though not superior ) cover of the Foreigner classic `` I Want To Know What Love Is , '' and in general , this album is more mature and less hip-hoppish than some of her more recent efforts . Unfortunately , there are still some imperfect aspects of the album . She has n't completely ditched the `` 40 pretending to be 20 '' personality , and the song `` Up Out My Face '' is pretty embarrassing . Still , I was fully expecting to be disappointed , and I must say that , for the most part , I 'm not .	1
I had previewed the album before buying it . I was n't impressed to say the least . It seemed boring and monotone . All the songs sounded the same . But I bought it anyway since I 'm a Mariah fan and have all her albums . I put the CD in my player 5 days later and hopelessly listened to it . To say the least , its one of my favorite Mariah albums , if not my favorite Mariah album of all time ! I love her vocals and the songs are really smooth and relaxing.10/10 !	1
This will be short and to the point . This new album is the best Mariah album since Butterfly ! When I heard the samples , I really felt like I was back in the 90 's and I have n't been so excited for a Mariah album since the Butterfly album ! Any fan of Mariah 's 90 's stuff , especially Butterfly , has no reason whatsoever to put this album down ! It really is a Butterfly part 2 ! ! Just forget all her albums since then , not that I do n't love all her albums but this is so much better than all her albums after Butterfly ! ! What really stands out here is the music itself has so many different sounds like you heard in the 80 's and 90 's ! ! Also , Mariah 's 90 's vocals are back finally on this album ! ! Meaning she does n't sound forced and she lets her voice sing more naturally that she has n't done in so long . The high notes especially sound so awesome and magical like you heard in the 90 's , like especially on the Butterfly album ! ! I just can not believe how awesome this album is ! ! Any Mariah fan should totally fall in love with it ! ! There 's NO reason whatsoever to bash it or say it 's less than what she can do . I can hear she put 200 % into this ! ! BUY IT NOW ! ! !	1
From the opener , `` Betcha Gon Know '' , Mariah reveals that she is an awesome storyteller . The song is very vivid , dark , and unforgettable . Everyone knows `` Obsessed '' a subtle dis to Eminem . `` H.A.T.E.U . '' is one of my favorites and apparently a favorite of many others as well . Many have stated that they feel the song is single worthy ( even though I disagree ) . Ironically enough too `` H.A.T.E.U . '' is now the album 's third single ( during the time of this write up ) . I feel this album is wonderfully written and executed . It has so many potential singles and I feel like Mariah and camp is not picking the right singles . I always feel like albums I really really like never pick the right singles . Maybe this is why the album is underperforming ? Anywho despite the few gripes I have about this album , it is my favorite of 2009 . I have not been able to stop playing this album . When I heard the samples awhile back , I liked those instantly so I knew I would like this album . I was n't expecting to like it this much though . `` Candy Bling '' is another favorite of mine and like many other reviewers have said , it is easy to get lost up in it . It also sounds great really loud in your car . `` Ribbon '' and `` Standing O '' are n't my favorites but their listenable . `` Inseparable '' is another big favorite of mine and a potential single in my eyes . `` It 's A Wrap '' is another favorite . I love the lyrics , Mariah 's vocals , and this song is definitely memorable . `` Up Out My Face '' is sassy and is like `` Shake It Off '' part two . `` More Than Just Friends '' is a breezy mid-tempo R & B ; jam that you can play with your windows down ( though it is cold outside now ) . `` Impossible '' is 90s R & B ; and it is another scorcher ! So many potential hit singles here it would be a shame to let this album slip through the cracks.Definitely recommended . Pick this up !	1
so what 's new on this album ? ? it feels more lighter than her previous albums and there are no guest rappers . nope ... .no jermaine dupri . Yet , it feels very generic . There are n't that many outstanding tracks on here . the lyrics on this album are more deep and personal ... well in a few songs . it shows mariah in different phases in her life like she 's writing a diary day by day . as she says , each song does have something for everybody . for people who are suffering from heartaches , drama , falling in love , or have mixed emotions ... .this is it . some songs take you back to the old mariah days . Some people think of this album as butterfly pt . 2 . It has the same fluff as Daydream . In all honesty , Memoirs feels more like a third installment of Butterfly ... a Butterfly repeat gone wrong . lyrically , the songs on here have the wit , humor , and sass as the previous ones , but I do n't feel like Memoirs is NEAR as good as Mimi , E=MC2 , or even Charmbracelet.1 . betcha gon know- '' it 's too dangerous to be in the vicinity where you are '' . i love that part . this song deals with heartbreak and pain . this song sounds pretty serious than her usual songs . in the background , you hear this little voice saying `` SLUT '' . how random . 5/52 . obsessed-at first , i was n't too impressed with this song to be honest . i felt it sounded like all the other songs with this auto-tune business , but the more i listen to this track the more i find myself enjoying the lyrics . `` why u so obsessed wit me , boy i wan na know ... lyin dat ur sexin me '' . the song is just humorous . mariah and her crew keeps denying that this song is about eminem ... but it 's just so obvious . come on now , look at the video . 4.5/53 . H.A.T.E.U.-woww ... beautiful song that tells how a seemingly , perfect fairy tale ended . it shows a more vunerable side to her . i can so relate to this song and i love the beats and her whistles . 5/54 . Candy Bling-i love candy bling ... it 's super cute and sweet . i think it would be a great valentine 's day song . this song reminds me of the great valentine 's day i had last year . such sweet memories . 4/55 . ribbon- '' i miss you ... to be continued '' . It 's just as sweet as the previous one but with rougher beats . i 'm loving the lyrics . i kinda like the distorted voice in the background but it 's a bit annoying . 5/56 . inseparable-it 's an average song with an okay tune . 2.5/57 . standing o- This song just sounds so bland to me . I would skip this one . 2/58 . it 's a wrap-this has this old school/70s rnb vibe . i love her `` do doo doo doo '' . BEST song on the album ! Why could n't she have more songs that could sound so amazing as this one ? ? ? 5/59 . up out my face-i dont care 4 the reprise , but it reminds me of high school . it 's a cool song to jam 2 with ur girls . it 's funny . `` talking bout u missin ur boo hoo hoo , you ai n't gettin it , you ai n't hittin it '' u tell em , mariah ! 4.5/510 . more than just friends- great sample , average song 3/511.the impossible-i love the jodeci sample . I get that she 's trying to pull a very sexy and intimate vibe , but it 's no Bliss or even Janet 's `` anytime , anyplace '' . 3/512 . angels cry-the beats kinda sound similar 2 `` i stay in love '' . the lyrics are beautiful . 4/513 . languishing ( the interlude ) -this song reminds me of classic mariah ... something we hav n't heard in a LONG TIME ! ! ! thank u , mariah ! ! ! thank u 4 bringin it back , but you could have made this song longer ! ! ! 5/514 . i want to know what love is- i grew up hearing the orginal and it 's my dad 's all time favorite songs . i was really looking forward to how mariah would sing this . now i 'm not gon na say that this cover beats the original . Compared to her covers , it does n't really hold up well like the others . I do n't like how she skipped one full verse and that she turned a classic rock song to an r'n'b/soul song that could very well be listed into some D-list movie soundtrack . In my opinion , she would have been better off singing a cover of MJ 's song `` You Are Not Alone '' since it would be more fitting for this album and since he had died recently . 4/5Average rating : 4.0	1
For longtime followers of Mariah Carey 's music , `` Butterfly '' from 1997 remains her most enduring work - a gorgeous collection of tracks that worked as a 'concept album ' , and also individually - and some of the lesser known works from the album - `` Fourth of July '' , `` The Roof '' , and of course , the seminal `` Breakdown '' , remain some of the greatest songs ever recorded in R & B ; history.Which is why `` Memoirs '' is interesting on so many levels . Not only has Carey decided to revisit her R & B ; roots , she also pays homage to certain key musical forces along the way , most noticeably Marvin Gaye , and Sade . Those influences permeate this recording , and while it can loosely be called a 'concept album ' , it is sequenced in breathtaking fashion , with every song in the right place , not a note wrong ; and Carey 's infamous whistle register arrives at just the right places.The great thing about Mariah Carey 's music is that despite the glossy and overproduced elements of her early 1990s work , she has learnt to go with the times and make music that is current , yet always with a hint of throwback . Sadly , her last two records , while being eminently memorable , were n't quite in keeping with her usually solid output ( I also consider 'Charmbracelet ' to be a winning CD ; though highly underrated ) . `` Memoirs '' corrects that , because it seems to reject radio-friendly pop , and rather immerse itself in the very root of R & B ; - some songs sound like love-children of Maxwell , India Arie and Erykah Badu , and this can only be a good thing.The Erykah Badu comparisons are also very valid on certain key tracks on this record . Shades of Mary J. Blige ( especially on a key track entitled 'Hate U ' ) are all over the place , and Carey indulges the more bizarre sides of her ( an entire two minute track is composed of a high school brass band repeating the same line ad nauseum ) , and her lyrics often veer into strange , almost transcendent madness . Consider this : `` Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this when I break ; If we were two Lego blocks , even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 could n't put us back together again '' . Granted , things are n't always this far out . On most tracks , Carey sings about what she knows - love and relationships ; but it wears thin after a certain point.However , the music often makes up for the dubious lyrical content . Lead single 'Obsessed ' is the worst thing here , and sadly , some of the interludes could have worked as full-fledged songs themselves . Prime amongst these is `` Languising '' , easily Mariah 's greatest ballad since the incomparable `` Close My Eyes '' from `` Butterfly '' . The songwriting here is stellar , and only serves to reiterate that when Carey does it right , she really nails it . This one track is easily mightier than the entire output of `` E=MC2 '' , and marginally better than most anything on `` Emancipation '' ( save for 'We Belong Together ' ) .Also surprising are song choices that open and close the album . The Foreigner Cover at the end does n't sound quite appealing in the beginning , but a repeat listen convinces you of its ' greatness , at least for the first verse and chorus . This is n't a terrific song to close any album with , but it sounds comfortable and inspired enough to hold everything that came before it . And the gems here are many - `` Angels Cry '' has a killer chorus that would do great as a commercial single , and `` Standing O '' is something that grows on you , much like the latter half of her previous album.Whats especially convincing about `` Memoirs '' is that Mariah is n't trying very hard to 'sell out ' or garner any more No . 1 singles ( whether or not that happens is of no consequence anymore ) . What she HAS done is create an album that rivals 1997s ' `` Butterfly '' in terms of novelty and creativity . The unfortunately titled `` Candy Bling '' is actually a stunning tune and lyric that acts as a befitting sequel to `` Underneath the Stars '' , and almost every song here some sort of reference point on `` Butterfly '' . For that alone , I can award this five stars.An artist in her element . Listened to purely as an auditory experience and not as a commercial product , this ranks very highly amongst Carey 's vast back-catalog . Five Stars .	1
Arguably stronger than 2005 's Grammy-winningThe Emancipation of Mimi - Platinum Edition , if slightly less fun than 2008 's underratedE=MC2 , 2009'sMemoirs of an Imperfect Angelmarks several departures and several new directions for the pop/R & B ; singer/songwriter . 'Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel 's ' title alone insinuated this would be a completely different Mariah Carey album than she 's done in the recent past . If 'The Emancipation of Mimi ' was her 'comeback ' after the incredulousGlitterand the forgettableCharmbracelet , and 2008 's E=MC2 sought to follow up that album with an album that had more 'hit records ' , 2009 's 'Memoirs ' recalls a personal Mariah Carey using her voice to greater heights . Without any guests and absent of Jermaine Dupri ( positive ) , 'Memoirs ' concedes the commercial appeal of Carey 's two past albums , save for 'Obsessed ' ( which failed to reach # 1 as the less enjoyable 'Touch My Body ' did ) in favor of a more coherent , personal outing this time . The numbers hurt ( # 3 bow , c. 168,000 copies vs. the # 1 , c. 463,000 opening of E=MC2 ) , but the results are more coherent.The album opens with an enjoyable , if slightly odd track entitled `` Betcha Gon ' Know ( The Prelude ) '' , which finds Mariah approaching this song in a 'narrative ' style , quite different from the club-leaning openers `` It 's Like That '' or `` Migrate '' . Here , the production by Tricky/The-Dream is exceptional , and a welcome departure from her Jermaine Dupri saturated previous albums ( though Tricky/The-Dream did produce `` Touch My Body '' ) . While `` Betcha Gon ' Know '' is enjoyable , it does n't scream 'commercial hit ' , particularly with its 'nutso ' punchlines ( Oprah , Stedman , Barbra Walters ? ) . `` Obsessed '' should have easily been another # 1 hit for Mariah Carey , particularly given the fact that the Black-Eyed Peas annoying `` I Got ta Feeling '' stayed # 1 shamefully for 14 weeks . However , `` Obsessed '' never quite clicked , despite the fact it is arguably one of Carey 's best and most interesting listens . Carey sounds great , and the production work by Tricky/The-Dream is fantastic . I honestly prefer it miles over `` Touch My Body '' . `` H.A.T.E . U '' , which follows , is equally alluring . `` H.A.T.E . U '' finds Carey singing softly and sensitively , with the end of the refrain allowing her to 'coo ' in her upper register like a 'songbird ' . Beautiful , passionate , this song where Mariah claims so resolutely , `` I Ca n't wait to hate u ... '' again does n't necessarily lend itself to the commercial appeal of say `` We Belong Together '' or `` Do n't Forget About Us '' . `` Candy Bling '' proves to be another fantastic listen which finds Carey in strong voice . `` Ribbon '' borrows production cues from The-Dream 's great 'Love v. Money ' album , penning a sensitive sounding diva against harder drums . The effect is spectacular , and again makes you wonder , why such a downgrade in numbers ? `` Inseparable '' , another production standpoint ( even if it sounds somewhat samey compared to other tracks ) , finds Mariah again sounding top-rate and the material 'sells ' itself easily . The main problem the listener may find is that as good and consistent as the material is , some of it slightly begins to blend together . Though arguably , one could say the same for the two previous Carey releases . `` Standing O '' instantaneously shows the influence of Terius `` The-Dream '' Nash with the pervading `` oh 's '' and sound-effects that have come to characterize his style . `` Standing O '' is n't the most distinctive track of 'Memoirs ' , but as far as consistency , it is as consistent as everything else . `` It 's A Wrap '' ' proves to be a better , more enthralling listen , placing Mariah against a 'new-school ' soulful 6/8 beat . `` It 's A Wrap '' is one of Carey 's best vocal moments on this album , finding the diva 'belting it out ' as opposed to her sometimes restrained vocal performances . `` Up Out My Face '' , similarly , is an interesting listening . It 's subsequent reprise , remixed with marching band instrumentation ( `` Up Out My Face ( The Reprise ) '' ) is enjoyable and again plays on this 'comical ' Mariah Carey , most likely a product of The-Dream . `` More Than Just Friends '' is solid and as enjoyable as everything else , while `` The Impossible '' begins to exhibit the slight leanings of 'sameness ' . Solid , nonetheless . A reprise of `` The Impossible '' could 've been cut and would n't have been missed here . Similarly , `` Angel ( The Prelude ) '' is more filler than genuinely adding depth to the album . `` Angels Cry '' finds a sensitive Carey hearkening back to her adult contemporary laden roots . While `` Angels Cry '' does n't quite have the same vitality or depth as a classic such as `` Without You '' , it does 'recall ' and remind us of the original Mariah Carey . `` Languishing ( The Interlude ) '' could 've been extended to have made one fantastic song ; Carey is in great voice here . Finally , an exceptional cover of Foreigner 's classic `` I Want To Know What Love Is '' provides the cherry on top of this exceptional , if underrated Carey album.Essentially , Mariah Carey is more mature sounding on this album , especially compared to E=MC2 . Some will love it , some wo n't get it , and others will treat it much like Usher 's 2008 'Here I Stand ' - it makes Carey boring . While it is n't as exciting has her albums made of 'hit records ' , it is a better album because it finds Carey rediscovering her roots in big ballads and with songs that have lyrics with 'personal conviction ' . 4 stars .	1
I 'm not the biggest fan of Mariah Carey but a fan indeed . After listening to Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel , I am totally in love with this Cd . The more I listen the more I love it . No it 's not the greatest Cd but it is so very addictive . Stop hating . MiMi still can deliver the goods way better than most .	1
I was really surprised that Mariah Carey was releasing another album after she just released EMC2 a year earlier . I used to be a Mariah fan around 11 or 12 , and but quickly got tired of her lyrics and screeching voice . I would occasionally listen to MusicBox , and some of her hits off of daydream . ( My two favorite albums from hers ) . When the media made a big hype off of Mariah 's 18 no . 1 hit , and her new album emc2 , I had to check it out . I instantly fell in love with her music again ! The whole cd was off the chain and I loved it . Could this one top that cd as well ? Well , i was pleaseantly surprised that this one did . It was def . more subtle and not as in your face . But the whole mood of the album was pretty cool . I was really excited to hear her upcoming single Obessed , and instantly fell in love with it . ( Grant it , Madonna , Mariah , Whitney are n't as good as they used to be , but its 2009 . And alot of things change . ) I do think the gucci mane remix should have been released as single instead of calling it the remix.I really liked I want to know what love is . I thought it was an excellent cover , and she 's def . trying to get back to her days of Musicbox , and her first album . Some people bashed it , while alot of music critics loved it . I agree with the music critics , it was a pretty good track . HATE U , was n't what i initially thought it was going to sound like , but i really liked the track , and I also enjoyed Candy Bling.Up out my face , was pretty good , loved the reprise . Overall , I think the dream did an awesome job of producing this album , and I 'm glad mariah tried to mix contemprary , with alittle bit of her old stuff . I def . think people should get this album .	1
I have to give Mariah some props . Rather than chasing after the style of the latest flavor of the week , she chose to risk album sales and try something new . Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is a slow burner meaning that it takes time to fully understand and enjoy it 's awesomeness . Yeah I stole part of that definition from Urban Dictionary , but you know what I mean.Making an album like that is a big risk for someone like Mariah . Especially coming off the comeback smash The Emancipation of Mimi . The follow-up E=Mc2 was n't a bad album , but it could 've used some work here and there . All is forgiven on Memoirs . For the most part anyway . The theme of this record is love and the ups and downs one can run into when falling in , out , and away from it . You 'd think an entire record about love would get redundant after awhile , but that 's not so here.Mimi is seeing red on the moody intro Betcha Gon ' Know . After catching her man cheating , she vows revenge . She 'll make sure he knows how it feels to be in pain `` when I get you back '' by putting him on blast to Oprah , Barbara Walters , and 60 Minutes . `` Betcha gon ' know how this feels/Even it is the last thing I ever do/To be continued ... '' I like Obsessed , but I do n't think it fits well on the album . Despite that , it 's a funny kiss off to Eminem who 's been going after Mariah ever since she denied having a relationship with him in 2002 . Just like her first Em brush off on Charmbracelet 's Clown , Mariah never addresses him by name , but makes it clear who she 's singing about . `` Why you so obsessed with me ? /Boy I wan na know/Lyin ' that you 're sexin ' me/when everybody knows/It 's clear that you 're upset with me/Oh , finally found a girl that you could n't impress/Last man on the earth still could n't get this '' she coyly teases.The ethereal glaze of H.A.T.E.U . gets the album back on the love track . Rather than continuing to miss and pine after her lover , Mariah wants to hate him for hurting her . `` I ca n't wait to hate you/Make you pain like I do/Still ca n't shake you off/I ca n't wait to break through these emotional changes/Seems like such a lose cause/I ca n't wait to face you/Break you down so low there 's no place left to go ! '' I love that her lower register gets to shine along with her higher . She rarely shows it off.Candy Bling is just as delicious as the title suggests . Backed by light finger snaps and music that reminds me of an ice cream truck , Mariah thinks back to her first romance and wishes she could relive it . `` Back in the day we were in love/We 're not in love anymore/But some days I sit and wish we were in love again/Irresponsible things we would do/Like fall asleep on the phone and skipping school/Now I 'm back to the future missing you . `` I 'm usually not a fan of the chopped and screwed genre , but it works on Ribbon . Probably because it 's an anonymous man 's voice in the background rather than Mariah 's . Who has n't been in a relationship where you 're so in love with that person they 've got you `` Wrapped up/Packed up/Ribbon with a bow on it '' ? Now here 's another question . Who has n't broken up with someone , but then realize it was a big mistake . Mariah certainly does on the piano groove Inseparable . She wants to call him up and makes things right , but her pride gets in the way . `` One of us just got ta pick the phone up/Cuz I know we 're still inseparable . '' Now we 're hitting a snag . The plot of Standing O is interesting about sarcastically applauding an ex lover for breaking her heart , but I do n't care for the music or Mariah 's repeated O 's . Sounds like something Rihanna would do.The doo wop of It 's A Wrap get 's things going again . Mariah told her guy if he messed up their relationship one more time she 'd drop him , but he did it anyway . `` Yet another early morning/And you walk in like it 's nothing/Hold up , hold up , hold tight/Ai n't no donuts/Ai n't no coffee/See I know you seen me calling and calling/I should crack you right in your forehead ! '' The lyrics are witty and silly like threatening to call Maury Povich because of his constant cheating . Only Mimi.She gets even wittier on the marching band led Up Out My Face . She 's so over her man that she 's packed her bags and is on her way out of his life for good . `` I 'm on the plane now/And do n't keep calling from your mama house/When I break , I break , boy '' and `` If we were two lego blocks/Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010/Could n't put us back together again . '' Mariah is routinely criticized for creating songs like this , but the joke is on the critics . Mimi 's just having fun . The reprise is fun to sing along to as well.More Than Just Friends is yet another `` I 'm in love with my best friend '' song , but Mariah 's off the wall lyrics make it anything but mediocre . `` Steady feenin ' for you like them fries at McDonalds/I want to be all on your lips like gelato/Permanently paint me in your picture like Picasso/Love me down 'til I hit the top of my soprano . '' You 've got ta love it ! Who knew Mimi could make such a seductive `` crawl under the sheets '' slow jam ? Do n't get me wrong , she 's sung plenty of sultry songs in the past , but I 've never heard her step into Janet territory . Minus the creepy , over the top sex , of course . Sampling Jodeci 's Forever My Lady , Mariah praises her hubby Nick Cannon for doing The Impossible and showing her that true love is real . She loves him like everything from a freeze pop and a Duncan Hines yellow cake to `` layin ' in the bed bumpin ' Jodeci . '' The lyrics are sweet and get their point across without being mushy . Speaking of Janet , the reprise sounds exactly like Any Time , Any Place.After a short interlude featuring a chorus of dreamy whistle notes , Mariah mourns the ending of a relationship on Angels Cry . Apparently the two were meant to be , but fighting and a case of the blame game caused them to break away from each other . `` True love 's a gift/But we let it drift/In a storm/Every night/I feel the angels cry . '' Languishing is reminiscent of another interlude that should 've been a full length song , Rainbow . Over a misty piano , Mariah admits that they 've both caused each other pain in the past , but wonders `` would you reach for me ? /If you saw that I was languishing/I was wondering/Would you cry for me ? /If I told you that I could n't breathe/If I was drowning/Suffocating/If I told you that I could n't breathe ? `` We reach the end of the road on the Foreigner hit I Want To Know What Love Is . I like that Mariah managed to make it her own and it 's stunning , but it 's too short . Just as the choir kicks in and the song is nearing it 's peak , it fades out . What 's up with that ? It could 've been epic , but alas . Something I could do without is the extra disc featuring a few remixes of Obsessed . They 're pretty good , but why add a handful of remixes of the same song ? That 's what a maxi single is made for.In closing , the cd is n't perfect , but it 's pretty close . To the people who listen to it a few times and deem it a flop , pay closer attention . This is the kind of music you have to let grow on you . You 'll be glad when it does .	1
Mariah Carey is perhaps the only artist with a strong presence on Top 40 radio who has ( earned ) the leverage to write and record whatever she wants , how she wants . Because of this her 12th studio album `` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel '' is the product of a double-edged sword - Carey gets disarmingly personal , delightfully lowbrow and places between by sticking to her artistic inclinations , but at the same time she may disenfranchise casual fans who expect her sound to skew the way of previous hits.There are a handful of roaring , boom box busting tracks such as the increasingly catchy Top 10 hit single `` Obsessed '' ( when she unleashes her voice at the climax she 's singing `` he 's all up in my George Foreman ! '' ) and the cheeky , intentionally humorous break-up ode `` Up Out My Face '' ( `` If we were two Lego blocks even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 could n't put us back together again '' ) . `` Ribbon '' is also a melodious marvel , with Carey gamely wrapping her throat around its jagged , luscious arrangement.The great bulk of `` Memoirs ... , '' however , skews toward steamy , sauna-warm slow jams with only occasional outbursts of that full-on chest voice of `` Hero '' and `` We Belong Together . '' The best cut in this vein is the wistful , bittersweet , positively glorious `` Candy Bling , '' which concludes with dazzling , fist-pumping , absolutely heartbreaking high notes . Also radio-bound is the downbeat , vacillating `` H.A.T.E.U. , '' which finds Carey immersed in the stifling ambiguities of post-relationship battle scars . Her aching , genuine vocal performance is the stuff of Grammy nominations.With deeper tracks like `` Standing O , '' where her vocals swirl and swell amid anxious underpinnings , or the lyrically curious `` It 's a Wrap , '' with old school vocal coos and handclaps , it is evident that Carey is not following any formula when she approaches recording albums - `` Memoirs ... '' contrasts greatly with the straightforward R & B ; and burning hip-hop of last year 's `` E=MC2 '' or 70s soul ballads of 2005 's `` The Emancipation of Mimi . '' However , this means there is room for missteps such as the adventurous but overloud `` More Than Just Friends '' and the cotton candy-like `` The Impossible , '' which floats like whipped cream as she tries to craft a slice of genuinely romantic quiet storm to mixed results . `` Angels Cry '' reinvigorates the album with its stark arrangement , Carey 's voice hanging unadorned in the mix for a wrenching call for a former love to return . It 's not single material , but it will satisfy those looking to hear her bust out a powerhouse vocal . So too will her plaintive , soul-searching take on Foreigner 's classic `` I Want to Know What Love Is . '' She sculpts the time-tested song into her own creation without compromising the integrity of the original , ending the album on an ambiguous note . `` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel '' finds Carey closing out the 2000s in self-assured , take charge fashion . As time goes by one can sense , to an increasing degree , that she is crafting albums first and foremost to please herself . It does n't satisfy listeners who long for a return to her people-pleasing days of the early 90s , but it certainly makes her a more interesting artist .	1
Mariah keeps doin her thing with another incredible album . The production value is superb , vocally and lyrically . One of her all time best . here is a breakdown of each track:1 . Betcha Gon Know : 5/5 a darker side of Mariah . A bitchy song with deep husky vocals , a new vocal range 4 Mariah and it works.2 . Obsessed : 4/5 apparently this song is about Eminem ? Why write a song about an aging tweaker bipolar balding ghetto white boy ? Obsessed Clown ( was n't the song Clown about him too ? ) Mariah gives him 2 much credit , but the song is kool.3 . Hate U : 4/5 another bitchy song with deep lyrics . `` I ca n't wait 2 hate u '' . I get it , the lyrics are about when ur finally OVER some1.4 . Candy Bling : 4/5 a cute song about romance , with lyrics borrowed from that Ahmad song from the 90 's `` Back In Tha Day '' .5 . Ribbon : 5/5 my fave song . It immediately made an impression on me . I luv Mariah 's vocals , they have that 80 's and 90 's r and b sound , intense ! 6 . Inseperable : 5/5 this song grew on me , more intense vocals . This is also the title of a Natalie Cole song , do n't get em confused now ! 7 . Standing O : 5/5 this song almost made me cry , again more intense lyrics , alot of oos , ahhs and o 's . The lyrics are gr8.8 . It 's A Wrap : 3/5 my least fave on the album . A bit slow n lazy for my taste . This is also the title of a Mary J Blige song , so that bugz me.9 . Up Out M ' Face : 4/5 another bitchy song ! luv and hate , we go back n forth on this album . Mariah calls this guy `` Boy '' . uh oh no u did n't Mariah ! 10 . More Than Jus Friends : 5/5 m ' other fave track . I luv the vocals and the lyrics ! 11 . The Impossible : ur standard Mariah ballad remeniscent of her more recent ballads . This song is about her cookie luv affair with Nick . The reprise resmebles the instrumentation of `` Anytime , Anyplace '' by Janet Jackson . I like the reprise better than the actual song ! sorry ! 12 . Angels Cry : 4/5 every1 seems 2 luv this song . The lyrics are sentimental and deep . maybe it will grow on me more.13 . Languishing : 4/5 this `` interlude '' almost lost me but there is some good vocals.14 . I Want 2 Know What Love Is : 5/5 Mariah does yet another cover of an 80 's power ballad . She does an amazing and unique version , changing up one of the lyrics `` In case I 'm needed when I 'm COLDER '' . In the Foreigner version it says `` In Case I 'm needed when I 'm OLDER '' . ( 4 all u music nerds who care ! ) .12 . Angels Cry : 4/5 every1 seems 2 luv this song	1
I want to thank Sealinewuman for bringing this band to my attention when commenting on my review of V.V . Brown 's ` The Attic EP ' . I had heard of The Noisettes , but I 'd never really given them much attention . After devouring their latest album , ` Wild Young Hearts ' , I 'm ready to pounce all over ` What 's the Time Mr. Wolf'.Once I do , I 'll be sure to weigh in.Grabbing at influences that range from funk to pop to R & B ; and hip-hop , to jazz and punk and even flares of country ( Sometimes ) ; The Noisettes have a deep pool to choose from , and while their influences may crop up here and there in subtle flourishes , they are recognizable and admirable , for they add layers of uniqueness to this album . I 'm intrigued to get my hands on their debut album , for I have a feeling it may be even more diverse than this album ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) , and so I have this aching feeling I may even like that album more than I like this one.But serious , I am dying to hear their stoned out take on ` Hit Me Baby ( One More Time ) ' ! The album opens strong , with ` Wild Young Hearts ' setting the tone and pace of the album ( the funk throwback feel is the strongest influence on this album ) . I love the playfulness of the track . It lets you know right up front that this is a happy album . The band even made mention in interviews that this was an album about being young , no matter what you age , by the way you act ; enjoying your life and having fun . ` Wild Young Hearts ' is a beautiful way to introduce that morale . ` Do n't Upset The Rhythm ( Go Baby Go ) ' comes next , screaming 60 's and proving even more exciting and engaging than ` Wild Young Hearts'.Pure disco brilliance.The best track on the album , without any hesitation whatsoever , is ` Never Forget You ' . The sensual jazz undertones are brilliantly matched by lead singer Shingai Shoniwa 's flawless vocals . The way she slinks into the verses is just impeccably entrancing . The song is on constant replay in my i-pod and I do n't foresee a time when I 'll grow tired of it.I love the disco flare brought to ` Saturday Night ' , even if I find the way she actually says `` Saturday Night '' to be rather annoying . It 's still a great song with great character . Probably my second favorite track on the album is ` Atticus ' . It has a much softer and gentler flow to it , reminiscent of soft rock . Shingai 's vocals are just flawless here . I love the lyrics here , so deep and meaningful and provocative.Both ` Every Now and Then ' and '24 Hours ' are great examples of two shade of the band . ` Every Now and Then ' is a much more mellow track , feeling aged yet modernly refreshing . '24 Hours ' is much bouncier and evokes a more uplifting and happy atmosphere . They way they layer their approaches to musical genres is stunning to listen to . Both tracks obvious borrow from similar pools of influence , yet they allow each track to speak for itself.I absolutely ADORE ` Beat of My Heart ' . The song is just , well , STUNNING.I 'm less impressed with the albums closing tracks . I admire the bluesy take on ` Sometimes ' , which evokes a southern rock , country feel to it . It was a risky and commendable attempt , but for me it just does n't stand out as well as it could have . I love that these guys are not afraid to try new things and incorporate many genres in their own style ( although the funk/R & B ; tone is predominantly their forte ) . For me , the closing track ` Cheap Kicks ' is the worst song here . It 's not because it 's ` bad ' but because it 's uninspiring . It just does n't bring anything new or exciting to the album and does n't scream ` LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AGAIN ' . Vocally , amazing , but aside from that it 's forgettable.Overall I 'm very happy with this album . I 'd totally recommend it , and I thank Sealinewuman for giving me the heads up !	1
'Wild Young Hearts ' for me was definitely one of those surprising albums of the year - the type that come out of nowhere from a group that you really have n't heard of that turns out to be ten times better than anything that gets a tone of publicity and attention . If you are looking for an album that has some elements of rock and old school doo-wop , 'Wild Young Hearts ' is definitely for you . It 's hard to describe the group 's genre or vibe simply because by listening to the album , you can tell the music has been inspired by various artists and musical movements . The end product is an album that can get you moving and dancing , as with `` Do n't Upset the Rhythm '' , and music that is very moving and reflective and packed with emotion and sentiment , as with `` Cheap Kicks '' .The Good : The vocals performed by Shingai Shoniwa is definitely what gives 'Wild Young Hearts ' it 's flair and attitude . Her voice , unlike so many artists these days , is natural and not computerized or auto-tuned . The Noisettes exude uniqueness and individuality with their music relying on vocals left untouched and natural backed with actual instrumentals that give each song a very indie rock vibe as if you 're listening to this group in concert or in an intimate setting like a small club venue . I can tell that the group put time into actually developing the music and the lyrics . Basically , when you 're listening to 'Wild Young Hearts ' you feel the music is authentic and personal and that the Noisettes really put themselves into the music . The music itself reminded me a lot of doo-wop infused with pop and rock . If I had to compare them to anyone it would be Blondie ; the music has a very early 1980s punk rock vibe ; happy , whimsical , lyrics and a voice that 's unique and really pulls you in . There 's really no 'bad ' song on the release . The songs that work best for me are the dancefloor-inspired `` Do n't Upset the Rhythm '' and the reflective/moody tracks `` Atticus '' , `` Every Now and Then '' and `` Cheap Kicks '' .The Bad : 'Wild Young Hearts ' has been released overseas for a while now . With this U.S. release , the record company for whatever reason not only played with the sequencing of the tracks but removed a few from the import version of 'Wild Young Hearts ' . This version did include all of the tracks on the import version except for one , `` So Complicated '' , a track that really deserved to be on this version . Yes , it 's one track but it 's a great track and there 's really nothing like it or comparable to it on the release . It 's an upbeat , fast-paced track with lots of guitar and drum that is something like an upbeat ballad . The sequencing of the U.S. version is okay but makes me wonder who decided the original track line-up did n't work and why songs were flipped around . It 's a minor critique that makes me wonder if the record company was trying to compensate for the missing track that really moved things along on the first release.In all , the critiques are n't enough to keep this release from being something worth purchasing . 'Wild Young Hearts ' is a great release that is packed with emotion and good music . Yes , at times , the tracks suffer from sounding similar to one another but I believe it is because of the rare quality of having music that is n't all computer enhanced and is actually based on vocals and people playing real instruments , so it is forgivable . Give The Noisettes ' 'Wild Young Hearts ' a listen ; it will definitely leave a lasting impression on you .	1
This is the album that Amy Winehouse would have made if she could sing ( or stay straight , whichever came first ) . Unlike Noisettes ' earlier releases , which emphasized the punk side of a punk-soul mix , Wild Young Hearts beats a path straight to Motown 's door , stopping to pick up a Blondie wig along the way . A little bit schizophrenic , but jumping with unbridled joy , Wild Young Hearts beats a disco rhythm one minute ( `` Do n't Upset the Rhythm '' ) and Bristol-like stomp ( `` Never Forget You '' ) the next . An unpretentious breath of fresh air , singer / bassist Shingai Shoniwa will snap up your eyelids and feet alike . Wild Young Hearts is simply irresistible .	1
I have to say I am surprised at just how good this album is . I knew this band from ` Do n't Upset the Rhythm ' and ` Never Forget you ' , but the music on offer here is excellent the whole way through and if you enjoyed either of the mentioned songs then it is a good bet you will enjoy the rest of the album as well . The title track is another favourite of mine , but it is hard to highlight one track over another to be honest . The lead vocalist Shingai Shoniwa has a wonderful voice and lends the album a real jazzy feel without becoming clich & eacute ; d or cheesy and the songs on offer alternate between punchy upbeat numbers to more sultry , smouldering affairs . The band seem to be polished and tight and the production seems clear and well suited to the bands style . The packaging is pretty good and the booklet is attractive too . All in all if you enjoyed the few songs you may have caught on the radio then snap this album up and if you have n't heard of this great band yet I would suggest you give it a try , you will pleasantly surprised.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .	1
For what it 's worth , I first heard this album being played as bumper music behind a segment on NPR back in August . I was so intrigued by what I was hearing because it hit so hard and came instantly as the freshest and most mesmerizing music that I 've heard in a long time . After I made a few phone calls , I was sent my very own copy and had it almost the next day . I 've been listening to this almost constantly . And be warned it 's so catchy , that you might think it a bit too catchy . I found myself hearing several songs in my head long after I had gone to bed . Unexplainably good.What 's probably the most obvious thing to say about this band / this record is that with the incredible amount of garbage floating around in the musical void they stand out so far that it 's almost embarrassing how good they are , and all while doing it in a simple and natural manner . It 's the first time I ever thought I 'd ever hear a perfect blend ofDiana RossandThe Sex Pistols . The sexual frustration on every track is almost palpable , too . So it 's no mistake Shingai sings : `` Damn this Wild Young Heart '' and it 's being fronted as the cover track.My favourite cuts on the album are just about all of them . You can listen to this from start to finish and never think of hitting the forward or back buttons . You may find yourself obsessing on anyone of the songs though , without doubt . ` Cheap Kicks ' and '24 Hours ' are my absolute favourites , even though the radio hits are brilliant all by themselves . I often have to censor my thoughts when I 'm listening to ` Do n't Upset The Rhythm ' as Shingai is honestly doing her best to seduce the listener.The best album I 've heard in a very long time and what 's even better is the fact that they 're incredible live - which is becoming more and more rare with some of these ` musical ' offerings as of late.And like Paul McCartney ... she plays bass ... ...	1
It 's only fitting that Ledisi 's 2009 release contains four songs with the word `` change '' in the title . Because that 's exactly what this album represents . Having really made a splash in the music world with herLost & Founda couple years earlier it was clear the Oakland native was more than aware of not only the rich musical heritage of the bay area but her stronger sense of the groove . While it 's true she had no problem dealing with funk on her last album it was done in a jazzier , slinkier fashion . By bringing in the likes of Jam/Lewis and Rahpael Saadiq as producers/co-composers on this album it allowed her to explore the more gospel/soul elements of her sound . And , in this case that 's represented in many ways by funk.Ledisi herself opts for more of a tough , growling style of singing on this album . At the same time the jazzy level of control is still of primary importance . This album contains a heavy chuck of hardcore , rocking funk on `` Runnin '' , '' Knockin '' and a cover of Buddy Miles classic `` Them Changes '' . These take a similar approach to funk that Rufus did-somewhat from a rock n roll standpoint , with more of a crunch to the rhythm section . A good deal of the songs fit into the category of funky soul such as `` Love Never Changes '' , the title song , '' Trippin '' and `` The Answer Is Why '' . The most potent of these is `` Please Stay '' , which to some degree brings to mind the early 70 's Sly Stone style of wah-wah charged poppy funk . `` I Need Love '' with it 's heavy programmed orchestral synth sounds could 've been very generic . But with Ledisi 's gospel soul shouting and the cosmic melody it 's the perfect marriage of musical styling with modern instrumentation.Between that and more retro gospel/soul inspired `` Alone '' , '' Love Never Changes '' and `` Goin ' Through Changes '' this album really does a great job at show casing the tougher side of her musical virtues . All the same the kind of elegance she 'd always had on display beforehand . That kind of mixture of gospel intensity and jazzy elegance are part of the basis of funk to begin with . So the hard driving funky soul Ledisi goes for on this album really brings out the power of her voice and compositions as well . It 's pretty difficult for someone with her type of creative bent and outlook to be much of a sellout . And this album continued the pattern of success of the previous release . All the same the theme of change was an excellent way to anchor the music . Because Ledisi is one of those people who has little to no intention of being bound by any musical boundaries , either creative or commercial that might stand in her way . So there 's a lot to admire about this album and the way she handles her groove .	1
This CD contains a diverse amount of music that a lot of more established artists could n't pull off or would even want to . She did and the results are amazing ! Her voice is more powerful than on LOST AND FOUND , and her willingness to try something new show that she not afraid to take chances . This was a great effort on her part and as and adult male who varies in his musical tastes , a very welcome disc in my collection .	1
I have been a fan of Ledisi 's for about 10 years now , and I always look forward to what she is going to bring , especially in concert . After a well received major label debut `` Lost and Found '' , she has returned with a cd that defies category , flexes her artistic muscles , and stretches her musically . This is in no way a commercial release , which is the best part , although a few songs could easily find their way to the best of radio programming . The cd is much more raw than her previous effort , while exploring Funk , Blues , Rock , Hip Hop , and R & B ... all with great results . Songs such as `` Everything Changes '' , `` Turn Me Loose '' , Them Changes '' , `` The Answer to Why '' , and `` Please Stay '' , all reflect the complexity and realness of the porject . Ledisi 's voice is in fine shape , and almost comes close to her live show , but you really have to see her in concert to get the full effect , she is an artist in every form of the word . Ledisi is not a fly-by-night , one dimensional , half-baked talent . She is an artist who has put in time to learn her craft , comes from a place musically that allows her to explore various genres , and is a true live performer who ignites a stage just with the music alone ( no props needed ) . I could go on , but you just have to check out all her work , and see her live to understand . Please get this one .	1
Ledisi , the once independent little engine that could , keeps going and going . Her growth in music is ever-changing and bubbling with welcome surprise . Now a major player in the game , `` Turn Me Loose '' is her first collaboration with a varied group of talented and successful producers ( Raphael Saadiq , Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis , Chief XCel , Chucky Thompson , Rex Rideout ) . They bring `` it '' ( their creative force ) to further enhance the musicianship of Ledisi . This project demonstrates that Ledisi is not just a Gospel , Jazz , R & B ; or Pop artist . In truth , she is a singer/song writer who encompasses all genres.Rather than singling out a particular favorite track of mine on this grade `` A '' CD , I will just close in saying I love the whole thing from its ' slamming start to its ' engaging finish .	1
Ledisi was practically an unknown artist until her 2007 albumLost & Foundwas nominated for two Grammy awards ( Best New Artist , Best R & B ; Album ) . While she failed to win , the exposure certainly heightened her profile as an R & B ; singer . Calling Ledisi 's second 'high profile ' album 'anticipated ' might be a bit of an overstatement , particularly given this stagnant economy in the music business , but it is certainly big for the previously unknown singer . LOST & FOUND was a fine album by all means , though it was `` quieter '' than the funkierTurn Me Loose , which shows a more ignited , even more vocally viable Ledisi . With this electrifying combination , TURN ME LOOSE is easily one of the best R & B ; albums of 2009 , right up there with the likes Maxwell'sBLACKsummers'nightand most likely Whitney Houston 's forthcomingI Look to You.The album opens up with the brief , but funky `` Runnin ' '' in which Ledisi instantly shows off her pipes . The songwriting is solid as is the production - and instant difference and departure from LOST & FOUND . `` Everything Changes '' keeps up the pace , adding funky horns to the mix . The production is still funkier than anything appearing on LOST & FOUND , marking a departure and experimentation on Ledisi 's part . As always , the starlet sings rings around a number of her contemporaries . `` Turn Me Loose '' , the title track is one of the funkiest of the album , hearkening old school 1960s/70s soul , though not sounding like an anachronism ( aka an outdated throwback ) . Sure , `` Turn Me Loose '' would only do well on Adult R & B ; /Adult Contemporary radio as opposed to pop stations , but that certainly does n't downgrade the freshness or the grand quality of this track.As for `` Higher Than This '' , it is n't only adult R & B ; at its finest , it also lays well for the hip-hop circuit with slightly fresher , more contemporary production than say `` Turn Me Loose '' . No , it is n't the overt `` hip-hop '' that has pervaded radio ( I mean that respectfully of course ) , but it does sound more directed toward a slightly younger audience - particularly in comparison to say `` Alright '' from Lost & Found . Ledisi sings exceptionally here , giving one of her most poignant , strong performances of TURN ME LOOSE . `` Higher Than This '' is just a well written , R & B ; song . `` Alone '' proves to be as well written as everything else showcasing Ledisi 's prodigious pipes and more sound production work . `` Love Never Changes '' features a chord-progression the likes of an Al Green southern-styled soul tune . Again , it is another solid listen and nowhere near being filler.Despite the solidity of tunes like `` Alone '' or `` Love Never Changes '' and the soulful `` Stay '' that would 've been perfect on Solange'sSol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams , it is a track like the should-of-been-first-single `` Knockin ' '' that truly steals the show . I have never heard Ledisi quite as energized or as contemporary on this R & B-rocker . ; I think to myself as a music enthusiast , 'why would you choose the good , but `` been-there-done-that '' 'Goin ' Thru Changes ' over such a kick-butt track as `` Knockin ' ? The production is the best of the entire album , the background vocals during the refrain are an exceptional touch , and Ledisi sounds awesome . 5 star track , ladies and gentlemen . `` Say No '' may not be equal to the greatness of `` Knockin ' '' , but it lays as well as everything does for the most part on TURN ME LOOSE . `` Goin ' Thru Changes '' is good ( not diminishing it ) , though I think adult R & B ; fans have heard this type of song more than once , which takes away from it slightly . It was a good choice for a first single , but it is n't necessarily better than `` Alright '' or `` Think of You '' from LOST & FOUND . Furthermore , as mentioned earlier , I believe `` Knockin ' '' easily 'beasts ' a track like `` Goin ' Thru Changes '' . `` I Need Love '' finds Ledisi again over a more contemporary backdrop with swirling synths and `` big drums '' . Wisely , the drums do n't grow as big as say a Ryan Tedder production ( known for 'big ' drums ) where it might have sounded a bit ill-fitting with Ledisi . `` I Need Love '' is n't the best of TURN ME LOOSE , but it also is n't filler . `` Trippin ' '' similarly is n't the best of TURN ME LOOSE , but it is certainly interesting if nothing else . The production is placed somewhere between the contemporary and a throwback to classic soul . `` The Answer To Why '' returns Ledisi back to more adult-contemporary helmed R & B ; , supported by acoustic guitar and strings . Again , I do n't connect with `` The Answer To Why '' as much as the very best of the album , but I do think Ledisi sounds great . The album closes `` funkily '' with the fantastic `` Them Changes '' , which proves to be worth the wait . A track like `` Them Changes '' could have easily appeared on a Prince , Chaka Khan , or Aretha Franklin album.Overall , TURN ME LOOSE is a great album . There is very little to criticize . The biggest thing is that Ledisi is better when she is funky and allowed to show off her prodigious vocals . 4 stars ; I hope that Ledisi receives a Grammy nomination once again .	1
Ledisi . What a different name , but then again , she is not your average , everyday R & B ; artist . Ledisi separates herself from every other artist somehow because she 's original , but she 's so spectacular in her originality . If you doubt me , listen to her debut album entitled `` Lost and Found . '' I loved that album and downloaded most of it onto my iPod and every time one of her tracks come on , I turn it up and vibe . Ledisi 's vocals always jump out at you , whether she 's singing a ballad or an up-tempo track . The clarity and pitch of her soprano are amazing . `` Turn Me Loose '' is another fine work by Ledisi . She was influenced by the genre of rock and roll as well as jazz and R & B . ; What I love about this album is the live instruments , the great lyrics and the intertwining of music genres . Most of the tracks are mid-tempo or up-tempo , but what 's a Ledisi album without the ballads ? Yes , there are a few . The title track is mid-tempo and she does a whole lot with her voice on this song . You can hear the vocal gymnastic from miles away . This song is saying , if you are n't in this relationship for the long run , just `` turn me loose '' now and stop wasting my precious time . `` I Need Love '' is another mid-tempo ; the title of the song tells you what the song is about in a nutshell . It 's a good moment on the album . `` Everything Changes '' and `` Goin ' Thru Changes '' are two of my favorite songs because of the profound lyrics , song arrangement and delivery.This is a great album . She has made magic once again . I recommend it ! Just press play and let her take you away . Once you give Ledisi a chance , you wo n't want to turn her loose.Mikeisha 's Top 51 . `` Going Thru Changes '' 2 . `` Everything Changes '' 3 . `` Say No '' 4 . `` Higher Than This '' 5 . `` Please Stay ''	1
When I heard that Ledisi was releasing a follow-up to her 2007 album `` Lost And Found '' , I was convinced that her next effort was going to be as mellow as the previous album . Also , not helping matters was seeing the producers involved- Chucky Thompson ? Raphael Saadiq ? Jam & Lewis ? Orthodox & Ransum ? Rex Rideout ( he did the lion 's share of `` Lost And Found '' ) ... yeah , this was going to be real mellow . Man , was I in for a surprise ! ! ! On her new album `` Turn Me Loose '' , I think it 's safe to say that she showed out on this one . She came in with the premise to funk . It 's like she went from Anita Baker to Chaka Khan in a split second . On the first track , she presents the song `` Runnin ' '' produced by Chief Xcel from Blackalicious- and it only gets better from there . Throughout the album , she ventures into that 70 's soul sound from the South- namely Memphis soul , the Muscle Shoals sound and the Al Green era with Willie Mitchell ( she 's from New Orleans , after all ) . Orthodox & Ransum contribute two songs , including the song `` Alone '' that sounds a little Lalah Hathaway-ish . Other tracks like `` Love Never Changes '' , `` Please Stay '' and `` Knockin ' '' have a Sly & The Family Stone feel to them . She closes the album with an excellent cover of Jimi Hendrix & Band Of Gypsys ' `` Them Changes '' . In short , this album is a must buy .	1
While I 've been disappointed w/ most bands I like that have either released their 2nd Cd or a new CD in general ... .MuteMath have not let me down . They 've stuck to what they do best , blending rock , alternative , electronica , and hip hop ( although not as much hip hop this time around ) on `` Armistice '' . Every song on this album is good , ( w the exception of track 2 ... I do n't dislike it , but it 's not great either ) Even though they sound a lot more radio friendly or `` pop '' oriented this time around , it 's still an amazing album that I ca n't take out of my cd player in my car . Looking forward to much much more from MuteMath and ca n't wait to see them live one day .	1
If you like Muse , Coldplay , The Fray and Band of Horses , you will really dig this record . I 'm also a big fan of Mew and Fair to Midland which are two bands that are much more daring in their eclectic-ness than Mutemath . Mutemath sounds like they are at the stage where their next release will break them out mainstream .	1
I had to buy the CD and hear it in its Mastered glory to give a full opinion due to the horrible quality leak i heard almost a month ago . This cd did n't catch my attention as much as their debut or the Reset EP but hearing it all the way through last night made me consider that the whole album works together very well . I do n't see the comparisons to Radiohead that the `` 1 '' 1 star reviewer said . They 've always has elements of Electronica before being to dancy..which Radiohead is similiar but thats the only similiarity . Odds and Electrify are probably my least favorites on the album but they grew on me enough that i didnt give this a 3 star review . Paul Meany seams like he 's forgotten what got him here first ... his lyrics ... when he was in Earthsuit he wasnt overly blunt bout his faith but you knew what he was talking about . But on Electrify it sounds like he 's talking about trying to have sex with this chick ... i know they probably arent labeled `` Christian Rock '' anymore but do n't get the drastic change in content or unless he wants to stray away from God ... thats probably why I didnt give it 5 stars ... sorry for the mixed matched review ... Just thought id point out different good and bad things but there arent many bad things . THEY ARE BETTER LIVE !	1
Either people not giving this album 5 stars are : Fan boys/girls stucked in a freshman albumNot musiciansThis album is absolutely brilliant , simple as that , every single song in this album is fantastic ( I ca n't say that about several of my all time favorite bands . Different , original with breathtaking arrangements solid lyrics , vocals , overall performance ( live and in studio ) If you are musicians you know how hard is to compose a solid album and bring such an exciting mixture into the table for everybody in the band to contribute . The violin in `` Clipping '' for example is just superb the arrangement has such a good taste it melts into the whole idea behind the song.People tend to compare bands to get an overall idea of their sound when talked about a new band . That is simply wrong , what we can do is discuss a little about their influences.I can say while growing around the same time I can hear the vibes from Muse , what influenced both bands ? I do n't know . Also I see some Radiohead influence and some goodies from the indie electronic scene.Should you get this album ? Yes !	1
You 've got to hand it to Europe ... ..they really know how to rock out . When many bands half their age are already going soft and selling out , Europe continues to up the hard rock ante.Sure , this album , as a whole , is not quite as bombastic as it 's predecessor , `` Secret Society , '' but there are more songs with hooks on this album . The title track is epic , and will stick in your head . The ballad `` New Love in Town '' seems to blend together earlier hits `` Carrie '' and `` Prisoner in Paradise '' and add a little blues touch into the mix . `` The Beast '' is a hard rock track that sounds as if it could have come right off of their earliest albums . `` U Devil U '' and `` Gon na Get Ready '' begin with a bad*** slow , grinding beat and burst into big melodic choruses . The album blends the sounds of old Europe and new Eurpoe , and does so effectively.Not every track is perfect , though . `` Catch that Plane '' sounds monotone , and the album loses considerable steam as it winds down , but it is redeemed by the inclusion of the two live tracks , which are incredible performances that inject life into the album to close it out on a great note . Europe may have sung `` The Final Countdown '' back in 1987 ... .but as `` Only Young Twice '' proves , this band has new life and they are living it , apparently , to the fullest . If this is what a midlife crisis sounds like , I can not wait for mine to begin ! 4.5 stars .	1
I admit , I 'm not really impressed with this album but Last Look At Eden is worth getting the album for . Hopefully one day they will have the MP3 's so people can get that song .	1
Swedish melodic rockers Europe ( yes , of `` Final Countdown '' fame ) released their eighth studio album in 2009 . Last Look at Eden is the band 's third offering since their reunion , and follows up the somewhat disappointing 2006 effortSecret Society . I actually put off buying this album for a couple of years because Secret Society left such a bad taste in my mouth , but I 'm glad I finally gave it a try , because it certainly seems like Europe is back on the right track here.I suppose the first thing to clear up is that Europe did not go back to their ` 80s `` hair metal '' roots here . Those days are long gone , and the band does n't seem interested in trying to recapture that sound , which is probably for the best . They 're not trying for a modern rock sound either . Maybe they got that out of their system on Secret Society . No , Last Look at Eden puts the band back on the path they started withStart From the Dark- smart , steady melodic rock with real heart and an obvious appreciation for bands like Rainbow and Thin Lizzy . And the songs are really good too . They 're not as overtly catchy as the old ` 80s and early ` 90s material , but they are very melodic and have a way of sinking in after a spin or two . `` New Love in Town , '' `` No Stone Unturned '' and the title track are great examples . John Norum 's guitar work is more sublime than showy here , and Joey Tempest has a strong , steady delivery that gives the songs some added heart and soul.As long as you do n't go into this album expecting anotherThe Final Countdown , Last Look at Eden is unlikely to disappoint serious Europe fans . It 's a very solid modern melodic rock album , and just what I had hoped to hear from the band after Secret Society.Edition Notes : Last Look at Eden comes in a fairly sturdy digipack and features a pair of live songs - `` Yesterday 's News '' and `` Wakeup Call '' - as bonus tracks .	1
Indeed , there is little doubt IMHO that this is the best , the most complete and sumptuous slab of wattage Europe have unleashed since they reconvened . Start From the Dark had it 's moments but the rusty interplay was a bit obvious in that John Norums riffs and Joey Tempests vox seemed utterly disconnected on many numbers . Secret Society was a good album , no doubt about it . But this is a touch better . It hangs together much like Secret Society did but it has a certain X factor and I can understand why some people are giving this the full five star treatment.On this album Europe does a range of things right . The prelude sets the tone for the whole album , a nifty little intro number of the sort you may more normally expect from a power metal band . The title track itself is a sturdy hard rocker where all things gel nicely . Elsewhere we get some interesting keys/riff/vox interplay on tunes such as No Stone Unturned which at times seems like a song with some form of multiple personality disorder as the chorus swoops on a Tempest vocal hook while Norum warbles away in the background and Mic Micheali comes over all 70 's prog tinged during the lulls . Other noteworthy numbers are the funky U Devil U which personally I find a bit twee though it 's hard to argue with the amount of roll it gives you with your serving of rock.The production is n't as warm and traditional sounding as Secret Society but that 's not to say it 's not as good , just things seem more ... .. shiny here . The booklet comes with full lyrics and I was lucky enough to score the version with a couple of bonus tracks . Do n't get too carried away on this however as neither are new songs , rather live renditions of a ) Yesterdays News and b ) Wake Up Call.All up this is a fine , fine effort that has seen the band very much back in the spotlight - Classic Rock gave this 8/10 and even Metal Hammer ( UK ) were being nice to the band not to mention their headlining of the Bloodstock Festival to much internet consternation . If you were ever a fan of this band it 's probably a good idea to grab this CD as it will become a trusted companion in the car , the office and around the home such is it 's utility . Almost five stars .	1
This has to be the best album by Europe since Prisoners in Paradise with a few songs that sound just like their old days . The CD I got was in a Eco-Friendly case and includes a booklet . If your a Europe fan and you do n't have this I would recommend this .	1
A must for any Brooks & Dunn fan . You may have all the songs on other cds , but there are several new songs on this collection .	1
this was a great cd by Brooks and Dunn , I miss them so much ! Brooks and Dunn had some great music , thank you amazon for making it possible to download into my computer !	1
This is a good send-off to perhaps country music 's greatest duo . While I think it was more of a marketing scheme , I think it is a good collection as most of their greatest songs and hits are here , such as My Maria , Lost & Found , and of Course Boot Scootin ' Boogie . If you are a devout and die hard B & D fan you will love this album , and I recommend it .	1
This 2 cd set is great . They have their old hits as well as new ones . I would definitely say it 's worth the money .	1
In my opinion there has been any better country duo than Brooks & Dunn . Both are outstanding singers and song writers . Their music moves you whether to dance as in Boot Scoot Boogie or to tears such as Believe or Neon Moon . Plus Only In America make a person proud to be an American . All great songs . Fantastic CD that everyone should own and enjoy . Very Highly Recommended .	1
Although Arctic Monkeys are superstars in their native England , here in the states it seems that they 'll only be known for `` I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor '' , despite a Saturday Night Live appearance . At any rate , their first two albums are classics in my book , so I had no trouble picking up their latest album , Humbug.Some people might not realize this is an Arctic Monkeys album right away , however . Not that the style sounds any different ( a little of a surprise , considering it was mostly produced by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme ) , but Alex 's voice has obviously changed between the releases ofFavourite Worst Nightmareand this album because he 's singing in a lower register . But the songs still stand out . I was n't as excited about `` Crying Lightning '' as everyone else simply because I do n't think it makes much sense , but there are better songs like `` Potion Approaching '' , `` My Propeller '' and the necessary end-of-album mellow song , `` The Jeweller 's Hands '' . And the spelling-out-the-title vibe of `` Dangerous Animals '' actually works quite well.My only other real concern is that `` now you 're hiding in my soup '' line in `` Fire and the Thud '' . But that kind of thing is easily ignored . While not a classic album like their first two , Humbug should have you saying everything but.Anthony Rupert	1
I do n't know any Acrtic Monkey fans at my school except a few Seniors at my school , but I have heard that this album was a disappointing among some of the fans and people who enjoyed their first two works.I think that this is a milestone for the Acrtic Monkeys , it 's good to do something out of the box , even though people may not like it . One of the biggest problems about music is the fact that band are often place under pressure to produce bubble-gum music for the sells , but this band is n't playing for the glory . They play because they enjoy it.The album 's tempo may be slower than the others , therefore less amiable for people who listen for the single , but it will grow on you after a few listens . I 'm not going to compare this album to their previous works because it 's too different ... Sometimes you just need to stop the comparisions and thank the new material.I personally enjoyed this album , and I think I will purchase the album soon .	1
Humbug being Artic Monkeys 3rd studio album and their 2009 release was a hit with both the critics and the general public . Rolling Stone and Metro giving it 4/5 in their reviews . The album peaked at # 1 in both the UK and Ireland . My favorite tracks are `` Crying Lightning '' and `` Cornerstone '' . All the lyrics are included in the booklet but not a list of who plays what . 4/5 .	1
Arctic Monkey 's threw the world a surprising curve ball with their third studio album Humbug , changing their musical direction quite considerably and releasing an album of complicating , challenging music that bore little resemblance to the fun and easy going style of their debut.The music started to incorporate both psychedelic influences and desert/stoner rock influences , which , while not overwhelming the album certainly left the overall impression as something different and odd . It has n't become a Sleep album or a Down album all of a sudden , but you can hear twinges of that style here and there . Josh Homme of Kyuss/QOTSA fame co-produced the album and guest featured on four tracks , which should give you some indication of the direction the album took.At first , I did not care for the changes one bit , I thought they should have had more fun lyrics , more fast songs and less jarring time sig/tempo changes , many fans did in fact , given the backlash against this album.The album really grew on me however and now I 'd rate it very highly indeed . The material just as an enjoyably hypnotic quality , and there is much to like about the album.Standout tracks include the opener ` My Propeller , ' the oft-played-in-concert number ` Pretty Visitors , ' and ` Secret Door , ' which I think most bridges the old and new styles.Overall , many people may be put off by Humbug , but if you enjoy a bit of prog or stoner rock then you may find that this album grows on you after a while.Comment	1
Although British disco-punk has declined in popularity near the end of the 00s , the Arctic Monkeys are still producing solid music.The band 's third album , `` Humbug , '' is a psychedelic masterpiece that transforms the pop band into an artistic phenomenon.Whereas other British punk groups have sloppily added electronic instruments to their ensemble , the Arctic Monkey 's sound remains largely intact . Aside from the pianos in `` Fire and the Thud '' and the organ sound in `` Pretty Visitors , '' they still sound like the same band.However , the recording style went through major changes . With help from co-producer Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age , the new album is drenched with dreamy echos and loud bass riffs from Nick O'Malley . Turner 's high-pitched voice was also toned down for a more down-to-earth tone.The resulting sound is an irresistable mix between the hazy echos from Marvin Gaye 's `` What 's Going On '' album and the aggressive punchiness of the indie punk group , Kasabian.Even though it does n't sound like it should work , the Monkeys make it work miraculously , in true artistic splendor . Matt Helders ' drums are more subdued in this album , but his staccato-heavy 4/4 rhythm transforms the rules for punk rock bands . Rather than rely on the typical Green Day-style speed punk rhythm , Helders litters his rhythm with drum rolls , tom tom thumping and cymbal smashing , making for a beat that sounds more or less like hip-hop beats on steroids.The band 's new , bass-oriented sound is even more infectious . Songs such as the hit single `` Crying Lightning '' sound like a dark '70s noir song , rich with probably the coolest bass riff of the year from O'Malley . Other songs , such as `` Dangerous Animals , '' are adrenaline-pumping tracks with a wicked bass line in the chorus.Most of all , Alex Turner 's poetic lyrics are unforgettable . There 's nothing cooler than hearing Turner sing `` Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste/You 'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say , behold is the crook in the hammock plays . '' It 's an infectious song that turns the slums into a bizarre world , featuring a tramp with a trampoline under his arm and barking alarm which `` waits , coiled 'till the corner is turned . `` Despite the heavy criticism of the band from other reviewers , this is definitely the Arctic Monkeys ' best album yet . The band has somehow managed to add artistic flair to their sound , without getting carried away with electronic sound effects . Combined with Turner 's knack for colorful lyrics , `` Humbug '' is one of the best albums of 2009 .	1
Like most reviewers of Humbug , I am quite delighted by this new Arctic Monkeys effort . It certainly proves to me that the band has staying power . The CD is not particularly long , but you get ten mostly excellent punchy , peppy songs and the great delivery fans have gotten used to . My favorites are : My Propeller , which to me is evocative of 60s `` underground '' rock ; the driving Crying Lightning ; the brief but pounding Potion Approaching ; another pounder with Pretty Visitors , and The Jeweller 's Hands which I find to be Humbug 's most interesting piece.This CD is a fine collection of songs which should show the listener that rock music still has something new to say after all . Importantly , the booklet that accompanies the CD contains the lyrics . If you are not listening to the Arctic Monkeys , you are missing out .	1
Heavy and dark best describes the Arctic Monkeys new sound on their third CD . Despite their protestations to the contrary , they sound more mature and fans of their previously more frenetic fare ( `` I bet you look good on the dancefloor '' , `` Brianstorm '' to mention a few ) may be sorely disappointed . It falls somewhere between the Arctic Monkeys sound of old and lead vocalist Alex Turner 's more symphonic side project Last Shadow Puppets.The CD comprises just 10 tracks , opening with `` My propeller '' which finds Alex Turner practically crooning to a gently rocking backdrop . `` My propeller wo n't spin/and I ca n't get it started on my own/when are you arriving '' .Lead-off single `` Crying lightning '' is filled with crunchy riffs and chiming guitars and should be a favourite of fans of their old sound . Lovely ! Other standouts are the stomping `` Secret door '' ( with a nice acoustic intro ) , the sombre `` The fire and the thud '' , the charming chiming ballad `` Cornerstone '' ( about picking up girls in pubs ) , the beautiful ambient `` Dance little liar '' , `` Pretty visitors '' ( filled with angular guitars and irregular drum patterns , the closest to their old sound ) , and closing `` The jeweller 's hands '' ( sounding like some score to some suspense movie , with a swirling psychedelic-sounding coda , think `` 505 '' from `` Favourite worst nightmare '' ) .Their lyrics , as usual , tell fabulous stories ; `` The inevitables gather to push you around/Any old voice makes a punishing sound/He became laughter 's assassin/Shortly after he showed you what it was '' from `` The jeweller 's hands '' .This album is edgy and experimental , and I 'm glad to see Turner and the lads not content to remain in their comfort zone . A grower , but one that richly rewards at the end .	1
Arctic Monkeys blew onto the scene , seemingly out of nowhere , in 2006 with their debut album `` Whatever People Say I Am , That 's What I 'm Not '' , becoming the fastest-selling debut in UK history ( and ultimately also selling quite well in the US ) . It was a good album , for sure , but overrated in my opinion . The band quickly released a follow-up album , 2007 's `` Favourite Worst Nightmare '' , which I thought was absolutely fantastic ( I had it in my Top 3 of the year ) , even though it was less commercially successful than the first album , both in the UK and here in the US . ( The closing track `` 505 '' will give you an idea of the new album , incidentally . ) The band toured relentlessly and then took its merry time to come back with new material . Now finally comes the hugely anticipated third album . I must admit that I was skeptical when I heard that Josh Homme , Queens of the Stone Age frontman , produced most of the album ( I am not a Queens of the Stone Age fan ) .It is immediately clear that `` Humbug '' ( 10 tracks ; 39 min . ) is quite the departure from the previous two albums . much darker and more subdued . The album stumbles out of the blocks with a tentative `` My Propeller '' , the weakest track on here , and I generally skip it to be honest . But things perk up after that with `` Crying Lightning '' ( 1st UK single ) , possibly the best song on here , and most reminiscent of the earlier albums . `` Dangerous Animals '' is quite nice as well , which is followed by a nice ballad `` Secret Parade '' . The middle section of the album brings mostly slower , subdued songs . The band really finds its groove on this album towards the latter part , starting with `` Dance Little Liar '' , setting off a tense and great ending of the album . `` Pretty Visitors '' is one of the best tracks on here , and the 5+ min . closer `` The Jeweller 's Hands '' caps off the album nicely.If you are looking for a repeat of the first 2 albums , you will be sorely disappointed . This album is dense but it started to win me over after repeated listening . Arctic Monkeys have moved on , period . Deal with it . I find the comparison with Kings of Leon very telling . After KoL 's first two `` Southern Strokes '' albums , that band came back with an equally darker 3rd album `` Because of the Times '' , telling us the band was going different places ( and we now know to what that has lead , with their `` Only By the Night '' mega-smash album ) . Having seen Arctic Monkeys in concert a number of times , I also imagine that a number of these seemingly subdued songs will rock hard in concert . The band is visiting Ohio next month , ca n't wait for that .	1
The UK music press has created and destroyed so many bands over the years , that it 's always best to take a `` don't-believe-the-hype '' approach.But three albums into their career , here 's what we know:1 . Arctic Monkeys are the best British band of the new millennium . ( Sorry Franz Ferdinand , Editors , Kasabian , Kaiser Chiefs , etc. ) .2 . Alex Turner has the wit , intelligence , and vocal chops to be ranked among the best British singer-songwriters of the past 40 years - he 's up there with the likes of Ray Davies , Pete Townsend , Paul Weller , Morrissey and Jarvis Cocker.3 . `` Humbug '' is a major step in the band 's musical evolution -- Sheffield post-punk blended with the stated influences of Cream and Jimi Hendrix and produced by Josh Homme ( Queens of the Stone Age ) and James Ford ( Simian/Alex Turner 's side project The Last Shadow Puppets ) .The Monkeys delivered on the hype with their brilliant debut album `` Whatever People Say I Am , That Is What I 'm Not . '' They followed up with the excellent `` Favourite Worst Nightmare . '' Now they 've delivered possibly their best yet : a hard-boiled sweet called `` Humbug . '' Along with a new maturity , there 's a familiar lyrical cheekiness , too , especially on tracks like My Propeller ( `` I ca n't get it started on my own '' ) and Crying Lightning ( `` My thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed/On the last of your pick'n'mix '' ) . `` Pretty Visitors '' is the track most like the Monkeys of old . And standout `` Cornerstone '' is a song of lost love and mistaken identities reminiscent of The Who 's `` Disguises . `` Clearly , the cheeky Monkeys have evolved into grown up rockers.Bring on the backlash .	1
WOW ! The Arctic Monkeys are one of the coolest acts in music in the last years ! HUMBUG is a real great album ! I really recommend ARCTIC MONKEYS to anyone who likes creative punk rock !	1
This is very different with a tinge of `` difficult third album '' syndrome . Turner 's singing style has changed significantly , heavily influenced by QOTSA , and I can hear The Doors , PJ Harvey and Morrissey influences all over this record.It 's a a sombre , darker album . Lyrically still impressive , but difficult to follow.It will be interesting to see where they go next , but it seems the Arctic Monkeys are growing up . Early fans may well be alienated , but they may attract new ones .	1
The Arctic Monkeys are n't kids anymore . The mere need for speed no longer thrills the way it used to , and their third album is a darker , more complex batch of songs than anything they 've ever attempted . Stone Age Queen Josh Homme may have pushed the band in this direction , but since some of the songs onFavourite Worst Nightmareseemed to me to already be moving towards the dark , I suspect a natural progression.In many ways , `` Humbug '' reminds me of The Undertones ' as they progressed to theirPositive Touchalbum . The bands both started out as hyper-adolescent punkier outfits , with their lyrical sights set on teen girls and gear ( Mars Bars to Nikes ) , and both sounded like a group that could have only formed in a British DiY environment . While their fans might have wanted the Monkeys to do songs like `` I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor '' forever , band leader Alex Turner appears to be tired of the form . So he minor-keys it , slows the pace down ( allowing drummer Matt Helders room to show off ) and allows his voice to flow like an instrument.That makes songs like `` Propeller '' sound almost menacing . Or let the hook in the first single , `` Crying Lightning , '' evolve out from the song instead of sledgehammering you . Or to experiment with textures , like the backwards guitar on `` Cornerstone . '' With `` Humbug , '' the Arctic Monkeys prove once and for all that they 're a three dimensional act , and will outlast the hype that swept them to their original stardom .	1
I picked this album up out of impulse , and I was largely rewarded . I had heard no Arctic Monkeys beforehand , but this album has had a lot of praise . So I bought it , and after a few listens the whole album nearly grew on me . It sounds like a more mystical Queens of the Stone Age/Muse . At first , like everyone else , I did n't really dig it , but after a while I could n't stop listening to it . The whole album is filled with phenomenal bass and drums complimented with catchy guitar riffs and dark melodies . Instrumentally its an amazing album . The frontman had to grow on me , but by now I 'm singing all the songs with him.So I 'll agree with the rest of the reviews and say , Let the album grow on you . The only songs i liked right off the bat were `` Dangerous Animals '' and `` Dance Little Liar '' . I will also say that those songs are the best on the cd , in my opinion . Other awesome tracks include `` Pretty Visitors '' , `` Crying Lightning '' , `` Potion Approaching '' and `` Fire and the Thud . '' The album has a sort of moody stubborn style , which separates it from the formula rock albums . The concept of the album is what keeps you listening to it . It an album that moves you slowly but steadily.Songs like `` Cornerstone '' and `` The Jeweller 's Hands '' are yet to grow on me and I doubt they will.This being my first Arctic Monkeys album , I 'm quite impressed . I hope to pick up more of their cds in the future , because they seem like the type of band to always bring something new to the table . This album has a unique concept and it does n't sound like any regular rock album . They have , possibly , the best bassist and drummer out there in the business right now . This album is a huge success and is now largely owned by way more than just their fan base . I had no previous experience in listening to this band , and now i got ta say that I 'm a fan . I listen to bands who are concerned with making art instead of selling cds . Arctic Monkeys are true artists and this album is a beautiful work of art .	1
We all know the cybernetic version of Cinderella starring the Arctic Monkeys like the national anthem : a band born in the myspace era that saw them become audience and critics darlings overnight . Backed by the smartly named campaign `` Do n't believe the hype '' they soared steadily and even though their follow-up was not as rotund in its offer as their debut their popularity did not dwindled a bit.For their third record they have enlisted QOTSA frontman Josh Homme and Last Shadow Puppets ' producer James Ford , both of who do not stain the Arctic Monkeys perspective but rather make it grow . Homme 's presence can be perceived cleary in the vocals and the darker soundscape of heavier guitars . Ford 's touch shows in the detailed arrangements that had been previewed in his work with the Puppets.Singer Alex Turner sounds more mature , and that is a term that will stick in one 's head throughout this album as the band is obviously taking baby steps into new horizons , cautiously but with determination . Growing up is a reality they have decided to embrace musically and the results have sprung a surprising detour on their ascension road.Potion approaching and Cornerstone , two of the finest moments , are perfect examples of the new territories they explore : they are thinking sonically without abandoning the candid approach to lyrics . Lead single Crying lightning is not as immediate as anything off the infectious Whatever people say I am , that 's what I 'm not but it grows with each listening . Pretty visitors , rumored to be the next and third single , reminisces of their hyped-up more straightforward beginnings , while The jeweller 's hands gives an amazing closing to a record that is destined to last beyond its immediacy.Edgy sounds great in Humbug . Not only Turner 's physique has become more robust , the entire the band has developed into a welcome improvement from the startling Favourite worst nightmare . Sexual innuendo , aggression and love declarations are omnipresent with a humorous and perverse twist that only helps to make the record sound complete and to slowly disengage it from angst-punk . The lyrics keep telling stories as usual but now they are embedded with melody ; emotions turn into deviant habits and observance gives cue to elongated introspection.It is not precise to call them a youth garage band anymore as their sound has expanded and landed them almost side to side with the big ones . It would be absurd to deny the improvements they 've made in only four years as it would not be gratuitous to affirm that shall they continue not relishing on the success of first-timer luck , and we are quite sure that will be the case , they will be very soon looked at above the shoulder by everybody .	1
I 've always liked Five for Fighting and this CD shows a lot of maturity , fuller sound and that great voice . I heard that John writes most of the songs , plays all the instruments and of course sings the songs . I love the song & # 34 ; Transfer & # 34 ; - catchy , unique and pleasant to listen to . Timberline is another wonderful catchy song . Note to the Unknown Soldier is such a great patriotic song . He 's a great storyteller and his music is wonderful ! If you have n't bought any of his CD 's , this is a good one to try . Also , pick up The Battle for Everything - another excellent Five for Fighting CD . Enjoy !	1
If you were disappointed by the piano rock on Fray 's latest , you will instantly like this . Production values are stratospheric here , so listen loud with a good headset . `` Transfer '' is such an amazing song , it has a soaring Coldplay and Keane style wrapped into it , one of the best songs ever made in my opinion .	1
This is the fifth studio album by the talented singer-songwriter , John Ondrasik . The album has that great Five For Fighting sound that we have all grown to know and love . I especially loved This Dance and Augie Nieto , but really enjoyed all of the tracks . If you like Five For Fighting , then get Slice , you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF FFF SINCE `` AMERICA TOWN '' AND AM A FAN OF `` SLICE '' AS WELL.IT CONTINUES THE TRADEMARK SOUND , FINE PIANO PLAYING & SONGWRITING OF JOHN ONDRASIK.THE SOFT BALLAD AND SOFT ROCKERS.SLICE , TUESDAY , CHANCES , TRANSFER & STORY OF YOUR LIFE ARE MY FAVES FROM THE ALBUM.BUT ALL SONGS ARE WORTH LISTENING TO.TOP NOTCH AND STYLISH IN THEIR OWN RIGHT ...	1
It 's hard to believe the group was named for a sporting penalty . John Ondrasik writes such gentle lyrics with orchestration that 's like pinpoints of light shining through a forest . This latest offering by the pop singer-songwriter is no exception.The CD opens with the title cut , which talks about the difference between then and now and exposes you to just a brief 'slice ' of life . In addition to this song , the other eleven songs talk about the unknown soldier , who they 've named `` Sam '' , climbing to the top of the mountains to find peace , and various philosophies of living life and finding joy.Pop is generally not my favorite musical genre , but I have discovered that FOF 's sparkling music is as hard to resist as ginger beer and equally uplifting . Another gem to add to their collection.Rebecca Kyle , October 2009	1
Make no mistake about it , John Ondrasik and FFF are doing his very best Brandon Flowers impersonation in Slice . The music , the lyrics , the hooks are all imbedded in Brandon 's solo from last year Flamingo sans the two girl back up singers . That 's not to slam John , but I ca n't help wonder if anything so similar is just some big cosmic collision . Although The Killers have n't been around as long as Five For Fighting , their popularity and quick rise among fans and critics appears to put them at an advantage . Flowers is a better vocalist with better range than Ondrasik in my opinion , but both are great lyricists ' and know how to infuse a song with catchy hooks and phrasing . Slice is a good album , just not a great one .	1
When Five For Fighting ( aka John Ondrasik 's ) album `` America Town '' broke out in 2001 , John seemed to be stuck somewhere between sensitive singer-songwriter and John Mellencamp blue-collar scribe . A decade later for `` Slice , '' he has fully divested himself of the blue-collar tough-guy act and has fully embraced his inner-soft rocker . `` Slice '' starts off with a nostalgic look at the days social networking meant taking your Don McLean album to a friend 's house , and then continues in a richly arranged Elton John/Billy Joel fashion.Ondrasik still has not lost his penchant for heavier topics , though . `` Note To The Unknown Soldier '' is as serious and melancholy as its title suggests , and `` Augie Nieto '' was written for a man suffering from Lou Gherig 's disease , assists a foundation to look for the cure , and wrote a book with his toes ( his lone remaining movable body part ) . No light reading , despite the easy listening trappings . The remainder of the songs deal primarily with love and other struggles , easily denoted by titles like `` Hope , '' `` This Dance '' and `` Love Ca n't Change The Weather . `` It 's a maturation that suits Ondrasik well . By puffing up the arrangements , he helps to draw attention away from the despair in most of his writing to the fact that he can create some great melodies . The intermingling of these elements makes `` Slice '' the most consistent and enjoyable of Five For Fighting 's albums .	1
John Ondrasik is far from my favorite singer but he has had some great songs and albums performing as Five For Fighting ! But this is by far the best songs he has written or composed . These songs are just beautiful , well written and crafted pop songs ! It 's the opposite of so many other artists who remain more popular than this alt band but lack material anything even close to this . Some might say it 's a bit too lush and orchestrated , perhaps too mellow or melodic ? But I like that kind of music and ballads like these . His voice glides so nicely on these tunes and I havent heard a bad song on the entire album . Perhaps the commercial success of this band is already behind them , but the QUALITY of the music has hit a peak with Slice ! I love it !	1
This is not one of Willie 's stellar works . it 's more or less a hodge podge from second and third liner tunes ... .but it is better than his other Willie and friends cd 's . I liked this cd ... Sound quality is good . I like Willie 's perspective of life , as he lives like his music projects . Nothing phony about this guy .	1
A good Willie Nelson album is like a good bottle of wine . His voice is perfectly aged and sounds as good as ever . Lost Highway is a collection of some of Nelson 's recent gems , some of which are immediately recognizable and some that you may not have heard before . `` Maria ( Shut Up and Kiss Me '' ) , with Rob Thomas , is a fun , lighthearted way to start off the album , which includes guest appearances from such music legends as Lucinda Williams , Elvis Costello , and Ray Price.For me , the treasures of this album are `` Back to Earth '' from Songbird ( produced by Ryan Adams and feature the Cardinals as Willie 's studio band ) and the several unreleased songs , including `` Superman '' . If you have seen Willie in concert recently , he loves to perform this song live , but the album version really stands out on this collection.Of course , you also get a few of Willie 's greatest hits , including `` Mendocino County Line '' , featuring Leann Womack , Beer for My Horses , with Toby Keith and Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain with Shania Twain ( a very interesting version of this classic song ) .If you are a Willie Nelson fan , this is one that has to be in your collection . If you are new to Willie , what a great place to start .	1
I would n't go as far as calling this a & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; as some have labeled it , but this compilation of fairly recent Willie Nelson recordings is mostly satisfying . With a voice as distinctive and comforting l as Willie 's , virtually everything he sings sounds good , so to rate the album you 're left with judging the songs themselves . And that 's where this collection falls a bit short . Plenty of good tunes , but I think it 's lacking some really true gems , the sort of stuff that Willie seemed to effortlessly churn out in the 1970s.So maybe this is n't the very best material that Willie Nelson ever recorded , but it 's still head and shoulders above most of the dreck that passes for country music nowadays . Willie has his vocals comfort zone and every one of these songs fits securely within that zone . As always , it 's such a pleasure to hear him sing . Even on the duet , where he shares the spotlight , Willie shines . And to my ears his voice has n't & # 34 ; aged & # 34 ; a bit . It 's still a magical thing.1 .

It seem we 'll never get enough of Willie.I really like this collectoin of new and old songs , as well as the artists that Willie brings into his music.Many artists are loners , in that they sing their songs by themselves.However , with Willie , he stands alone in both his songwriting and singing abilities ; that he has no fear of competing with others.As a matter of fact , he seems to relish singing with others and also singing other 's songs.This album is a perfect example of his versitility.Whether it is singing that classic `` You Do n't Know Me '' by Cindy Walker and Eddy Arnold , or that great Hank Williams standard `` Lost Highway '' with Ray Price , and then there 's that classic `` Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain '' , written by Fred Rose , that he sings with Shania Twain which they do a stupendous job on ; or the `` Cowboys Are Fond Of Each Other '' and `` Ai n't Going Back On Brokeback Mountain '' , where Willie addresses one of the most politically correct issues of our times ; you ' want to add this CD to your collection and enjoy what Willie brings.This CD reiterates that Willie is still the best of the best and his songwriting , maturing voice and performances still continues to shine and provide freshness in whatever he tackles .	1
`` Lost Highway , '' finds Willie Nelson doing what he seemingly loves to do best - make music with his friends -- and let 's emphasize the `` make '' in that . The man works at his music making . He , certainly , has been doing it for decades , and . at about 74 , is a longtime member of the Country Music Hall of Fame . This record finds him doing two duets with silky country crooner Ray Price , 81 -- they may well be the last of the great honky tonk performers , and the last of the Texas Swing singers , too . They here give us the title song , `` Lost Highway , '' and an emotionally vibrant `` I 'm Still Not over You . '' Nelson also duets here with country stars Lee Ann Womack , Toby Keith , and Shania Twain . The artist collaborates with husband/wife team Elvis Costello and Diana Krall on the timeless , thoughtful `` Crazy , '' one of the first songs Nelson ever wrote : it was a big career-making hit for Patsy Clyne . Finally , he delivers a soaring version of country classic `` You Do n't Know Me , '' and a swinging `` Harder They Come . `` Nelson can render a song , any song , with a passion and purity few artists can match . He can deliver an emotionally-laden song , yet do it with a clean , understated approach : guess it takes decades of practice to learn that . Furthermore , the man does just seem to like to ramble , and to make music with his friends : I was once lucky enough to catch him in New York 's Central Park , one beautiful blue sky spring evening , playing and singing with Johnny Cash , Kris Kristofferson , and Waylon Jennings , then calling themselves The Highwaymen . Believe me , there were lots of good vibes bouncing around .	1
Following the success of their last two albums , Muse did a considerable amount of tinkering with what would become their fifth studio album . After a series of studio experiments and endless writing sessions , they finally got around to producing the record themselves and thus `` The Resistance '' has arrived . Sprawling , beautiful and most importantly - musical - the album aims to be yet another classic , with the band accomplishing such lofty goals almost effortlessly.Like those before it , Muse 's fifth is swamped with heartfelt vocals , synthesizers , breath-taking piano playing and distorted base , all the elements that have come to be associated with the band by now . `` The Resistance , '' is n't much of a creative departure for the band , but is most certainly a more focused and sharper affair than 2006'sBlack Holes and Revelationswas . The album is highlighted by songs ranging from the epic `` United States of Eurasia '' to the arena-rock of `` Guiding Light , '' a stunning ballad that is sure to send shivers up your spine each and every time . On songs such as these , the guitar-work of Matthew Bellamy comes to the forefront and blazes a trail for the rest to follow . Each song packs a punch of over-whelming emotion and power . Think U2 , but without any pretentions or limitations.The coup de grce , however , comes in the album 's three-part `` Exogenesis Symphony , '' which closes out the album , marking perhaps Muse 's finest musical achievement to date . Employing over 40 musicians ( which is a staggering ratio to the three men that normally make up the band ) this weighty piece of music is both epic and ambitious , much like the eight songs that precede it . This piece may take up a good chunk of space , but it also goes a long way in capping off a breath-taking and boundary pushing album . Success and the growing expectations from the band 's audience have done little to spoil the band 's creativity , and in turn , Muse has yielded yet another rich and robust affair . `` The Resistance '' is , without a doubt , destined to become a modern classic .	1
You just ca n't please some `` fans '' . Whenever a band tries doing something a little bit different , there are those `` I use to love this band , but what the heck is this ? '' sort of comments.To me MUSE was never original , but then few bands really are . So if the music is well done , is a lack of originality such a bad thing ? Sure , when I listen to this I hear Radiohead , Queen , Porcupine Tree or some combination there of , but I still can recognize it as MUSE . This release , like the prior ones , is quite well done , a bit more variety here to keep things interesting , so I deem it rather enjoyable .	1
Like a lot of people I was first introduced to Muse thanks to Stephenie Meyer and , from the first piano arpeggio of Sunburn I was hooked . I quickly bought the rest of their albums and liked each one . THis is no exception . A more poppy sound , but as another reviewer commented I suspect this was so tat Muse could reach out to those who had been brainwashed by the Katy Perries and Lady Gagas of what passes for music these days . And the complete absence of Autotune from a single song on this CD was the most beautiful thing I 'd heard in quite some time . Because come on people , seriously . Do we want to sing or sound like Daleks ? Back on topic though , I love every song on this CD , but my favorites are the three openers , Uprising , The Resistance and Undisclosed Desires .	1
Muse just barely disappointed me with Black Holes and Revelations , an album critically acclaimed to be their crowning achievement that I found slightly uneven . I 've never thought twice about naming Absolution as my favorite album by the band , and as a follow-up , Black Holes just seemed to be lacking the same focus and drive . This left room for The Resistance to come in and reclaim what I felt they had lost . In a way , it does . Resistance takes the best moments from each album and tries to put its own unique spin on them . The result is far more hit and miss than Black Holes could have ever dreamt of being , yet still a somewhat rewarding experience for any Muse fan.What Muse does exceedingly well on The Resistance is the same thing they 've always done ; craft loud , smart , beautigul rock music . `` Uprising '' feels like a Muse take on a Marilyn Manson song - at least initially . By the time the third chorus rolls around , you 'll most likely be rocking out to the harmonies and Muse-peggios that you 've grown accustomed to over the years . As far as pure , unadulterated rock goes though , you 'd be hard-pressed to find anything on this album more satisfying than `` United States of Eurasia . '' The song is so pretty , yet so raw and real that you 'll think you were listening to Queen . When Matt screams out , `` United States ! United States ! '' I get goosebumps at the sheer awesomeness of it all . This is classic Muse ; something that any long-time fan can instantly fall in love with.But as I said , The Resistance is a highly uneven listen , and where songs like `` Eurasia '' will rock your junk clean off , others like `` Guiding Light '' fall absolutely flat . It 's this album 's `` Invincible '' - really good until you start to see all the flaws in it . `` Undisclosed Desires '' is Muse 's completely misguided attempt at making a Britney Spears song , which may pander to the `` Twilight '' crowd ( I ca n't even begin to tell you how much it annoys me when people describe `` Supermassive Black Hole '' as `` that song from Twilight ) , but it has absolutely no place on this album ! In all fairness , it seems like they 're trying to recreate that same song right down to the lyrical content . But where `` Supermassive '' had an irresistible rock groove to it , this one is simply boring . As far as the poppier Muse is concerned , I 'll be just fine with `` I Belong to You , '' easily one of the album 's finest tracks . It 's got a danceable beat and an infectious feel . The French interlude is strikingly beautiful , and when everything comes back together again , well , it 's just magic ! A review of The Resistance would n't be complete without mentioning the 3-part `` symphony '' that closes out the album . `` Exogenesis '' is straight from the Absolution-era of Muse , and for that reason , I ca n't help but love it ! `` Overture '' sounds like a roided-out version of `` Ruled by Secrecy , '' the eerie closer to the band 's 2003 masterpiece , `` Cross-Pollination '' is straight out of `` Butterflies and Hurricanes , '' while `` Redemption '' sort of just stands on its own merits . As great as these songs are though , they feel entirely tacked-on to the album , which takes away from their greatness a bit.The biggest flaw of The Resistance in my opinion is the lyrical content . Matt Bellamy has seemed compelled to write socio-political songs as of late , so seeing it appear all over the album is no big surprise . But Muse 's music alone has always made me want to go take on the whole world . Writing a song about how we need to rebel against the powers that be and `` watch our flag ascend '' just seems like a dumbing-down of the music . Popular music has always been an outlet for speaking out against governments and `` fat cats , '' but Dylan did it much better in the 60s . Bellamy 's lyrics come off as a Saturday-morning cartoons version of the same thing.Still , there 's a lot to like about The Resistance . There are some fantastic songs on this album , and if you can get over the 3 or 4 dud tracks and the sometimes-silly lyrical content ( `` Love is our resistance ? '' Dear god , really ? ! ? ) , you 'll find that it is an entirely worthy album to add to your collection . Yes , Muse is officially an `` arena '' band , but they 're endlessly more talented than any of the other bands occupying the sub-genre . Take solace in that , and in knowing that in the last 10 years they have yet to let any of us down entirely.Key Tracks:1 . `` Uprising '' 2 . `` Resistance '' 3 . `` United States of Eurasia '' 4 . `` I Belong to You '' 5 . `` Exogenesis : Symphony Pt . 1 : Overture '' 7 out of 10 Stars	1
Okay where to begin , it has been three years since we got a taste of Muse and there brilliantly artsy and layered tunes . Since their last release `` Black Holes and Revelations '' Muse have really bloomed into a group capable of much more then a mere Radiohead clone . They 've also procured their rights into the mainstream of rock and alternative , being plastered on award ceremonies , tracks hitting the ` Guitar Hero ' and ` Rockband ' series , just overall awareness seems to have spiked.Muse have stated time and time again `` The Resistance '' ( though at the time untitled ) would be more of an experimental/electronic effort . Rest assure they did n't pull a Radiohead `` Kid A '' minimalist approach ( again avoiding similarities between the two groups ) , but instead putting fourth all the right efforts to make for an epic . 11 tracks , about 55 minutes of music , and a three part conceptual movement , Muse are back ! Album openers deceptive tracks leading us to believe it is X when it is really A , `` Uprising '' is our opening to `` The Resistance '' . For a single it 's a tad bit long and maybe a bit too repetitive , but it hits clearly with electronic beats capable of raising a New Order fan back from the club . Reminds me a bit beat wise of a song from Battles with out the math rock complexity of course , . Now the actual title track `` Resistance '' ( in this case track 2 ) is of the opposite polarity to that of `` The Resistance '' . Both on the same playing field as they both are electronic , but this ones less charged and more passive especially the ambience of the intro . Then the familiarity of a U2 track you may know of as `` New Years Eve '' is drawn , the pianos watery reverberation and path along the keys may make you think twice on the bands influences . The third track is less then 4 minutes and is tied as the shortest song on the album along side with part two of the concept tied tracks . `` Undisclosed Desires '' plays out to be a tightly chopped tune that sounds as though it 'll be a sleeper single . It 's not bad , nor am I saying it is a single , it is one of those tracks that have the right hooks to make it accessible , but lack the oomph to be the first single . `` United States of Eurasia '' is a track Muse just do n't seem to let die , each album they have a soft crooning piano tune and keep making a song that could be its counterpart ... ` USoE ' is that one . To keep things a little more interesting they throw in a Queen like surge into the mix and weave it with a foreign group of scales . Speaking of reinventions `` Guiding Light '' ( track 5 ) sounds very similar to `` Invincible '' one of Black holes cheerier moments ( as it was pretty bleak ) . Minus the slivering guitar of `` Invincible '' add a loudness boost to the drums equals `` Guiding Light '' in a nutshell . `` Unnatural Selection '' track 6 is a shape shifter at that . Goes from an organ intro to a Deep Purple meets Queens of the Stone Age big muff tune . It is also the longest track on the album docking in at nearly 7 minutes ! `` MK Ultra '' ( not Radioheads MK1 & 2 ) is though the synthesized strings were rolled in sugar . It is poppy , pounces , and has quick game like change ups ( one part reminded me of something from the older Legend of Zelda video game series ) . `` I Belong To You '' did n't get the memo , a song like this already exists on the album elsewhere and at an earlier point ! This track would be `` Undisclosed Desires '' , they both have that one-two combo in the beginning this track has a bit more dynamics and is less buzzed out . The existence of this track is probably for the vocal chord dance in around the half way point deterring it from `` Undisclosed Desires '' to make it its own entity . The brassy connection around the 4:40 mark is of interest too.Now onto the three part mini epic sweeps , being strung on a line or playing around with the continuity of the album wont really hurt these three tracks . I feel they are all interchangeable and can give some power back to certain songs after coming off the high of such profound delicacy . The reason I say not to worry so much about the continuity here of all places is , although they are all similarly named ( `` Exogenesis '' ) ... The three tracks tie in together by a quick fading out . grabbing a hold that fade and phasing it into the intro of the next track . They are all orchestral though , especially the second part `` Cross-Pollination '' . It has a breakout moment and then shoots back down to a low volume resonating bow . The first Exogenesis `` Overture '' is just that , movie like , finds a stair climbing pace and walks with it indefinitely . The third and final Exogenesis is one of a supposed catharsis entitled `` Redemption '' . Intro wise it sounds a bit mournful but seems to find the swinging light overhead , and ends on a brighter note piano slowing down , notes ringing a little bit longer growing a bit more sleepy and there you have reached the end.So what did we get here with the long awaited new Muse album ? You be the judge of that , I 'll tell you what I got out of it . A band that has succeeded with another hit album yearning for a more complex passive side , while still submissively pleasing the crowds near flawlessly . It achieves what is was suppose to an eclectic electronic album , its short comings are simple and literally short at that . Maybe a expenditure to the total duration by shaving down minutes off a few other songs , keep the intensity of the first track , and that 's really about it . It 's not a step above there four previous albums and they are n't leaps above this . This one wont be a sleeper hit due to there fame at this point , but maybe when looked back at Muse 's catalog one might spot this one with some of weakest moments . If not that maybe the best word is least desirable.So do we get our moneys worth ? Simple answer yes , the budget price is quite the deal and the deluxe edition is about that of standard CDs anyways . Those not familiar with Muse and would to get into them will also find it helpful that the band has had there work all reissued on vinyl ! Final question probably looming from above is ... Was it worth the wait ? Yes , be glad Muse are back , be glad no hiatus came our way .	1
I 'd like to weigh in on this before overexposure utterly ruins this fine CD for me . It should come as no surprise that as muse grows in popularity their music becomes more mainstream . That is a hard and fast truth that has repeatedly been proven correct throughout the history of popular music . The pop radio sheen has been polished brightly for this record . THE RESISTANCE is not like SHOWBIZ or SYMETRY , two earlier recordings that typified their youth and exuberance whereby the song 's inherent energy trumped production . But even then they appeared to possess a grander vision of where they 're headed . Their penchant for a larger-than-life sound , and anthemic showstopper mentality was apparent as young up-and-comers . Given the breakthrough of ABSOLUTION and the overwhelming success of BLACK HOLES it 's only natural that this album would continue in that path toward US stardom . Consequently , it 's at this point in the progression that I usually lose interest in a given artist . But I could n't resist . What works for this band since the beginning is a combination platter of loud , razor-sharp guitars , obtuse lyrics , rich , layered vocal harmonies and classically-infused ( nocturne-like ) piano passages . The latter are also the components that many detractors obsess upon . Is n't it curious that those who routinely resort to tired old cliches like self-indulgent , bombastic and pretentious when criticizing progressive and art rock are themselves guilty of self-indulgence , pretension and verbosity in their own writing and ( more insidiously ) in their thought process ? They know better than the unwashed , uncultured masses.This is simply another superbly artful endeavor by muse . Matthew Bellamy 's ambiguous writing and showy playing is at the core of this band . He has endured the unjustifiable accustations of being a Thom Yorke ripoff , which have finally been silenced . Now it 's Freddie Mercury and Brian May that he 's beholden to . Well , he 's certainly not the first artist to dare reveal his influences . It 's that melting pot of experience , talent and influences that yield the most meaningful , enduring and controversial art.I fully realize that this is the record that launches muse to new heights but since I do n't listen to radio for music purposes I pray that I am at least partially insulated from the unfettered hype that is sure to ensue .	1
Listening to `` The Resistance '' is exploring a world on the brink -- war , controlling governments , and a brewing revolution thinking about rising up . Those dark and conflictive sentiments boil slowly through Muse 's fifth full-length album , which is equal parts brilliant and awkward . While many of the songs are exquisite and expansive , the whole synthy Depeche Mode vibe just does n't work . `` The paranoia is in bloom/the PR , the transmissions will resume/They 'll try to push drugs to keep us all dumbed down/And hope that we will never see the truth around , '' Matthew Bellamy sings over a stabbing bass melody and colorful swathes of electronica.That more or less sets the mood for the songs that follow , although they tend to be a bit more restrained -- the slow piano-and-drums build of `` Resistance '' blooms into a hard-rock explosion . Then there 's some dancy synth-riddled melodies ( I smell MTV ) , slow-burning stretches of bass-blazing prog , and hundred-mile-an-hour avalanches of volcanic hard-rock ( `` I 'm hungry for some unrest/I wan na push it beyond the peaceful protest ! '' ) . Not to mention the truly brilliant , multifaceted expanse of `` United States of Eurasia . `` The last third is basically one big climactic build-up , followed by a spectacular musical finale -- it 's like sitting through a good-but-not-great movie , and then being blown away by the final act . After the symphonic piano-rock of `` I Belong To You ( + Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix ) , '' Muse begins a spectacular three-part `` Exogenesis : Symphony '' that harkens back to their older work , with string instrumentation blending seamlessly with the exquisitely painful , rich Britrock.I 've adored everything that Muse has ever produced , even the albums that did n't quite rise to their full potential , but `` The Resistance '' strays too far from their signature sound to be truly engaging . It still has some rich rock songs that blaze with internal fire on their own , but do n't really stick together into a cohesive album.The first few songs of `` The Resistance '' are rather awkward , with lots of fuzzy hard-rock , buzzing bass and a glitzy synth sound -- and some like `` Undisclosed Desires '' is the stuff of art-rock nightmares . You keep expecting Britney Spears ' robotic voice to chime in.But gradually the classical and hard-rock influences start to blend more seamlessly , and you end up being swept away by the lush expansiveness of `` United States of Eurasia '' or the aching `` Unnatural Selection . `` There 's also a hefty dose of buzzing bass guitar and multicolored synth , mingled in over the epic stretches of guitar , symphonic strings , and some piano buildups that add a melancholy edge to all the angular rock'n'roll stuff.And Bellamy sticks to the tried-and-true messages in his songwriting -- the world is in turmoil ( `` And these wars ; they can never be won/does anyone know or care how they 've begun ? `` ) , governments are rotten and the world is a mess , so get off your butt and act . Much of the time , he sounds like he 's standing on a cliff raging against a storm.As much as it pains me to say it , `` The Resistance '' failed to grasp my mind and heart like the previous Muse albums . It has some moments of pure brilliance and rock'n'roll beauty , but it also has some moments of colorful awkwardness .	1
Best way I can describe ... ..The Resistance is a squeaky clean Muse ball which rolled down a hill . In it 's path it rolled over and picked up some ; Queen ( heavy Queen influence ) , Pink Floyd , Chopin ( literally ) , Mozart , Gershwin , David Bowie , Gary Glitter , Philip Glass and coasted on into modern times with a nicely produced , polished , clean sound meant for cranking through your 500w Bang & Olufsen.The album theme : Rock Opera . Classic `` political , media & social brainwash '' -bashing rock music . Despite having a `` theme '' , the songs are very diverse , ranging from high energy power rock , to quiet , delicate and precise piano passages . Instrumentation includes obvious band ( guitar , bass , drums , vocals ) , `` church '' and `` rock '' organ , diverse synthesis , classic grand piano , and real symphonic arrangements weaved throughout.My favorite pick for 2009 , and 2010 so far.I would n't typically encourage potential Amazon customers this , but I bought mine through iTunes for the extra digipak goodie . There 's a nice interactive with photos , videos , lyrics and flashy graphics . I 'm glad ( in this case ) I chose the iTunes version.However you buy it , turn off all the lights , sit center to speakers , turn the volume knob up on your receiver ... ..keep turning ... .a little more ... .press play , and enjoy ! ( screw the neighbors ! ! ! )	1
First off , I should mention that I come from the side of Black Holes and Revelations being the best Muse album up to this point . There is a lot of discussion how The Resistance is a different sound for Muse but after a half dozen listens , I find it as more of an evolution or maturation of a sound that started with Black Holes and Revelations . The Resistance feels like it could feel the same mold , but lyrically it is well advanced beyond that.The album find Muse taking a more serious approach to their music with political themes that can be seen as targeting the current world state of affairs . Yet , as a Muse album , one can still see the side that throws fun , over-the-top music and style into its songs . This is probably best illustrated by the song `` The United States of Eurasia '' . There is an underlying political message that is masked by the fun of the sound that is strangely similar to Queen in Bohemian Rhapsody.In fact , you find a similar condition in each song on the album , and it really makes this album stand apart rather than amongst or behind others that tackle serious themes . Too often , albums blatantly state the criticism of politics or current events like a war , but the best music does n't need to state the obvious . In fact , an enduring piece of music will leave it just a bit vague as that is the type of music that will be relevant in years to come when similar wars or political situations develop . A subtle message is wonderful , and it is what really makes this Muse album grand.The only knock I give on this album is that the sound has n't really evolved enough from Black Holes and Revelations to really make this album stand apart from its predecessor . Lyrically , it does , and there are some great elements to the music such as the 3 part symphony at the end and the piano interludes Matthew Belamy throws in here and there , but there were similar elements in the previous album . However , I do find that the unity of the album as a whole and the layers of sound keep growing on me , and in a few weeks time , I may actually think this is Muse 's masterpiece.In the end , I think that if you are a fan of Black Holes and Revelations , you 'll love the Resistance . If you are a fan of albums previous to that , you still might enjoy it . Lyrically the Resistance is a step up and in a similar vein with Absolution , but if you are a fan of those earlier albums , you just might not find it reaching that level in your ear . Then again , if you are a listener that likes a challenge , you 'll probably find it a joy to listen to after a few tries whether or not you think it is Muse 's masterpiece .	1
With sounds akin to Radiohead , Queen and Fredric Chopin ; this album is a sublime masterpiece . Undeniably brilliant and aurally arresting . The Exogenisis symphony is elegant and worth the whole price of admission .	1
In my high school days -- when I was into bands like Creed and Good Charlotte -- I would automatically write off bands like Muse because they reminded me too much of Radiohead , who I hated.Nowadays , thank goodness , my ways and tastes have changed.Muse is a perfect example of a modern rock band that consistently cranks out solid albums and even more solid live shows . I 've had the privilege of seeing them live twice now and both times rank right up there some of the best concerts I 've ever seen -- and , all bragging truly aside , I 've been to many a concert in my day.This most recent tour is in support of their latest album , 2009 's `` The Resistance '' ( more on that later ) .While this album does n't represent the band 's pinnacle ( 2003 's `` Absolution '' holds that spot for me ) , it is a uniquely engaging and entertaining album and it definitely made my list of the best of 2009 . `` The Resistance '' is Muse 's fifth studio album and while all of their previous albums were self-produced along with help from other production collaborators , this album is their first with sole control . And rightly so , for such an epic and ambitious undertaking as this album has proven to be , it could only have come from the minds and interpretations of the band members themselves ( mostly lead singer/guitarist/primary songwriter Matthew Bellamy ) .I love to see bands evolve over time . Even if they evolve in what the majority of people agree to be the `` wrong direction '' , at least it shows that they 're willing to try something different . Even though I do n't consider `` The Resistance '' to be Muse 's best album I have to give them credit for still exhibiting elements of that stadium rock sound we all know and love ( see the Queen-esque `` United States of Eurasia '' ) but at the same time exhibiting a new and exciting evolution.As far as this idea of evolution goes , it really shows through in that this album explores the electronic and classical genres a great deal more than any of Muse 's previous releases.A perfect example of the electronic side of things would be the song `` Undisclosed Desires '' . Even though it 's mostly electronic in terms of drum beats and bass lines , it also has symphonic elements sort of soaring over the top of everything else that 's going on in the song.In terms of classical elements , the best example of this would be the albums three part closer , `` The Exogenesis Symphony '' . I 'm a huge sucker for things like this . I love multi-part songs/titles that are epic , tell a great story , and last for minutes on end ( this creation clocks in at 12:51 total ) . It is presented in three movements , `` Overture '' , `` Cross Pollination '' , and `` Redemption '' . All of the string arrangements and compositions were done by Bellamy himself and the work explores the theme of the end of humanity ( `` Overture '' ) , our attempts at survival ( `` Cross Pollination '' ) , and our realization that unless we drastically change something about the way we live , everything that has happened will only happen over and over again ( `` Redemption '' ) .Each of the three members of this band ( the aforementioned Bellamy , bassist Christopher Wolstenholme , and drummer Dominic Howard ) have always brought the heat in terms of stylistically identifiable parts on their various instruments ( most notably Wolstenholme 's bass part for the song `` Hysteria '' from the `` Absolution '' release ) and all of those elements are definitely present on this album . That fact , coupled with the fact that this studio effort really explores new territory makes `` The Resistance '' a truly enjoyable experience that , if nothing else , begs to have some sort of science fiction movie made that is based solely on its music -- or at the very least , `` The Exogenesis Symphony '' .One of my determining factors for how good I think an album is would be how well the songs seem like they would translate in a live setting . In this situation I was lucky enough to have been able to see firsthand whether or not this was the case . To put it quite simply , and I know this sounds clich & eacute ; ; words really ca n't describe it . Basically , if you ever get the chance to see Muse live , do yourself a favor and spend the money . It 's a guaranteed non-disappointment.Even though the songs compiling this album only earn it a four star review , the way they translate live coupled with older classics easily bump the concert experience to a full five stars . A conspiracy theorist might even think that it 's all a ploy to get people to the live shows since that 's where the real money seems to lie in the music industry these days ... The tour in support of `` The Resistance '' was Muse 's biggest yet . The stage setup alone cost over $ 2 million ( check out a picture here [ ... ] . The stage was centered around three mock skyscrapers which at the beginning of the show dropped down to reveal each of the three band members on his own riser probably around fifteen feet in the air . Of course , there was a rotating drum kit -- something with which ( as a drummer myself ) you can never go wrong . Their laser show was superb and at one point giant confetti-filled balloons that looked like eyeballs were unleashed on the crowd . Some concerts are emotional , some are even disturbing , but Muse puts on a show that is intense and just plain fun.The experience , like any , is one that can easily turn magical , especially if you have a loved one who has a mutual appreciation who can share it with you . I was blessed enough to have this so it made the night that much more enjoyable . One of the most beautiful things about music in general is that every time you buy an album , if it turns out to be one that you really enjoy there 's an excitement and anticipation that , `` Maybe someday I 'll get the chance to hear these songs in person . `` My hope for music lovers is that no matter which artists or bands you love that you 'll get a chance to see them in person at some point because it has the potential to cement them into the hall of fame of the things you truly loved most about this life .	1
I had to jump on here and give `` The Resistance '' a 5 star review . Had to . Why ? Because it 's so incredibly obvious . To think otherwise is either ignorant , misinformed , or plain stupid .	1
This album flows very well and is very flavorful and fun . I can see Muse snobs not liking this record but I 'm not one of those people . If I had to say negative things about this release it would mainly center around the blatant 'Queenish ' sounds they ripped off and inserted into a few songs . Other than that , these songs stay in your head and you ca n't help but contemplate them during the day .	1
Muse has risen to become one of the biggest bands in the world , yet with their fifth studio album they continue to walk in the shoes of their influences . Muse 's fourth album , Black Holes and Revelations , was their first attempt at breaking the molds created by bands like Radiohead and Queen that they are so frequently compared to . Now , three years later , instead of moving onward in their own musical direction and establishing their own unique sound among the arena rock greats , they awkwardly climb back on the shoulders of their idols for support.There is no greater example of Muse 's static connection to the styles of other acts than in the song `` United States of Eurasia . '' The song starts out beautifully with the lyrics `` you and me are the same '' accompanied by piano . Perhaps these lyrics are a foreshadowing of things to come because at approximately one minute and eighteen seconds in , a vocal harmonization enters that is so similar to Queen that even Vanilla Ice would question its origin.Another area where Muse seems to have taken a step back is in the flow between songs on the album . Unlike many artists that release an album more as a collection of singles , Muse albums tend to have an excellent balance between songs giving the listener the sense that each song is a movement within a greater body of work . Unlike Black Holes and Revelations , which played like a symphony , the tempo changes and mood swings between songs on The Resistance are distracting at times . I ca n't imagine how confused a crowd would be if Muse ever tried to play The Resistance straight through in a live setting ; jumping around from the start with `` Uprising '' and then suddenly forced into a lull with the beginning of the appropriately named title track , `` The Resistance . `` Criticisms aside , The Resistance is still an enjoyable record and a must own for any fan of Muse 's previous efforts . The three part `` Exogenesis Symphony '' found at the end of the album is a beautiful bridge between the classical and electronic synthesis worlds . In the first movement , the strings even simulate the work of an arpeggiator , a tool frequently used by Muse in the past . As a true fan of their music from the beginning , I would have liked to have seen Muse really explore their own unique sound with their fifth trip to the studio , but Matthew Bellamy and company have still produced a final product that will undoubtedly solidify their reputation as one of the world 's greatest bands to see live . That is , of course , if they change up the track order for their set list.Similar Artists : Radiohead , QueenTrack Suggestion : Undisclosed Desires	1
Initially not my style of Alternative/Rock music but for some it must have been the greatest hour of fun receiving this one . This became a donation and it felt good to give to someone in dire need to keep and enjoy . A good album though with great spins and hooks to grab a listener for a lifetime .	1

Muse is definitely not what they used to be . However , they never fail to surprise with the changes they make on every CD . I would say that The Resistance is a one step forward and one step back for Muse . This is definitely an awesome album . One thing that bothers me in this CD is that there is n't as much guitar as I wished and Mathew Bellamy uses too much tremolo bar in some songs.1 ) Uprising - 8/10 - Good song to start the CD which for some reason gives Muse a `` libertarian '' label . Too mainstream.2 ) Resistance - 10/10 - Beautiful song with great lyrics.3 ) Undisclosed Desire - 10/10 - It does n't belong on this album and guitar was replaced with a keytar . Also , if it I did n't know it 's Muse I would think it 's Depeche Mode . Nonetheless , my second favorite song and very catchy . Good to sing along in the car.4 ) United States Of Eurasia - 9/10 - At first I hated it , but then it started growing on me.5 ) Guiding Light - 5/10 - Filler . Not a bad song , but not a good one either . Weakest one on the album.6 ) Unnatural Selection - 10/10 - best song on the album . Great riff in the beginning and even better lyrics . Similar to New Born but very catchy . I hate the way he says `` ocean . `` 7 ) MK Ultra - 8/10 - Good synth work in the beginning ; the song could use more speed though8 ) I Belong To You ( My Heart Opens To Your Voice ) - 9/10 - The transition to the French part is so good that you do n't even notice it . I wish the whole song was in French.9 - 11 ) Exogenesis Symphony 1-3 - 10/10 - A masterpiece hands down.Muse continues to amaze with every release . Their style and music is an art ; after all , how many rock bands do you find that have symphonies , pianos or use Chopin 's work ? Yeah , I ca n't come up with any other band either .	1
Muse is n't exactly breaking a lot of new ground here . This album is a little more operatic , a little more theatrical , a little more like Queen , but there 's no real change to the sound they 've had for years . It 's actually one of the most predictable albums I 've heard in years . I could guess some of the flourishes and melodies before they finished happening , and the only real surprise was when `` Exogenesis '' , the three part symphony that closes the album and impresses the most of anything on the record , did n't explode bombastically at some point , instead merely building and then falling pretty beautifully.It 's not a bad album by any means , just an unexciting one for a group that 's ostensibly unique and totally original . I ca n't think of any groups that have the mix of synth elements , driving bass , and falsetto vocals that make up their identity , but it does n't quite sound new anymore . Also , Matthew Bellamy 's guitar playing is totally restrained here , which is not a good thing at all . `` Uprising '' , `` Resistance '' , and `` MK Ultra '' sound like normal singles for the band ; catchy , epic , and occasionally a bit silly . A couple tracks incorporate excerpts from classical music and operas , which is a bit pretentious , but does n't really hurt them . `` Guiding Light '' is the epitome of sounding like they 've done this all before . The key to whether you enjoy this album might hinge on whether you like Muse for their style or just for being a rock band .	1
When I first found out about Muse 's new studio album , the Resistance , I was really excited . In the year before , I had bought all four studio albums and HAARP ; I had high expectations and had become a die-hard fan . As an album , The Resistance is very coherent , but a lot less heavier than some of their other work ( i.e. , Origin of Symmetry , or Absolution ) .Track by track : Uprising- great opener but why the heck is this the single ? Do n't get me wrong , this is a great song but there are others that would do much better as singles.Resistance- Beautiful . This is one of the two songs that should have been a single . The the last couple seconds remind me of Star Wars : the phantom menace , although I do n't know why . The parts with the piano sound a little bit like ( VERY little , just the echo in the background ) X & Y ; era Coldplay . Drummers may want to hear this one.Undisclosed Desires- My opinion fluctuates here . The only thing that is definite is that anyone learning to play slap bass should download this , or have a liking for dance music . It is extremely electronic , and has no guitar or piano.United States of Eurasia- One of the greatest songs ever written by Muse . This is the other song that should have been a single . I think that it is very misplaced being in the middle here . Collateral Damage , is actually an excerpt from Frederic Chopin 's Nocturne in E-flat major . If you listen to this , you will hear some parts that sound like we are the champions . You can not go wrong if you download this song . It is amazing , beautiful , and very anthem like.Guiding Light- OK song . Not meant to follow Eurasia . If you are a fan of heavy distortion however , try this out.Unnatural Selection- Heavy , but definitely worth your time . When I first heard it , I thought it sounded it familiar but I did not realize that the main riff sounds a lot like Newborn , from origin of symmetry . Just as epic . That being said , it is another one of the albums highlights . It is varied , even though it may sound like heavy riffing at first , however there are dynamics and tempo changes . It is long.MK Ultra- Reminds me a little bit of Take A Bow , and Stockholm Syndrome . This would be more appreciated maybe if it followed Uprising . If Unnatural Selection is too long for you , then give this one a try . They 're in the same vein , only this does n't have as noticeably drastic tempo changes , however it makes up for that with having a much darker , dire sound . But what the heck is with the title ? I Belong To You ( +Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix ) - Interesting . It sounds a little like Muse attempted to mix classical , Jazz , and light rock . First off , a decent portion of this song is from the opera `` Samson and Delilah , '' which provides some nice contrast . Based on the part written by Muse , it sort of sounds like an angry love song , with a clarinet solo . The excerpt sounds like it is classical mixed with Jazz influences . Provides a lot of contrast , and is a good prelude to Exogenesis . The other half of the title is in French , and means `` My Heart Opens to Your Voice '' . For those who want something different from Muse.ExogenesisOverture- Brilliant . Although technically speaking , this is not an overture . An overture samples all of the songs in piece . This is more like the first movement of a classical piece . Now as a piece , it is absolutely GLORIOUS . Do n't expect heavy bass or drums . This is all about the vocals , and the strings . It sounds like a prelude to a fight scene , or a dark journey.Absolutely majestic.Cross-Pollination- The first thing I thought as it started , was Pink Floyd 's Ummagumma ; specifically , sysyphus . This is the part of Exogenesis that sounds the least like a symphony . Not as good as the overture , but decent.Redemption- This being a `` symphony , '' here is the final movement . An excellent way to close the album , only rivaled by Eurasia . The beginning could make someone cry , and it is quite literally , the piece one might hear during the final scene of a movie . Worth the downloadThat being said , Exogenesis is absolutely amazing as a whole . And if you get the CD you can read the lyrics , which are very much like a musical conversation.Also , if you consider getting the DVD Bonus version , it is literally showing what they did . There are no interviews , you are just watching fragments of recording sessions . However it is still quite interesting to see what they are actually doing.If you download single songs , here is what to get ; 1.United States of Eurasia or Resistance2.Exogenesis : Symphony ( all parts ) 3.Uprising	1
So many times the Recording Academy overlooks some of the 'best ' albums when it comes time for Grammy nominations . Hopefully this time next year , the Academy wo n't overlook Muse 's exceptionalThe Resistance , which makes my list as perhaps 2009 's Best Rock albums and one of the best overall albums of the year . It seems that rock in 2009 saw few outright shining albums , further accentuated by the rather bland Grammy nominations and lack of a clear front-runner . Muse 's 'The Resistance ' , released in September outside of the Grammy eligibility period , may just be the true shining rock album . Having never purchased a Muse album before but hearing my friends rave of their greatness , I decided I would purchase 'The Resistance ' given its exceptional reviews and the hype surrounding it within a plethora of magazines . I will say this , I was n't disappointed one bit . Exceptional.The album opens with the rousing `` Uprising '' , a valedictory performance by all means . The production is solid , the songwriting exceptional , and frontman 's Matthew Bellamy 's vocal performance is spot-on . Captivating , epic , and alluring all in one , `` Uprising '' is definitely my favorite cut from 'The Resistance . ' While `` Uprising '' is my favorite , `` Resistance '' proves no less captivating than `` Uprising '' as it is every bit as exciting and well conceived . With driving drums , touches of piano contrasting the guitars , and experimental timbres , `` Resistance '' is phenomenal . `` Undisclosed Desires '' possesses more of an alternative pop-feel than either `` Uprising '' or `` Resistance '' , contrasting the 'heavier ' nature of those tracks . It showcases the versatility of the group and their finesse . `` United States Of Eurasia/Collateral Damage '' reminisces one of something that Queen might have done in the 1970s . Progressive , beautiful , and epic , `` United States of Eurasia ... '' is another breathtaking performance from Muse featuring strings , middle eastern sounds , grand vocal harmonies , and a driving groove . Exceptional by all means , `` United States of Eurasia/Collateral Damage '' is a stand-out ( not to mention the use of classical composer/pianist Chopin at the end ! ! ! ) . `` Guiding Light '' begins energetically with a driving groove , that erupts into an epic , high energy cut . Inspirational , gargantuan , and chilling all in one , `` Guiding Light '' keeps up the momentum . `` Unnatural Selection '' opens with chilling pipe organ ( who does that on a rock album ? ) , leading into another 'sick ' performance . May I just say again , Grammy ? `` Unnatural Selection '' proves to be 7 minutes of unrequited greatness . What musicianship Muse possesses . `` MK Ultra '' is solid , while `` I Belong To You/Mon Caeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix '' finds the band entangled in yet another great , lengthy , prog rock 'epic ' - this time incorporating French ! The album ends with a three-part 'symphony ' , `` Exogenesis '' ( tracks 9 - 11 ) , which is equally as epic , mysterious , beautiful , and intriguing as the entirety of the album . Essentially , 'The Resistance ' proves to be an epic , lofty affair that is intellectual , yet counters it intellectual means with a grand enjoyability . Easily one of the year 's best albums , I 'm sorry I waited so late to review it . 4 1/2 stars .	1
Muse have done a rare thing in creating an album that combines pop listenability with true artistic risk taking that turns out to be a brilliant listening experience . This album is bold and intense with an eclectic mix of musical styles and sounds . Muse have thrown everything into this album including the best production techniques of their impressive career . This is definitely an apex in Muse 's musical evolution and makes you wonder where their genius might take them in the future . There are many highlights including the infectious opening track `` Uprising '' , the Queen-infused `` United States of Eurasia '' and the epic three part suite `` Exogenesis '' . Highly recommended to discerning music listeners who want the best pop-rock has to offer .	1
Muse has put out another solid CD of great music . The Queen influence is present as usual which I love . They are also are a lot more artier on this one . The piano work is amazing in a semi-classical framework . I 'm not too fond of their songs that sound too poppy U2ish but this CD moves away from this to a degree and challenges the listener . Overall this is a good effort from a band that certainly has some prog in them .	1
Opening cut and lead-off single `` Uprising '' from English Alternative trio Muse 's new CD `` The Resistance '' sounds like the theme to Dr Who or Twilight Zone set to a galloping beat . `` They will not control us / we will be victorious '' wails/warbles lead singer Matt Bellamy , sounding at times like Radiohead 's Thom Yorke.And so opens Muse 's 5th album , comprising 11 tracks and seeing them merging their Rock sound with a more Classical/Operatic flourish . The title track `` Resistance '' is more frenetic and atmospheric with snarling guitars and swirling synths in turn , while `` Undisclosed desires '' has an almost R & B ; approach despite the snarling Rock feel . `` United States Of Eurasia ( + Collateral Damage ) '' starts off as a hymnal piano ballad before building to a Queen-style cinematic climax with an Oriental touch and skyscraping chorus before ending on a melancholic classical piano note . `` Guiding light '' is a beautiful anthemic ballad , while `` Unnatural selection '' is a brilliant mid-tepmo rocker with Bellamy sounding desperate and breathless . `` MK Ultra '' starts off blistering a blistering riff alternating with subdued verses , while `` I Belong to You/Mon Caeur S'ouvre & agrave ; ta Voix '' is a thumping Rocker ending with a clarinet solo.Next comes the ambitious `` Exogenesis symphony '' , comprising 3 parts ; the serene `` Overture '' ( filled with delicately plonking piano and majestic strings ) , the more classical sounding `` Cross-pollination '' with a Rockier second half ( Quentin Tarentino surely missed this for his `` Inglourious Basterds '' soundtrack ) , and `` Redemption '' ( with an absolutely beautiful piano solo at the end ) . Pretentious or a work of genius ? I 'll take the latter.With music this experimental and beautiful , resistance is futile !	1
I love this cd , have listened to it over and over and over for weeks ! ! ! ! ! ! I would recommend this cd to everyone !	1
GOT INTO MUSE WITH THEIR PREVIOUS RELEASE , BLACK HOLES & REVELATIONS AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR NEXT RELEASE WHICH IS AWESOME.TO ME , THEY ARE A BAND THAT WILL BE FOR MANY MORE YEARS.GREAT SONG WRITING.SONGS 1-11 ARE STRONG.MY FAVES ARE UPRISING , RESISTANCE , UNDISCLOSED DESIRES , UNITED STATES OF EURASIA AND UNNATURAL SELECTION.JUST OUTSTANDING THROUGHOUT.IF YOU WERE A FAN OF THEIR PREVIOUS RELEASE , WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR . GET IT NOW ! ! ! ! !	1
Really like this album -- the songs are sequenced brilliantly , with all the pop stuff up front , then all the prog-rock Queen-ish stuff as it unfolds . Embarassed it 's taken me this long to check out Muse ... liked `` Absolution '' a whole lot as well .	1
Black Holes and Revelations saw a band truly coming into their element . From the cinematic `` Take a Bow '' to the wild , western-style `` Knights of Cydonia , '' it was thrilling from start to finish . So after what was easily their most epic of albums , where to go next for the beloved Brit trio ? The Resistance , Muse 's fifth studio album , may be their best , despite initial fears stemming from lead single `` Uprising . `` It was n't necessarily that `` Uprising '' was a failure . After all , it earned the band their first true appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 , after their American success was initially discovered from BH & R ; 's `` Supermassive Black Hole '' having been used in a certain vampire romance last year . It even utilized the `` Rock & Roll Song Pt . 2 '' beat in full force . Yet , it feels too much like `` Starlight , '' minus the swagger ( and piano riff ) of that classic Muse single . This leaves `` Uprising '' easy to like and a bit hard to love.Things quickly turn massive with the next two songs , `` Resistance '' and `` Undisclosed Desires . '' Both are right up there with the band 's best , the former reminding the listener of `` Map of the Problematique '' and the latter being the most ... gasp ... hip ? of all Muse songs yet . And the following `` United States of Eurasia ( +Collateral Damage ) '' relies on Queen and an epic , moving message just enough to save it from the embarassment of lead singer Bellamy repeating `` Eura-sia ! '' several times towards its end.The rest of the album continues along quite well , `` Guiding Light '' and `` I Belong to You '' in particular providing a nice change of pace from tracks 2-4 , and it pushes right along to the `` Exogenesis : Symphony . '' While the album was yet in development , there had been rumors of a 15-minute song , which has surfaced here in three parts ( which actually come to not quite 13 minutes ) . The three parts sound different from each other enough to be mistaken for three unrelated album tracks that just so happen to fade into one another , yet it maintains a faint cohesiveness and a larger-than-life conclusion in Part 3 that leave the listener knowing one thing for sure -- Muse is back .	1
I like Radiohead I like Depeche Mode and I now like Muse . Do n't like the politics ( fake lefties ) , but I do likethe music , energy & production . And I 'm an old guy ( 66 ) Viet Vet ( 63-68 ) Not exactly in their demographics , but hey its a free country ( so far ) .	1
Do you hear that ? It 's the collective of Muse fans crying after yet another album of Muse 's gets released . Well I 'm so sorry for them . They wasted their money . Boo hoo hoo , it 's all Muse 's fault for progressing and taking a step forward in their career . Waaaah.Anyways this is Muse 's fourth album and is their best since Origin of Symmetry . The band does not disappoint here , and yes it is different , however in a good way.There 's a lot of good songs to be heard on here- THe catchy opener `` Uprising '' has some of Bellamy 's best vocals ever , period . Undisclosed Desires is brilliant , a way different Muse song , and deifinitely a great different track for the British art rock trio . Guiding Light is a very Queen-esque song that I LOVE ! It definitely has a very `` A Night at the Opera '' sound to it . Unnatural Selection is one helluva catchy song , one that is definitely a must-play-over-and-over type track . I Belong To You is a very catchy , White Albumesque track that may take a little getting used to , but I love it . The last three tracks , however , are the best : The Symphony tracks are one epic experience when listened to together.Anyways , the special edition of the album comes with a DVD that has a 45 minute documentary on the making of the album . It 's quite fun to watch , as it has a lot of moments of the band goofing off . And it 's done in chronological order , so therefore it 's in the order of the songs . That said , the only thing I do n't like is the menu seriously thinks it 's a video game.Anyways , this is a great album , do NOT side with the negative reviewers before listening to it . Just listen to it yourself and judge . I ca n't wait to see them live on this tour now !	1
Only a few tracks in and it 's clear that British rockers Muse had a lot invested in `` The Resistance . `` The tremulous yet genuinely seductive `` Undisclosed Desires '' gives off a smooth , meditative vibe that smolders and lingers . So too does the awesome title track until the killer chorus kicks in with a refreshing torrent of electric guitars and soulful , push-all-the-buttons vocals from lead singer Matthew Bellamy . The raw , angst-ridden lead single `` Uprising '' is a solid track in spite of some trite , undercooked lyrics.Because high-quality playing is standard throughout the album , sometimes shadowing the melodies and Bellamy 's expressive , longing vocals , some of the songs toward the center of the disc initially fade together . Increased , closer listens reveal the tracks ' individual assets , however . The hard-rocking , soul-searching bravado of `` MK Ultra '' is a major highlight , as is `` Guiding Light , '' which finds Bellamy in cloying but endearing voice . The latter could be a major radio hit with its juicy , evocative melody and room-to-breathe arrangement and downright awesome guitar solo.The mostly instrumental three-song suite that closes the album invites accusations of self-indulgence , but Muse score major points with each , particularly the third , which brings the album to a graceful , ambient , achingly beautiful close before one final outburst of thundering drums and powerhouse vocals . `` The Resistance '' is a hell of a recording from a hell of a band . It goes for the throat a little too earnestly and tries to impress a little too much , but with a set of musicians with what is clearly above-average talent the results inevitably remain a pleasure .	1
This was my favorite Muse CD for a long time . It might be more suited for pop listeners ( I was pretty mainstream until i discovered Muse and followed them into the realm of alternative rock ) . There are a lot of great songs on this though , especially Resistance and Undisclosed Desires .	1
The songs on this cd are very fun , energetic , and thought provoking . For example , `` Uprising '' makes you think of the importance of why it is better for people to be more united when it comes to standing up to their government . The video to the song really gives it more dimension . It is really weird but creative at the same time because of the teddy bears utilized in the video that are making some angry faces . I was intrigued to watch the video to understand the song some more , and also because `` Uprising '' is my husband 's favorite song . My favorite part of the `` Uprising '' song is where the Muse Frontman Matt Bellamy sings `` If You Could Flick a Switch , and Open Your Third Eye , You 'd See that We Should Never Be Afraid to Die '' . The reason why I enjoy that part of the song is because it symbolizes to me the importance of seizing opportunities in life even if you intend to joyfully live a long life . I believe the song `` Resistance '' is about how what is wrong or right in love is shaped by whoever is perceiving it ( depending on the person ) . My personal favorite song of this album is `` Undisclosed Desires '' song . It has a very original beat , and very romantic lyrics . `` Undisclosed Desires '' is a song that many are going to enjoy regardless of one 's romantic level . `` Undisclosed Desires '' is a beautiful message about someone that wants to have a passionate affair with someone regardless of what may have transpired in that individual 's past . It is suprising to me that the `` Undisclosed Desires '' has yet to see radio airplay where I live because it is very enjoyable . Overall , this collection is going to appeal to many who enjoy pop and/or rock music .	1
Muse is a band that I have really grown to enjoy and just the fact that a band like this has become so popular gives me faith that at least some people out there still appreciate quality music . Muse fuses progressive rock with electronica , pop , and Queen like bombast to create a wall of sound approach that could easily be overblown and pompous , but in their capable hands becomes modern rock at it 's absolute best . The band have become a bit more commercial with each release , but it is a natural progression that is not as distracting as it often is with bands reaching this level of success . The album begins with two instantly catchy singles `` Uprising '' and `` The Resistance '' both of which deserve the massive airplay that they have received . Other highlights include the Queen influenced `` United States Of Eurasia '' and especially the final closing suite `` Exogenesis Symphony Parts 1 - 3 '' which features Muse at their progressive best . There are a few clunkers on the album which keep me from rating it a 5 star . `` Guiding Light '' , `` MK Ultra '' and `` I Belong To You '' sound like deliberate attempts at commerciality and do n't do a lot for me . From a progressive rock standpoint Muse are not nearly as complicated as many of their lesser known contemporary peers , but they do what they do really well . I hope with the success of this album it will inspire people to explore more progressive minded artists . `` The Resistance '' is definitely a good jumping off point .	1
It has it 's moments . The songs are a little more pop than what we would ever expect from Muse and a few of the lyrics are uncomfortably sappy . `` Love is our resistance '' ? ? ? ? ( cringe ) But this is album is definitely worth owning if only for Exogenesis . It really is something special . Gorgeous .	1
It happens to every band ; it 's practically a clich & eacute ; . At some point in an artist 's career , he or she will want to spread their wings and try something a bit ( or sometimes drastically ) different than their fans are used to . Before The Resistance came out , I went back on a Muse binge and listened to their albums . What I discovered when I finally started listening to The Resistance was that this album was inevitable . And the reviews here and elsewhere on professional sites/magazines are also inevitable : some proclaiming it Muse 's masterpiece , others that its a bad album . As you can probably tell , I 'm in the former category.The Resistance kicks off with `` Uprising , '' a track that seems to partake of the Dr. Who Theme Song and has a guitar flourish that first reminded me of the chorus to Blondie 's `` Call Me . '' This song has an electro , pulsating beat that continues the kind of electro-trend from `` Supermassive Black Hole . '' It took me a bit to feel its groove and now I 'm in love . The third track -- easily the album 's most `` controversial '' song -- is funky in an R & B ; way , mixing some hip-hop sounds with electronica and some nice thumping rock thrown in . It 's an amalgamation of so many different sounds that it 's probably Muse 's most adventurous.Of course there 's `` United States of Eurasia , '' which people have already decried as a ripoff of Queen . While it definitely does have a Queen influence , it 's not unique in Muse 's catalogue . You could see this direction in `` Knights of Cydonia '' which I found to be more Queen-like than `` Eurasia . '' Also I was a bit surprised to see it end with a twist of Nocturne In E-Flat Major , Op.9 No.2 by Fr & eacute ; d & eacute ; ric Chopin . You could tell that Matt Bellamy and company had a thing for classical music in some of their earlier music , but this is where it really hones in . Following this track is another classical-styled song , this time courtesy of the opera Samson and Delilah , entitled `` I Belong to You ( +Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix ) . '' Finally , as if to hammer this thought home , we have a three part symphonic monster of a song that incorporates a full orchestra and Matt on piano . This song is epic and moving , bringing in influences not only from Chopin but also Franz Liszt . Each movement blends well into the next ; the flowing arpeggios in `` Overture '' lead into the tinkling keys of `` Cross-Polination '' which climaxes with a rock section before ending with `` Redemption , '' a nice outro that ends the CD . It 's fantastic and a perfect closer for The Resistance.Thematically , The Resistance covers all the same topics fans come to expect , including love , standing up for what you believe in and a variety of political and conspiracy theories . `` United States of Eurasia '' references the book The Grand Chessboard concerning a political theory that the United States should control the Eurasian landmass for oil reasons . Other songs follow suit , with proclamations of `` I want the truth ! '' ( `` Unnatural Selection '' ) and `` Rise up and take the power back , it 's time that / The fat cats had a heart attack '' ( `` Uprising '' ) . Nothing really new here , but done with the typical Muse flair.And here we come back to the beginning . The Resistance is n't for everyone and I can definitely empathize with those turned off . It wears its classical leaning on its sleeve for all to see and indulges in enough modern pop and hip-hop styles that will make people who raised their eyebrows at `` Supermassive Black Hole '' really wonder what they 're listening to . But it 's been an inevitable journey , taking their latest albums as inspiration . It 's definitely not for everyone and your mileage may vary . For me , though , The Resistance is almost pitch perfect and a modern classic that will stay in my CD Player for quite a long while .	1
`` Fight The Power '' is the theme to the new Muse album , the set that should finally make the superstars in the USA . Matt Bellamy and crew have delivered on the promise of their deliriously coolBlack Holes and Revelations , opting to strike with the old fashioned concept album.Our hero of `` The Resistance '' starts off the album shouting `` They will not control us ! We will be victorious '' to a veryWe Will Rock You Theatricalbeat during `` Uprising . '' He rages against the machine and wonders if it 's all worth it without love ( the title track ) before giving in to love ( `` I want to reconcile the violence in your heart , '' he coos ) on `` Undisclosed Desires . '' You likely know where all this is headed , but you 'll still be surprised . There 's plenty of defiant cries like `` I want the truth ! '' or `` I 've traveled half the world to say I love you . '' sprinkled throughout `` The Resistance , '' yet Muse makes it all sound fresh and fun again.But then there 's the coup d'grace . The three part mini-symphony `` Exogenesis '' would do proud by bothYesorQueenor evenEmerson , Lake & Palmer . Rich on the Mozart and the prog , this just pushes Muse into a whole new world . Bellamy , bassist and backing vocalist Christopher Wolstenholme and drummer Dominic Howard can now soar as high as they 'd like . `` The Resistance '' is the mark of a band that refuses to set limits ; Muse are capably now blending rock , funk , progressive , alternative and classical in the scope of one CD . You ca n't fight it .	1
I had never heard of Muse , but I heard Glenn Beck mention this album and I HAD to check it out . Let me be honest , I do whatever Glenn Beck tells me to . Seriously , if he told me to go out and buy a pile of poop I would probably do it . It was a great suggestion on his part for me to buy this album . Pure libertarian bliss . The singers voice is a little high , which takes some getting used to , but overall this is great music for true patriots.U-S-A ! U-S-A ! U-S-A ! U-S-A ! U-S-A ! Edit 9/26/09 : Apparently the sarcasm was n't thick enough in this review for you all ...	1
Muse has been compared to just about any band in the British landscape from the moment set foot on a stage . Fortunately this has not affected their sense of identity and that once loathed alien/apocalyptic/surreal vision of the world has led them straight to the top of the charts and to the iPods of more people than we care to admit.What is the appeal they have over their listeners ? First , they CAN write great tunes but they add a twist and make them ridiculously fun . Second , they do n't take themselves seriously and unlike most of their contemporaries they are able sail from political denounces to comedic spurts without problem . Third , they take in all the comparisons and make them part of who they are.This is the most obvious point in their fifth studio recording . Having blown open the contrived label that capsuled `` prog-rock '' with Absolution and take it a notch further with Black holes and revelations , The resistance shows a Muse refusing to mature completely and using all their cards under the sleeve to reinvent a nearly extinct genre . This time the results might be less colored and more grey than in previous opportunities , but never dull.As if the banner had been raised from the start first single United States Of Eurasia is an open homage to Queen , not only in length but in composition . Give or take some nods at Chopin and even the presence of an Exocet launch at the end . The rest of the album will see Matt Bellamy , Christopher Wolstenholme and Dominique Howard indulging in their conspiracy theories , orchestral fascination and spacial aesthetics.They move from ballads ( I belong to you ) to straightforward rock ( Unnatural selection ) to a symphony in three movements ( Exogenesis ) that will not only give you an inside out cerebral trip but also leave you craving for nothing else when the odyssey is over . Uprising is a radio friendly cut that most reminisces what they 've done in the past ( like a breeding between the jolly Supermassive black hole and the sinister Time is running out ) , while the title track gives cue to the plot behind the record 's concept : resistance against general corporatocracy and the idea that love can cross boundaries between different political views and religious beliefs.One thing is impossible to deny : they have managed to deliver yet another amusing and tightly arranged album . The composition along with Bellamy 's incredible vocals are exquisite in execution , and we can only imagine how this record will sound live . As Chris conferred on a recent interview , their sound does not necessarily becomes bigger but different . Whether they have achieved that with The Resistance is something each listener will have to deduce ; if you asked me I would tell you I am eagerly expecting their new material .	1
Love this album . A step above Boys and Girls and a big improvement over Be OK ( and I liked both ) . If this is the type music Ingrid plans as a `` big girl '' then I look forward to many more like this one.Full of pep and energy . Uplifting . Makes you feel good listening.Soldier and Maybe rise just a notch above the others . But many good tracks .	1
I 'm digging this cd . 'Soldier ' is a great anthem , ready to rock you from the beginning , begging for attention . 'Are We There Yet ' has a yearning to it in the vein of Glass on Ingrid 's last album . Did I mention this album begs to be listened to again and again ? Seriously , so many hot tracks to choose from . Now , to be honest I was a tad worried after that 'Be Ok ' song , which I found tedious at best . But this is AWESOME , capital AWESOME . 'Chain ' is great builder , with a huge climbing chorus of vocals at the finale . 'Mountatin and The Sea ' is just feel good sing-along tune , but my FAVORITE has to be 'Once Was Love ' ... .such a great album , though I had doubts after that silly , little 'Be Ok ' song . I 'll shut my mouth now . This is hardcore awesome , and Ingrid really nailed it here . Girls and Boys is still awesome too though . Awesome work , Ingrid ! ! ! LOVING IT !	1
After a listen through , `` Everybody '' leaves at least one lasting impression ; that Ingrid is a very talented young woman . The songs have particularly powerful lyrics , and are cleverly composed rather than gimmicky catchy . The entire album has a very clean sound , leaving the individual instrumentation to stick out more , good job on whoever produced with her . My favorites are `` Everybody '' , and `` The Chain '' . Alas , this effort falls just short of amazing , as I think `` Everybody '' suffers from a feeling of same-ness on many of the tracks . And although in this case it is a good thing , in that she performs nop-notch songs , a bit more diversity would be much welcome on this , which causes me to rate this at just 4 stars . But it is still a very good album , and I highly recommend .	1
After a few days of listening toEverybodyon continuous rotation , I have come to really enjoy this release as a whole . Most of these songs will end up on one playlist or another of mine , and that 's a testament to the range and variety of this album . While this album may not be best appreciated played in one sitting from start to finish , it includes a lot of songs that sound great when played individually or mixed in with other artists.In certain ways , this album is a natural extension of Ingrid Michaelson 's previous albums . Tracks like `` Everybody '' and `` Men Of Snow '' have the deceptively simple structure of some of her most successful songs . `` So Long '' has lovely vocals with simple and mellow guitar accompaniment . These kind of tracks are what many would expect an IM album to sound like.Yet tracks like `` Soldier '' and `` Mountain And The Sea '' remind me more of the rock ballads like `` Possession '' from Sara McLaughlin'sFumbling Towards Ecstasy . On those songs , the harmonies and driving instrumentation add an energy that I really like . And `` Locked Up '' continues that trend with a piano rock song that blends the hand clapping and simple structures of other songs.Songs like `` Sort Of '' seem to have more in common with the longing and softness of records like Tracey Chapman'sNew Beginning . The ground that she covers here gives you a sense of Ingrid Michaelson 's versatility as a song-writer and performer.I can appreciate the depth of more carefully written lyrics from prior albums , but I also respect that Ingrid is trying to expand her range as an artist . Some of these simpler songs may be more accessible and , thus , may win her new fans . There is always the risk that they may alienate long standing fans , but there is enough of her signature sound here . `` Once was Love '' is a good example of how this album is both a step forward and a step back from previous ones . On the one hand , we have a rich instrumentation that includes violins and layers of percussion . On the other , we have repetitious lyrics that recycle certain concepts . There is validity to the criticism that certain words , like that four letter word `` love , '' are over-used on these songs.And yet , I give her a pass on that for one reason . When I listen to each song individually , most of them are still very good on their own . As I said , they may not be well designed for playing in the same playlist , but most of them will end up in one playlist or another . I 'm not crazy about the repetition on songs like `` Once Was Love '' and `` Everybody . '' But judging by the fact that the title track is already successful as a single , it 's clear that most people disagree with me on that.My personal favorites are `` Soldier , '' `` Sort Of , '' `` Mountain And The Sea '' and `` Locked Up , '' though all of the other tracks add something . I think I like these tracks most because they show me a different side of Ingrid Michaelson that I did n't get to see as much of in prior albums.CONCLUSIONThis is an interesting new direction for Ingrid . The pop sensibility of this album is significantly increased , which may alienate some and appeal to others . But those willing to give this album a chance are likely to find more than a few songs that they like.Enjoy . **************************************NOTE : The first disk I received had a problem playing the last track , # 12 , `` Maybe . '' I am curious if others had this experience with the disk or if mine was an isolated case .	1
Just finished listening.I am by no means an Ingrid Michaelson newbee . I liked `` The Way I am '' but then I did n't listen to her regularly for quite sometime.I bought this CD well ... because I 'm going through Sara Bareilles withdrawal.I know i like her non-mainstream stuff because a few years ago I got my mom `` Human Again '' ( her newest CD ) as a gift-and of course as it turns out she listened to it once and has n't taken it out again.Whereas , I have the full CD on my Ipod.Of course there are a few I listen to quite a bit more then others but I 'll get back to that later.Here 's my track-by-track on this one.1.Soldier-I found this one to be a beautiful start to the album.Its not over-the-top but its not highly ... slow either.Definitely going on the Ipod.2.Everybody-Already on my Ipod . This song just makes me happy..puts me in an instant good mood . First heard on the Lady and The Tramp DVD/Blu Ray Commercial.3.Are We There Yet-I came across a lyric video to this on Youtube a couple of weeks ago . I liked it.Granted I was n't paying it 100 % attention.I was multi-tasking . I like it . I like how it portrays happy endings and asks the question well `` Are we there Yet ? `` 4.Sort of-Like it.Its a grittier love song.Kind of reminds me of `` Love Song '' in that sense now that I think about it.Will be going on Ipod.5.Incredible Love-Like it.Will be going on Ipod.See review of `` sort of '' 6.The Chain-Okay so I actually heard this on a Youtube fan video of Once Upon a Time ( One of my current favorite shows ) like 3 months ago.Yeah , guilty ... was multi-tasking again.I like it though.Will be going on my ipod.7.Mountain and the Sea-Not one of my favorites.It nearly put me to sleep while I was listening.Just not in my taste/preference range.8.Men of snow-It sounds highly depressing but I really like it.Will be going on Ipod.9.So Long-Like it.Like the gritty nature of the song.Will be going on Ipod.10.Once Was Love-Listening to this kind of reminded me of the first season of Once Upon a Time ... I 'm really not going to go into detail.Do n't want to spoil it for people who have n't seen it yet.People who might want to.Like it . Will be going on my ipod.11.Locked up-The first thing I thought when listening to this track ... before the lyrics came on or anything.MAN , I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS ON MY KEYBOARD . Love the instrumental.Love the lyrics.Will go on ipod.Will probably be played as opposed to skipped frequently.12.Maybe-A really good ending track.It leaves the listener feeling really happy/good ( well at least me ) .Its very upbeat.I like it.I like how she chose to end the album on a positive track.Its like the feeling you get when you finish a really good book.I know I said I would talk about some of her other stuff ... but first I wan na say how I really enjoyed the packaging . It was really easy to maneuver.Not so much like a DVD case as other CDs.Where you have to yank and yank and turn and hope to not break it.Other songs : Somewhere over the rainbow-Watched her singing it with the Sandy Hook kids online.Bawled my eyes out.Just had to say that.Most played on Human Again : Fire , Do It Now , Blood Brothers ( Studio Version ) , Black and Blue , In the Sea , End of the world ( Studio recording is played more ... but i love how she introduces it in the live track ) , Live it with LoveWinter Song : I figured someone might ask.I mean I did say I 'm kinda here because of Sara Bareilles.I 'm not crazy about this song.Its two great music artists.But the song itself does n't really show off the best of either of them in my opinion.Hope this extremely long review helps someone .	1
So far 2009 has seen a number of `` sophomore '' releases from artists , and Everybody from Ingrid Michaelson is one of them ( I 'm not counting the EP Be OK but limiting to major releases ) . Fans looking for Girls and Boys Part II will not find what they are looking for in Everybody . However deviating from Girls and Boys is not necessarily a bad thing . I found Everybody to be a much more focused work . It is also much more mainstream ; however , some will not look on this favorably . You could almost makeInstrumentally , Everybody has more depth and variety . I loved the violin and cello on `` Soldier '' and `` Incredible Love '' . Michaelson also introduces Ukulele on songs such as `` Everybody '' and `` Mountain And The Sea '' . It has a feel similar to Israel Kamakawiwo ` Ole 's rendition of `` Somewhere Over The Rainbow '' from 50 First Dates . I also really enjoyed the subtly stated use of trumpet on `` So Long '' . Perhaps as a way of at least loosely connecting with her past work , `` Everybody '' and `` Mountain And The Sea '' also feature the folksy hand clapping that Michaelson used on Girls and Boys.Vocally , Everybody features more of Michaelson 's lower register . This comes right out of the gate on `` Soldier '' , and it continues on other tracks such as `` Sort Of '' , `` Maybe '' , and `` Incredible Love '' . That is not to say that Michaelson has switched exclusively to a dusky alto . Songs such as `` Are We There Yet '' , `` Men Of Snow '' , and `` The Chain '' have plenty of her upper register and falsetto . `` The Chain '' is the studio version of a song that we first heard on Be OK . It has the same vocal round at the end as the live version did , and it just does n't seem to fit with the rest of Everybody . As a final note , Everybody has good vocal harmony . I really liked the way this came through on the chorus of `` Mountain And The Sea '' and `` Maybe '' .Lyrically , Michaelson plays things much more straight up than she did on Girls and Boys . Love and relationships dominate Everybody as seen on `` Soldier '' - `` And so it goes . The soldier knows./The battle with the heart is n't easily won . '' and `` Maybe '' - `` Maybe in the future/you 're gon na come back/you 're gon na come back around '' . It is obvious from the title alone on `` Incredible Love '' and `` Once Was Love '' . The one song that would fit with the more unique style of Girls and Boys is `` Men Of Snow '' where Michaelson tells of building a snowman that she tells her troubles to only to find him melted the next day . Even this still seems friendlier to a wider audience than most of Girls and Boys.All in all , Everybody is a major step forward for Ingrid Michaelson . While I enjoyed Girls and Boys , it almost seems esoteric compared to Everybody . Michaelson has created a sound that while featuring greater breadth in vocal range and instrumentation is at the same time more focused . Fans of KT Tunstall , Sonya Kitchell , and A Fine Frenzy should give this a try.Download this : Maybe	1
I think Ingrid Michaelson is one of the most talented singer-songwriters of our generation . After the success of `` Girls & Boys '' and `` Be OK '' , she has come up with another solid album now . There are a lot of catchy tunes in here and I am sure a lot of soundtracks/ads would be looking to feature some of the tracks . She has definitely has a unique sound of her own and has the promise of a very successful and long lasting career . Highly recommend this album !	1
someone introduce this to me this cd and group.so i had to buy it.was not disappointed at all.very good music .	1
I got this song honest face for my ipod touch . The song is nice and up beat . I love liam voice and hope he go far in the music business . I got this song for free right here on amazon . I just love , love this song , the melody and beats is on point in this song .	1
This song is a little experimental and definitely unusual . I think the risks paid off for the most part . It has a good beat , the vocals are smooth and melodic . The lyrics are quirky but interesting . The only real fault I found with it is that it 's a bit too repetitive . Over all a good song.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More	1
good and one of kind album , nice beat too it and enjoy listen to it , one of kind sound that stay with you	1
I liked this song enough by Liam Finn + Eliza Jane to purchase it . Really not a lot you can say about a single song except I think it & # 8217 ; s a great song .	1
I appreciate getting to hear new sounds and then decide if I want the full album . This is one I enjoyed and am glad that it was chosen as one to download for free . Thanks , Amazon .	1
When the closest influences are not too far away to resist , the results are obvious to identify . Liam Finn and Eliza Jane 's song `` Honest Face '' from the album Champagne in Seashells has the uncanny melodic and lyrical resemblance to Crowded House and Neil Finn , Split Enz , Beach Boy Brian Wilson 's experimental Pet Sound renderings and a dab of Sean Lennon echoing behind . Beyond the similarities , the song is catchy and memorable.Indeed , music is an open door towards uniqueness and creativeness . And with every new song and artist that produces a sound that takes the listener by surprise , the musician has done something right to get the listener 's attention . In the case of `` Honest Face , '' that rings true .	1
Just want to keep this review simple . Its a good song . And when AMAZON recommends a new artist to listen to , i tend to listen . Usually this works out great and i find a new band or artist i like . Liam & Eliza is no exception !	1
& # 2951 ; Fuzzy Wuzzy 's Summary : & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; Recommended with warm fuzzies.This band sounds like a mixture of 80s bands , and on their own Web pages , they list The Cars , ELO , and even Kraftwerk as influences . As a result , prior to listening to their music , I was expecting a sound with far more prominent keyboards and synthesizers . But , in fact , their sound is more balanced with the guitars . Resemblances to The Shins are quite evident , and the band mentions The Shins as a group that they like . Singer K Ishibashi 's light-spirited vocals sound , to me , like a cross between the 80s groups Dexy 's Midnight Runners and Howard Jones . In fact , frequently while listening to the ninth track , `` Come On '' , I find myself mentally inserting `` ... Eileen '' into the lyrics because the music and vocal stylings sound similar to Dexy 's Midnight Runners ' 1982 hit `` Come On Eileen '' . Overall , I like the first half of this CD better , with `` Flaming Arrow '' and `` Made In A Day '' being my favorites , and `` High Plains Drifter Finds The Oracle At Delphi '' and `` Come On '' being runner-ups . A good second release for this group , even though I do not consider the overall release to be memorable enough to be rated 5 stars .	1
For sports fans who play Electronic Arts video games , Jupiter One has been a sonic mainstay for a number of years - appearing in Madden NFL 08 , NHL 08 , FIFA 08 , FIFA 09 and Burnout Paradise - while also embracing other delivery vehicles ( commercials , TV shows ) for their music.Formed in 2003 , the New York City-based group has had little available in the traditional music marketplace - one album , two EP 's - until the recent release of Sunshower ( Ryodisc , RCD 10982 ) . The 11 songs from founding members K Ishibashi ( vocals , guitars , violin ) and Zac Colwell ( vocals , guitars , keyboards ) and Mocha ( vocals , keyboards , violin ) , Panda Dougherty ( bass ) and David Heilmann ( drums ) pull from a variety of artistic canvases for a satisfying sound from the indie rock universe.The clean pop production of the single , Flaming Arrow , highlights a snappy bassline from Dougherty , though the sounds of U2 on Come On make it the best track . The witty Volcano is akin to the brief `` Drama '' era of Yes , while a double play of Made in a Day and Anna are driving pop , with the latter featuring layered vocals reminiscent of the Climax Blues Band.Heilmann keeps the pace quick on Lights Go Out and there is a pop wickedness in Find Me a Place . Simple Stones has a cool summertime groove , but the nice mix goes nowhere fast in High Plains Drifter Finds the Oracle at Delphi . The hop in Strange Teacher is nearly over before it gets rolling and the acoustic closer - People in the Mountain , People of the Ocean - has the pop sensibilities of Ray Davies.Produced by Chris Ribando ( whose engineering credits include Michael Jackson - The Ultimate Collection and Mary J. Blige - No More Drama ) and the band , the album is a foxy trail to a picturesque rainbow after a pelting storm of the typical fare spurting out of the radio .	1
This is one of the catchier pop albums I 've heard this year , and it comes out of the chute with a couple of really good uptempo tunes , `` Volcano '' and `` Lights Go Out '' . My first impression is a sound not unlike the currently-hot French band Phoenix . Unlike that more techno-oriented band , though , Jupiter One strives for a richer sound , complete with close harmonies and hints of orchestral arrangement . I hear influences of The Beach Boys , Paul McCartney , The Shins , and even Nate Ruess ' defunct band The Format . When they 're bopping along with edgy energy , they 're really enjoyable ( `` Come On '' , `` Made in a Day '' ) . It 's the midtempo tunes that tend to drag the album down a bit . `` High Plains Drifter Finds the Oracle at Delphi '' , for instance , is not nearly as interesting as it sounds . The album closes , however , with a short , folky , lovely number called `` People in the Mountain , People of the Ocean '' , which could have segued right out of McCartney 's `` Blackbird '' . All in all , it 's an enjoyable pop album that I will most likely listen to again .	1
My title for this review has absolutely nothing to do with this very nice CD , `` Sunshower . '' But when I heard that `` Jupiter One '' is a reference to the 1960 's science fiction television series , `` Lost in Space '' ( the spaceship on the program is named , `` Jupiter One '' ) , I immediately thought of this memorable phrase and important part of pop culture history , uttered by the robot in nearly every episode , `` Warning , Warning . Danger , Will Robinson ! `` , whenever some sort of alien was hiding behind the next ( fake looking , 60s plastic ) rock.OK , anyway , on to the music . Which I liked very much ! This one is going on my I-pod where I only put my favorite music . In the category of music dubbed `` Indie '' because the bands are creating and presenting their music in a non-mainstream way and do n't yet draw huge crowds , I think `` Jupiter One '' has alot of talent , including a strong base player , great vocals , and excellent rhythm ( in guitar , base , and drums ) .Who do they remind me of ? I 'll agree with other reviewers who have noted the tributes paid to other artists from decades before , and from a variety of genres . Except for a similarity at times to `` The Shins , '' I ca n't really compare them directly to any other performers . `` Jupiter One '' has a nice balance of originality and tradition . I particularly enjoy the upbeat melodies and rhythm of `` Lights Go Out , '' `` Flaming Arrow , '' `` Anna , '' and `` Simple Stones '' ( the first half of the CD ) .I 've kept the CD in my car , and with everything else to do there including paying attention to the road , making cell phone calls , broadcasting my I-pod on the radio , or listening to XM comedy ... . , for the last several days , `` Jupiter One '' and `` Sunshower '' have won out.Most people , and certainly the subset who review music , tend to possess lemming like qualities for following the crowd . I think `` Jupiter One '' is just one `` Soundtrack From A Good Movie or Hot Television Show About The Angst of Being 20ish '' away from hitting it big . For example , as did nearly everyone did who was lucky enough to have been on the marvelous `` Garden State '' soundtrack.This band is too talented , too respectful of their music heritage , and too creative to be overlooked . I hope we 'll continue to hear great sounds from these folks for a long time .	1
I enjoy this recording . I think it is even growing on me a bit . However , it is not one of those musical events where I am bowled over and just have to run out and get everything that I can find of theirs . When I first listened to THE WHITE STRIPES , it had that kind of `` I have to have it '' effect . I also liked the raw , bluesy , wilder sound of the White Stripes . This group , however , is a lot more pleasant sounding than the White Stripes , which for me is not necessarily a good thing . If the group had the vocal power of Adam Levine of Maroon 5 , then I would add another star . It does not . If it had the instrumental power of the White Stripes or Dead Weather , I would add another star . It does not . This album has a very pop-rock orientation instead of a blues-rock one . If you like pop-rock , this may be the group for you . I enjoy the tune ANNA quite a bit but it is a very pop oriented tune . There is nothing raw or wailing about it . The terminology `` crowd pleasing '' comes to mind when evaluating this group . Again , that may or may not be a compliment depending on what kind of listener you are .	1
Question : What is with the album art 's obsession with foxes ? Jupiter One , named after the space ship from 'Lost In Space ' is a quasi-indie/alt rock band that 's music may be a little frazzled at times , has very distingwishable vocals , and last year they suprised me with their song `` Countdown . '' It was n't the best song of the year by any means , but it was a solid song nevertheless , and it had a nice feel to it . And while I did not listen to all of their debut , I would feel safe in venturing to say that this album presents something of a musical shift , with lots of 70s musical influences , and less of a radio-friendly sound . The result , is somewhat mixed.Highlights Include : VolcanoLights Go OutAnnaCome OnSound-wise , the album takes a lot of its cues from the late 70s , including tracks that sound vaguely disco-inspired , Eagles-esque , or just songs that fit in the general musical mood of the era . So , your opinion of the album may depend on your tolerance for a group like the Eagles . It does venture into pop rock and alt rock territory though , and this is where the album shines . It 's often frazzled , but Jupiter One does a great job with songs like `` Lights Go Out '' and `` Come On . '' I did n't find a distinguishable hit as in `` Countdown , '' but there 's quite a few solid tracks neverthelessHowever , the album has a major stumbling block , and that 's memorability . In reviewing this album I took a couple days off to meditate about it , but then found myself forgetting about it rather quickly . And while you tend to remember the highlights fairly quickly , and as the album grows on you over time , it just gets lost in the shuffle of its sound , then to the dark cravasses of your mind , never to be heard from again until you hear it the next time.Overall , Sunshower is a solid , earthy effort with more than a few songs to please Alt Rock , indie , and pop rock lovers with its 70s influence . There 's some very strong songs here , but the album is almost crushed under the weight of its longevity . Perfect for late nights , you 'll either love it and/or hate it depending on your mood.Real Score : 3.5	1
I 'm not sure if the title accurately sums up the `` genre '' description of Jupiter One or not , but why pigeonhole a band . Sunshower is a great disk . The singer has good range and has the ability to sound different on each track without adornment or tricks . Each song sounds different and Jupiter One crosses many genres from 70 's glam/progressive , disco , 00 's indie ( Shins ? ) and even acoustic ballads . Tracks 1-6 are the key songs I would recommend as possible singles but the entire set list works well for a driving time CD .	1
`` Your father watched from the front porchI put my hand to the sky '' That 's where I make your daughter soar , '' He must have misunderstood me '' These lyrics from `` Volcano '' just sets the tone for this `` SUNSHOWER with a nice mix of angst and melody that just moves the listener right along into JUPITER 1 's throwback mixture of Pop rock . Alternately sounding like Foo Fighters on songs like `` Lights Go Out , '' and Toto on `` Anna '' ( and its not just the name , listen to the organ , chorus , and `` ooohooo . '' ) JUPITER 1 keeps you listening , Gems like `` Flaming Arrow '' may make you wish that they stay far away from the spacey sound effects that litter some of the songs ( I guess it goes with the name ) , but the band is talented and creates some very catchy tunes . Sure there are misfires like `` Simple Stones '' with its instantly forgettable repetitiveness and the ponderous `` High Plains Drifter ... '' but the overall effect is a band that 's having a good time playing with the conventions of pop and you 'll probably have a good time listening to them .	1
One can hear many diversified influences on `` Sunshower '' by Jupiter One . Echoes of The Stones ( 1980 's era ) as well as The Flaming Lips , Soft Cell , The Stone Roses and others can easily be detected . This does not take away from the artist 's individual talents of providing a unique listen , but rather enhances it.By exposing the listener to finely crafted and performed songs , it makes me look forward to what will happen on ( hopefully ) subsequent releases .	1
Jupiter One 's `` Sunshower '' has sunny pop melodies that shimmer and make your body start to sway . The opener `` Volcano '' bops joyfully while the lyric seems to be about a guy who starts a volcano , `` Get out , get out of the house ! '' `` Lights Go Out '' sounds sunny but the lyrics reflect breakup jealousy , `` Every time I think of you & your new man ... '' `` Come On '' places a pounding guitar attack with breezy vocals and lyrics that reflect a little less than sun . `` Sunshower '' is a strong pop confection that was a pleasant surprise . Enjoy !	1
It 's hard to review this album for the simple reason that I do n't believe that Jupiter One knows what decade it is.As a 70s album ( with songs like `` Simple Stones '' ) , it 's a phenomenal ride and occasionaly as a 60s album ( with songs like `` Strange Teacher '' ) , it 's even more phenomenal . In 2009 , one wonders if anyone can bank on the success on Jupiter One in the current musical climate . Most of the songs would have been extremely innovative back in the 70s , although there are odd curiosities like `` Come On '' that sound like late 90s Alternative Rock.It 's a great album , but it 's terribly confused and released about 35-40 years too late . If you like some of the non-Disco funk songs of the 70s or some of the psychedlic/Beatle-esque offerings of the 1960s , this album will definitely be in your vein ... .	1
It is rare that I review a group/album that I have n't heard anything about at some point . Sure , I review solo artists and bands I 've never personally before purchased , but never one I 've never heard of at all . Because of my interests in constantly broadening musical horizons , I found that Jupiter One'sSunshowerwould be an interesting listening considering I had no idea what to expect . An indie-rock release , Jupiter One proves to be trivial as many indie bands are , but the music and the songs themselves on 'Sunshower ' are quite accessible , and quite well put together . 'Sunshower ' is n't the second-coming of course , but it is a good representation of indie-rock . `` Volcano '' , my first slice of Jupiter One , proves impressive with its happy , major-key sound . Even more drawing is the harmonized background vocals on a neutral 'ah ' syllable . The vocals are soulful and poppy here , making for a great combination . `` Volcano 's '' refrain specifically is catchy and grows addictive ; sure it 's not as addictive as Top 40 Radio , but addictive enough to stick in one 's head . `` Lights Go Out '' features interesting production work and jagged rhythmic guitar . While the track is n't quite as enthralling as `` Volcano '' , it still showcases good songwriting with an enjoyable indie-pop sound . The hook is definitely catchy . `` Flaming Arrow '' would 've sounded completely fresh in the late 1960s - early 70s folk-pop/rock era . Despite the vintage sound , this track falls short of sounding like an anachronism . Instead , it sounds cool and catches the ear . The chord progression , namely during the refrain is rather neatly put together . `` Made in a Day '' benefits from a big bass line and an accelerated tempo . While it does n't sink in as a 'classic ' or supersede the greatness of either `` Volcano '' or `` Flaming Arrow '' , it is still solid . Best of all , it is brief in duration . `` Anna '' proves to be much more enjoyable than `` Made in a Day '' , invoking an anthemic pop sound . The sound is still somewhat subdued ( like much of indie-pop/garage-rock/pop ) , but there is something more potent here , much like `` Volcano '' . The vocal harmonies are beautiful and vocally , the performance has more a more vibrant , shimmering quality . `` Simple Stones '' , like `` Anna '' features nothing less than stunning production work , this time evoking a soulful , disco-laden quality , much like the early 1970s . `` Simple Stones '' would 've suited the Rolling Stones well , ala their ubiquitous hit `` Miss You '' . Enjoyable by all means , `` Simple Stones '' lays extremely well here both vocally and musically . `` High Plains Drifter Finds the Oracle at Delphi '' is obviously conceptual by the title . Less accessible than some previous tracks , it is nonetheless interesting and exciting . The music maybe most captivating , though the vocal performance is both soulful and affecting as well . `` Find Me A Place '' opens with a funky , soul-laden introduction , again embarking on a production treasure trove . The refrain proves poppy , making this soulful track easily enjoyable to the everyday listener . `` Come On '' cranks up the tempo with driving , rock-driven guitars . A thin , but constant driving bass line underlies the rest of the production . `` Come On '' does n't sound completely unlike a Sting & The Police song in sound . While the refrain is catchy , the song lacks the substance and draw of the best on 'Sunshower ' . `` Strange Teacher '' evokes an old-school folk-rock quality , making it similar to `` Flaming Arrow '' , and equally alluring . Closing track `` People in the Mountain , People of the Ocean '' is typical indie-rock ( think the Shins ) , but it is n't as fun or as exciting as the best ( `` Volcano '' , `` Flaming Arrow '' , `` Anna '' , etc . ) Overall , 'Sunshower ' is a good album that shifts styles enough and maybe even too much at times . Well-rounded , there are weaker numbers , though the production and the overall sound sell the album throughout . While I do n't think Jupiter One is my new favorite artist , it does represent indie-rock well . 3.5 stars .	1
Jupiter One 's Sunshower is one of the finest pop albums in years . It 's bouncey , it 's catchy , it 's pop brilliance . But more than that the musicianship is nothing to gawk at . While the boys are really doing nothing edgey or new , they have managed to make pop music what it should be and designed to be ... fun.Sunshower is n't just full of mind numbing pop tunes however . 'Volcano ' and 'Simple Stones ' all boast lyrics that are more than just bubble-gum . The guitar tone and style evokes memories of Robert Smiths earliest recordings with the Cure which adds more of a earthy and honest feel to the album.Sunshower is the perfect pop album for a late night drive or a cloudy afternoon with the sunsetting . Highly recommended .	1
Well where do I start . The tracks are short , sweet and a little too polished , yet there is still a bit of a hook to it . It almost sounds a little out of the place for the time . It 's like a bit of indie mixed with a band from numerous decades . A very Beetles-esq sound at times . `` Anna '' one of the best tracks on the album , sounds as if it 's straight from the 80 's . Even `` Simple Stones '' has a 70 's funk sound to it and reminds me a bit of Hall & Oates . My track ratings are as follows.1 . Volcano - 8.5/102 . Lights Go Out - 8.5/103 . Flaming Arrow - 8.5/104 . Made In A Day - 8/105 . Anna - 9.5/106 . Simple Stones - 9/107 . High Plains Drifter Finds The Oracle At Delphi - 9/108 . Find Me A Place - 8.5/109 . Come On - 8.5/1010 . Strange Teacher - 8/1011 . People In The Mountain , People Of The Ocean - 7/10Overall : 84 % B-Sure , it 's nothing groundbreaking and surely not super memorable but it 's worth a listen . I must say however , it does keep your attention pretty well all the way through even though the album is lacking in length . It 's interesting that the band is able to use a lot of influences from several different eras .	1
Jupiter One play some generally upbeat indie pop , but thankfully they 're pretty good at it.They morph styles a lot , which keep the listener from getting bored . Whether its a bouncy folk influence , a relaxing vibe , a dub reggae bass line , some jaunty new wave , or a song or two that sounds exactly like Sting is singing for them , Jupiter One makes sure they 're giving you some variety in their music to keep your attention . And the songs have some darn solid hooks too.Enjoy ! Unless you 're one of those guys who only listen to grindcore , there 's no real reason not to !	1
Sunshower 's managed to grab everything from 70 's and 80 's pop and blend it in to a feel-good disc that does n't have a single skippable song on it . Probably every reviewer is going to talk about the group 's musical influences . I heard Genesis and Peter Gabriel right off . What 's great about Sunshower is that the music is n't just 'inspired by ' . They 've somehow taken the best out of these musical great 's styles and made it their own . They 've got harmonies inspired by CS & N ; , a sharp drummer , and a world music influence just to name a few.This is a CD to put on to blast away winter 's chill darkness and dispel a rainy day 's gray mood . Use it to dance , exercise , clean the house and the time will go by faster with your heart a good deal lighter , too . One of the best tags below is 'power pop ' and that definitely describes this group 's appeal.My only complaints , the sound definitely is engineered for MP3 . On a stereo , you lose some of the lovely effects and the beauty of the music somewhat flattens out . Additionally , the CD is short . I could listen to this group for a bit longer than 38 minutes.Rebecca Kyle , October 2009	1
`` Sunshower '' is my first exposure to Jupiter One , and it 's definitely been a pleasant one . This is definitely the least edgy album I 've heard in a long time , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing . Sometimes one is in the mood for some nice , non-confrontational music and this album fits the bill . It has a nice flow with enough variety to keep things interesting.The album has a nice live band feel , which I find missing from so many records these days . It does n't suffer from overproduction and you get the feeling that these guys probably sound just as good in a live show . The instrumental parts are n't particularly virtuosic , but then again , that 's not really what this music about . It 's about the construction of nice , simple songs.My main criticism is that with so many similar-sounding groups out there , Jupiter One does n't do much to differentiate itself . The experience of listening to `` Sunshower '' is one you could get from a number of different bands . That said , if you 're a fan of upbeat , positive , and tuneful indie rock , this will not disappoint.I 'm not particularly enamored with the album , but it has enough staying power that I return to it occasionally . It 's enjoyable and puts you in a good mood . Check out some MP3 samples first , but if you like what you hear , you 'll get more of the same . There 's always something to be said for positive , uplifting music .	1
Picked this up on a whim . Never heard of them . Now I ca n't get them out of my head ! They draw some obvious comparisons to the Shins at times but they have a unique sounds that blends right in with other bands on my playlist like Guster , Broken Bells/The Shins , Death Cab for Cutie , Cowboy Junkies , Zero 7 , the Fountains of Wayne , Radiohead and Mute Math . They ALMOST make me appreciate jazz with the musical flavorings they mix into their pop-hook-oriented tunes . They also give a gracious nod to the 70 's at times yet keep it cool enough to not feel stupid cranking your stereo as you cruise . The Harmonies are cool and I love that every song sounds different . Add these guys to your playlist !	1
Very rarely does an album come along that is enjoyable all the way through it 's entirety . This one is a winner all the way around.There is n't any crap or filler tracks on this album . Each song is full of feel good jams that would make gloomy days seem bright.There is definitely allot of toe tapping , head bobbing and chair dancing going on in the office today.This one made the cut for my playlist . Looking forward to even more from this group .	1
This is my first encounter with Jupiter One , and this is the sophomore effort . You 'll be excused if you find yourself thinking you 're listening to The Shins as that band exercise a Beatles/Beach Boys fetish , but that is what `` Sunshowers '' sounds like . It 's lighter than air and rich with harmonies , and often catchy . If every band could write a song as cool as `` Anna , '' the world would be better place.The quality stay consistent throughout , tickling the usual angsty subjects ( young love , urgency , desire -Tears for Fearscame to my mind at various points of this CD ) . There 's a dreamy essence to a lot of the music here , and at times the new wave gives way to some folkiness . This is especially true on the closing `` People In The Mountain . '' The glistening strings bring the album to a satisfying close . The five members of `` Jupiter One '' seems to be bringing in different personality traits and making sure that `` Sunshower '' does n't get too homogeneous.The funk of `` Simple Stories '' comes from one voice , the playing with fire metaphors of `` Flaming Arrow '' another . The orchestral pop of `` High Plains Drifter '' teases the psychedelic world beautifully . While not bombastic or hyper-dynamic , `` Sunshower '' is a breezy delight . To me , it 's no surprise that they 'd be touring with Regina Spektor , whoseFarshares many of this album 's best qualities .	1
I 've been grooving to these Jupiter One tunes all day , especially `` Anna '' and `` High Plains Drifter Finds The Oracle . '' They 're rock with a wide streak of melodic pop running through it . J-One has a tight band sound that harkens back to the ` 80s hit radio days of groups like The Cars . The best songs on Sunshower feature ultra-catchy melodies , a mix of hot guitar riffs and other instrumentation ( synths ) , a propulsive rhythm section , and smooth-energetic vocals by singer K. Ishibashi . ( He is NOT a screamer , he actually sings ! ) Jupiter One is opening for Regina Spektor . I hope I catch the show when they come to my area of the country !	1
This is JUPITER ONE 's second album , SUNSHOWER , a cool party album of catchy pop melodies . ( Their first album was a bit less pop , longer songs , extended jams , etc . It was closer to their Talking Heads- avant-pop ideals . ) When the album starts to play , you might think you 're listening to rock and roll dance music from the first half of the 80s . Some of the synth work DEFINATELY refers to the New Wave period of rock , but the beats are far too `` organic '' sounding , for this music to sound like drum machine / Yamaha DX-7 new wave dance era . The first two songs are upbeat , and hook you in . Then , the third song comes on , FLAMING ARROW . Excellent song ... .little bits of STEREOLAB come crashing up against BLONDIE 'S best dance songs , with a singer that has one of `` THOSE '' voices . Man , can that guy SING ! This band has some secret weapons that grow obvious with repeated listens . The drummer consistantly keeps the groove interesting . ( Its the drummers style , that must be drawing the comparison to late period FLAMING LIPS . ) The songs often have intense , surprising time changes . Along with the singer 's smooth tone , and wide range , and that incredible drummer , is a tastefull keyboard player who produces most the leads on the songs . The bass player lays down hip , swinging beats as well . When the music starts to sound a bit lame , is on `` ANNA '' , where the influences are too close to STARSHIP , or the commercial period of JOURNEY . ( Of course , for those who love that style , this isnt a problem . ) Tho `` ANNA '' sounds annoying , its over fast and you 're into the next number , which has a bit of the LOVE AND ROCKETS sound , mixed into a touch of the PORCUPINE TREE modern rock sound . ( The bass player locks down a fine bass line , matched to minimalistic synth leads over the breaks . Nice work . ) FIND ME A PLACE is a take on powerpop ballads . The synth parts sparkle , tho the whole song works . Another great cut is HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER FINDS THE ORACLE OF DELPHI . Its begins as an unassuming number , until you get up to the chorus , and the chord turns minor , the voice becomes colored with a yearning , keening sound . COME ON is one of the weaker tracks , based on the BIG BEAT BALLAD sound , that builds into heavy , languid guitar lead . This song might remind people of ROXY MUSIC around the time of their AVALON album . STRANGE TEACHER has some light reggae backbeats , matched to a very nice vocal melody . The middle eight on this song , dreamy and airy , does exactly what a good middle 8 always does ... .breaks the mood of a song , before it becomes stale . The album ends with a folk song not unlike what you often hear from THE EELS . Ending a pop album with a slow tempo folk song , is just another unexpected surprise in an album filled with them . `` SUNSHOWER '' has a little something for everyone , making it a perfect party CD when entertaining.Its hard to say who may best like this album . The direct influences of COLDPLAY , EELs , PORCUPINE TREE , maybe even ZERO 7 or mellow FLAMING LIPS is obvious . But if you dont like 80s rock , a lot of what happens musically here , might not be to your taste . SInce this isnt hard rock , but mellow mid tempo rock numbers , all well played , I could see a lot of people enjoying this music . The composistions are tight , direct , and a lot of FUN . Zac Colwell 's the composer for these tunes , and the lead singer as well . As a first album , its impressive . The only thing that might disappoint me , would be if this were the `` peak '' of Zac Colwell 's career , and he doesnt keep moving beyond his influences .	1
Coming into Monsters of Folk , I expected something short of their solo efforts . What I got was something mostly different , and the shocking diversity found on here something to behold . But not only is their diversity , but there 's songs that are actually pretty good . More than pretty good actually . They may be something short of a Folk Rock Beatles , but the exploration of rock and folk taken on this album is well worth the journey . Just listen to the first two tracks . Simply stunning.Highlights Include : Dear God ( Sincerely M.O.F . ) Say PleaseWhole Lotta Losin'Slow Down JoLosin Yo HeadThe album 's true achievement is its ability to truly function as a supergroup . Although the members take turns singing and writing , they all work together on a song bringing their expert instrumentation and rich harmonies to what would otherwise be one-note efforts . In fact , to fully get this album is to listen to it in full surround-sound since the album is a sonic masterpiece . The sound quality is just so good , and it does n't hurt that everything else works so well.But of course , the album is subject to sound like a Conor Oberst solo album on occasion , suffer from an overt sentimentality , lyrics that do n't work quite as they should , and it may stay in the folk genre too long , but its surprising moments make the album worth slogging through the less than brilliant material . But still , there is a goldmine of brilliance to be found.Overall , Monsters of Folk was n't anything like I expected , and I was pleasantly surprised as the depth I found here . Again , it may not all gel , but it is one of the better supergroups we 've come across in the past 20 years . In all honesty , I want to hear what the 4 troubadours can come up with next . As long as they take more risks , and try to step out more of the genre for which they 're named , Monsters of Folk should truly give you nightmares of brilliance , instead of scary flashes.Real Score : 4.5/5	1
I am so happy to have this album because I admire and respect every musician who put forth effort to create it . I 'm appreciative of the beautiful & thoughtful arrangements and very interesting instrumentation by the aptly coined contemporary Traveling Wilburys . It is a unique gift to hear a few songs that offer the seamless blending of voices I 've come to love individually , but there are some songs that are exactly reminiscent of the parts and not the sum . So , its not all sunshine & rainbows because there are some holes . Unlike others reviewing here , I 'm IN LOVE with Dear God ( and I 'm agnostic , so this ai n't a spiritual review ) because it is brilliantly produced , hauntingly beautiful and representative of the collaboration ( a departure from all of their solo work ) . There are other strong tracks that are good old-fashion alternative country and I have mad respect for namely : the LIVE version of Temazcal ( ancient sweatlodge ? ) , The Sandman the Breakman and Me , Magic Marker , Map of the World , and Slow Down Jo , all of which feature beautifully inventive guitar work . Overall , this is a solid purchase , if you dig any of these artists .	1
Monsters Of Folk is a super group comprising solo acts or acts from other groups , similar to Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young , or more recently , Travelling Wilburys or Raconteurs . Composed of singer/songwriter M. Ward , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis from Bright Eyes , and Jim James of My Morning Jacket , their sound is harmony rich psychedelic Folk/Rock , akin to Fleet Foxes or Grizzly Bear.Opening cut `` Dear God ( sincerely M.O.F ) '' is a swirling psychedelic sounding number with dreamy harmonies and posing exisential questions . It samples `` Is There Any Love '' by Trevor Dandy and is truly beautiful . `` Say please '' is more upbeat and guitar driven , a bit Beatles-like , while similar , but more downbeat is `` Ahead of the curve '' .There is variety in the sound , from the spare acoustic trio of Folky `` Magic marker '' , `` Map of the world '' , and `` The sandman , the brakeman and me '' , the woozy psychedelic `` Slow down Jo '' ( again , those dreamy harmonies and softly chiming guitars offsetting whispered vocals ) , the ethereal sounding `` Temazcal '' ( with Oberst singing `` The love we made at gunpoint was n't love at all/They 're dancing in the valley , the moon is the mirror ball '' against ghostly harmonies ) , to the sunny Country-tinged Rocker `` Losin ' yo ' head '' and the bouncy Western-style `` Man named truth '' ( beautiful guitar and harmonies ) .Everything is brilliant really , and the subtle flourishes and nuances add to the allure of the fantastic songwriting . A monster !	1
Monsters of Folk is a supergroup consisting of Jim James ( of My Morning Jacket , annoyingly here listed as Yim Yames , as he did on his recent `` Tribute To '' EP -- why ? ) , M. Ward ( of She and Him ) , and Conor Oberst and Mike Mogist ( of Bright Eyes ) . Wow , when you see a collaberative of that stature , your expectations ca n't helped but be high . So how did this actually turn out ? `` Monsters Of Folk '' ( 15 tracks ; 55 min . ) is equally ( almost too politically correct , in a way ) divided in 5 songs for each of Jim James , M. Ward and Conor , in which each of them has lead vocals . But besides that , the band does have a complete mixing up as to who plays what . Each of the members takes turns at one point or another playing the drums , bass , lead guitars , keyboards , and whatever other instruments , just impressive . As to the songs , however , they are all quite subdued , yet gentle ( there is only one 'rocking ' tune on here , `` Losin To Head '' ) . It all flows by very beautifully , but to me ithe overall album did n't resonate all that much unfortunately . Sure , there are several outstading tracks , such as `` Say Please '' , `` Man Named Truth '' and the beautiful closer `` His Master 's Voice '' , but considering all the talent that is behind this collection , I could n't help but feel a bit let down . Is this a bad album ? Of course not . But it 's not the `` home run out of the park '' that it could 've been either.That said , I can only imagine how amazing it will be to see this band live in concert . I wonder if they 'll jump around on the instruments as they did on the album . The band will be touring soon , and I can only hope I 'll have a chance to catch them . Finally , if you wonder where you can here these guys , check out WOXY ( BAM ! The Future of Rock and Roll ) , the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country .	1
The announcement of Monster of Folk 's debut album this year instinctively drew a knee-jerk reaction of dread from me , despite its pristine indie pedigree . After Tinted Windows defined the term `` novelty supergroup '' yet again for the year 2009 , I was just a little worried that ego and the sense of `` fun '' that routinely leads artists to ill-advised collaborations would cause the sum of talent here to be considerably less than its individual parts . Luckily for me and fans of the people on display here , Monsters of Folk works more like a well-oiled , cohesive `` best-of '' collection of each , rather than a clash of styles or a neutered effort of bland , wankish jam sessions . Made up of Conor Oberst ( Bright Eyes , Mystic Valley Band ) , M. Ward ( She & Him ) , Jim James ( My Morning Jacket ) , and Mike Mogis ( producer extraordinaire ) , Monsters of Folk 's terrible title belies its eminently accessible nature.Unlike , say , James Iha and Taylor Hanson , Monsters of Folk 's previous bodies of work definitely share a sort of kinship . From Oberst 's post-Cassadaga work , to James ' obviously country-ish bent , to Ward 's folksy , ` 60s-pop-worshipping solo releases , it seems almost preordained that this foursome would eventually find each other , with Mogis ' instrumental wizardry and understated production serving as the glue of the album . Best of all , despite its 15-song length and influences-on-their-sleeves style , Monsters of Folk never comes off as a gimmick , or , worse , a mere compilation . Oberst never dominates one track and then disappears on the next ; James ' does n't make one song his personal My Morning Jacket clone and then let someone else take the spotlight on the next . Rather , Monsters of Folk melds them all into what consistently feels like a natural record , one where new listeners might be surprised to learn of the members ' disparate backgrounds . `` Dear God ( sincerely M.O.F . ) '' does start things off pretty shaky , and you 'd be forgiven for thinking it was an Evil Urges outtake , and a terrible one at that . But the bad taste is quickly wiped away with the irresistible , fuzzy energy of `` Say Please , '' where the gorgeous but clearly distinct harmonies gives the song a true group feel , a ` la Crosby Stills and Nash ( or , dare I say it , the Beatles ) . From there on it 's a veritable treasure trove of woodsy , vibrant music , a grab bag of styles notable not for their differences but by how well they mesh as one . Hear Ward and company burn it on up tempo alt-country rocker `` Whole Lotta Losin ; ' '' hear Oberst do his best Johnny Cash impression on the fingerpicked western-flavored `` Man Named Truth ; '' best of all , hear all three of them play off each other on the restless build-up of highlight `` Baby Boomer . `` It 's easy to distinguish between the three vocalists , from Ward 's smoky , soulful vocals to Oberst ' wobbling entreaties to James ' immediately identifiable falsetto , yet their effortless harmonies and vocal interplay is sharpened to a lovingly refined point . Musically the band 's closest touchstones are Ward 's last two solo efforts , as songs like the woodsy `` Goodway , '' `` Magic Marker '' and many more mimic the kind of ` 60s pop/Americana folk pastiche he 's strived for , although Oberst 's Mystic Valley influence is well represented here ( his inexplicable Mexico fascination continues on `` Temazcal '' ) . But far be it from them to discriminate - songs like acoustic shuffler `` Map of the World '' reflect Fleet Foxes ' multi-part harmonies and Appalachian character , while `` The Right Place '' sounds like vintage , It Still Moves-era My Morning Jacket . The record as a whole continues to build up its own identity as it goes on , thanks in large part to Mogis ' eclectic production and the refusal of the tracks to fall into a stylistic rut.Sure , it 's a little long , and the opening and closing tracks are two of the worst bookends for an album in recent memory , but perhaps that 's just merely a testament to the strength of the material in between . After hearing Monsters of Folk for the first time it 's easy to write it off as a success in its genre and a ( huge ) success for the supergroup ideal , but repeated listens show it as much more than that . Songs like `` Say Please '' or `` Baby Boomer '' practically sound like they were recorded in a live setting , the band 's energy a nearly palpable feeling throughout . Monsters of Folk is a great album , and it achieves this excellence not with fancy studio tricks , particularly amazing songwriting , or virtuoso musicianship , but with that which so many other supergroups have lacked : a refreshing passion for the material , the kind of passion that is impossible to ignore .	1
In one of the more unlikely combos sinceTinted Windowscame out this year , Jim James ( or as he has taken to calling himself Yim Yames ) ofMy Morning Jacket , blues/folkieM Wardand Dylanesque folk-mongerConor OberstofBright Eyeshave teamed up to mingle their overlapping tastes for this album . Add producer and Bright Eyes multi-instrumentalist Mike Mogis , and you get a thoroughly enjoyable folk album that draws on each members ' individual bests.I got to see the Monsters on tour at Philadelphia 's Academy of Music and was astonished at just how well these guys blended together . Oberst is probably the closest thing to an old-school folkie of the bunch , with Ward being more a blues singer and James adding a southern accent to MMJ 's psychedelic pop-rock . When they unleash a traditional folk song like `` Man Named Truth , '' they hit everything dead center . James brings in the Neil Young school of other-worldliness , used best on the closing `` His Master 's Voice '' or theThe Grateful Deadsound-alike `` The Right Place . '' Ward leads on `` Slow Down Jo '' and the others add harmonies that hold up theCrosby , Stills , Nash & Youngcomparisons that have been tossed at this album.That kind of hype is a bit unfair to the band , as the Monsters do n't seem to have an agenda like CSN did , and `` The Travelling Folkberries '' seems more apt . There 's plenty of great moments here , like `` Map Of The World , '' `` Say Please '' and the previously mentioned songs . But there 's also the occasional trip-up , like the pretentious opener , `` Dear God , '' or the tossed off sounding `` Goodway . '' But again , when they hit the bulls-eye , this is some top-flight stuff . And I have to add , after seeing him playing live , Jim James is a real monster ... on guitar . Even more so than the denseness of his MMJ albums reveals .	1
Fans of My Morning Jacket and Bright Eyes may be a little disappointed . Overall this feels the most like an M. Ward album with some guest vocalist . But if you love M. Ward this album is excellent.Also if you like this album check out The Travelling Wilburys , it 's a supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan , George Harrison , Roy Orbison , Tom Petty , Jeff Lynn . They sound like them a lot !	1
`` Monsters of Folk '' caught my attention immediately because of the name . But come to find out though , that these guys are not really 'folk ' artists in the truest sense of the genre . I was n't really fans of any of the guys/bands in the band beforehand , so I 'm quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this record.The music here has this sort of transcendent beautiful indie rock/ folk-rock/ classic 60 's 70's-songwriter-from-the-future vibe here . It 's the sort of music that is still going to sound good several years from now . I thought I might not like having different singers rotating on songs , but they all work together nicely.I really liked this record and enjoyed it while commuting to/from work in traffic , so I found it nice and relaxing . It 's mellow enough too that I could probably fall asleep to it/ space out to it . Good stuff . Definitely worthy of a spot in any music fan 's rotation .	1
I first heard of Swell Season three years ago when I went to a Damien Rice concert . Swell Season was the opening act and I had never heard of them . I was blown away . Glen Hansard is a fantastic singer and a masterful storyteller during his live shows . That night , I bought their first CD . I was impressed with nearly every track and I went out and bought a CD from Hansard 's other band , The Frames.Then a few months later , I saw that Hansard and Marketa were appearing in a film together called Once , which features a great deal of music from that Swell Season CD . I was overjoyed to see the band would then go on to win an Oscar.So is there a sophomore slump or hangover with Strict Joy , the duo 's second CD ? Not at all . It is excellent . Every track is great and I was impressed that most of the music is softer than what Hansard has done with The Frames . It 's a different side to him that should be explored more , I think , in future projects . As for Marketa , she is great but I prefer listening to his voice . Either way , this album is worth investigating if you like folk , or indie music.It is also worth mentioning that this CD was included in NPR 's 50 best all songs considered collection for 2009 .	1
Who does n't already know the charming story of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova , the creative ( and for a while , romantic ) couple who acted and performed in that indie film gem from Ireland , `` Once '' ? It was a bit of an underdog triumph when they won the `` Best Song '' Oscar last year for `` Falling Slowly '' , arguably the best romantic ballad of the decade . Now they follow up that success with a new album under their collective name , The Swell Season . It 's a more polished affair than either their debut album or the `` Once '' soundtrack , but it 's also much more cohesive . You wo n't hear Hansard 's raw , shouting vocals that punctuated the songs from `` Once '' , but that 's not a problem . This is definitely a mellower affair , and the songwriting is every bit as strong and more mature . It 's not as cathartic as some of the songs from `` Once '' , but it 's still quietly moving .	1
Strict Joy is an achievement . It chronicles every feeling of falling out of love ; unexpected loneliness , second guessing yourself , blindly thinking you still have a chance , guilt , questioning life , wondering why it all had to happen , and at the end , acceptance , however bittersweet it may be . The music never condescends the listener with any sappy breakup songs that scream `` poor me '' . It 's more of an audio diary of the decline of the real relationship of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova , and if any musicians these days know about catharsis , it 's these guys . It also does n't hurt that they 're two of the best musicians working today , and they are a revelation when put together . As if they 're already great enough when they 're each on their own , there 's nothing better than hearing these two harmonize.The album begins with the sweeping , charming Low Rising , which I 've loved to death since they performed it on the Tonight Show however many months ago . I have to say I like most live versions of this better than this studio version ( partly because of the mix ) but that does n't change how good of a song it really is . Then the album has a two-song slump , which is the only low point of the whole album . No matter how many times I 've tried to like Feeling the Pull , I just can not . And In These Arms is better , but I really ca n't find anything to it ; it just feels standard to me . But after this slump comes one of the best parts of the record , tracks 4-6 . I ca n't explain how much I love all 3 of these songs . They of course all contribute to the scope of the full album , but if they were released on their own as an EP , it 'd be one of my favorite EPs released by any band . High Horses is n't necessarily one of the best on the record , but it 's a good song nontheless . After that , every track ( and I mean every track ) is golden , with the exhilirating The Verb being one of the very high points of the record ( which actually is n't saying much , because nearly every song here is a high point of the record ) . Back Broke closes the album in a desperate , sad , and very real fashion , and if someone told me this was exactly how the couple ended their relationship , I would n't doubt them.Buy Strict Joy . I might 've given you some of the best advice you 've heard in a while . This is worth your money , and much more . It 's one of the most satisfying listening experiences I 've had all year . If you like the music from Once , then I hope you 'll like this ; though keep in mind , those songs were about falling in love , and these songs are about falling out of it .	1
Loved & # 34 ; Once & # 34 ; and it 's sound track . This cd has a nice blend of voices together and solo and also a nice mix of ballads and more up-tempo songs .	1
Like many people , I was first introduced to Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova when I went to see the movie `` Once . '' Of course I was swept away by that charming film , and since music was so integral to its appeal , buying the soundtrack was a no-brainer . Yet my love for the movie did not quite translate to the soundtrack which ( though not bad by any means ) has not earned anything close to heavy rotation at home or in the car.So it was only natural that the new album by The Swell Season ( Hansard and Irglova ) , `` Strict Joy , '' would end up in my hands too . And I have listened to this album almost nonstop since I first gave it a spin about a week ago . The difference , I think , is one of scale and scope . Although I love the music from `` Once , '' I have a somewhat limited appetite for spare , singer-songwriter music without any significant backing instrumentation . All of the music from the `` Once '' soundtrack was beautiful in and of the moment , but not addictive in the same way that a really great album can be . `` Strict Joy '' is that kind of great album . The cohesive feel of the songs is immediately apparent , yet the album is not repetitive or tedious in any way . It 's true that heartache is the subject matter throughout , yet the songs are so fresh and beautiful that I am never left feeling that I 've heard it all before.The first two songs could n't seem more different . `` Low Rising '' plods along languidly , perfect for a slow dance or a slow drink at the bar . The song is guided by a growling Hansard , and a mournful , bluesy electric guitar solo . `` Feeling the Pull , '' at the opposite end , is a jangly , twinkling folk song , full of wanderlust and melancholy.The remainder of `` Strict Joy '' charts the territory in between these polarities , such as the sweet darkness of `` In These Arms , '' `` Paper Cup , '' and `` Back Broke , '' and the innocent sadness of `` Fantasy Man '' and `` I Have Loved You Wrong . '' Yet the best songs may be `` The Rain , '' which starts off with just Hansard and an acoustic guitar , but escalates to a soaring , full-band sound with guitars , strings and a xylophone , and `` High Horses , '' a moody , fast-paced number reminiscent of Death Cab for Cutie at their best and REM 's `` Losing My Religion . '' `` Strict Joy '' is great throughout , but these are the album 's real high points .	1
Amazing followup collaboration from Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova ( the couple commonly referred to by tabloids as Glenketa - okay , not really ) . The album achieves momentum with lots of strong , soulful songs and beautiful musicianship . Both the songwriting and the singing are so good . I 'd read in an interview that Glen and Marketa had ended the romantic aspect of their relationship ( I ca n't imagine how intense it must be to collaborate in such a creative and beautiful way ) , but the songs on this record are n't bitter , awkward , or phoned-in . Rather than feeling like a contract obligation , it 's a brave example of life after romantic love and is every bit as `` real '' an album as anything either musician has ever done.I do hope this effort does n't delay Glen 's participation in another Frames album , though !	1
This is definitely a more polished entry from this compelling duo . I did not realize they had ended their romantic relationship , and I 'm sad about that , but it imparts a bitterwseet air to their performance . Hopefully they will continue their musical association for years to come , because they are only getting better . This CD showcases Irglova 's lovely voice in a couple of numbers . I feel like Hansard is such a huge personality , and I like the idea that he has a softer side and uses Irglova to send that message . I agree with the reviewer who points out that Hansard 's voice is not so raw as on earlier albums . In general the orchestration is more prominent and beautifully offsets their vocals . The lyrics are clever and rueful . I like this CD quite a bit . I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 because it feels like something I could put in my player at any time , and never get tired of it .	1
Maybe a little overproduced but these 2 go together like , oh I do n't know but they go together musically in such a sweet and effortless way . This is a quieter softer album and came at a time in my life when I needed that .	1
Owl City 's `` Fireflies '' is a surprisingly good indie rock hit . It 's made it onto America 's Top 40 ... and it actually sounds good . Owl City is like early Coldplay , before it sold out and became U2 wannabe wannabes . `` Fireflies '' is contemplative , bittersweet , yet peppy . It really does light up the charts !	1
I could just listen to this over and over ! ( ... and sometimes I do ! ) Easy download from Amazon .	1
I was lucky enough to get this song when it was still free . If I had n't , I would 've gladly paid for the privilege of owning it ( the same ca n't be said for most of the free offerings ) . Adam Young 's youthful , earnest vocals sound a lot like the lead singer of Death Cab for Cutie , which is a good thing if you like DCC . The slick production and catchy tune guarantee that you will be humming `` Fireflies '' to yourself for the rest of the day after you hear it . The fresh , original lyrics make it stand out from the plethora of whinging love songs you hear on public radio . I could relate to it , because , like Young , I 'm an insomniac . He shows that you do n't have to be disappointed in love to have trouble sleeping . And you can use those sleepless nights for inspiration , as Young does . I may decide to listen to his other music and see if it measures up to this sample .	1
There are sometimes those songs that actually can be surprising from the mind when you least expect it . That is the case with newcomers Owl City , and their debut single , Fireflies . When I first heard the single , I was actually very surprised with how dynamicly appealing and eclectic the song was . I thought it was really very appealing with Electronica music , and how it honestly appeals well for young and old listeners alike . It really was a surprise that I really enjoyed that does showcase that definitely was a strong escape away from all the joke artists like Rihanna and Kelly Clarkson . I hope that Owl City can stay around for quite awhile , and bring in some more fireflies to the world.Song : B	1
He is so original and down to earth . I love the catchy toe tapping single . You start singing or humming to the lyrics . I just heard it over the & # 34 ; radio & # 34 ; at the store and it still brings a smile to my face . Check out utube ( dot ) com for the fun video .	1
In this day and age , it is always a little refreshing to hear a pure thrash album , and not one that has any metalcore leanings or tendencies . Five Finger Death Punch , a modern thrash outfit from Los Angeles , California , stitch together belligerent thrashes riffing with forceful drumming , chugging bass lines , and choruses that are usually really remarkable in their huge size . And they never forsake catchiness , either , as they always remember to fuse their songs with strong hooks and memorable parts . And the heck of it all is , they do it all without ever sounding like a cheap Killswitch Engage knock-off . No , the sound heard on their second full-length , 2009 's `` War Is The Answer , '' actually falls somewhere between Lamb Of God , Shadows Fall , Exhorder , Anthrax , and Metallica . `` War '' certainly covers all of the usual thrash bases , as it ranges from thrashy beatings to soaring power ballads ( see `` Far From Home '' ) , and even goes so far as to include an entirely instrumental track , as well . ( `` Canto 34 '' is a four-minute long instrumental with crunchy , chunky , guitar and bass riffs that only stop cascading down upon the listener 's eardrums to drop in some exceptional , and fairly ripping solos . ) And the heck of it is , the highlights do n't stop there ! `` Bulletproof , '' with its Slayer-meets-Pantera buzzsaw riff and Yngwie Malmsteen-esque melodic shred soloing , is a possible highpoint ; although it does have some competition in a track like `` Hard To See , '' with its crunchy , syncopated , even at times borderline funky-sounding groove that evokes some latter-day Ministry material , and huge , soaring , stadium-sized chorus.Elsewhere , `` Dying Breed '' sounds very reminiscent of Slipknot 's `` Before I Forget '' in that it anchors lurching rhythms and serrated , crunching guitar and bass riffs with tight double bass thudding . The number , a powerful set opener , also tucks in a memorable melodic chorus and even a decent guitar solo , into the mix . `` Crossing Over , '' then , is a sweet , cleanly-sung ballad that falls somewhere between Staind 's `` It 's Been A While '' and Guns ` N ' Roses ' `` Sweet Ol ' Child Of Mine . `` But it is immediately followed-up by `` Burn It Down , '' which is backed by a hefty , thrashing chug and stomp , shredding solos , and really powerful and memorable lyrics and vocal patterns . Two other highlights include the steady , chugging hardcore-beating and breakdown-happy rhythms in `` No One Gets Left Behind '' ; and the Anthrax-meets-Hatebreed album closing title song.In the grand scheme of things , FFDP can not be said to have delivered a total knock-out , here , as `` War '' does not exactly make for a very life-changing or even absolutely essential listen . But it is still a good album . It is tight , well-played , catchy , as tough as nails , and again , refreshing enough to be recommended to fans of thrash and groove metal genres .	1
The 2nd album , from the Los Angeles based , 5FDP comes a little over 2 years since their debut group album , The Way of the Fist , was released . This time around you have the group founder , Zoltan Bathory , on guitars ; Ivan Moody on Vocals ; Jason Hook ( who replaced Darrell Roberts ) on guitars & background vocals ; Jeremy Spencer on drums ; and Matt Snell on bass & background vocals . Though I mostly listen to & review hip-hop and R & B ; music ( have about 1200 CD 's ) , I also listen to & enjoy some Rock and Metal ( have just under 100 CD 's ) . The members have a history with other bands & Bathory recruited and started the band , which has a pretty good following , and rightfully so . This one has 13 tracks ( 1 being an instrumental ) . Of the 12 ; 1 is a Classic , 1 is near-classic material , the other 10 range from average to good songs , there are none that I 'd say are ` skippable ' material , and the album can be listened to straight thru without any disappointment or having to jump around . Definitely recommended for fans of metal/harder rock sound. # 1 - 6.5 ( hard , metal tack ) # 2 - 9 # 3 - 7.5 ( decent harder metal track ) # 4 - 7.5 ( another decent harder metal track ) # 5 - 9.5 ( very good song ) # 6 - 8 ( a nice metal song ) # 7 - 9 # 8 - 7 ( another alright metal track ) # 9 - 7.5 # 10 - 7.5 ( a much slower , deeper vocal song ) # 11 ( instrumental ) # 12 - 10 ( CLASSIC - great remake of Bad Company 's song of the same name ) # 13 - 8.5 ( very nice , hard metal song ) Zoltan Bathory - Guitars - b . 5/15/78 - b. Hungary moved to Los Angeles , CA ( also was part of U.P.O ) Ivan Moody - vocals - b . 1/7/80 - b. Denver , CO ( also was part of bands : Motograter , Black Bood Orchestra , & Ghost Machine ) Matt Snell - Bass/background vocals ( also was part of bands : Anubis Rising & Deadsett ) Jeremy Spencer - Drums - b . 1/8/~73 - b.

Back in 2007 , we saw Five Finger Death Punch 's highly successful debut album `` The Way of the Fist '' . When I first got my hands on it , I immediately fell in love with it , and I quickly became a fan of 5FDP afterwards . Now , with their new sophmore release , 2009 's `` War is the Answer '' , Five Finger Death Punch are back with another full round of hard driving metal that is locked and fully loaded . This album really shows that these guys have definately done some serious growing and maturing since the first album , it 's simply incredible on every level with an excellent mix of balls to the wall songs including `` Dying Breed '' , `` Burn it Down '' , `` No One Gets Left Behind '' , `` Bulletproof '' , and `` War is the Answer '' , and more slower and melodic cuts such as `` Far From Home '' , `` Crossing Over '' , and `` Walk Away '' . It also features the addition of new lead guitarist Jason Hook who replaces Darrell Roberts as well . The production here is much stronger and better this time around , and the album artwork is just fantastic , I love it , and of course the band 's musicianship is top notch and much more stronger and tighter . Ivan Moody is one of the most talented vocalists in metal today . His clean , melodic singing vocals are just strong , powerful , and absolutely fantastic beyond words , and he also does an excellent job at belting out gutteral screams and growls that are actually clean and understandable . This album really shows how much better of a vocalist Ivan has become . The guitars of Jason Hook and Zoltan Bathory are just excellent here with tons of hard driving , and pummeling riffs and outstanding solos from Jason that 'll make your jaw drop in sheer delight . Meanwhile , bassist Matt Snell pummels through the listener 's ears relentlessly with strong , hearable basslines , and skinsman Jeremy Spencer dominates his drum kit with awesome beats and fills , and solid double bass kicking.Highlights Included : The opening track `` Dying Breed '' immediately kicks you in the teeth with an aural assault of brutal , gutteral screaming verses that lead to a great melodic chorus , as well as fast machine gun riffing and double bass pedal slammming , and a great ripping solo is included . The second track and first single `` Hard to See '' is a very catchy and melodic driven song that really showcases Ivan 's amazing melodic vocal abilities especially in the chorus , and there 's also an excellent guitar solo at 2:08 , while track three `` Bulletproof '' is another fast and heavy track that boasts more machine gun riffs and double bass action and another good balance between screaming and singing . Up next , we got `` No One Gets Left Behind '' which is a heavy and angry war/political song , while `` Crossing Over '' is a nice ballad which features some heartfelt vocals and lyrics , and another fantastic solo is thrown in as well . My personal favorite song , that being track six `` Burn it Down '' is another catchy and heavy hitting song that is highlighted by heavy trudging-like riffs that hit like bricks and straight up angry screams especially in the chorus , and there 's another excellent guitar solo thrown in as well . I can just imagine myself lifting weights to this song . `` Far From Home '' is another masterful and excellent ballad type song that features another incredible vocal performance by Ivan . This song seriously is just absolutely incredible , believe me . `` Falling in Hate '' meanwhile , is another heavy and addicting cut that features more straight up screaming vocals and slow yet punishing and menacing riffs , while `` Canto 34 '' is an incredibly outstanding and impressive instrumental cut that has attitude written all over it , and features more of Jason 's excellent leadwork and powerful heart pounding and headbanging riffs , and a great drum beat to go with that . Next we have the band 's cover of Bad Company 's classic hit `` Bad Company '' . I was so surprised and impressed at how well they covered this song , and I love the solo around 2:51 , and Ivan of course delivers another strong and powerful melodic vocal performance , and last but not least , the final track `` War is the Answer '' is a heavy and crunchy album closer that boasts driving double bass pedal slamming , bone crunching riffs and a ripping solo , and all-out angry screaming vocals and lyrics . A ferocious album closer this one is.All in all , `` War is the Answer '' is an absolute incredible and outstanding sophmore effort from Five Finger Death Punch , and it 's definately a huge step forward for these guys as well . It really makes you wonder what the next album is going to sound like . This album definately shows that they 're not afraid to show every single emotion that they possess in their hearts and souls . Anyways , if you enjoyed 5FDP 's first album `` The Way of the Fist '' , then by all means , you 'll definately enjoy `` War is the Answer '' . Highly Recommended ! !	1
This is an album that will pave the way for heavier radio rock and possibly get heavier metal bands like Trivium onto the radio . While I would much rather prefer this be on radios everywhere over the modern pop we get , this album does a have it 's share of flaws . One being some repetition ( as in a few songs sound the same ) , lyrics ( a big drawback ) , and just too many tracks on the album . 13 is quite a number for a standard album . The vocalist is very good , very distinct , the guitars are much better than I ever would 've expected from a more mainstream rock/metal band , and the bass and drums are pure gold ! The music:1 . Dying Breed- This song stomps on your eardrums to kick this album off ! Ivan 's growls are very distinct ! I can tell it 's him and his clean vocals are great ! This song is a headbang fest ! This is the kind of thing you could wake up the Army with ! The drumming is extremely good on this , the bass is not only audible , but it drives the music ! ! ! And the guitar solo is extremely well done ! The soloist is competent enough to not just shred , but to make a story out of his solo ! Great work on the musicians ' part ! EXCELLENT SONG ! ! ! I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! 2 . Hard to See- This is the song I would expect to hear on the radio out of all the songs on this album ! It sounds like the modern hard rock style , but more metal ! There is double bass in the chorus and riffing between chorus and verse . The verses sound more like a groove/80 's heavy metal song , but the chorus sounds like a slower , melodic metal anthem . This song is another standout track ! I really like the intensity it has even though it is more reserved ! The guitar solo and instrumental sections are freakin ' amazing ! It 's the kind of stuff I 'd expect from a more complex band , but delivered in a similar style to Breaking Benjamin meets In Flames ! EXCELLENT SONG ! ! ! 3 . Bulletproof- This one is intense and has a thrash/groove feel to it ! Then the chorus is one of the most melodic of the album ! I love this chorus ! And the riff too ! Heck just the song ! Ivan 's voice is great here , the guitars are very in-your-face and the drumming is intense and aggressive ! The bass is n't as present as it was on Dying Breed , but it 's still produced and mixed very well ! The solo on this song is good , but it does n't come anywhere close to the previous two solos . The drum work on here though just makes me so happy ! If this song was on the radio , my day would be made ! This is the perfect balance of heavy and melody to be put on the radio ! Another amazing track ! 4 . No One Gets Left Behind- This one sees things heavy and reserved at the same time . It 's not as reserved as Hard to See , but it 's not as heavy as the other 2 previous tracks . The riffs on this one are more alternative/thrash/groove metal and the chorus is more of a radio rock band . The style comes off very well-done and it 's still heavy enough to warrant some head banging actions ! The drumming is great again and the guitar work is more atmospheric this time around . The middle section has just riffing without a solo . I feel that there could 've been something bigger there , but the song is fine without anything . Good song ! 5 . Crossing Over- I feel that this song is ok , but not ok enough to be on the album . As others have said , it sounds like Hard to See in the chorus . It is a more brooding ballad in the verses , but the chorus just kind of takes away from the song 's potential since it 's akin to a track we just heard 7 minutes ago . Ok song , not really good nor bad , just there.6 . Burn it Down- The opening riff sounds brutal and epic , but I feel that this song is just a bit too much testosterone . It 's got the heaviness I want , but this is one where the lyrics get in my way . Just too much unnecessary cursing and just no real lyrical value . Not that the other songs have lyrical value , but this one just really disappoints me . The guitars are good in this one too . Pity.7 . Far from Home- This one is a real ballad . This song is beautiful and holds some real lyrical value . Ivan 's voice is very strong and emotional on this song ! He really sounds good here . As it is a ballad , the band kind of takes the back seat for this one , but it 's still a good musical backdrop for his voice . The guitar solo sounds like a Hair Metal solo , but in this case , that 's a very huge plus ! It just fits so well ! Awesome song ! ! ! 8 . Falling in Hate- This song was just very unnecessary . The lyrics , while somewhat humorous are just horrendous and the music is ok. Not the best song on the record . I feel that it 's filler . I just really did n't find this track to be a relevant song . It 's just dumb.9 . My Own Hell- The opening guitar part is heavy and then it opens up into an atmospheric melodic rock song . The verse is definitely something that could make the airwaves heavier . The chorus is very melodic and laid back and shows Ivan 's melodic senses again ! The verses are thrashy and groove along with a good amount of bass and double bass drumming . The guitar work is more melodic through the chorus and more thrashy in the verses and bridge . The song lacks a guitar solo , which I feel it could 've used , but this is a very good song without one . This is one that I can sing along with . The ending guitar part is amazing ! It sounds kind of like a Dream Theater guitar tone/part and it just makes me happy ! ! ! Good song ! 10 . Walk Away- This is a ballad/rocker song that shows a more alternative metal sound than the other tracks . This song reminds me of Breaking Benjamin vocally . His vocals just have that tone in the verse . The chorus is n't pulled off as well as other songs , but I do still find this song enjoyable . It 's something I can sing along with . The guitar solo on this song is impressive . It 's not much , but the tone of the guitar and the way the solo is played just reminds me of Neal Schon of Journey ( one of my favorite guitar players ) just in a heavier setting than he is usually in . I like this song ! 11 . Canto 34- This song is phenomenal ! Like really , for a radio/alternative metal band , this is freakin ' amazing ! Not only can they deliver great songs , but this band has an instrumental that 's longer than their songs on the album that rocks just as hard as their vocal songs ! I love this ! It 's something I could work out or walk to ! It 's melodic , full of solos and full of attitude . The drums could 've been done heavier in some places , but besides that , this is just freakin ' awesome ! This band has the potential to make music complex like Dream Theater and Trivium if they want to ! This instrumental proves that . AWESOME SONG ! ! ! ! 12 . Bad Company- This is a cover of Bad Company by a band of the same name . I 've never heard the original , but while this song is good , I do n't feel that this should 've been on the standard edition because the song just does n't do much for me . Now , that being said , I can see why it was put on the album because it gained the band a boat load of acclaim and recognition . It 's good for that , but for me , I personally do n't care much for the track.13 . War is the Answer- Just no ... The opening riff sounds absolutely amazing and the jam that happens after that is also amazing , but this song is absolutely lame in the lyrical department . Like really this song could 've been another instrumental and I would 've loved it . The lyrics , however suck . I 'm a fan of metal with intellectual and intelligent lyrics , so in that respect , this band is already lucky that I checked them out and like some of their stuff , but this song is just stupid . Musically , I have no problem with it . Ivan put way too much testosterone in the lyrics with all the f bombs and unnecessary swearing . Stupid song . Absolutely stupid.Verdict- This album has its fair share of amazing tracks that will impress and it 's fair share of wasted minutes . The good songs will be things I crank up when I just want some heavy stuff to blast and the bad songs will never willingly reach my ears again . All in all , this is good radio metal , but because it is made for radio , it has some drawbacks . I think it is a good purchase for fans of Avenged Sevenfold , Slipknot , and Disturbed . However , if you like Trivium , Dream Theater , Evergrey , or other bands of that nature , you will be more than happy with the riffage , but the lyrics might not deliver.Happy Shopping	1
After enjoying `` The Way of The Fist '' , I was looking forward to FFDP next release.It was worth the wait and not at all disappointing.They have n't really been around long enough to compare all their releases , being I only know of two albums.If you had to compare the two , they made some fine tunings and perhaps more mature song writing on this effort.More melodic and balladry.They are a metal band , so you are to expect heavy and loud stuff.They deliver . If you enjoyed their previous effort , there is no reason to stop at that and pick this one up as well.The songs are solid throughout and will keep you tuned in.Get it now ...	1
If you area Five Finger Death Punch then you 'll love this CD . It is amazing . Sound is a very good mixdown .	1
FFDP have a bit of a & # 34 ; stupid & # 34 ; image , but for what I 'm not sure . Some may not like their rebellious streak or numerous violence and war referrals , which is a fair criticism I suppose . However , if you 're like me and do n't really care that much about lyrics unless they 're really offensive personally , it 's the music that makes or breaks a band.The FFDP sound is well-honed and does n't vary too much from album to album , with heavy intros , verses , and clean sometimes sing-along choruses . Also , there are some damn fine guitar chops and a great crushing sound so I really do n't have many complaints.Singer Ivan Moody growls with the best of them but can sing very nicely , too . It 's a breath of fresh air to hear a crushing metal band still use vocals that carry a tune . Then , we get great guitar and drums that propel a beat rather than stomp all over the damn thing.I personally like & # 34 ; Falling In Hate & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Dying Breed & # 34 ; and the cover of & # 34 ; Bad Company & # 34 ; from the band of the same name , but there really are n't any filler tracks here . FFDP come as close as anybody recapturing the spirit if not the musicianship of Pantera , but then again , Dimebag Darrel was in a class by himself . This is good stuff to listen to after a miserable day at work .	1
Fantastic music worshiping our Lord . It really puts you in a great mood and touches your heart ! I am sure you will like it as much as do .	1
One of my favorite christian songs and really love this version of it . Great to listen to . Makes me happy .	1
Yes , blown away ... To think , it 's not a new song but this renditionis exceptional ! I feel the music deep down my soul ! The only flaw w/ this version is thatthe very end was abrupt and flat.Was it a technical thing ? Thank you much for this free song.HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD ! ! !	1
beautiful song , plays great on my kindle , highly recommended . just beautiful . even better price . try it you 'll love it its free	1
Listening to music like this on my computer makes my day at work much better , and this was perfect for that purpose .	1
Love this ! ! ! ! It is absolutely beautiful . Very uplifting . I would recommend it to anyone . It deserves 5 stars and more	1
This album is different from the typical & # 34 ; worship & # 34 ; album in that it is TRULY a worship album . What that means is that you can put the album on and simply go into the presence of God . This husband and wife team understand that sometimes worship is about just letting go . They just play and allow the listener to be part of the worship experience . It 's an inspiring album for me as worshiper , worship leader and professional musician .	1
I am not familiar with these artists , but I like this song and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Christian music .	1
This song will move you to want to sing even if your not religious.she has a voice that makes you want to sing along .	1

When every member but frontman/founder Andrew Stockdale exited the band in 2008 , two years after performing on 2006 's full-length , self-entitled debut , many thought the end of Wolfmother was near . Not so . Stockdale recruited two new , very competent musicians in bassist Ian Peres ( who also plays keyboards ) and drummer Dave Atkins . The band 's rhythm section was also completed and made fuller and better-sounding with the addition of a rhythm guitarist named Aidan Nemeth . And with this new band in tact , the Australian four-piece released a sophomoric full-length effort in 2009 , `` Cosmic Egg . '' As a result , their Seventies/Eighties-worshipping hard rock/heavy metal sound ( which is heavily influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , Rush , Deep Purple , UFO , Rainbow , Dio , Pentagram , and Jethro Tull ) is not only present , here , it sounds as sharp as ever . Simply put , on `` Cosmic Egg , '' Wolfmother sound more Wolfmother-y than ever before.With its `` Ace Of Spades '' -era Motorhead-esque bass intro and propulsive , swinging bass grooves , `` California Queen '' is bass propelled-opener -- although it does make plenty of room for some unexpectedly shrieky , whammy-bar-guitar soloing and Robert Plant-meets-Chris Cornell-esque vocals . By doing so , Wolfmother created an insanely catchy , feel-good , and nearly-danceable modern hard rock classic . Although not quite as irresistible as the above , lead single `` New Moon Rising '' is a keeper because it marries bluesy , bottom-heavy , Tony Iommi-derived riffing , tasty wah-pedal licks and more propulsive and powerful bass lines with bluesy , Southern-tinged crooning and memorable melodic choruses . `` White Feather , '' despite mostly playing like a full-on White Stripes ode , does retain some catchy , bobbing guitar hooks and a pulsing bass throb . And it is all capped off by more memorable vocals and lyrics , as well as a terrifically epic , wailing , 40-second long solo to cap it all off , too.The really tasty , Tom Morello-inspired `` wah-wah '' guitar licks of `` Sundial '' hooks the listener into a deep , crunching guitar/bass groove . Meanwhile , the guitarists are ripping out UFO-styled unorthodox , shredding solos . The tune does retain some melody , though , as some cool , jazzy piano keys and soaring melodic choruses are sprinkled into the mix , too . Next up , aside from featuring some acrobatic soloing in the background , and a strong , prominently grumbling bass bottom that flows along with the whole song , `` In The Morning '' actually plays mostly like a pretty , laid-back , Beatles-esque ballad . But this is then followed up by perhaps the heaviest song on the record , the thunderous `` 10,000 Feet , '' which features a wealth of surprisingly metallic and viscerally satisfying , chunky , grinding , Sabbath-y , pure doom riffage . And it is all augmented by a strong , chugging bass line.Two later tracks , the title song and `` In The Castle , '' both play like oh-so-Iron Maiden-ish tunes , with their rhythmic , galloping grooves , simple , chugging licks , powerful bass bottom , and terrific , shredding solos . And if that were n't enough , the latter of these tunes also features an extremely trippy , proggy intro , dramatic-sounding drum rolls , and noteworthy lyrics . ( It deals with power metal-type fantastical storytelling about going places `` that you have never been , '' etc . ) `` Far Away '' is the perfect accompaniment to these two tracks in that it is a very psychedelic power ballad with nicely melodic bass lines , a wailing , classical-sounding piano line , and Stockdale doing his best Ozzy Osbourne impression ( if Ozzy 's nads were in a vice , that is ) . A whopper , crunching stoner metal eventually kicks in , though , taking things into much heavier territory.And `` Pilgrim '' is great continuation of THAT song because it , too , features some big , sludgy , distorted , hard rocking , deeply grooving Sabbath-meets-Zeppelin guitar and thundering bass riff slices . And some Jimi Hendrix-inspired licks and a bout of surprisingly blistering solos are also included , here . Then , following the nearly five-minute long exercise in exceptional soloing that practically makes your fingers itch to play along with on air-guitar ( `` Phoenix '' ) , comes the album 's fittingly very progressive and epically epic closer , `` Violence Of The Sun . '' It is a six-minute long closer centered around siren-like guitar melodies and deft , crashing cymbals . Sure , the odd big , doomy power chord occasionally comes smashing through , making its arrangements heavy and momentous -- but only occasionally.In conclusion , it may have taken an overlong amount of time ( three years ) to produce , but with this album , Wolfmother have definitely created a very worthy follow-up to their eponymous debut . `` Cosmic Egg '' may not take many huge -- or even substantial -- musical leaps and bounds for the Australian band , but it is definitely a hugely enjoyable and memorable , hard rocking good time . As such , it is easy to recommend all Seventies/Eighties revivalists , and fans of hard rock/heavy metal , in general .	1
This album comes after a so-called break-up . well , more bands need to break up , more often ! They really came out swinging a huge hammer on this one.It from the start is decidedly harder and the fuzzy psycadelic stuff is even more matured.The previous album could be a bit sophmorish on some of the trippy parts but this record is definantly more aggressive . and its that in the good way.Great job , very good album !	1
Their first album may have landed in 2006 , but three years later , the band already has a great deal of history and a new lineup . Wolfmother originally started as a power trio out of Australia fronted by singer and guitarist Andrew Stockdale with Chris Ross on bass and organ and Myles Heskett keeping them together on drums . Their debut CD reached number twenty two on the Billboard charts after drawing comparisons to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin among other notable 60s and 70s hard rock heavyweights . In 2007 , Wolfmother even won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for their song `` Woman . '' After headlining festivals and selling out large venues all over the world , Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008 leaving Stockdale as the only remaining member.After what seemed like ages for classic rock starved fans , Wolfmother is back with a sophomore release that is even better than their debut . With howls resembling Robert Plant at the peak of his career and riffs rotating between Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , and White Stripes influences , Andrew Stockdale has proven he was the driving force behind Wolfmother from the very beginning . His new band consisting of Ian Peres on bass and keyboards , guitarist Aidan Nemeth , and Dave Atkins on drums compliments Stockdale 's style perfectly . Where Wolfmother 's first album often felt rough around the edges , their new release is polished to an incredible shine . The punk influences heard on songs like `` Apple Tree '' are less apparent on Cosmic Egg , but can still be heard in songs like `` White Feather . `` Cosmic Egg excels in maintaining consistently catchy and impressive rock from beginning to end . The lead single `` New Moon Rising , '' the Zeppelin-esque `` 10,000 feet , '' and the slower tempo `` Far Away '' may be stand out tracks , but the album is excellent straight through . When I first listened to this album , I thought it was an overall excellent release , but a few of the tracks felt out of place . I then realized these were the additional tracks found exclusively on the Deluxe Edition . Take those four extras out and Cosmic Egg is truly an album to remember . If you find the majority of your favorite artists are now over the age of 50 , I highly recommend you give Wolfmother a try . They had one of the best debuts in a long time , but with Stockdale 's new lineup of definite talent , Wolfmother has only gotten better and will hopefully continue to make music for many years to come.Similar Artists : Black Sabbath , Rose Hill Drive , The RaconteursTrack Suggestion : New Moon Rising	1
After what seemed like forever , Wolfmother is back with their second release that is even better than their debut . Andrew Stockdale has proven he was the driving force behind Wolfmother from the very beginning . His new band consisting of Ian Peres on bass and keyboards , guitarist Aidan Nemeth , and Dave Atkins on drums compliments Stockdale 's style perfectly .	1
If you like to Rawk you will love this album as it does indeed Rawk most mightily verily thus . If you do n't , you wo n't .	1
My friend came up to me one morning and asked me if I knew about Wolfmother . No , I did not ? What ? I had n't heard about Woldmother ? Apparently , until the night before , he had n't either . So he let me listen to a few snippets of tunes on his i-Pod . Yup . Sounds good . Sure . Another hard rock band I should be into , eh ? Uh-huh.Then I heard the guitar riff for 'Sundial ' . What the heck was that ? That 's cool . So , I ordered the delux-edition of the album , hoping for lots of Sundial riffs . What I got was n't disappointing at all.I gave CD 1 a spin in my car while driving and when it was done it spun a second time before CD 2 went in for a double run through . The album ended up on my MD player as well and stayed in it for two weeks before the debut album took over . What can I say ? I love the music.Only a couple of months ago I was thinking that music these days has stagnated . Once there was a time when you could date a song to the year just by the sound and style . Now 2009 sounds almost like 1999 . I gave up hope and spent most of my time in my 1968 to 1978 music collection . Wolfmother not only revive that sound and style of composing and playing but give it a shot to wake up the dead rock stars of the classic days of hard rock and metal.What I particularly like about this second album is the appearance of some mother heavy riffs that would leave Tony Iommi wondering why he had n't thought of them . The riff and sound is so heavy sometimes it seems even the distortion is weighed down and sluggish , and an image of a glacier bulldozing it 's way into downtown comes to mind.But it 's not all about knocking you senseless on your ass with heavy riffs . There 's plenty of straight out hard rock and ease back acoustic and piano in the very best of the classic sense . For a band whose front man talks about a rock show that 's just `` bang , bang , bang , bang , '' one song after another ( see their web site for the interview with Andrew Stockdale ) , they put a lot of effort into creativity and mood . The album is a rich menu of flavours.One other thing I appreciate on this album is that there is less of a Jack White vocal style ( though still prominent in some songs ) . At times I find myself thinking that Stockdale 's vocals resemble a young Ozzy in tone but with power coming closer to ( but not equivalent to ) a young Robert Plant.Overall , this album is a high four stars for me . And that 's because I am being very critical in my opinion .	1
I love these guys ! great sound of there own mixed with black sabbath and tull and a few others.highly recommended ! this album is just as good as there first one .	1
The 2009 edition of Australia 's Wolfmother is essentially a different band from the one that released their stunning debut in 2006 . Only Andrew Stockdale remains from the original trio and officially asserts himself as the main man in the band here . With new members in tow this version of Wolfmother is a leaner , meaner music machine with a wider variety of material in it 's repertoire . The band still take their sound from 70 's era hard rock with elements of Sabbath , Zeppelin , Deep Purple , and Uriah Heep surfacing throughout the disc . They also occasionally mine more pop oriented fare with comparisons to Cheap Trick , Oasis or even The Beatles to be found . What all of these influences boil down to , is a modern version of classic rock done really really well . Yea , it has all been done before , but these guys do what they do so well that everything sounds fresh and invigorating . I truly enjoy the wide variety of music to be found on this disc , and find the material to be much more diverse that the band 's debut . `` White Feather '' is the only track on the disc that I do n't care for that much , but even it has grown on me with repeated listens . All in all , with the new lineup Wolfmother have improved over what was already a very solid band . To my ears this is one of the best heavy rock albums of 2009 and if you are into a somewhat retro inspired release it does not get much better than this . Sadly the album does not seem to have done as well here in the U.S. as the debut did . The album did not get a lot of airplay and seemed to have came and gone fairly quickly . Hopefully this will not dissuade the band from continuing in this direction in the future . It would be sad to see a band with this much talent fade away .	1
Another incredible album that seems from a different time , past and future . Tracks like 10,000 Feet and California Queen just boggle the mind . I keeps finding myself saying `` they sound like ... '' but then I ca n't figure out who they sound like . I guess they sound like Wolfmother .	1
Andrew Stockdale had the proverbial `` artistic differences '' with his old Wolfmother mates , so after the international success of the debutWolfmotherCD , he picks up a new bassist and drummer ... and then makes an album that sounds almost exactly like the first . if you revelled in the 70 's thud and crunch of that one , you 're going to be in Van Heaven when you get hold of `` Cosmic Egg . `` The influences are all still there , be they the Zepplin stuttering of `` White Feather '' or theDeep Purpleorgan that wells up from `` In The Castle . '' And like before , you get the feeling Jack White/The Raconteurshave been in the boys ' CD players . `` Cosmic Egg '' is a big guitar album , filled with dirty riffs , down-tuned chording and wah-wah racket ( love that bent sound on `` Pilgrim '' ) .Even the cover art and album title harken back to a hazier day . The lyrics occasionally slip into hippie-mysticism ( `` California Queen '' ) and Hendrixian Guitar Utopias ( the six minute `` Violence Of The Sun '' ) , but Wolfmother never fall into boredom . `` Cosmic Egg '' will make you hope they stay on this track and wonder if the next album cover will be a Frazetta painting .	1
The heaviosity flows freely on this new Wolfmother album . ( Or is it heavitude ? ) But I like the fact that this is hard rock as opposed to Heavy Metal . In other words , it 's filled with loud and heavy electric guitars and high-register lead vocals , but the songs do n't bludgeon listeners into submission . For one thing , there 's a variety in tempos on the Egg -- it 's not all freight train , sometimes it 's a limo . I hear some of what one of the other reviewers described as `` more Sabbath than Zep '' on the album , in songs like `` 10000 Feet , '' but I still hear some Zeppelin in several of the songs too . My take on these homages to past `` rock gods '' is that Wolfmother maintains its originality while incorporating elements that worked so well for great genre bands in previous decades . It 's something I liked about Wolfmother before , and I 'm still enjoying it with this new incarnation.Regarding the Deluxe Edition , it 's interesting to me that the one-CD version has 12 songs on the disc , but when they added the 4 extra tracks for the Deluxe set , they decided to split up the songs 8 and 8 ( eight tracks on each CD ) . And the extra tracks are not just stuck on at the end , they are integrated into the song sequence with the original 12 cuts . So maybe the band is just presenting two different versions of the album ? `` Shorter '' and `` Longer ? '' I 'm interested to learn more about that situation . Anyway , I 'm glad I went for the Deluxe - the four extra songs sound just as good to me as the other twelve !	1
everyone else is giving this album high marks except for snobs and that makes giving them another 4 star rating that much more satisfying.this is n't music for art kids who need something to alienate their parents.this is n't music for old grandmas ... unless their grandkids are stuck-up art kids.this is n't a profound statement on life nor is it something that 's going to change the world.it 's rock.loud , happy , air-guitar-playing shoutalong with the speakers up to 10 ( they do n't really go up to 11 ) while driving down the street in whatever car you have because you 're out of beer and you need to get good and drunk before you smoke later while listening to the second disc ( and the second disc is worth it ) .I did n't have any favorite songs until one of the bonus songs played on the second disc ... which is not to say that the rest of the album passes without notice , but rather to say that the tonal shift found in that song , Caroline , works without feeling like a bonus song.all your favorites are tossed in to the influence list as well - get over it . yes , he can sound like Jack White . yes , he can get ... nothing else to say actually.this album is fun.f-u-n.have some .	1
Wow . I 'm shocked and saddened at just how lackluster this album really is . I 've been a fan of Mariah Carey 's since first hearing `` Vision of Love '' in 1990 , and have followed her through the ups and downs of her career . Lately , Mariah 's been at the top of her game . The one-two punch of Emancipation , then E=MC2 was truly a treat ! Those albums had flair , rhythm and ( for the most part ) variety . Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , on the other hand , is so bland that for the first time I found myself having trouble getting through one of her albums ! I knew that this album was more down-tempo than her previous albums , and I was REALLY looking forward to it upon learning this . I thought that Mariah doing an album of slow jams would be great next-step for her . But truth be told , every song sounds exactly the same . In fact , `` Obsessed '' , `` H.A.T.E.U . `` , `` Languishing '' and `` I Want To Know What Love Is '' are the only standout tracks on this album of 17 tracks.The album sounds like it needed more time . Honestly , seeing as though the last album came out such a short time ago , the world could 've waited a little longer for this one . It 's really too bad , this could 've been such a great album .	-1
To be honest , I am shocked by this cd . I didnt like Obsessed on the radio because it is overproduced and the lyrics are stupid . I figured maybe the rest of the album would be better . Nope I was wrong . Every song is uninspired , extremely slow and bland , and there is no outstanding vocals like on The Emancipation . AND the biggest problem is the use of Auto tune on her voice . Come on Mariah , do you really need auto tune on your voice after being in the business for 20 plus years ? I thought after her emancipation her CDs would be getting better and better , but lately she has been going way too mainstream and lazy as a matter of fact when it comes to her voice . I think she is in a midlife crisis and feels like she has to do this crappy mainstream stuff to keep herself in the limelight . I want the old Mariah back ! ! ! !	-1
Is it just me , or dose all Mariah music all start to sound the same ? I found this cd dull , I can see why they put off the release . Mariah , try something new . this just is not gon na cut it , I like this even less than the last cd.Not really hearing too many stand out tracks , didnt really like the first single , not sure there are anymore top 10 singles on this cd . Better luck next time Mariah .	-1
I was a big fan of hers back in the day , that voice simply could not be matched . Now that it is completely gone and she is resorted to cooing and squeaking like a phone sex operator , you would think that she would amp the music up to compensate for it ( like she did with 2008 's infectious , addictive , masterful E=MC2 , which remains my favorite album of hers to date ) . Here , though , you merely find one bland , dull , boring , lackluster ballad after another , with a few mediocre uptempo numbers with obnoxious , embarassingly weak hooks thrown in for good measure . It 's really quite pathetic when the first single from an album is as good as it gets . If you like `` Obsessed '' , just buy it alone and do n't expect anything just as good or better from this horrible , horrible album . Mariah , either do what you did with E=MC2 or retire , but please do n't record such drivel ever again .	-1
Hardly any song stands out here . Its all about the way she sings the songs again . A lot of whispering and crackling . I love Mariah but this isnt good at all . 2 songs stand out if your looking for the voice , Angels Cry and I want to know what love is . Rest is junk and on those two cuts..they could have been better .	-1
Mariah Carey has a knack for crafting perfectly commercial records . This record basically captures all of the flavors on the radio right now without bothering to advance them in any way , save that they 're being sung by someone who knows how to sing . Unfortunately , her talents ca n't save a beat you 've heard a thousand times since yesterday , and with as much material as appears here it 's a shame that only about 2 tracks are worth buying : the 50 Cent-esque `` More Than Just Friends '' and steamy slow jam `` The Impossible '' . Even these tracks we 've `` heard before '' , but they 're at least better than the rest of the album . In a way , it is the record I expect Alicia Keys to make , not Mariah Carey . At twelve albums deep , Carey should be leading the pack , not in it . Shack her up with some really progressive producers ( how about switching out `` Tricky '' Stewart for the REAL Tricky ? ) and let 's make an album that will stand the test of time . It 's not like she needs the money.And does it bear mentioning that we might not really need yet another confessional-themed album from her ? I guess it does.If you 're a fan , you 'll think this is the greatest record to come out this year . If you love the stuff on the radio now , you 'll find it compelling . If you are n't either of these people , get the two tracks mentioned and keep walking .	-1
This is quite a let down . Each CD since Emancipation has gone downhill . There are a few really nice songs like Angels Cry , HATE You , and Languishing . I Want To Know What Love is is okay too , but an unnecessary remake . Obsessed is alright too ! But the rest is pretty boring really , like basic R & B ballads without the punch and catchyness like the tunes from Emancipation . I 'm glad I only paid $ 5.99 during the special , I got about 5 good songs for my money . But had I paid full price $ 15 , I would have been bummed ! I give 2 stars for about 5 good songs , the rest make it lose the other potential three stars !	-1
This album is clearly written by the dream as all his signature beats and adlibs and what not . however it sounds like what woudl be his 3rd album , not really a mariah album . best she gets back with JD to get back to mature songs.i like impossible and candy bling . i 've always hated obsessed.One thing i can never take away from Mariah is girl can sing like hell . she has a voice that is so beautiful , maybe she needs to get back to the old way she used to sing , like vision of love days .	-1
I describe this album as `` Typical '' `` Predictable '' `` Boring '' & completely `` SAFE '' , In comparison to any material Mariah Carey has done in the 90 's . `` Lyrically '' `` Emotionally '' & `` Vocally '' Mariah Carey put forth very little to no effort with `` Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel '' . She went from using touching & profound lyrics to the EXACT opposite of that . `` MC '' uses improper Grammar all through this album , Double Negatives , Sentence Fragments , Run-ons and the whole bit . I 've also noticed Mariah purposely using a subtle speech impediment in some songs on certain words to put the cherry on top of her ghetto-ness and give it that `` hood appeal '' , Which by the way was nowhere to be found on anything prior to her `` Emancipation '' .Yes ! We all know Mariah has had a few Hip-Hop songs in her career that you could count on your fingers . The only thing Hip-Hop about those songs were the beats , and then again the beats were subtle . Now it 's the lyrics along with her pronunciation of the words she 's uttering ... .Pathetic.The music itself is ( again ) '' Predictable '' , annoying & boring . The beats are so commercial and overproduced . It does n't take an outstanding vocalist to sing anything she has on this album . These are all the kinds of songs you expect from The Pussycat Dolls , Monica , Brandy , Ciara , Cassie , Danity Kane , Teirra Marie , Jordin Sparks , Kristinia Debarge , Mya , and anyone else that you know who 's music sounds the same . Notice how the ladies i 've mentioned are all half Mariah 's age , These girls were in kindergarten or baby strollers when she was where they are now . Moving right along.The only subjects `` MC '' covers is inner city relationships gone wrong between `` Boy & Girl '' sang over tacky bump-n-grind styled RNB with Hip-Hop qualities that rowdy Highschool and College aged kids will sing-along to with their cliques at lunchtime and on the back of the public service bus . I really believed Mariah was more evolved than this.After giving it a lot of thought , I truly believe this kind of music is MC 's get-out-of-jail-free-card . Her voice is withering year after year and I know she 's not proud about that . Reading all the Negative but TRUTHFULL comments about herself online posted by her true and honest fans has most likely taken a toll on her psychologically because she knows what 's true and what 's not . A lot of the comments about her singing has confirmed her own beliefs of it . Therefore she 's more than likely just numb to it all and crams junk like this together . Which would explain this disaster.On a brighter note there `` IS '' one track in particular that I continue playing over and over and it 's the 2:33 Interlude `` Languishing '' which brings back memories of the true Mariah Carey . `` Languishing '' is remeniscent of songs such as `` Petals '' `` Twister '' & `` Sunflowers For Alfred Roy '' . Yes ! It sounds like the stuff Mariah has done again and again but can you ever actually get enough of it ? `` Languishing '' Has a beautiful and touching melody with `` Real '' lyrics . `` I Wan na Know What Love Is '' is a poor imitation of her older side , What ruins this song the most is not only her singing but the beat , She gave it a NEW generation bump . As long as the NEW generation believes this stuff is music she 's got it made . She 'll never have to actually `` work '' ever again . ( Must be nice )	-1
In short , buy the import ONLY ... why ? ? ? Because Universal US took a song off , `` So Complicated '' , and changed the track order.Unnecessarily.I HATE when they do this ... the UK version is fine , 11 tracks , a certain , specific track sequence ... I was waiting for the US release to get the album at a reasonable price , plus bonus tracks may have been added ... then again , the same thing with this happened with Amy Winehouse 's `` Back To Black '' , where Universal US took the song `` Addicted '' off ... Problem is , no one knows in advance what will happen with the US version , PLUS the US execs probably think , `` Oh , no one knows who they are in the US , no one will notice '' .Yeah , well , I NOTICED ! ! ! Eleven tracks down to a measly TEN ? ? ! ! ? ? And the original sequence is ruined , changing the mood and feel of the album . Frustrating ... I could have bought the import MONTHS ago , but I waited , and when I saw the US CD , I freaked out ! ! I hope this does n't happen with Pixie Lott 's US version of her album either ! ! Nothing against this band , I think they 're awesome , `` Never Forget You '' is a great great song , and Shingai is an awesome singer & bass player ... we became quite friendly at the Siren Festival in Coney Island 2 years ago ... so I was SO looking forward to buying this ... now , I only want the import.Sorry for the 1-star review ... but I had to get the word out as a warning ... 5 stars for the album , 1 or zero stars to Universal US.Nuff said .	-1
The clever thoughtful lyrics remain , but musically HUMBUG seems trapped . The title `` The Fire and The Thud '' sums up my feelings about the first 6 cuts . The sound in the first half of the CD repeats itself ad nauseum , bass and drums in a depressing combo that drags down everything else into the same muddled and unpleasant sound . When you finally get a break on songs like `` Cornerstone '' it ` s a welcome respite from a very dismal sound . Finally the lighter and more musical touch of their previous work makes an appearance . While I think it 's important for a band to continue to evolve , I much preferred the balanced approach of the first CD to this one . The last few cuts make this much more palatable , but I still find myself less than inclined to give HUMBUG the multiple plays that WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY got .	-1
Wow , I now know what it would sound like if Britpop went through a `` KC & the Sunshine Band '' phase . Arena rock used to be more monster truck , but now my kid brother 's up on the stage , waving his snotrag above the greasy crowd like it 's an extension of his `` aura . `` I remember when these Brian Eno Juniors were just innocent leeches . On `` The Resistance , '' these dime-store divas are all too happy to concede . And the one attempt at humor , `` United States of Uranus , '' ends up merely being the least offensive Queen imitation . These guys are the Madonnas of old-man emo.If you had asked me before the fact , I never would have thought that you could market so many Radiohead imitators at the same time . If you had said Thom Yorke 's help-I-just-choked-on-a-chicken-and-got-the-urge-to-sing vocal stylings would spawn a million followers , clogging up a whole decade in faux alacrity , I would have considered thee mad ! Surely the world could n't be that cruel ! Then I heard the beginnings of the `` Exogenesis '' trilogy , a self-congratulatory fusion of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's `` Phantom of the Opera '' and Rush 's `` Moving Pictures , '' and I knew that hell could n't be much worse .	-1
I met Muse only recently . Via Hullabaloo . I was blown away . Love at first sight . Bought Origin of Symmetry , as recommended by a friend since these tracks feature on his Hulla ... Loved it . Bought Absolution thanks to Chris Billings ' most popular favorable review of The Resistance . Listened carefully to The Resistance twice through , attentively . Decided it is an awful disappointment . First track is Muse meets disco . Second track is Muse meets electronica , then Muse meets Queen ( Freddy Mercury in fact ) , and so it goes on until Muse meets symphonic music . Do n't let anyone get away by describing lack of inspiration as experimenting with other genres . This can only appeal to those too young to know the sources from the 60s 70s and 80s . Time has gone , and sadly so have those genres , because they were the least interesting . So I find this album commercial in the pejorative sense . There is only one good track on it : 'Unnatural Selection ' . As far as the 'symphony ' is concerned , why not rather listen to a real one . The cut and paste simply does not work , is contrived and pretentious . Buy it , but in a year or two you 'll be using it as driving music or car washing music ...	-1
Far from the tasteful hard rock of Origins of Symetry , Showbiz and Absolution , this album just sounds pretentious . The music is not very good , not very original , and not very catchy , and yet it seems to claim that it 's the greatest thing you 've ever heard . It 's overproduced and overwhelmingly thick , with song structures that just do n't make sense . In short , the whole concept of this album does n't work . It 's not even a valiant effort , it 's just a total failure . I 'm disappointed because I enjoyed some of their earlier work , but I 'm not surprised because great bands are few and far between . Unless they come out with something amazing next time around , you can write off the Muse . Great album cover , though .	-1
It certainly does not come close to Black Holes & Revelations not even close , The 2nd Law is better than this one . Too much use of synth in this album and not at all rock oriented as in the previous 4 albums before this . This sounds more orchestral than anything and it was n't that good . Bellamy 's voice in here was toned down more than in any other album and the songs were somehow forgettable after the 2nd song on the album . I expected better in this album instead I found myself skipping a lot of songs , something I do n't usually do . Muse went towards a totally different direction in this one and it was somehow lackluster .	-1
This is by no means Muse 's best work , but it reaps the rewards like the Matrix sequels or Star wars prequels . And watch all the Muse fans click `` unhelpful review '' because I hurt them.Uprising is an ugly pop song . It tries to compensate for its lack of energy with superficial clapping and pointless shouting ( `` hey '' , '' Come on '' ) . I cringe when Matt tries to fire up his audience with cries about `` us '' and `` them '' . Its cheap and souless . The Dr Who theme is predictable of muse , the reptition is dissapointing but what really makes this sell out song terrible is that its not even good enough to be on radio . Within the confines of a pop instrumental , Matt 's wailing voice sounds way too melodramatic and whiny.The intro of Resistance could almost be superimposed with Citizen Erased . A rehash of old work . Resistance on the other hand is so bland melodically . And just in case you could be wrong the cheesy chorus makes sure you 're right . It goes absolutely nowhere . Never builds , never changes , never climaxes.And since Absolution , Matt has had this undisclosed desire to make mainstream music . Its obvious , as with every new album there is the inclusion of at least one hideously dumbed down track . Enter this Timbaland jingle which proceeds to cling to one idea , beating and spanking it . I 'll admit the melody is actually catchy , but its paperthin . Im not totally against this sound , I just dont see the point unless Muse evolve it into something more unique.Enter United States of Eurasia . You know it was kind of cool for muse to be thought of as the new Queen , but then to seal the deal with this blatant imitation is emabarrasing . It is pornographic in nature . Lyrically inept , completely literal in every sense with a rehash of past melodies . Predictable angular transitions but this time it feels like novelty.And roll in with Lawrence of Arabia thematics ... Lights camera action people . While I was once a great admirer of Muse 's bombastic pompous sound , its potently staged here . Its like a Walt Disney ride where you realise the scenery is just wallpaper and the walls are made of styrofoam.Guiding Light is a slow bellowing ballad in the way of songs like Blackout and Sing for Absolution from their earlier album . And as one can imagine from the cliche title its a self indulgent rompfest of eurotrash one liners . iIts romance as stale as cardboard cutouts , which fizzles out somewhere after the guitar solo anyway.Unnatural selection proves that muse are somewhat throwing music at us any which way . Opening with organs , but why and with what purpose . The whole soundscape is just hot air , and subsequently the whole track lacks any real emotion . I hear a band like Arcade Fire ( intervention ) put to use the organ and one feels like it has purpose , like it opens ones palate the way good wine does during a main meal . But this song is just a pile of little league ideas . Matt even manages to sneak in a System of a Down-esque wallow which is insulting.MK Ultra follows like Map of the Problematique . Opens with a pacey guitar jingle which sounds pretty cool but it suffers from a lack of variation and ultimately swallows itself whole into nothingness . A general theme in this whole album . And of course the guitar solo at the end is a rehash from live gigs . Are these guys getting lazy or are they trying ever so hard to be on radio . They dont do anything daring with it , all the while sounding completely ordinary.I belong to you is probably Muse 's best love ballad to date . Its something that might belong on Showbiz if they did that album again . Bouncy bassline and Matt 's splintered angst . But its an interesting track which manages to change sounds repeatedly and all the while paints a rich landscape of sounds.Exogenosis is not the saving grace . Although it is in another league compared to the rest of the album its still not the mammoth symphony I was hoping for . Its really just a rehash of sounds they 've done before , including Microcuts , Butterflies and Hurricanes . Other parts are familiar melodies sourced from cinema . It is wonderous and I admire it in a lo-fi way but Im disappointed because Muse had the potential to really do something special with this . Butterflies and Hurricanes alone feels more grand and daring than this 15 minute symphony . And while Exogenosis does have the impact of making you feel like your riding the magic carpet through sands of history , it never overwhelms you with any climatic explosions or exotic delights . Part 3 Redemption makes for a beautiful melody , I cant help but take it literally ... `` lets start it over again '' .But for all my criticisms it comes down to the simple fact that this album is not enjoyable . Its ok but its not great in the way I would want to listen to a particular song again and again.There was a reason Muse resonated with me so much in the past , but to see them now make music that is universally non-offending , accessible to all ears , and is deliberately simple to capture the short attention of passers-by ( at walmart , in the elevator , at work , while commuting ) will not satisfy someone like me who makes the effort to actively listen to the album.

I know all Muse fans , including me , hate constant comparisons to Radiohead , so how about a contrast ... Radiohead has never released an album that has n't involved big changes from all previous records ... Muse , while nowhere near as diverse in their catalog , still gave listeners a fresh output each album they released , and I consider every one of those records to be a big improvement on the previous one . This album , however , is deja vu throughout . And I know we all love when the multi-instrumentally-talented Matthew incorporates his beautiful piano skills into a song , but the piano-vocal moments in the second half of `` Resistance '' are the biggest examples of deja vu from previous performances.I want to know why a band who already has a gigantic international fanbase was n't able to take more chances on a record . Yes , these songs are all very listenable and do rock , but where 's the Muse excitement when there 's no `` Holy cow , I 've never rocked like that before '' ? Songs like `` Map of the Problematique '' , `` Hysteria '' , `` Time is Running Out '' , and so many more really did give us that reaction . So , I challenge any fan of this album to point out what is new and fresh about this record . I 'm very curious to know what I 'm missing , if I am wrong at all about this .	-1
Got this CD cus a friend recommended them , said they were like this band that band this other band ... said they were GREAT and his favorite . Well , they sound like Radiohead meets Alkaline Trio with a splash of Queen , and that pretty much sums them up . If I want to listen to any of those bands I will , I dont need one band that sounds like them .	-1
The first few tracks sound like late-period U2 . Track four sounds like Queen , and track five sounds like Ultravox . By the time track eight -- which is a real keeper -- comes around , you 're just too depressed to care ... .and too underwhelmed to chalk up this groovy aberation to anything other than dumb luck . Enjoy !	-1
Why this was even on my list of items to review , I never downloaded it .	-1
I never purchase this song i do n't if no who this person i do n't like listen to this type of music .	-1
I think I hit the button by mistake this is totally not my kind of music . I listened a few times	-1
I really do n't do drugs ( other than legal ones like caffeine ) , but in listening to this song again , I ca n't understand why I downloaded it , except for the fact it is free ; but if it is n't very good , why download it ? Anyway , after listening to it a couple of times ( to make sure I was n't missing anything ) , I feel the song is only worth two stars , and I am planning to delete it from my ipod . I guess everyone makes mistakes ; maybe it was a senior moment for me ( since I am over 65 ) .	-1
i got this song for free and ca n't say much about it besides i do n't care much for a variety of music it may be worth listening to though .	-1
I did n't order this song , so I 'm surprised I 'm being asked to review it . I do n't even see it on my playlist , but after reading some of the other reviews , I 'm not going to waste my time .	-1
There really isnt anything here worth buying . The song is pretty much just a boring waste of time . It isnt the worst song ever , but the music is pretty lame , the vocals uninspired , the lyrics repetitive and passe . Nothing here i would go out of my way to listen to , and would definitely never pay money for it .	-1
`` Honest Face '' by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior . However , the instruments had so much of a screechy sound and the song was just too depressing ( about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face ) . I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track . `` Honest Face '' is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters .	-1
Named after the spaceship in the '60s television show , Lost in Space , Jupiter One are a lot of inspiration short of becoming special . To me they are a poor man 's Snow Patrol with a similar kind of poppy alternative rock . At times they are catchy , but nothing groundbreaking here . Sunshower reminds me of Snow Patrol 's early stuff , notablySongs for Polar BearsandWhen It 's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up . Those albums are alright , but they did n't grab me . Nothing was memorable to me and they only served as a platter of potential . It was n't until a few years later that Snow Patrol really came around , and the same could be said for Jupiter One . Unlikely , but never say never.Sunshower is an apt title for this album . Like a rain shower in the sun , the sounds are bright , yet have a twinkling sensation like light rain . It 's kind of an odd analogy , but it fits . No idea what the meaning behind the name is , though . The first two songs `` Volcano '' and `` Lights Go Out '' are actually quite good - they 're upbeat , fun , and have a little angst . If you do n't like those you might as well forget about the rest . And actually everything after `` Anna '' ( which sounds like a theme song for a family sitcom ) is indeed forgettable .	-1
The album starts off reasonably well . The first few songs , teenage angst , get outside and do something , and then I watched the building burn down . Somewhat catchy tunes , not bad music . By track four , it very gradually devolves into 80 's pop music . The band sounds like oh so many pop groups from that era , especially Tears for Fears , toss in a little Peter Gabriel , and U2.The album is well recorded , the mix is spot on for a popular record . Lyrics are clear . The generic guitar and drum playing are well mixed . Frankly , there is absolutely nothing offensive or wrong with this CD . The dynamic range is very narrow so nobody will ever be surprised by music highs or lows.Well there in lies the problem , after track 6 or 7 , this disc is remarkably forgetable . What drew me in was the band chose the album name after one of my favorite films and director , Akira Kurosawa 's Dreams ( Akira Kurosawa 's Dreams ) . The connection literally ends exactly there , the band may love this movie , but the music is not at all related . This disc has been called , Indie-Pop or Adult Alternative music . It may well be independent , if Rykodisc is still an independent label , and it is certainly pop . But Indie or Alternative from the sense of new , different , and on the margin ; not anywhere close . The sound is very simply 80 's pop recorded today.The final song on the CD is a folkie ballad that tries way too hard to sound like bubbling brooks and lovely outdoor scenes . In so many ways , this song does n't belong with the other 10 tracks.Jupiter One 's Sunshower just sounds like so much rehashed music . The CD would make decent background music for a party where nobody is really listening anyway .	-1
Let me start by saying Jupiter One is n't a bad little band . I see them listed as `` Pop '' , and I guess that 's correct in that they would have been considered `` Pop '' or `` New Wave '' in the 80 's . Today , not so much . And that is actually a good thing . Instead of some over-produced junk like Shakira , Justin Timberlake or Pink , Jupiter One comes across as a stripped down band which actually features a real drummer , bassist and guitarist . The singer can actually perform without the aid of computer modification . That was a refreshing change , but also leaves me wondering ... who or where will these songs be heard ? What is the audience for this disk ? The tunes do n't really fit into the current `` Pop '' catagory ... maybe `` Adult Contemporary '' ? `` Sunshower '' features a couple of nifty tunes , not great songs , but catchy in that `` background-jingle-featured-in-that-Target/Old Navy/Volkwagen-commercial '' hummable way . The disk starts off with a keyboard heavy tune , and one of the stand outs on the album , `` Volcano '' , and with it 's `` get out , get out , get outta the house '' chorus , feels like it would fit perfectly in a television commercial for an airline or travel bureau.The next tune I kind of liked is called `` Flaming Arrow '' , it 's got a cool beat and sounds a bit different than the rest of the tunes filling out the disk . Again the repetitive chorus of `` you build me up , you burn me down '' would fit perfectly on some Sandra Bullock romantic comedy sountrack.The third highlight on the disk for me is the sixth track `` Simple Stone '' . This is probably my favorite song on the disk , simply because of the bass line in the tune . It 's got a funky , late 70 's vibe going on . The only problem with the tune , it that during the opening and during the chorus , there is this high-pitched keyboard whine that borders on a sound only dogs can hear . On a car stereo it 's not too bad , but I imagine on an Ipod it would sound like a dentist 's drill scraping at your eardrums.The final acoustic number `` People in the mountains , People of the oceans '' also is n't a bad song , but clocking in at about a minute and a half , it 's more like a songlet than an actual tune.The rest of the songs found here are basically interchangeable . All with a fairly mellow sound , that is n't bad as background music , but nothing to write home about . My guess is that in the coming months you 'll hear a tune or two off of `` Sunshower '' as the background to some commercial hocking toothpaste or jeans , and if you like it ... great click on the link above and buy it ... .but I do n't recommend buying the whole album .	-1
I found this band to have potential to be a good alternative pop band . Half the tracks were just over the interesting line while half fell in the boring category for me.The tracks that rose above wereMade In A Day ( best track on the album ) VolcanoAnnaCome OnStrange TeacherThere are a couple of tracks with really interesting titles , only wish the music was as interesting .	-1
When the cover is the best part of the CD , you 're in trouble . Jupiter One 's `` Sunshower '' is derivative and strangely hollow . The music is constructed of spare parts left over from other bands , particularly the Flaming Lips . Musically , they seem to know how to play their instruments , which is a plus . Not a note or a harmony out of place.Or perhaps I should say , their producer can edit things together to where it sounds like they know how to play their instruments . The reason I say that last is because there is a falseness , a hollowness , to Jupiter One 's music that I ca n't precisely define . Their music gives the illusion of substance but when I really listen to it , it dissolves into its derivatives and disappears . The lyrics vary between I-love-you rubbish and incomprehensibility , always seeming like they 're going to say something enlightening , but they never really make it . The music is the same ; it almost seems like something is going to happen , but it never does.Jupiter One 's `` Sunshower '' is clever in a completely vacuous way . It gives the illusion of being memorable pop , but their hooks do n't stick in the brain and their songs do n't return to haunt me . `` Sunshower '' is a candy bar ; sweet for a moment , empty calories , made by a corporation , and in the final analysis , not all that good for you . The best thing about the CD is ultimately the cover , which is peculiar enough to almost be art . The rest of it ? Not so much.Finally , I find it very odd that their promotional material mentions the producer when the production itself is so poor . I have to be honest . The sound is muddy and ill-mixed , and nobody should be proud of the production , engineering or mixing on this album . The dynamics of the music are muddled and nothing sounds as if it were recorded right , or well . If I were Chris Ribando I definitely would not have insisted on a producer credit , or I would have used an `` Alan Smithee '' on this one . The production is some of the worst I 've heard coming from a major label .	-1
In pop music it 's possible to write songs that are catchy but not terribly great . To me , `` catchy '' and `` great '' are not 100 % synonymous . Jupiter One demonstrate this perfectly on `` Anna , '' a song that is hooky and harmless enough but makes me really , really wish that people would stop feeling nostalgic for the 80s.I 've heard a few `` alternative '' debut albums from 2009 and they pretty much annoyed me . Jupiter One 's second album ( I think I can accurately lump them with 2009 rookies ) does n't necessarily annoy me , it just bores me . It seems to be a professionally performed and recorded batch of go-nowhere songs derivative of the do-nothing bands from ten years ago that already bored me once before.It 's a hard album to review . Not because I 'm at a total loss for words , but because there just does n't seem to be any personality or surprises to these songs . Honestly , no adjectives come to mind while listening to Jupiter One . Nothing excellent , nothing nauseating , just really boring . I would cut them some slack if they would have done more interesting things with the faux-funk of `` Simple Stones . '' But as it is , the songs starts , plays , then ends . So does the whole album .	-1
When I first recieved my copy of this album I really wanted to like it . The preview material made it seem like it was something I would like . Unfortunatly , while ok to play in the background , this work does n't stand up to repeated close listenings . Something that I ca n't quite put my finger on makes it just seem like less than it should have been . It may be that it tries too hard & feels a bit pushed . Another fair album that fall a bit short of being really good .	-1
This cd had a lot of retro-feel to it , mostly to the 80s and 90s , but it never took a hold of me and grabbed me , compelling repeated listens . I had to force myself to give it more listens to form an opinion . There was a sense that they were trying too hard to be lyrically smart and to brew up a musical smorgasbord of styles and influences , but in doing so , they avoiding taking any stylistic stand.It starts promisingly enough with the intro to Volcano , a fair number that actually loses momentum as it proceeds and that seems to sum up the entire cd . None of these songs really catch my ear . They were like an innocuous background noise , and while that is n't offensive or harmful , it is n't what I 'd want to make regular listening . When some of the songs start off well with bright enthusiastic pop melodies , the singing starts and jars me out of the buzz like a speed bump.This is a musical style that I am not a big fan of regardless of this effort , so I may not be the most reliable reviewer on this . Maybe listen to some samples to get a taste , but for me this is a cd I 'm glad I did n't have to buy .	-1
The first song and the last are your usual PRO-GOD drivel that 's better left for a gospel album.Why young folksters like this would have this garbage as their first and last track on the album is beyond me.The only songs I `` dug '' were the Conor Oberst ones.These other guys should find a good evangelical church and entertain the `` Lords Flock '' .IT SUX ... ..that 's the best rating I could give this album.Wish I had n't wasted the $ 10 with an Amazon Download .	-1
Why would M. Ward and Jim James , two of the best guys out there today , team up with the craptacular bright eyes . I was able to listen to this for free , and im really glad i didnt buy it on an impulse . Bright eyes is way to overrated . Also monsters of folk is the worst name for a band I have ever heard .	-1
I like TSS . I 've seen Glen and Marketa in concert and they seem like pretty cool people . Their live performances are incredible . The soundtrack to `` Once '' is simply amazing , flawless even.That 's why it 's shocking to have heard this album and come away numb and bored . `` Strict Joy '' is a real disappointment . There is n't anything on it anywhere nearly as memorable as to be found on `` Once '' .I will say that it 's not completely unlistenable . It could sound ok as background , ambient music in a coffeehouse , but it 's nothing that grabs your attention and has you coming back for more.I do n't know what went wrong with this album , but it surprises me greatly to call it what it mostly is : dull .	-1
I abhor this song ( look that word up , or just guess it 's meaning ) . I also do n't like Lil ' Wayne 's music either . However , there is n't one song by that rapper that I like less than this wretched song.The writer ( and composer ! ) needs to be given a good shake for composing such drivel.Everything about it is just plain horrible ! 1 star .	-1
I do n't think I 've ever posted a one-star review on Amazon , but when I heard this particular musical travesty , I knew I 'd have to put everything else aside and write one immediately -- this `` song '' is a five-alarm pop-chart EMERGENCY.After listening to the girl down the hall here in my apartment complex play this thing 38,957,991 times today , I can certify that this abortion of a song is perhaps the single worst piece of pop to ever find a place on Billboard 's Hot 100 . Owl City 's Fireflies hits the nadir in every way that matters : the `` vocalist '' sings , in a cloyingly earnest and sincere manner , that , `` I 'd get a thousand hugs/from ten thousand lightning bugs/as they tried to teach me how to dance . '' Yeah , it 's THAT bad . I 'm not even kidding . It 's like some art-school dropout decided to try his hand at poetry , and , upon realizing that he did n't have the first clue where to begin , went right ahead and stole all the stupid one-liners from a box of Hallmark Cards -- and then forced them all to rhyme together . The vocals are sickeningly-sweet HORRIBLE -- imagine a forced sincerity done in self-autotune ( ! ) ; the lyrics are nothing but a poorly described bad acid trip -- and the whole stupid mess is placed over `` music '' that is probably a dumbed-down version of the theme from Sesame Street , but played slightly out-of-key and slowed-down to make it even more unappealing to anybody with ears.Absolutely rancid .	-1
I chose this because I thought I would enjoy reading some inspirational thoughts , but it was not that for me , I 'm sure someone else would probably love it , It was just OK to me .	-1
When it has came down to the past 25 years , Madonna has simply been the most influential dance diva of all-time . Her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . But , unfortunately her music has n't really hit the home run in her recent records , and with more of her life the past few years on her marriage to Guy Richie ending , and her adopting African babies , she has n't been able to really deliver to the big hits . That simple is also the case with Celebration , the new single from Madonna 's upcoming anthology from her success with the Warner Brothers era . The song sadly does n't really deliver the same spark Madonna had delivered throughout her past 26 years . The song sadly is not Madonna at her best . It feels like she does n't hit that nail on the head , as we 've heard from her last few records . While she has been known as the material girl , her material needs to be more fine-tuned when she does deliver her next studio album.Song : D+	-1
Maybe 1-2 decent songs here . No powerhouse , lasting , memorable songs . The voice is not what it was in terms of power and strength . The songs are pretty boring . This is one that will be on the discount racks soon . Take a pass.All artists have to be judged on their art , not their lives , so the supposed challenges of her life ( like she has had it tougher than people in the Third World ? ? ! ) are irrelevant to me . I judge her work , and this work is forgettable.Paul	-1
There is no question about the fact that Train has been away from the music scene for quite awhile . While Pat Monahan had a solo effort in the works with Her Eyes , and Train 's last single Cab back in 2005 , was a dissapointment and never caught on with hard core fans , they definitely missed out on the feeling . Their latest single is honestly no acception . Hey , Soul Sister , does n't feel like Train has delivered that same unique chemistry that Train had honestly been knpwn for on bigger singles like the strong Calling All Angels and Drops Of Jupiter . I really did n't feel the vibe on the mind that Train was trying to re-capture after being out of the spotlight for so long . If you are new to Train , than I personally recommend other songs like Meet Virginia than Hey , Soul Sister.Song : D+	-1
Let me put this straight : the Strokes were not that good and I did not like them . So if you do n't agree with this , do not read any further . It is true that they appeared at a time which was a low ebb for rock in general . But it was mainly their looks and attitude that made the impact . Their recorded output has been pretty small and of irregular quality . Even Is This It is not a masterpiece . Their recorded output has been marred by a sloppy sludgy sound and missing bite iin thier attitude . This impression of boredom also permeates the first solo record by Julian Casablancas . The cover of the record is ultra-weird , with all these red colors additionally to the HMV dog ( what 's his name again ) together with a phonograph : he is on EMI , get it ? Julian Casablancas also stares blankly at us and the record conveys this blank impression . As I wrote the production is not good and the sound really muddy . He has added keyboards this time ( on french TV he had a pretty keyboard player at least ) but they can barely be hard to great effect . Also there are no real tunes and he sounds bored . At least Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers knew how to be bores but still have that added `` je ne sais quoi '' that made them great : now there was a great NY rock band . This is the cheap version . Even Television was better.While 11th dimension is clearly the best song , it is not great : it starts really well but then instead of winding up it suddenly gets caught in a boring groove . Sad to say guys but this is not a good record .	-1
Amazon is asking me to review my & # 34 ; purchases & # 34 ; and this apparently includes free mp3 files . I have this whole album . I like Sedaka . I like holiday music ( have 5,000+ files ) . Let 's just leave this review as saying mixing the two makes me uncomfortable .	-1
The Bedroom Tapes , This Kind Of Love , Into White , The Christmas CD , now this , I fell in love with Carly with No Secrets , and went on to love Hotcakes , Another Passenger , Boys In The Trees , Playing Possum , Torch , My Romance , This CD is just so sad , all the songs pale in comparison to the originals , and the voice sounds so off . Carly is my favorite singer , but I ca n't just give a great review based on the past , I have n't heard a great Carly CD since Have You Seen Me Lately , even the spotty Letter 's Never Sent had moments . Sales will be dismal for this , and rightfully so , stop feeling sorry for Carly and expect more from someone who is capable of another great pop CD , Get in the studio with a great producer , someone fresh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! , not just your friends hanging out and strumming a guitar and la la la , lets see what happens.PS , I did love Moonlight Serenade , Come Upstairs & Spoiled Girl had spunk ! This is the first Carly CD I did n't buy .	-1
The idea of recording your Biggest songs years down the road is not a new one in the past 20 years , but it needs to be one that should be retired . As a Loyal Fan of Ms. Simon 's And the $ 7.99 price tag There was no way I would n't have purchased this cd and while I did n't have HIGH hopes for it , I have to say It ties The Dionne Warwick `` My Freinds and Me '' as one of the worst remakes of songs I have heard . ( Dionne did at least give us a great Cover Picture , I am not sure what Carly was thinking with this cover . ) but back to the music , the arrangments are not only NOT better but some such as `` That 's the way I always heard it should be '' and `` your so Vain '' are down right annoying .	-1
I dont like the presentation of these songs . Not that the acoustic greatest hits albums like this are always bad . Spandau Ballet just released the same exact kind of album and it 's superb ! But this one does n't work for me . Carly is trying to be too carefree here , even starting off some songs like mistakes and goofing ( like It Happens Every Day ) . Plus stupid silly additions to the songs like Hallelujah Hallelujah on the end of The Right Thing To Do , Give It To The Girls , Give It To The Girls at the end of It Happens Everyday ( for example ) . Her voice is also lacking range and she 's all over the place changing tone , adding stuff , etc . Really they are her songs , but she 's tearing them up like a bad amateur would . This CD is also badly produced . As I read , Carly put this CD out because of the disappointing sales of her last CD and money problems . She sued Starbucks for not properly promoting the last CD . I ca n't imagine how much money she will even make from this ? Compared to what she use to earn , it has to be peanuts . A tour would be a much wiser idea , and a lot more money MILLIONS ! This is a very low place for her to end up in 2009 depending on her bread and butter selling this CD .	-1
Poor Mr. Stewart ... It seems he 's starting to feel like a 'living mummy ' ... Too many 'Recycled ' classics , one after the other ... A very bad sign , showing the end of a life-long music career.I just started to change all my old RS LPs , to CDs . 'Tonight I 'm Yours ' and 'Blondes Have More Fun ' ( Digital Remasters , German issues ) are the first titles I 've chosen . Any of these terrific RS albums , are by far MUCH BETTER than this collection of Covers of real Pop/Rock/Soul masterpieces , that are highly valuable by themselves ... In their original versions.Bye bye , Mr. Stewart .	-1
Let 's cut to the chase . Rod has lazily bungled another opportunity to do a meaningful album . There were hundreds of great soul songs in the 60 's and 70 's . A few have been played to death on every consultant-stifled FM `` good times great oldies '' station in America . There are many other great songs that HAVE N'T been overexposed . Guess which ones Rod chose to record ? Can you say `` Michael McDonald ? `` Sadly , this lame CD will be a Christmas present for thousands of sheeple this year , because it 's safe , bland and predictable . Rod had a chance to spotlight some songs we have n't heard a million times already . And if anyone believes that Rod can do `` My Cherie Amour '' and `` Rainy Night in Georgia '' better than the original artists , well then , this piece of crap is for you ! Zero stars , Rod.And if this sells , next year , we can expect Barry Manilow 's take on `` Psychedelic Shack . ''	-1
Have n't heard this yet , but since Stewart no longer considers recording anything but covers albums , why make the effort to listen before reviewing ? Seriously folks , this is Rod the Mod 's SIXTH-STRAIGHT album of cover tunes , which takes `` resting on your laurels '' to a whole new level . Rote renditions of classic songs are the bread and butter of the American Idol phenomenon , but there was a time when Stewart 's pipes were responsible for the CREATION of some of the finest classics in all of popular music ; now , he 's reduced to crooning alongside American Idol cast-offs and singing songs that made OTHER people famous . A waste .	-1
... if you are looking for what Stewart can do with soul , r n b , or blues , steer clear of this . Hie ye back to Jeff Beck - Truth ( which could have been Led Zep or bigger but for the egos ) , or any of Stewart 's first four solo records . On this disc , Stewart looks like Linda McCartney and sounds worse . His hot legs are loaded with varicose veins and he 's got a wad of cellulose in his credibility that will get you limp in a heartbeat . This is as bad as Sinatra singing `` Something . ''	-1
Honestly , there just are n't many good songs out there on radio so far this year , Unfortunately , there are songs that just are n't very strong . That comes through with newcomer La Roux and their techno song Bulletproof . The song honestly was n't a very strong song at all . It felt not to be very weak , it was a mixture of the voice of Justin Bieber meets the intimacy of Erasure . I really was honestly very dissapointed with the song . It actually was not one of the best songs I 've heard recently on radio . Hopefully , the next time I hear a techno-styled song , I can hear something a bit more authentic that is better than being bulletproof.Song : D-	-1
For starters , if I listen to hip hop , it 's usually underground hip hop because of the diverse lyrics and incredible beats . I decided to give in and listen to this mainstream crap and see what it 's like . I was right , lyrically , these guys have no originality and are probably high as a kite when writing these crappy lyrics . Their beats are good and not boring but this may as well be an instrumental album . These guys can not produce lyrics that make sense . All they do us cuss every other word ( and I 'm not at all offended by cussing as I use a lot myself ) , and they use the N word waaaaay too much .	-1
On his fourth album in his six year major label career , Young Jeezy delivers one of the worst albums of his carrier . Listening to this album , it seems like more of a contract fuilfment rather than an album that Jeezy would 've love to put out . Listening to the album , I did n't notice any passion or hungriness in the voice that Jeezzy is known for , and truth be told his rhyming comes off as lazy on TM 103 . Even though , Jeezy has appeared on numerous other rap and R & B singles such as `` Say I '' by Christina Milian , `` I 'm So Paid '' by Akon , `` Hard '' by Rihanna , and `` Love in This Club '' by Usher , the latter being a number one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 2008 , he never really had that crossover appeal that T.I. , Ludacris or Cockroach Face a.k.a . Lil Wayne had , and at this point in his carrier , Jeezy could n't afford to have a lackluster album , given the numerous delays . The only song of note are `` I Do '' featuring Jay-Z and Andr & eacute ; 3000 and `` OJ '' ( featuring Fabolous and Jadakiss ) . Pick up the Common album instead , which was also released today .	-1
Thank you for killing hip hop with your wack ass . Thank you so much . I really admire young jeezy for that . The music is sooo good . This album is a classic . Yeah right punk .	-1
Just not one of my favorites for an entire Cd of songs , but she still has an incredibly unique soulful sound !	-1
I thought this was a fairly average CD , with only a few exceptions . `` I Believe It To My Soul '' has a nice sax solo . Most of the songs were written by Joss Stone .	-1
Let me get one thing clear from the start : this is undoubtedly Joss Stone 's best album so far . The songs are okay and the musical backing is quite good.However ! Joss Stone sounds like Beyonc & eacute ; with a bad case of PMS - she sounds like she 's overwrought and having a `` hissy-fit '' in every song . Worse , she sounds like a Karaoke Blues singer - someone who is trying to impersonate someone else.I 've heard this album countless times in my workplace now . I am not sure what one is supposed to with it ? There is n't any great emotional depth to the album . You could n't dance to it . The lyrics of the songs are n't particularly insightful and the voice of Joss Stone is too distracted and distracting for the album to make pleasant background music.If you 're buying this CD for a child of sixteen years or under , note that the photo of Ms Stone smoking in the CD notes could be considered an unhealthy influence on children . Joss Stone , as a singer , is a complete idiot for smoking . Any singer who smokes is a damned fool .	-1
BIG DISSAPOINTMENT ! documentary = classic . doctors advocate = classic . lax = classic . the red album = big dissapointment.i cant believe it	-1
I am thoroughly disappointed with this album . Lady Antebellum seem energetic on TV but half the songs featured here are sooooo boring ; they lack real energy and fervor and are too soppy for my liking . The best song on here is the gorgeous and uptempo `` Run to You '' , which ironically is a bonus track ! What a disappointment !	-1
What is it with country music ? It is SO predictable , all sounds the same , and the voices do too . I thought I would give this album a chance since the title track was covered by Shakira and Keith Urban on American Idol in recent times . I have listened to the album 5 times and it is so boring . Not one track stands out as an amazing composition . In fact it sounds like Taylor Swift at times . It sounds like other country singers too . Why do people like this sort of music ? Country music is almost as bad as listening to rap .	-1
i really didnt like this one . theres only 2 or 3 songs on here that i liked , but the other ones just got boring to listen to after a while . i also dont like how dry the album sounds . sorry guys , maybe next time .	-1
This U2/coldplay ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a Target commercial . That 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy Target commercial !	-1
. . .and it was called `` La Isla Bonita '' by Madonna and `` Do n't Turn Around '' by Ace of Base . I have both songs on MP3 as well as `` Alejandro . '' So I guess this is the new thing now : combine 2 or more songs from back in the day , add your own insipid lyrics to it , and -Wala ! - a `` new '' `` original '' hit song ! Why would I pay any money for that ? What a rip off !	-1
There is no question that sometimes there can be too much exposure of an artist , that it does honestly feel like it can be more tiresome and bothered than it really was before . That honestly is the case with Lady Gaga . She has had so much overexposure , that it feels like the organic appeal of her songs has honestly lost their welcome . That honestly is the case with her latest song Alejandro , from The Fame Monster . I really did n't find the some to be anything really special nor strong . It really felt like she was taking the page from Madonna with Gag 's take on style of La Isla Bonita . Sadly for Lady Gaga , the song really is n't a definitive song for her . I think she really should try and give her fans absolutely something new , and go away for awhile . Alejandro did n't have the spanish guitar worth singing to.Song : D+	-1
Old , but it is one of the originals and so it is good dance music as well as sing along .	-1
I recently got a copy of the latest BT album These Hopeful Machines from my library . I never been so bored to death by his music than I have been with These Hopeful Machines . I really dislike it when artists feel they need to make a double album thus the case with BT and his latest effort . I felt like a lot of the beats were regurgitated and made the songs sounds so much the same . In fact I felt like I was listening to the same songs over and over again with and without vocals . I certainly liked the vocal contributions by Kirsty Hawkshaw and Rob Dickinson but even their vocals could n't save the weak material that BT composed . I really wanted to like the album but I just ca n't .	-1
I thought this would be right up my alley & with all the raves I was hoping this might be something I could become addicted to for awhile . Unfortunately it missed the mark for me . In fact I found the whole thing a bit pretentious , the lyrics were trite and a lot of the musical elements sounded shiny , yet bland and underwhelming.There is absolutely no need for it to be a two disc set , as each of the twelve songs could have been cut in half and would probably have had twice the impact . Each songs is too repetitive , there are not enough variation and new ideas to justify the length of each song.For example , I did enjoy A Million Stars the first couple times I heard it , but the third time it wore out its welcome halfway through . The song consists of the standard trance chick voice cooing `` You 'll feel love again '' for twelve solid minutes over track that was okay , but nothing great . Again it would have been a pretty good tune at half the length.This album might be best suited as pretty cool , hip background noise for a house party , and it 's not bad as ipod yard work & working out tunes . But I just do n't think it rewards close listening at all .	-1
I never listened to Johnny Cash before in my life but after hearing `` Ai n't No Grave '' on the WWE over and over , I decided to buy this album . I did n't know what to expect so my hopes were n't high . I can listen to all the songs but only three really stood out to me , `` Ai n't No Grave '' , `` Redemption Day '' and `` Satisfied Mind '' . Everything else just went in one ear and out the other . Nothing special .	-1
This may be one of the safest albums that 's come out in 2010 . The song titles are more risky than any of the music on this thing . It also does n't help considering the people behind it and their bodies of work ; there 's obviously Danger Mouse 's work , and also the latest Shins album , Wincing the Night Away , which is quite risky and experimental ( well , risky and experimental for The Shins ' standards ) . The duo seem afraid to try anything to spice up the music . I 'm not saying an album with James Mercer as a primary songwriter needs to be sprawling and abrasive , but you can only be so pleasant until you get boring . With this album , that happens about a minute into The High Road , and it never gets up throughout the whole album . It does n't demand your attention in any way , it barely even asks kindly for your attention . With that , this thing is n't terrible , but I 'd be lying if I did n't say it 's blank as a piece of paper . Like a plain salad with no dressing.The music , for the most part , is like the album cover . An enclosed , safe world with a window opening that allows you to peek inside . If only there was actually something going on in that world .	-1
It happens to a lot artists : They make a little money and move to L.A. ( or New York or Berlin ) and start hanging out in night clubs and in the midst of some late night partying they decide it would be a great idea to make some music that resembles the crap that 's thumping out of the ( lcd ) sound system . I 'm not saying that 's what happened to James Mercer , only that it sounds like it did.I want to like this cd , I really do , and it 's not terrible , but it 's not good either . Forgettable and dull are the first words that come to mind . Then again , I just read it hit # 7 on the album charts so what do I know ?	-1
First off , `` Electic ladyland '' was remastered for a 3rd time in 1997 and by the Estate of Jimi Hendrix , the brought in no other than the iconic Eddie Kramer ( who was the original engineer and produced much of Jimi 's original recordings ) plus they said on the 1997 remasters to have used the original mix-down tracks , I mean why 13 years later do we all a sudden need a new re-master ? Jimi has been `` remastered '' now so many times its a joke ! The catalog first came out on CD in 1990 on reprise records and they sounded like shiet ! Then they were very quickly re-mastered , actually within just months of their intitial release , they were deemed so horrible that they were quickly remastered and resold with just a small sticker on the box ( they had CD 's in long narrow boxes then ) the sticker just said `` remaster '' . This wasnt a true remaster but a quicky job using some system called `` sonic solutions '' , a way to remove static and such from the songs , but thats about it , but still big improvment . Also to be noted , Electric ladyland was originally released as a 2 CD set , the remaster changes it to 1 CD . Then in 1993 when Alan Douglas moved to the MCA label , they were agian re-mastered and given new CD covers ( dumb idea ) they all looked liked the `` Voodoo Soup '' ill fated CD cover . Those were true remasters and said to use the original mater tapes . Then in 1997 Al and Janie Hendrix wins there lawsuit over Alan Douglass and all the CD 's were once again remastered , just 2 stupid years later ! The gimmick this time was they went back to the original mix down tracks and remastered from those plus as well as brought back the original artwork . Then now they move to sony/legacy and what do they do ... .. ? ? ? REMASTER the songs ... ... get real ! Then after all that is said ... .++ PLUS I can say this : VOODOO CHILD ( Slight return ) is STILL NOT remastered correctly ! I have this on the original Reprise records vinyl . Voodoo Child starts out with a `` hum '' or `` buzz '' in the background , prob from Jimi 's amp and it starts out in the left speaker and comes into both speakers within 4 seconds , the buzz tho is heard until the song kicks in after the intro.The song does NOT fade at all but sounds more like the tape running out . Now this song even had 1 more remaster ( if you can believe that ! ) In 1985 reprise released `` Kiss the Sky '' a greatest hits and was the very first album to have remastered Jimi songs on it and I first noticed this botch back then , infact the song fades out early and is a few seconds shorter than the original mix put out in 1968 . Let me hear it the way Jimi approved it in 1968 with all it 's inperfections.Im just sick of record companies making a huge splash over remastering , you listen to this and listen to the 1997 remaster ... ... the diff is well ... ... you cant tell . many have said these are the same 1997 remasters bogusily being resold as new , whereas some say they are new ... .whatever the case , its not justifying buying the new cd ... ..or with the crumy DVD promo film you get with it . Why didnt they throw in the 70 min DVD of the making of Electric ladyland ? Na , they want you to buy that as well .	-1
When it has came down to Miley Cyrus , she honestly has n't been as driven as being so much of a tween act . With her latest single , Party In The U.S.A. , from her Time Of Our Lives EP , is n't really a interesting song . She honestly has been a bit overdone with her music . Sadly , I was n't very thrilled with the song after awhile . It has recently gotten very tiring after awhile . While Miley may have grown herself out of her Hannah Montana role , unfortunately after The Climb , she has n't fully grown up musically . Hopefully , with her next full-length record or song that comes out , Miley can prove to have a much more driven song . This Party In The U.S.A. has gotten to be a bit overdone for me.Song : D+	-1
The reason cited in the email was that it was `` spiteful '' . i am only giving an honest opinion . Her music stinks like a monkey 's anus . I remember she appeared on Oprah once with Joan Jett . Oprah only asked Miley some bland , talk show host type , inane questions and did n't even pay attention to Joan Jett , a true rock n roll legend . Miley is n't worthy of lickin Joan Jett 's rock n roll boots . the song is moderately annoying , so i gave it an extra star as my one star stuff is the really annoying crap .	-1
i used to like this song a little bit , but then it got really overplayed and it got really annoying .	-1
Spent 'almost 2 million ' to make a 'quality product ' ? I dont think so..I hope not . This thing is awash with out of contol effects that obliturate whatever actual music , ( however bad ) may be on here : Swirling , distorted , arbitrary noises throughout..they seem like mistakes , but they were left in , so what 's going on ? Perhaps it took such drastic measures to hide whatz-er-names ' voice , or to hide how blatently her voice was processed to be in tune . Do we all understand what 'Autotune ' is ? : It 's a voice loaded into a keyboard , played by a keyboard player . The melodic choices are n't made by the singer..the rhythmic choices are n't made by the singer..and pitch problems are digitally corrected , ( more accurately , digitally re-created : You could TALK your part , and still be singing through the keyboard ) . This girl uses it so much , so mechanically , that it has to be hidden in an ocean of distracting noise . This is 'wow ' bad .	-1
When it does come to to Heidi Montag , the so-called star of The Hills on MTV , it seems more as if she wants to be famous for nothing , just like Paris Hilton . Sad , but honestly no doubt about it true . SO when it feels like she has the independence to do everything , it feels like a big fat train wreck . That comes with the feeling of trying to be a wannabe singer with her debut record , Superficial . The songs here are just a bunch of wasted trash on the voice , and spending time with the ears listening to the record . Each track like the so-called dance rhythms of Fanatic , to the lackluster feelings of One More Drink , all the way to the end with Love It Or Leave It , is just all about being within dance music . Unfortunately , it is a displeasure at all from start to finish . It is such a shame that Heidi wanst to deliver as a singer , by thinking she is now trying to be like Britney Spears , and the rhythms of her record Circus . Yet , it feels like Heidi Montag is now trying to be the next Paris Hilton instead . I remember how disgraceful Paris 's record was a few years ago , and how bad her songs were , and now I found a record that is even worse than what Ms. Hilton 's record was . Do n't even bother getting Heidi 's Superficial at all . You 're just wasting all the time in the world ! ! ! ! ! Album Cover : D-Songs : F-Price : FMastering : FOverall : F-	-1
I 'll download the few songs I want with the talent singers . F ! fergie WTF SLASH ! ! ! This album is basically a collection of artists feat . Slash playing their own style of songs ... ..WTF ! Slash is getting desperate . Not a good release .	-1
When Slash left Guns N ' Roses in 1996 , many GNR fans have impatiently waited and demanded another `` Appetite for Destruction '' . When Slash , Duff and Matt Sorum got together with Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland to form the supergroup Velvet Revolver , there was a sigh of relief among rock fans that they will get the music that they desired for . Finally , a real hard rock band in the age of Creed and Nickelback . Of course , never mind the fact thatsome of therock bandswere alreadydelivering thatkind of musicat the time . Apparently , those guysweren'thard rockenough for these fans.Unfortunately , Velvet Revolver proved to be a failure - uninspired music , lackluster songwriting and a strong lack of chemistry between the frontman and the music players . It did n't take a brain surgeon to know that having Scott Weiland play with Slash was like havingChris Cornell work with Timbaland . So in the span of four years , Weiland was no longer in the band , everyone pursued solo projects and Velvet Revolver went into hiatus , still without a frontman to this day . The saviors of rock n ' roll , ladies and gentlemen.But shortly after Weiland 's departure , Slash made an announcement that he and his friends were going to create a good , old-fashioned rock n ' roll album a la `` Appetite '' , one that he was unable to make during his final days with Axl Rose . And since Axl did n't deliver that kind of album , many fans point their hopes on Slash to deliver a worthy successor to that towering masterpiece of hard rock . It also helped that Slash recruited some of the best and best-loved icons of rock , - the lead singer of Motorhead , the prince of darkness Ozzy Osbourne , the alternative rock gods Chris Cornell and Dave Grohl , the godfather of punk Iggy Pop - some newcomers such as Black Eyed Peas vocalist Fergie , Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine and Avenged Sevenfold singer M. Shadows - and , most of all , the three former members of GNR . Seriously , how could it all go wrong ? Well , everything - music , lyrics , creativity , production . Moreso than the Velvet Revolver albums , there is not an ounce of inspiration and creativity in these fourteen lackluster tracks . Most of these songs are boring rehashes of 80s hard rock cliches , some that were best forgotten . How depressing is it to hear the likes of Ozzy Osbourne , Iggy Pop , Kid Rock and Chris Cornell waste their considerable gifts in singing such hackneyed , trite lyrics ? How discouraging is it that given the talent involved , you 're left feeling empty and unfulfilled ? Think about it for a second - you have an album by Slash that consists of Dave Grohl , Iggy Pop , Ozzy Osbourne , Chris Cornell , Kid Rock , Lemmy , Fergie and the three former members of Guns N ' Roses - and it still blew . Imagine `` A Momentary Lapse of Reason '' replacing David Gilmour with Slash and you pretty much got the picture.I wanted so badly to like this album , but I came out of it feeling short-changed . When not even Izzy Stradlin could take a dull hard rocker like `` Ghosts '' and bring it to life , you know you 're in trouble . Unfortunately , that 's just the tip of the iceberg . Most of the other tracks are guilty of bad quality , starting with `` Crucify the Dead '' , which may rank as one of Ozzy Osbourne 's worst vocal performances . A lifeless power ballad where the Ozzman takes a blatant shot at Axl Rose ( `` A gun jammed with a rose '' . How original ) , `` Crucify the Dead '' is proof that the Prince of Darkness and sentimentality do not mix . The next track `` Beautiful Dangerous '' , featuring Fergie , is better , but not much . Fergie is in good form , but she 's no match for the song 's ridiculous lyrics ( `` And that 's when I spin on the pole/Now my head 's exploding and your gun is loaded/So I 'm guessing I 'm on a roll '' What the hell ? ) and sludge of processed guitar riffs and bland keyboards . I thought this was a good , old-fashioned rock n ' roll album ? The rest of the tracks are hardly `` Smooth '' with Rob Thomas . `` Back From Cali '' is cut-rate AC/DC rip-off featuring the ever-derivative Myles Kennedy sounding like a haphazard cross of Bruce Dickinson , Geddy Lee and Robert Plant . `` I Hold On '' , feat . Kid Rock , is a retread of far superior Kid Rock ballads such as `` Lonely Road of Faith '' , `` Picture '' and `` Cold and Empty '' . `` Promise '' , feat . Chris Cornell , sounds like a weakly crafted demo from the Soundgarden basement . and `` Nothing to Say '' begins as a promising Sabbath-like epic , but disintegrates into a tedious speed metal track featuring forced singing by the usually talented M. Shadows.The most tolerable songs on this album are `` Gotten '' feat . Adam Levine ; `` Doctor Alibi '' feat . Lemmy ; and the instrumental `` Watch This Dave '' , with appearances by Duff McKagan and drummer Dave Grohl . The former is a warm love song where Adam Levine brings life to half-baked lyrics and the latter two tracks have a momentum and fervent energy that is sadly missing from the rest of the album . Depressingly , these songs would be considered expendable in these artists ' music catalogs.The greatest disappointment , however , is the production . For an album aspiring to be like `` Appetite for Destruction '' , I have never heard such a clean , polished sound . If it was raw , sloppily produced a la `` New York Dolls '' , `` Raw Power '' or `` In Utero '' , perhaps the album 's music would probably sound better than it is , but the refined Eric Valentine and Big Chris Flores production really suck the life out of these songs , making the songs ' deficiencies more blatant and obvious.As stated earlier , I wanted to like this album a lot ; my love for Guns N ' Roses is immeasurable . Unfortunately , albums like `` Slash '' prove that what these band members could n't do alone what they did together . Despite the star-studded cast , `` Slash '' failed to make a dent at the Billboard charts and the gap of talent between Slash and Axl more obvious . Slash is an extremely talented guitarist , but without a songwriter like Axl or even Izzy , he 's lost in making hackneyed mediocrities like this.If Slash wants to get cozy with his buddies and play uninspired rehashes of `` Nightrain '' , `` Sweet Child O'Mine '' or `` Locomotive '' , then he 's welcome to it . Unfortunately , this album will only serve as an unintentional reminder that no matter what kind of person he was , Axl Rose was clearly the writer.Far from being `` Supernatural '' , Slash 's solo album is a super bore.Strong recommendation to avoid .	-1
Coheed and Cambria 's neverending saga set to prog-rock music that sounds more and more like Rush gets more and more annoying each album .	-1
I 've read a lot of positive reviews of this album , claiming that Coheed had ripped off Rush and Iron Maiden in their previous records , and that this may be the most `` them '' album yet . If that 's the case , then I think Coheed should go back to ripping off Rush and Iron Maiden.Coheed are very talented , and frustratingly so . If anything , the first two albums are two of the greatest achievements in Prog Rock if you ask me . Then their third album came ad it was somewhat quite middling . A lot of good on there , a lot of decent , a lot of bad . Then the fourth , No World For Tomorrow ... I do n't think there were any memorable tunes on that disc . OK , I Liked the title track and Gravediggers and Gunslingers . And On The Brink was good too.Well , with this album , Josh is gone . In comes Chris Pennie , an extraordinarily talented drummer . A nice bloke too , I met him back in October . Also returning is the lack of any memorable songs . None of the tunes on this disc would rate above a 2/5.I actually do n't like any of the songs of this disc . As I stated , the highest I can give any of the songs is a 2/5 . Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it . The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live , and even that track sounds out of place , like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed . The best tune on the album , This Shattered Symphony , Has an amazing opening and chorus , but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus . Same thing with Guns of Summer , despite the awesome drumming . The Broken starts off awesome but quickly falls flat on it 's face . World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying , and threw them into one song.I ca n't even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut , with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy . The intro to In The Flame of Error and the chorus rule but everything else is ruined by what ruins the whole album- Coheed having interesting parts of songs , then suddenly going off into a wild tangent . Hence the `` pretentious '' part . They 're trying too hard.Then of course , what should be The highlight ofthe album is actually their worst song EVER , and may even be one of the worst songs I 've ever heard . It is essentially just noodling around for 7 minutes . Not even the bizarre and creepy coda at the end could redeem it . Here 's the thing guys . I love heavy metal . I love electronica . I love Prog . I do n't love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once , thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.Also , the lyrics are disastrous . I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating . Here they 've clearly taken a step back in that department . `` Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' ugh , seriously ? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.Look , Coheed are much better than this . They have TALENT . They can actually write tunes . They can explore their creativity in ways no other modern band can . But this album just bores me . I sincerely hope they can make a comeback with their next disc .	-1
I 'm very embarrassed to have purchased this cd . I heard Congratulations on a movie soundtrack and found it a bit captivating . And I wanted to support a fellow Memphian . But this is just garbage from one end to the other . Lots of noise . Very childish and cheesy lyrics . I kept forwarding to the next song until it , and my suffering , was over .	-1
Is it just me , but during most of the songs you find yourself thinking , `` that keyboard is ruining the song . '' Maybe they 'll put it all together for an entire album , which `` Congratulations , '' and `` Someone 's Missing '' suggest .	-1
This is pretty bad which is a shame because I enjoyed their first effort.I 've not much to say on this one besides it does absolutely nothing at all for me .	-1
I 've loved Rufus since his self-titled debut came out back in '98 . I 'm also a huge fan of artists who are willing to `` bare it all '' by forsaking all the flash and dazzle that good production brings with it . Acoustic tracks are sometimes far superior than their studio counterparts . Just look at Tori Amos , Alanis Morissette , Rufus , and others.My problem with this album is not in the lack of orchestral accompaniment or even in the lack of backing vocals . The idea of getting back to the basics and giving us nothing more than the piano and his voice is a spectacular one.Where Rufus falls short on this album is in the songwriting . In part , I 've loved Rufus ' work because of how wonderfully he can craft a melody and spin words cleverly . But here , none of the melodies soar and few of the lyrics move me ( excluding the Shakespeare , obviously ) .Although most of the album , I 'm assuming , is meant to come across as mellow and relaxing , I find it all to be less relaxing and more boring.The two strongest songs on the album are `` Sonnet 20 '' and `` Les feux d'artifice t'appellent . '' The latter is easily the greatest accomplishment on the album . Rufus , in a stroke of genius , uses the piano to make the sound of the fireworks referenced in the title . Honestly , that was brilliant.I do n't doubt that Rufus is capable of wowing us with nothing more than piano and vocals . He 's done it before . Think of `` The Art Teacher '' from Want Two . Just piano and Rufus , but the melody is stunning and the lyrics are clever . I saw Rufus open for Tori Amos once , and he sat up there with no backing vocals and no other instruments besides his keyboard . He sounds better that way on some songs than the flashier studio tracks.But on `` Lulu , '' Rufus disappoints .	-1

Oh boy , where to begin ? Did somebody get lonely making something akin to music and not getting any pats on the back from the spray-on-hair whizzes planted behind the superdesks ? Perhaps a codependent stray met his puppy-love match and la-la land ensued , what with the brains being ejaculated all over the place in a fury of white-hot resignation.I almost decided to give this abortion of blues-infused smut five stars , nearly convincing myself that it could n't seem this bad if it were n't purposely tongue-in-cheek , but then I remembered that Grandma used to fart directly on her hubby 's face for no other reason than that it asserted who was the boss of their relationship . Baboons flinging poo in a territorial tizzy tend to get their own space.Which means the fates get the last laugh again . It merely puts The Black Keys back at square one : When you 're still -- or back -- in your basement studio , unadultured by sex for hire , money for nothing , there are no limits , the world is in your palm.But who cares about that anymore ? I need to get rich quick and I need my Twitter army pronto . I need to make toast flecked with golden nuggets of awesomeness . Can I buy that in a bottle ? Of course , junior . Just hire the right coach . Or fire the wrong coach . Just sit back . Are you pretty ? Good , we 'll squeeze a few years out of you before we send you to the slaughterhouse .	-1
I gave these guys a chance because I 'd heard `` Tighten Up '' at a pub in London , England . I loved its catchy , bluesy , bar band type sound . A few days after I got back to Canada , I searched out this album and bought it , because I really liked then sound.Honestly , I 've listened to this disc 5 times and I still cant get into it . Nearly all the tracks sound the same . By about track 6 , I 'm still reminiscing on the awesomeness of Tighten Up . These guys are indeed talented , but by god , there 's little to no variety in the songs on this album , I liked Never Gon na Give You Up also , but that was it.Maybe I need to hear the bands other stuff , but I just ca n't get into this disc .	-1
I 've been waiting for the reinvention for sometime , and knew he was not the blues purist he maintained . Now we get the blues heavy funk of T-Rex or James Blood Ulmer . Gone , however you might feel , are Dan Auerbach 's solo wankings . It 's heavy handed production which can not mask limited vocal posturing . If your like me , you still long to see Hound Dog Taylor live.P.S . If the entire album was , `` too afraid to love you , '' it might suggest a career change . Auerbach would have made a great sideman .	-1
Things have become truly desperate and I have now resorted to the deception of safely disabling my daughters stereo in order not to be tortured by yet another full play of this diabolical album from the horrible and monotonous `` mockney '' whine of Kate Nash . The damn thing has been on repeat for weeks and as far as I can tell its only redeeming feature would be as a form of `` white noise '' to torment prisoners accused of heinous and despicable crimes . While I have never held in high store Ms Lily Allen she is clearly a veritable poet laureate in comparison to the pre pubescent rhymes of Ms Nash . A sample for your delectation is drawn from `` Doo wah do '' where the language of Shakespeare is reduced to couplets of such sophistication that `` Everyone thinks that girls a lady , but I do n't , I think that girls shady '' . Bloody hell as they say in French and proof were it needed that an A Level `` English Lit '' is not the force it once was.Ms Nash also concludes this `` magnum hopeless '' with a song entitled `` I hate seagulls '' . I will readily admit that I share with our BRIT school prodigy an intense dislike of these belligerent vertebrates from Hades particularly when one of these sky borne thugs stole half a bag of chips from my hands at a notable English seaside resort in recent months . That said were it to come down to a straight choice of Ms Nash 's singing or a recording of one of these wretched birds squawking for a full 40 minutes it would be the feathery opportunistic scavenger that gets my vote every time . Ms Nash may be fool enough to think that `` Mr Best Friend is you '' but unfortunately for her we are allowed to choose our own friends and in this humble abode she would be turned away at the door with a flea in her ear .	-1
Better than 'Ridin ' Solo ' by Jason Derulo , Usher has another hit . But that 's not saying much . I think both of these songs went to number one at one point but boy did they not deserve it ! There are tons of less dumbed-down songs that could have made it to the top that are great tunes , but just are n't as overexposed . Sad , really.This is sort of a club song , but not a typical one . It really can make you dance . And the kids seem to really , really love it ( I mean the younger ones , I 'm 25 ) , but I ca n't stand this horrible song . `` Oh , oh , oh , oh . Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh my God . `` Very annoying.One of Usher 's worst songs ever ! 2.5 stars .	-1
`` OMG '' tops the list as one of the most annoying songs of 2010 . Along with the vocal stylings of Justin Bieber and Ke $ ha , as well as Katy Perry 's bland Californian comeback , it 's a song that deserves to be stashed in the forgettable bin . `` OMG '' brings together the talents of the handsome Usher , as well as Will I Yam of the Black Eyed Peas . The lyrics are repetitious to the point of being ... painful . Is this song banned by the Geneva Convention for being cruel and unusual ? `` Oh my gosh , I 'm so in love '' Usher sings over and over and over and over and over ... then it devolves into some cheerleading chant . It would be as if one of Ke $ ha 's songs managed to segue into `` Ave Maria '' as sung by consecrated nuns . It does n't make sense . It 's too bad I have this song memorized . It 's THAT bad . Raymond should n't be pitting himself against RaymondRaymond v. Raymond -- but against bad music .	-1
There is no question that Usher had undergone a lot of strife the past few years from his marriage to Tameka Foster ending , to him losing his idol Michael Jackson and singing with grief at his memorial service , to the less-than-dynamic reaction to his tracks from his latest album Raymond Vs. Raymond from his earlier singles like Papers and There Goes My Baby . Nevertheless , he is still trying to make it all his own , and his latest single O.M.G . which he teams up with Will.I.Am . from The Black Eyed Peas feel like Usher is trying to spike up the magic The Black Eyed Peas caught last year with I 've Got ta Felling . It sadly feels like it is a less than strength that should be strong for Usher to deliver . I was n't very surprised with the song , it felt like it was watered down and less than organic for his calibur . Usher should try and show his rhythm to a better crowd that feels like his own and not a mimic , and that is not a confession.Song : D+	-1
Just saw Vince Neil live at the M3 concert near Baltimore . He can not sing worth a darn anymore . He is totally done . He had to have his guitarist sing songs for him , and they blew him away . That being said , this CD is way produced to cover up just how bad he is now . He 's a Whore done live was awful ... I was embarrassed for him . Poor Vince , lived the fast life and is now just too slow to rock .	-1
I 've listened to this cd many times ; I think that this album suffers for a big lack on new ideas , and these songs ( or at least many of them ) are closer to commercial contemporary R & B , and are not similar to the glorius Incognito albums of the 90 's ; there 's not sense of rhythm , I ca n't find here the groove and funk that made their past albums great ; the special guests here ( Mario Biondi and Chaka Khan , among the others ) ca n't elevate this music to the glorius past of the group .	-1
ughthis is more general than just talking about this specific album , but overall this album made me even more realize that eminem needs to:1 ) stop screaming2 ) stop singing3 ) stop talking about how everyone hates him , the price of fame , blah blah4 ) start rapping in his old rap voice from SSLP and MMLP5 ) appease his core fans that were there from the beginning with the same witty lyricism he was first known for . the most important word there being & # 34 ; witty & # 34 ; 6 ) get some hotter beats that are n't made by him or dre ( yes i said it ) , and that fit his style7 ) stop trying to be a technical whiz at rapping and go back to the witty content that i liked before ( see number 5 ) i do n't know what else to say , i felt like i wasted my money on this .	-1
I used to like Eminem , but after hearing this im not a fan of him . It was June 18th,2010 , i just took my science final so i had a half day of school . I was watching the fuse eminem takeover and i saw the video for not afraid , it was cool so i went to fye and bought the cd . I thought it would be great but was i wrong ! ! ! ! 1 . `` Cold Wind Blows '' - okay opening , kindda funny ( 4 out of 5 ) 2 . `` Talkin ' 2 Myself '' ( featuring Kobe ) - okay track , not a fan of kobe or the lyrics . ( 3 out of 5 ) 3 . `` On Fire '' - one of the good songs ( 4 Out of 5 ) 4 . `` Wo n't Back Down '' ( featuring Pink ) - not a fan of this song , i hated pink 's part ! ( 2 out of 5 ) 5 . `` W.T.P . `` - okay song , i liked it ( 3 out of 5 ) 6 . `` Going Through Changes '' - another song about his daughter . ( 2 out of 5 ) 7 . `` Not Afraid '' - i used to like it but it gets annoying hearing it all over the radio and s*** ( 3 out of 5 ) 8 . `` Seduction '' - hated it ( 1 out of 5 ) 9 . `` No Love '' ( featuring Lil Wayne ) - this song is getting a one from me because wayne is in it ( 1.5 out of 5 ) 10 . `` Space Bound '' - stupid song , i hate the music video and chorus ( 1.5 out of 5 ) 11 . `` Cinderella Man '' - Great song . ( 5 out of 5 ) 12 . `` 25 to Life '' - kind of boring song ( 1 out of 5 ) 13 . `` So Bad '' - only song produced by dre , so it has to be great ( 4.5 out of 5 ) 14 . `` Almost Famous '' - okay song , not the best ( 2 out of 5 ) 15 . `` Love the Way You Lie '' ( featuring Rihanna ) - my god i hate this song so freakin much , rhianna sucks , the beat sucks and the lyrics suck , worst song on the album ( 1 out of 5 ) 16 . `` You 're Never Over '' - R.I.P Proof ( 4 out of 5 ) 17 . `` Untitled '' ( hidden track ) - good song ( 3 out of 5 ) so in my opinion i didnt like this album , i thought em sould out but after hearing hell the sequal i still have hope	-1
I 'm a die hard hip hop fan ever since the days of Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer ... and let me tell you one thing people if there was ever a rapper that could compare to the God-like Fred Durst , it would be Eminem ! Generic fruity loop beats , lame lyrics , and genric song titles ... what more could you ask for ! ? Oh and the catchy chorus in `` not afraid '' is soooooooooo unique and awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Avoid poser rap like Jedi Mind Tricks , Non-Phixion , Vinnie Paz solo stuff , Necro , Ill Bill , Immortal Technique , 2Pac , Bone Thugs , NWA , Slick Rick , Grandmaster Flash and RUN DMC ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Stick with the god of all Rap Metal Fred Durst , Linkin Park , Puff Daddy , and Eminem.peace out thugz ! ! ! ! !	-1

Wow.Seal is absolutely one of my favorite artists . He 's had highs ( his debut , System ) and not-so-highs ( Human Beings and 4 ) . But 6 is a whole new arena . It 's dreadful.I 'm not sure what was going on here , but I can only imagine he experienced some kind of financial stress or panic , and met with a bunch of suits to strategize on making lots of money with a quickness . Sad to say , that 's not how art works.So , what 's the result ? One song that sounds like classic Seal ( The Way I Lie ) , another song with a killer intro ( If I 'm Any Closer ) , and a reasonable b-side ( The Weight of My Mistakes ) . Otherwise , it 's 100 % ballads that suck , the musical equivalent of tofu . And Seal knows it - in the video of the making of the album , he says this is his best album yet ( every artist says that every time ) and you can just see his nose growing.Seal wants to more exotic travel , buy some new luxury cars , and live like a rock star . That 's the sole purpose of this album . But the eclectic creativity of System is long gone , and the song writing is below that of the worst elevator music . This is just aural filler for CPAs and yuppies to host baby showers and provide inoffensive background music for staid corporate events . Even the lyrics suck ( ? ! ) because they are so direct . Direct is n't interesting , it 's boring and talentless . The best lyrics are veiled and open to interpretation , as Seal has done so well in the past.But Seal did this on purpose . System proved he can still write great melodies , and is ( was ? ) willing to dare to grow and try new collaborators . That album was 'amazing ' , start to finish ( well , except that duet with this wife ) . If 6 had been his debut album , it would have tanked and been his last.But since this album sold well , at least in some 'markets , ' we might get more of this tripe . But I hope on 7 , Seal re-COMMITS to being an artist , does his great work , and is confident the money will follow .	-1
Unfortunately this is the lamest SEAL cd to date . Not bad but nothing here really grabs you like his early work . I would n't say Foster is a bad producer and you need Trevor back but I CAN say I enjoyed his work with Trevor more than his later , 5 minute song , commercial feeling cd 's . I just enjoy his song writing about other things in life than his personal love stories , which are fine . I just wo n't listen to this cd as much as the others .	-1
I am a completist of most rock bands formed in the 70 's , and Heart is one of those bands . First of all after listening to their new CD `` Red Velvet Car '' twice , hardly any of the songs struck me , and that 's too bad because they had 6 years to come up with a great rock record and they struck out . This is no `` Dreamboat Annie '' , `` Little Queen '' or `` Bebe Le Strange '' , it might be even worse than `` Jupiters Darling '' . Tracks worthy of this CD in my opinion : `` Saffronia 's Mark '' and `` Death Valley '' . The Rocker `` WTF '' just does n't resonate here . Unfortunately this will just be filed under H in my CD collection and just sit there and gather dust , except when I wan na record one of these tracks .	-1
I rented this from my local library after completely giving up on Heart after the Brigade debacle but after listening to old Heart they dragged me back in.. the main problem with this disc is that it has nothing about it that stands out . It 's about as mundane and lifeless as I 've ever heard . WTF is catchy , Wheels is ok , but does Ann and Nancy actually listen to what they record ? This is as by the numbers and ineffectual as it comes . If it was n't Heart it would be one star .	-1
I did not buy this ! Take it off and I want my money back . Christmas music again . Are you kidding me ? This is not how I want to start my day !	-1
I have been a fan of of Montreal for eight years . Finding them was one of the most exciting musical finds in my life . I own all of their albums . I like some of them more than others . But I will not be buying this new album . It is bland , horrible , and forced . It sounds like aweak uncle rock secretary booty shaking white man 's poor man 's P Funk . It is awful.I was not a fan of their middle period . ( The Bedside Drama : A Petite Tragedy-Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies ) It was ok , but too wordy . It was clever , but gave me a headache . Could n't listen to it for too long . I loved Cherry Peel and The Early 4 track recordings.Satanic Panic is their best album and Sunlandic Twins had some strong songs on it , but was weaker . When I first heard Hissing Fauna , I hated it . It was not the of Montreal I was used to . My wife and I went to see them in concert on this tour . ( We had seen them many times before and had always enjoyed them . ) She began to cry during the show and we left . She could n't take looking at Kevin . He upset her . He disgusted her . She felt sorry for his soul.That album finally grew on me . ( Not my wife though . ) Skeletal Lamping was weak , but there were moments of sweetness on it . I was hoping that False Priest would show him moving in another direction.It does n't . It 's one of the most disappointing albums I 've ever heard . It 's even hard for me to go back and listen to the other albums that I loved . Kevin makes me feel ill now . I keep picturing that dude in Silence of the Lambs dancing in his basement . That 's what Kevin is in my mind . I do not want to be part of his world.But more importantly ... The music is just bland.False Priest.Kevin , you are the False Priest.For those of you just discovering of Montreal try Cherry Peel , Early Four Track Recordings , The Bird Who Continues to Eat , and Satanic Panic.False Priest does not represent this band that was once great .	-1
Remember back when Blonde Redhead were a Velvet Underground lover 's dream band ? Back before the Yeah Yeah Yeah 's debut . Back before weird was normal . Remember how good Luv Machine was when it came out in 1998 ? It was almost as if someone threw Yo La Tengo , The Ex , Sonic Youth , The Pixies and Bjork in a blender . Twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace seemed so cool and wise , and when they stood on stage with Japanese singer Kazu Makino , there was nothing more New York . They were at once romantic and rocking - not an easy thing to do . They were the art stars back when we did n't call rockers art stars , making the scene as quietly as anyone of recent memory . Sexy , smart and creative , all three of 'em.I get it , bands change . That 's cool , but how a band like Blonde Redhead goes from experimental to promising and polished pseudo-prog to the so-called left field pop of their new record is beyond me . How can the band that made the Can-friendly In an Expression of the Inexpressible with Fugazi 's Guy Picciotto make Penny Sparkle , an indie-pop record for the Gaga Gag Generation ? I just do n't get it . I suppose many will call Penny some sort of Bjorkian hustle , but that just seems to obvious to me . Anyone who hears this record should be painfully aware of how hard the Redheads are trying to get some Pitchforkian-type love . You know , that sweet , fickle right now kind of love that the kids are so hot for in 2010.The one promising thing about this , the band 's eighth proper studio record in 15 years , is that it sees the trio again working to do something they 've not done before . The last two Blonde Redhead albums , 2004 's Misery Is a Butterfly and 2007 's 23 felt phoned in , especially when you consider how inventive they 'd been on their first five records . But , I suppose , with Penny Sparkle we do n't get a bad record , but we do n't really get a Blonde Redhead record . We get what feels like a Bjork-meets-Goldfrapp experimental version of chamber pop . It almost feels as if the Redheads made their album after watching Sophia Copolla 's Lost In Translation twelve times in a row . The vibe is still sexy , but the rock is gone . There 's atmosphere and mood , but it just does n't work as well . The dreamy tunes , like `` Love Or Prison , '' `` My Plants Are Dead '' and the uber-mellow - and Radiohead-friendly - title track are pretty great , but not quite good enough to make up for stinkers like `` Spain , '' `` Here Sometimes '' and the very Yeasayer-like `` Will There Be Stars . `` All that said , the record almost has the feel of a debut ; which I gather is the point . Let 's hope this mellow , guitar-absent , young-ear-loving version of one of the best NYC rock bands of the 90s is just a quick misstep . Their NYC Ghosts & Flowers , if you will . Because if this is the Blonde Redhead we have to look forward to , we may as well stick a fork in 'em . I only wish Blonde Redhead were big enough that this stinker of a record could kill off this tedious Modern Retro phase . Cause , damn , it 's getting old .	-1
As I lie here drinking myself to death , I reflect on all your ersatz misery . Here in my sumptuous penthouse suite , resting in my reverse-tanning bed , I look down on all of you . You with your clandestine puppy dog eyes -- twinkling , fading -- resigned to be indigent , unwilling to take a step toward the cold , dark precipice . I would feel sorry for you if my soul 's squalor was n't so complete , so very intense . This glowering dread like the devil 's frigid frock , black diamonds rushing down from my porcelain visage and all remains numb in this frost-flecked grave ... Sigh.Regardless , me and the boys have offered up another double fistful of love songs to cheer you up . Sorry we could n't come up with a clever name for the album , and sorry it sounds pretty much like our last three albums , except with much less pep . In fact , you might say we 're lately sounding more like The Editors than they sound like us . It 's kind of embarrassing , I suppose . But I 've been busy dating a lot of young models and there 's nothing particularly gloomy about that . Well , that 's not entirely true . It can be gloomy if you stick with them when they start doing heroin pretty heavy , but that 's why I said `` a lot of , '' because I just move on to the next one when that happens . It 's disgusting and I have no time for it . Not that I do n't have time for heroin , but I do n't like it when they start trying to horn-dog my stash is what I 'm really saying.What do you think of that album cover ? Did you notice how it 's the name of the band and the name of the album at the same time , but it 's not really because it 's been broken apart like a mirror ? Mirrors are the windows to the eyes or something like that . Actually , I just took a look at the cover up close . I 'm not sure if it really even spells Interpol . Wait , Interpol ? Is that what we 're calling ourselves ? Is n't that like some global police organization ? Why would you name yourself that ? I 'm confused . I get like this sometimes . The air gets thin way up here and I 'm fresh out of humpback caviar and the hotel manager just told me there 's no more of that vodka distilled from the tears of suffering Darfur babies left in stock . Super-sigh.Yours truly , DJ Fancypants	-1
It 's not a perfect album : the shaky bassist work ( departure of bassist Carlos Dengler ) on some of the album is sometimes confusing , some Songs rely more on chaotic shouting matches instead of exciting singing ( this due to the lack of an actual singer available ) and it 's just a little too long . But , these are tiny criticisms that do n't alter the fact that at its core , Interpol is nuts .	-1

I 've closely followed and loved Interpol 's early music since '02-'03 . I really do n't know why Paul and the gang are so uninspired . It seems they possibly tried to regain their `` Indie cred '' by going back to Matador for their latest self-titled release , but the album falls flat , fairly badly . Songs go nowhere , most of them are paced very slowly with Paul 's purposefully cryptic lyrics , but now , they 're all about girls and relationship drama ( targeting emo teens ? ) . Maybe it was the super model girlfriend ? ( ugh , cmon ) I do n't know , but I suppose there 's a reason Carlos left the band after recording this ... he knew the music was bad and that their light had apparently gone out , starting with OLTA , which was a better album actually in my opinion ( and is n't saying a whole lot ultimately ) .In fact many of these songs sound like rejects from the `` Julian Plenti '' album , sans one or two tracks . There is n't even a song nearly as good as `` Games For Days '' on here . The songs seem half-baked and uninspired . I ca n't even go into them as they are almost all so utterly dull.I quite literally had to , for the first time with their music , force myself through their new album , and I had already heard/owned `` Lights '' and `` Barricade '' ( and they gave me the `` oh boy this is going to be a bummer album '' feeling immediately ) . The songs , again , go nowhere , seem uninspired , and are just plain boring , to sum it up.I do n't know what else to say , so I shortened this review , there 's no point in knocking someone when they 're down . Time for solo projects and shoot-off bands guys .	-1
I will admit I have only heard this album once so far , I listened to it on my way to work this morning . But holy cow I really hope this album is a grower becuase for me it was a borderline painful experience getting through the whole album . Interpol have been one of my favorite bands since they started and I love all their previous albums . Yes even `` Our love to admire '' which I feel is unfairly criticizez . I also loved Paul Banks solo album as well . But my initial feeling of this album is that it was very hard for me to enjoy . As far as I could tell this album is completely lacking catchy choruses ( just really repetative ones ) or enjoyable guitar arrangements of any sort . Now I am far from the type that wants things radio friendly , but sounded like maybe the most un-catchy batch of songs I have heard in a while . I guess it is kind of the aquivalent of like an abstract Sci-fi film that does n't make any sense , and is not very enjoyable , just somewhat interesting because it is so wierd and different from anything else . Obviously Interpol have always been kind of cold and distant sounding , because that is the type of music this band makes ( ex . Joy Division ) , but to me all their previous albums still had a pulse and a heartbeat . This one to me sounds dead on arrival . No emotion or feeling what so ever . And there are a couple of tracks that I thought were going to give me an aneurysm ... specifically the song `` Always Malaise '' , which in my opinion is one of the worst songs I 've heard in a while . Maybe I am being too harsh here , but I 'm not just trying to be a hater . But I was really looking forward to this album , and to only like maybe three songs out of the 10 is quite dissapointing . Then again maybe I should look at this in a Kid A kind of way and realize it is not meant to be enjoyed like a traditional album and try to appreciate it for what it is . Like I said in the beginning , I hope this is a grower . Here is the quick four star rating breakdown of how I feel about these songs:1 ) Success = 4/4 ( pretty good , sounds like old interpol and is more like what I wanted the whole album to sound like.2 ) Memory Serves = 3/4 ( Decent , but starting to drift into the tone deaf wasteland of the rest of the album ) 3 ) Summer Well = 1/4 ( I could find no enjoyment in this song whatsover ) 4 ) Lights = 4/4 ( Easily the best album on here , even if the guitar riff is extremely repetative . But sounds like the Interpol of old ) 5 ) Barricade = 2/4 ( Somewhat decent first single , but could not really find anything that makes it stand out as being Interpol ) 6 ) Always Malaise = 0/4 ( One of the worst songs ever . Eventually turns into the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard ) 7 ) Safe Without = 1/4 ( starts out okay , then goes downhill like the rest ) 8 ) Try it on = 3/4 ( The other song that I actually liked on here ) 9 ) All of the ways = 2/4 ( Decent but overall boring ) 10 ) The Undoing = 1/4 ( boring from the get-go )	-1
Bands use the self-titled album as a means of telling their fans that they 're going back to basics , that this album will rediscover what made the band great in the first place . That 's almost assuredly what Interpol wished to communicate by releasing a self-titled album after their critically derided Our Love to Admire . Unfortunately , despite whatever good intentions , Interpol 's latest fails to live up to the promise of their first two moody and exhilarating albums.Interpol starts off promising with `` Success , '' a song built almost entirely upon their muscular rhythm section . However , by the second song , `` Memory Serves , '' many of the album 's reoccurring weaknesses quickly become apparent . Like much of the album , `` Memory Serves , '' relies too heavily on a feeble and repetitive chorus that lead singer , Paul Banks , strains to sell like he 's some sort of low level stock broker . Lyrically the album trades in the sort of over worn love loss that mistakes clich & eacute ; s for directness . In `` Summer Well '' Banks pleads , `` I miss you babe / I want you back , '' and as a listener I can only think to myself , `` Who cares ? '' Interpol have never been known for their lyrical prowess , but on their first two albums you could count on them to use obtuse abstraction now and again to set the mood.That 's not to say that Interpol does n't have its good moments . The orchestration on `` Always Malaise '' and the piano on `` Try it On '' point to a fuller sound that still might reinvigorate the band . Unfortunately , even the interesting sonic tricks on Interpol are buried under thick production that flattens any dynamics in their sound . These are n't songs , they 're mosquitoes frozen in amber . The front cover of Interpol shows the band 's name in a state of deconstruction . Well , judging from their past few albums , the band should spend some more time figuring out how to tear their sound apart rather than putting it back together .	-1
But then , I am not a preschooler . Or a Raffi fan apparently . Nice little song , for little kids to enjoy .	-1
The first thought that crossed my mind when Linkin Park posted this entire CD to their Myspace page shortly before the album 's release was that the fans are going to HATE this . And looking at some of these reviews , I was right.Never a huge Linkin Park fan myself , I have gotten some enjoyment out of both Hybrid Theory and Meteora back in the day . This CD sounds nothing like those , it might as well be from a different band.That said , this review will not be complaining about that , exactly . I actually liked Minutes to Midnight , their previous CD , enough to have rated it 5 stars ( ! ) when it came out , which surprises me , but that was my opinion back then so I 'll stick with it.Most fans seemed to have been underwhelmed with Minutes to Midnight , finding its softer rock style to be a huge departure from the Nu-metal band they knew and loved . These people are not going to be won over by A Thousand Suns , which seems to totally ignore the vast fan complaints about that CD 's new sound.I do n't want this to be `` that type '' of review . I understand that bands change , their interests change , their style changes , etc . I was fine with this on Minutes to Midnight , which was , I think everyone would agree , still a rock album . Well , A Thousand Suns is not . I do n't know what I 'd even call it , to be honest . Techno hip hop at times , `` boy band '' soft at others ... .but basically , you ca n't even hear much guitar presence here , it 's all been covered over by a synthesizer . The songs are all for the most part mid-tempo ( The Catalyst is the fastest song on the CD , amazingly enough ) and there are only about 9 songs on this CD ... .the other 6 are either clips of speeches or synthesized interludes between songs . At times these can be atmospheric and interesting , at other times , they come off as pretentious and pointless . Having to wait till track 3 to get to the first real song on an album is never a good thing . And this is especially a problem when one of these songs is as unbelievably awful as The Messenger , the album closer , which features Chester howling over an accoustic guitar about how `` love keeps us kind . '' Ugh . Waiting for the End is a mixed bag that I ca n't tell if I love or hate . Same with Robot Boy.Elsewhere , Iridescent is an effective balad , Burning in the Skies is okay , but it sounds like a Minutes to Midnight throwaway . Wretches and Kings is a cool Linkin Park meets Public Enemy type of song , When They Come For Me is pretty solid , Blackout 's very good , and of course The Catalyst is great ... but that 's about the best the CD gets . Taken as a whole ( as the CD is meant to be ) it 's definitely an interesting listen , despite the terrible final song that will make fans beg for Little Things Give You Away , Numb , and Pushing Me Away . Taking each song and looking at it individually , though , these are some of the band 's weakest to date , despite some cool parts to each and innovative ideas , none of the songs manages to leave much of an impression . All go on for too long.It 's interesting that Linkin Park decided to release a CD that could potentially alienate their entire fanbase . They say in the booklet that they 're aware of this , but that they 're doing this because this is the type of CD they want to release . That 's all admirable , I just wish this CD was a bit better . It 's got some solid tracks and some very cool and effective moments . It 's also got lots of aimless techno filler and the move AWAY from rock music almost entirely is disappointing to me . This is Linkin Park , is n't it ? I love when bands experiment and try to broaden their sound . But then there 's when it 's a case of too much of this , like here , when the simple fact is that this should have been a solo album , or a side project , or something . This CD bearing the Linkin Park name just does n't feel right . I thought Minutes to Midnight was a good effort on the band 's part to broaden their sound and release more subtle and more `` adult '' rock . I could see what they were trying to do . This CD , though , except the rap songs , sounds more like Phil Collins than Linkin Park . I 'm not sure at all what the band was trying to do here . And it 'll further alienate fans.Myself ? It 's listenable . I bought a copy so I could have it in my discography and I can see myself listening to it a few times . But for many fans , it 's probably a sign of the end of the Linkin Park they grew up listening to . And if the band continues in this direction , I just do n't think they can compete against the artists it seems that they 're trying to compete against , so it might be the start of the fall of the band , too . Which is kind of too bad , because they have talent . Again , musical experimentation is good ... totally and completely ignoring your fans ' complaints about your previous CD ... not good . They do n't need to necessarily make another Hybrid Theory but they ca n't just continue to ignore their fanbase , otherwise , what will they have ?	-1
I was n't huge on MTM but it did have some awesome songs but this though has no rock at all . They are all techno with some rap here n there and that 's it . Wretches & Kings and When they come for me are the only songs I enjoyed . I understand you want to be different but they are a whole new band and not a good sound either .	-1
`` Minutes To Midnight '' witnessed Linkin Park attempting to morph into some type of amalgam of U2 and Pink Floyd , as they edged their way into adult contemporary with songs like `` Shadow of the Day '' and `` Leave Out All the Rest . '' For the most part , that was forgiveable , because those songs were well-constructed pop , and the album also featured some songs that were uptempo and reminiscent of their early sound ( `` What I 've Done '' and `` Bleed It Out . `` ) With `` A Thousand Suns , '' any trace of old Linkin Park is gone . There are electronic interludes between nearly all of the songs , and they do n't really connect the songs , making them almost non-sequiters . Of the 15 tracks , only nine are actual songs , and many of those ( such as `` Catalyst '' ) sound more experiments rather than fully developed songs . When the songs do develop , they lack the strength of the better moments of their previous work . `` Robot Boy '' sounds like One Republic covering Oasis ' `` Wonderwall . `` `` Iridescent '' picks up melodically where `` Leave Out All the Rest '' left off , but never really gets going . `` Wretches and Kings '' is a brilliant track , combining all the great elements of MTM with their early hits . But all in all , this album is somewhat of a missed opportunity . It is evident that the band labored extensively on this , as the lyrics tell tales of everything from nuclear fallout to citizen uprisings . It is an ambitious effort to be certain - but it suffers the fate of so many other albums , which is a lack of consistently strong songs .	-1
Linkin Park overall is garbage . Come on even you hardcore fans have to admit they 're a studio band . I will admit as a kid up until I was about 13 I enjoyed everything from Meteora on backwards , and I can still listen to it and enjoy it , but THIS ! This album is terrible . It 's a bunch of whiny techno idiocy . Why this band gets so much credit is beyond me . This has to be their worse album yet . Should have seen it coming , with the dreadful Minutes To Midnight .	-1
This album proved to be too difficult for repeated spins . While I do appreciate an album that takes time to sink in ( some of my favorite albums were those that i did n't initially like , but ended up growing on me due to the complex nature of them ) A Thousand Suns comes up short in the memorable song department.The issue with A Thousand Suns for me is that it does n't seem to flow at all . It has too many idea 's floating around in its head to be a complete thought . Many may say that I just do n't get it , and to give it more time , the problem is I really do n't enjoy it as a whole , save a few memorable moments . There are good idea 's here and there , and some great musical moments , but they tend to always meander off in some unrelated direction once they get interesting.Case and point , `` Waiting for the World to End '' , this song has a fantastic bridge/verse that appears with Chester singing throughout . This part of the song is fantastic , actually it may be one of my favorite moments in Linkin Park 's discography . However , the strange rap/reggae portion of the song from Mike , just does n't flow with Chesters part at all , and ends up just being confusing . Actually , I ca n't figure out which is the chorus and which is the verse . It just seems like a connection of two unrelated songs , and forcing them to fit together.That 's kind of the way the album is as a whole . I like the idea of the album ( a complex concept album ) and I like some of the parts within , but its all very mixed up , cut and pasted , and the concept does n't come through , and I end up skipping around.I like Linkin Park , so this is not a critique of the band , as i have seen here on the reviews , i just feel that this project is a little to `` inside '' for the band . They had an idea in mind they built it , maybe it 's exactly what they planned , it 's just not very accessible to the public . Thats my take . I will say this though , the next album should be interesting if they take these types of ideas and sounds , and maybe use a different platform .	-1
I dont really listen to that much Rock music , but this CD is depressing as hell.Its not good music.I mean minutes to midnight is way better than this album .	-1
When Hybrid Theory came out it was unique , different , and brilliant . Now having said that , LP do n't whine at me because I think Hybrid Theory and Meteora were wonderful but after 2 albums that sounded like disc one and two of the same album it was indeed time to move on . Then came Minutes to Midnight . I was a little put off by the album but it grew on me . Was n't the best by far , but it was decent . Transitional . But the new one , where to begin ... I 'll break it down track by track.1 . The Requiem - 4/5 This song actually is n't a song , but its separated so it gets a review . This is completely electronic with a humming in the background that sounds like gang vocals . Not a bad track actually , and ties in a lyric from towards the end of the album and actually helps to tie the album together well . Overall a decent opener that leads into ... 2 . The Radiance - 5/5 This song is exactly the same vein as the first , with one wonderful exception . I love the quote from Robert Oppenheimer . Other than that , this is still nothing special.3 . Burning in the Skies - 3/5 Decent track actually . Slow , haunting , different as it gets for the band . I honestly liked it.4 . Empty Spaces - 1/5 Crickets ... nuff said . Did n't need to be a track , could 've been a transitional tacked onto the last song.5 . When They Come For Me - 3/5 I 'm gon na place the score for this one in the middle because of how it felt for me . On one hand the song is odd and upbeat , with a beat to die for . Shinoda finally raps like he 's wanted to for so long . Fort Minor let him have his hip/hop outlet but this song really sounds like it belongs in the genre . Now onto the lyrics ... ugh . This song lyrically sounds like a massive slap in the face to fans who are n't enjoying this album and who were n't keen on Minutes to Midnight . LP , you have fans . They would 've stuck with you through changes if you 'd kept it worthwhile , but Minutes to Midnight was only ok and guess what ? They stuck with you . Then they say that ya , the third album was ok but the first two were better and what do you do ? You spit in their face . Is it really that big of a deal ? You ca n't please everyone boys ... 6 . Robot Boy - 4/5 I actually enjoyed this one . Strange sound but it was pleasing to the ears . I 'll be nice and stop here . Enjoy the track with the weirdest title on the album.7 . Jordana Del Muerto - 2/5 Yet ANOTHER instrumental . There are some lyrics sung in Spanish over the background though . Its haunting and alright , just not really that memorable . Nothing really wrong with it.8 . Waiting for the End - 5/5 For some reason I love this bloody song . So much fun , great sound , and overall decent impression . Probably the best track on the album.9 . Blackout - 1/5 Chester , you have a unique scream . I love it . Having said that , you misuse it here . Its butchered by the background music . I could 've stood this track a Capella instead.10 . Wretches and Kings - 2/5 This idea and sound sort of worked on When They Come For Me but yet another song about the American class system that actually makes them sound ignorant as successful musicians above the lower class they 're supposedly helping rise up ... come on boys ... 11 . Wisdom , Justice , and Love - 1/5 Another instrumental . Nothing against it , but it scores low because at this point in the album this is just getting ridiculous.12 . Iridescent - 4/5 Second favorite song on the album . A decent balance between band sound and electronics . Lyrics are alright as well . Nothing too epic but its a good song actually.13 . Fallout - 2/5 Another bloody instrumental , but the one thing that helps this track is that it contains a lyric from Burning in the Skies , tying the entire album back together.14 . The Catalyst - 1/5 Has decent ideas but just goes nowhere . I know I 'll receive flak for saying that , but its got too much Mr. Hahn , feels like a dance beat and not a song , and on top of that it sounds like they 're expecting people to shake it to the lyrics they wrote about nuclear destruction . The album had a great idea behind it , but this is the pinnacle of the poor execution behind it.15 . The Messenger - 3/5 I admit it , I kinda like the idea of acoustic Linkin Park . Its decent , but the lyrics are a little odd . They sound ... sort of like they were written in a rush.Other than some of the different lyrics it was alright.Well folks , there you go . Linkin Park 's new album is slightly disappointing and not really worth buying but as a die hard fan from back when I bought it , and I 'll buy the next one . Lets just hope they get over their 'vision ' and need to lash out at people who said they were better in the beginning because if they get past this they can start making real music again . Who knows , this next album they make could have a concept like A Thousand Suns , but be better executed . Here 's hopin boys , and regardless of this album I 'm still with ya .	-1
I 'm a huge Linkin Park fan since day one and I am shocked how awfull this album is . There are 15 tracks and more than half of them are some lame interludes that make no sence and waste good space . The few songs they do have are just bad to say the least I 'm very dissapointed . This may be the end for them if they dont come back with somthing better than this trash ! ! !	-1
Save your money . This is nothing like you 've ever heard before from Linkin Park . And that 's not a good thing.I find this situation ironic . When I had initially heard that the band was changing their sound for their previous album , Minutes to Midnight I was dreading what the outcome was going to be and I ended up adoring that album . It 's probably my favorite album of their catalog . So naturally , I trusted the band when they said they were changing up their sound yet again.Big mistake . `` A Thousand Suns '' is a good example of what would happen if a history textbook mated with a turntable . Some tracks are instrumental . Some tracks have historical speeches set to something that sounds like the background music for a video game . I get that this album is supposed to be unconventional but it 's such a drastic departure from their previous sound that I am surprised this was not cut down to an LP and was actually released as a commercial album.Anyone who was as entranced as I was by the `` New Divide '' single from the Transformers soundtrack was waiting with baited breath for the new album . And a great deal of us felt let down . The `` New Divide '' single was an absolute masterpiece of both sound and lyrical content . `` A Thousand Suns '' sounds like it was compiled together in one weekend while on a bender.Some of the salvageable songs on this album , in my opinion , were `` Burning in the Skies '' , `` Waiting For the End '' , `` Wretches and Kings '' and `` Iridescent '' and these songs are `` meh '' at best . `` Burning in the Skies '' sounds like `` Valentine 's Day '' from Minutes to Midnight set to more of a Red Hot Chili Peppers beat . `` Waiting For the End '' has a hint of the Chester Bennington melancholy that we all know and love , but it 's still a bit of a sleeper . `` Wretches and Kings '' sounds a bit more industrial than techno but it 's still not necessarily noteworthy . `` Iridescent '' stands out , but not by much . Mike Shinoda shares vocals with Chester on this almost-ballad but it 's still not enough to reach out , grab me and make me proclaim it the best of these four.I strongly suggest that if you are interested in getting a copy of this album that you preview the tracks on iTunes or Amazon.com before you purchase it . `` A Thousand Suns '' will blind you if you purchase it unaware .	-1
Congratulations Linkin Park ! You just wiped off half your fanbase , I remember the good ol ' days when Hybrid Theory came out and LP was all over the TV , radio , shows , and when everyone was jamming to their music . Then Meteora came out , another rock solid album . They were at the top and hardly anyone had any complaints about their music - I still remember how awesome it was to speed in my car with their songs at max volume when I was a teenager . However few years ago , Minutes to Midnight came out , which was somewhat mediocre - some songs were a throwback to the older albums while some were just plain shocking - I felt as if I was listening to The Fray and All American Rejects ; nevertheless , it was still a decent CD that was worth the money . They rolled downhill with Minutes To Midnight and they literally fell off the cliff with Thousand Suns.This CD is extremely disappointing and the only good song that I really like is The Catalyst ( I love the live version at MTV 's VMAs ) . Do n't bother with the rest because it is pure garbage and it will make your ears bleed . I do n't care if the lyrics are good when the song itself is n't . Those of you who are saying that this is a masterpiece , I assume you are post Meteora fans because that is the only reasonable way to explain this . Honestly , I think that this album should have been named `` Epic Fail . `` The change from NuMetal to technorock I guess is shocking . It 's like Eminem releasing a metal CD.I 'm sorry Linkin Park , I am no longer your fan .	-1
I thought Minutes to Midnight was bad ... . I did n't think Linkin Park could get any worse , but they did . A Thousand Suns is just ... well , garbage . There 's really no other way to say it . Talk about a band having zero inspiration and just going through the motions . Experimentation is one thing . Bands often try to branch out to a new kind of sound , like Linkin Park did with Minutes to Midnight . I can accept that . Every great band has a clunker album mixed in there somewhere . But two experimental , far-out albums in a row , makes me think this band has already peaked , and run out of creative ideas.Chester 's voice is shot . I guess that 's what you get when you scream at the top of your lungs for 10 years . He 's tried to evolve into a rock singer , and he sucks . Sorry , Chester , but you do . Shinoda , what the hell happened to him ? He used to bring the flava ; intelligent rap verses , and he used to FLOW . Now , he 's a complete has-been . His rhymes are few and far between . He 's a singer now ? Come on . And when he does try to rap , he sounds pathetic.I ca n't imagine a bigger free fall than what Linkin Park has accomplished the last 2 albums . What a joke . Stick a fork in Linkin ' Park -- they 're done !	-1
Aside from two songs off this album , I thought it was garbage . It 's filled with short , weak instrumentals that act as nothing but a filler to make it seem like you are getting more bang for your buck . I mean do we really need an 18 second instrumental track ? Come on . LP could have easily cut this album down to 10-12 tracks instead of the needlessly long 15 . I expected a lot better .	-1
A literary critic once said that Stephen King could publish his grocery shopping list and it would become a best seller.Judging from that above analogy , Linkin Park seem to be thinking that nowadays . And I 'm sure a lot of you fans will be telling me that I 'm wrong , that I ca n't accept it when a band `` matures '' . Which is not true . I encourage a band I like to evolve . My favorite band , Iron Maiden , did it with every album . Their new album , The Final Frontier , is an example of maturation done RIGHT- They have n't gone soft or psychedelic.The two songs on this album that appeal are `` The Catalyst '' and `` The Messenger '' . The Catalyst is AMAZING . It 's basically the one track on here that comes as close to LP sounding as the album will get . The Messenger is an acoustic ballad similar to `` In Between '' on the MTM album , except this may actually be better.The rest is fail.This album should just be retitled `` An Hour of Musical Masturbation '' since that 's what it is . Too many electronica parts . There 's a few parts that make you think ALRIGHT , REAL LP TIME ! ! ! ! but then they last like 2 seconds each . And the lyrics sound like they were written by a 6 year old . Worst of all though is `` When They Come For Me '' . That song made me cringe in utter fear . `` I 'm not a robot , I 'm not a monkey . I wo n't dance , even if the beat is funky '' . WTF ? ? ? ? Seriously , this is the same band that wrote `` Easier to Run '' or `` With You '' ? ? ? ? Well it is official . LP are DEAD . They died on MTM and have been rotting in the grave ever since . I 'm completely done with them now .	-1
I really do n't remenber other bands that recorded such good albuns like Hybrid theory and meteora , and than start to record TOTAL CRAP MUSIC like this ! ! ! ! i ca n't recognize linkin park anymore ... where is the rage ? where is the will to create heavy songs again ? what happened to chester vocals ? ? ? looks like linkin park wants to be another band ... and not a heavy rock band , but something between emo and eletronica ... by now , i do n't believe linkin park will ever be the same again ... they totally sell out and lost their way making common lame songs to play on mtv , instead of heavy great tunes like PAPERCUT and FAINT ... well , i remenber when hybrid theory come out and i thought this band was cool ...	-1
Although this album is a lot of styles all mished and mashed together , and is sometimes kind of innovative , to a degree , it could be best described as 'artistic crap'.Not long after Linkin Park became Nu-Metal heroes with their debut album , 'Hybrid Theory ' , Nu-Metal lost it 's standing in the rock community . Although Meteora from 2003 basically continued in that vein , Linkin Park had to sink or swim ; since 2001 Korn and Limp Bizkit have suffered massive loss in sales , and Linkin Park was going to follow them down that path if they did n't adapt . In 2007 they released 'Minutes to Midnight ' , which was a major departure from their earlier sound . It was more ambitious and diverse . It was essentially a completely different style . Obviously LP were well educated on the low opinion of them in this post-Nu-Metal world.They have followed this up with 'A Thousand suns ' , which is a kind of social-conscious album that is full of statements . To understand WHY I give this album a low-rating , it 's worth comparing to an album almost 20 years ago by a hair-metal band ; 'Three sides to every story ' by 'Extreme ' . 'Extreme ' were labelled a hair-metal band in a grunge world that suddenly did n't like their style . They came out in 1992 with an ambitious album full of social commentary , including anti-war anthems . What also makes the two albums worth comparing is because on that album 'Extreme ' used a sample from a speeach by social activist Martin Luther King . 'A thousand suns ' uses three excerpts from activists ' speeches , including one from the same Martin Luther King . However there is one clear difference between the two.While 'Three sides to every story ' is a very well-thought out album that has a lot of meaning , 'A thousand sons ' does n't really mean anything . The lyrics have a lot big statements and emotion filled passages of sanctimony , but the overall meaning is often vague to the point of having no meaning at all . There 's a lot of complaint and discontent , which has always been a feature of Linkin Park music , but now that they 've cloaked themselves in Rage Against the Machine like activism , it 's even more frustrating that the lyrics really do n't amount to anything . And the music itself is a step-back from 'Minutes to Midnight ' . Genuine good song-writing and complexity , who showed their heads occasionally on the last album , have been replaced by a lot of effects and sampling . There are some good vocal harmonies here and there but that ca n't save songs that are desperately trying to cover their own lack of substance . That said , the songs 'Catalyst ' and 'The Messenger ' are genuinely high quality , 'The Messenger ' is particularly lovely.Shame really , I have been intrigued by these recent Linkin Park albums , since I have discovered them recently , because I thought there might be a Nu-Metal band that can come good , but 'A thousand suns ' is basically a meticulously and thoroughly crafted piece of crap . To all the music critics giving this 5 stars and going 'wow ' ( not Amazon reviewers , but actual critics ) , you really do have low expectations of what music can achieve , do n't you ? A REAL rating : * ( 1.00/5.00 )	-1
This song is decent , but not good enough for my iPod . In my opinion it sounds like any other song on the radio . Bruno Mars has a good voice but this song does n't impress me that much .	-1
This is Taylor Swifts least creative piece of music . Her self-titled debut and some of Fearless is alright , but THIS is `` diary hidden '' nonsense . I found none of these songs good . `` Mean '' is the most atrocious garbage on this CD . Like Pumped Up Kicks , it talks about getting revenge on a bully , and that song should be burned in a fiery inferno where all good rock fans gather in a circle and watch this song burn in the most violent fashion ever . `` Mine '' is also atrocious , but not worse than `` Mean '' . Also , Taylor Swift sings about being in love in most of the songs . This is advice to NEVER buy this record .	-1
got a chance to sit down and listen to this album and hear where Taylor Swift was going.the things she has going for her is that she has a catchy sound and it compliments her vocal range and her subject matter . a Marginal songwriter thus far at best . i do wonder if she will ever expand as a Artist or will she be getting by with material that while catchy and works never expands her artistic range . vocally she is alright as with songwriting.production is slick and it works.right now if i took her 3 albums and picked out the best stuff I might have One decent album and the interesting thing will be where she goes from here in the years to come . she is a interesting artist for the times and has that Commerical sound down . however is there anything else to match the overall hype ? time will tell .	-1
Okay , I like to start off saying that I have nothing against Ms . Swift . I respect her for achieving this much success as she did at her age . However , her music is dull . My sister bought the CD , and I heard the entire CD from start to finish . Now , she has catchy songs but her lyrics are nothing inspiring . Her melodies are very similar to her previous songs , and they tend to sound rather simple . There is nothing wrong with that , of course . Many classics are simple ( i.e. '' Something '' -Beatles ) . Swift 's music on the other hand , is awfully generic . For example , her more edgy song `` Haunted '' is a good track . A contrast to her prior hits , but again , after a few listens it gets old.Normally , I do not write reviews for contemporary artists , but I felt compelled to do one for `` Speak Now '' . I wanted to see why she 's as popular as she is , and I guess it 's just because she 's everywhere . Additionally , I do n't think she has any vocal range . I have seen her perform and it is not the best ( or close ) of performances . Take last year 's Grammy performance with Nicks , it was dreadful ! Yes , I guess I must be inane , but this is my opinion and for those who claims this as legendary , timeless , classic music , you might have hit your head one time too many . Again , my opinion , do not attack me because it differs from yours .	-1
Taylor Swift has released another `` country '' cd ( masquerading as a tween pop marketing ploy ) . Again , we get a batch of formulaic songs that sound all the same , simple , sing-song lyrics , and the same Taylor overproduced/slick vocals . Carrie Underwood , Jessica Harp , and even Diana Degarmo 's Nashvillle acoustic ep blow this away . Yes , she can flip her fair , pretend to sing , and strum the same one note during 3 minutes song ( can she really play that guitar that the industry has bestowed so many awards ? ) . I do n't think so ... I bought all 3 of Taylor 's cds and they are a guilty pleasure , but when compared to Carrie 's vocals , energy , songwriting skills , and humility - Taylor just pales in comparison .	-1
I 've always hated everything tayloer swift has done the bestt thing that happened to her was haviong geeky kanye west disturb her speech but seriously how many disney girls start off innocent then they end up bisexual and on drugs .	-1
There is nothing that stands out on this album . The singer is nothing special . The band is nothing special . It 's all pretty much slow tempo , alternative rock music that could have been written during anytime from the 80 's to today . The only thing saving this album from a one star rating is the creepy dwarf on the cover of the album and the fact that they write and play instruments .	-1
these so-called songs are just meandering listless silliness -- there 's really no point in these women having a band at all : amorphous , trite , unoriginal , and ultimately banal as hell , The Fool is a crap record by a crap band that harks back to the sort of assembled `` groups '' back when rock first started to become a commodity . if you want chicks who really rock try Throwing Muses ( any incarnation ) or Lush . only drooly fanboys madly in love with Shannyn 's sister flock to Warpaint gigs . they have some cool guitars and effects pedals to hide the shambling playing , but that 's about it . i gave this record to some hip oaf who likes awful stuff like Death Cab and Beach House . i gave it a chance first -- honest . there 's just not a single melody here or moment that has n't been done a thousand times better by a million bands . just atrocious .	-1
This song is so annoying . At first I liked it but it was so over-played and just has become annoying and over-rated , just like the artist who sings it .	-1
The beauty in this song is unmatched Katy Perry shows why she is a # 1 hit making machine with gorgeous powerful vocals that make you feel something every time she opens her mouth and unleashes a rainbow of beautiful unmatched vocals . This is easily the best song of 2010 and quite possibly the best song of the decade !	-1
Katy Perry is really starting to become annoying . Her mediocre songs and terrible attempts at making music are evident . She needs to give it up already . She is terribly over-rated and I do n't know why everyone likes her . Likely cause of her looks , like most artists . No talent and all her songs sound the same . The only sound she ever makes in all her songs is ooooooohhhh	-1
Nothing special about the song . Ca n't stand the singer at all.Yuck . This ai n't the one but her husband got away free at last !	-1
There is no question that when it has came down to Katy Perry , she has shown that there can sometimes be too much of a sex kitten to make music for . It can be good for some , but in her case it is a bunch of junk . Her latest single , E.T. , the 4th single from her sophmore album Teenage Dream is n't really a driven song . She feels more like she is trying so much to be like the music that Lady Gaga . I really did n't like the song at all . It really is even worse than her California Gurls had showed last summer . The single version with Kanye West is also just as bad . I would definitely pass this song up , and go for someone who has a real voice , and not a E.T.Song : D-	-1
This song is in the top five stupidest , tasteless , poorly written , poorly sang , autotuned , pieces of obvious garbage I have ever heard . This is whats wrong with music . This is n't music is a shat out product for dumb people .	-1
The song is awful . The lyrics are horrendous and about pointless sex , encouraging people to have sex just because they feel like it , not because it is right . The vocals are dreadful , the beat is obnoxious , really horrible song and way overplayed . Anyone with any musical taste would never approve of this song . Katy Perry is one of the worst `` singers '' in history .	-1
There is no question that there is a lack of really striking music out there . With Katy Perry , she has n't really grown into her music , and brought out a real feeling of strength where her songs really are delivering . With the title track for her sophmore album , Teenage Dream , I really did n't feel any chemistry she brought out into the song that really was strong . She really could be more grown into her voice , than just being another pretty face next door . I wish her all the best with her marriage to Russell Brand , but I honestly think she needs to grow much more as a singer to be more appealing.Song : D	-1
Is it possible that they were just lucky with their first three albums ? Or else they consciously decided it 's more fun to make crappy songs that appeal to the masses then it is to continually make great songs that fly under the mainstream radar . Either way , this album is a `` once and done '' affair . Seriously , can you imagine an adult man listening to this stuff ?	-1
Pretty disappointing album , but I kinda saw it coming when they started to be really popular . I hate sounding like one of those music snobs that only likes bands before they 're popular , but most of the time it 's true . Is it just me , or are these songs really boring ?	-1
I started listening to Kings of Leon back when their first album debuted . I loved it . Their second album was a bit more evolved , less rowdy , more structured . I loved it . Their third album was a total departure , we saw the band go from a southern garage sound to a stadium sound ... I LOVED IT . That 's right . Loved the change . What you find about KOL fans that defend the early work is that they include Because of the Times in the `` glory days '' , even though it wasnt the same kind of music as the earliest material . If that goes to show anything , its that the reason the early fans of KOL do n't support them anymore isnt beacause they 're famous , and is n't because the style of music is different . Plain and simple , the songs arent as good . Only By the Night was the album that made them huge , but it did n't pick up right away . I bought it the day it came out , and realized how the punch that was in their other albums was missing . I do n't dismiss the entire album though . Crawl , Sex on Fire , and Use Somebody are all great songs . Only by the Night sounded like Beacuse of the Times without the energy and creative ideas . I was hoping for something better this time around . Not so much a return to form , but a return to looking at songwriting from a more creative process.When i first listened to this album from beginning to end , I honestly couldnt remember one song . Nothing stands out . They played it very safe , each song sticking to a mid tempo , over produced feel . Songs like Black Thumbnail and Arizon from Because of the Times have totally different personalities . Nothing on this album sounds unique . There 's just simply a lack of good ideas , and a lack of passion in the songs . When you listen to something that you love , you can FEEL it . Trying to listen to this album was difficult , as I found myself spacing out halfway through trying to pay attention to each song . The music is uninspired and trudgingly boring . It became background music to me , as hard as I tried to find something to like . `` Mary '' had its moments I guess , but not enough for me to justify it as anything more than the best song on a bad album . I love this band , they had 3 and 1/3 great albums , but I ca n't back this record up . I 'll still pay attention to them when the next release comes around , but I 'm hoping its better than this .	-1
I found `` Come Around Sundown '' , a tad dry . They still have n't topped `` Youth & Young Manhood '' . `` Radioactive '' , is a fine single , but most of the music seems to run on , it just starts sounding the same after awhile . Maybe they could try some orchestration to go with there music next time , it could sound pretty sweet .	-1
This dreary and generally aimless album is a very poor follow-up to the Kings of Leon 's previous album , which was agreeable and quite pleasant most of the time.What we have here on this new album is a potpourri of Kings of Leon clich & eacute ; s and it sounds like they made a vaguely generic `` Kings of Leon '' album packed with apparently purposeless and unmemorable songs . I 've heard the album countless times now and I still ca n't remember any of the songs . The sound ? Dinosaur guitar-based Rock from the 1970s - it reminds us of why the Punk revolution needed to happen !	-1
When I first heard the name Wacka Flacka Flame I thought it was a joke . He had one small radio hit with `` O Lets Do It '' and I thought well that 's it . Then over the summer he came strong with `` Hard In The Paint '' . Still did n't know it was him . By time `` No Hands '' was everywhere on the radio , I did n't know if it was his single or Wale 's ( I hoped it was Wale 's track ) When I heard his album title was `` Flockaveli '' I thought `` Hell Nah '' . Who is this young cat with no lyrics using the great Tupac 's name to get more publicity ? So of course it made me even more skeptical.The first thing I noticed was how much the beats sound like Rick Ross 's B.M.F . Then I found out that this album was produced by young producer Lex Luger ( who also produced Ross 's B.M.F & MC Hammer ) . His work is very impressive . The hardcore , bass thumping beats on `` Bustin ' At ` Em '' & the summer street banger `` Hard In The Paint '' remind me of a young Lil ' Jon . His beats lay the perfect background , too bad Flame is a horrible lyricist . I have n't heard a rapper say his name so much in a song since Mike Jones . His rhymes are cartoonish . It does n't take a musical genius to rhyme `` Flame '' & `` Mane '' . ( You can see the huge lyrical gap between Flame and Wale on `` No Hands '' ) The song titles tell you everything you need to know about the song . `` G Check '' , `` Bang '' & `` Smoke , Drank '' , lets you know there is nothing intelligent being said in these songs.Not since Young Jeezy 's `` Thug Motivation 101 '' , has a true gangsta , hardcore rap album came out . Theres no sing-along hooks , no sappy love songs & no auto tune . Just pure adrenaline rush beats that will keep your head bobbing for days . But you ca n't live off beats alone . You have to say something and that 's where Flame fails miserably . For the younger generation who do n't care about lyrics this will be their album of the year . But for the generation who grew up listening to the real Makaveli , this album will annoy you by the tenth track .	-1
The best way for me to describe Waka Flocka Flame , much less this CD , is to compare it to Red Bull : Its chock full of energy and a lot of people like it , but its ultimately unsatisfying and too much of it is bad for you.Let me just say first off that despite my obvious biased , I gave this CD a listen . I really did , all 17 tracks . At the risk of being called a Waka hater , I was really not feeling this CD , and that is an understatement of epic proportions . Music is an art form and there is no right way to express yourself through it , and despite how I feel about this dude 's music in general , I have been hearing people talking about this CD a lot for the last week or so , and I decided to see if everyone else was seeing something I 'm not . For the life of me , I cant figure out this guy 's appeal.Waka suffers from what I call Same Song Syndrome ( SSS ) ; a very common disease among many mainstream rappers where they will make one catchy song , then replicate that song several times but alter the beat and lyrics slightly and call it an album . I will concede however , that the production on this album is pretty decent in the sense that it does n't sound like something a kid made in his room with Frooty Loops basic . Money was spent to make this dude sound good . The sound clearly draws heavily from the short lived Crunk movement , as well as the general syth sound heard in most mainstream southern rap , giving it that pumped up fight music feel . Unfortunately , thats about as high a praise as I can really give Flockaveli , because as much as people want to try and downplay the importance of lyrics in hip hop , they do make a difference.Waka keeps it very simple : his sub genre of Hip Hop is Gangsta Rap , therefore he raps about doing a bunch of `` gangsta '' stuff . Throughout the entire CD , every song , save for `` F**k This Industry '' is about busting gats , riding on enemies , robbing , stealing , haters , making money , and fighting . Sadly , the people expected nothing more of his music , but thats another topic . Because he is so simplistic in his subject matter and lyrical ability , he is easily accessible to anyone who wants to listen to him , but anyone who likes to hear about more then one thing for an hour will quickly grow tired of Waka 's monotony . `` For My Dawgs '' , `` F**k This Industry '' and maybe `` No Hands '' are the only examples of a 17 track album of any type of attempt at something to change it up . But clearly , thats not what Waka is going for ; he 's keeping it `` real '' on Flockaveli , and apparently this is all he knows.Another things to beware of about this album : do not mistaken being `` raw and energetic '' with having talent . One of the most consistent things I have heard people saying about Flockaveli is that `` he is so raw with it ! Its so full of energy , and blah blah blah '' . While the album is full of energy ( thanks mainly to the production ) as far as him keeping it raw ... please . Enumerable gangsta rappers past and present have done it better.Lastly , ***gets up on soapbox*** I have to express my dislike for this CD for the content . I dont think there are too many people who can and will defend Waka making positive music . He 's not , point blank . This is music to blast in your car when you just want to be loud and energized , nothing more . Come on people , lets call a Spade a Spade and be done with it , Waka Flocka Flame is by no stretch of the imagination a good music maker . Dont give him points because he 's a half-booty artist doing half-booty work . But at the end of the day , your going to like you want , so if you feel the need to drop ten bucks on Fozzy Bear here , go for it . You 'll be getting your money 's worth for years to come ***rolls eyes and gets off soapbox***	-1
How does one review this album ? From beginning to finish , there is not one track that you 're going to skip . Theres nothing horrible here . However , theres not one track that you 're going to want to skip ahead to , either . This album does n't have a `` Satellite '' , `` Fa Fa '' , `` Happier '' or `` Careful '' thats going to pull you in . It also does n't have a `` Ruby Falls '' or a `` Come Downstairs and Say Hello '' as an epic ballad . This is an album full of twelve songs that pretty much do n't TAKE ANY CHANCES . They are all mid tempo , three minute pop songs . They all sound very much alike , and it 's a bit of a shame . Songs like these have always been on Guster albums , but for every `` C'mon '' , there was always something like `` Lightning Rod '' that really caught your attention as something different . The guys played it safe this time , trying to sound like the band they thought they should be . That kicked Adam Gardner totally off vocal duties , totally killed the bongo percussion , and turned the songwriting into a strict formatted process . This album has no variation , and suffers from it . Guster has always been a `` happy '' band , but this album is just a bit too sugar coated for its own good.Guster fans , I still would suggest looking into this album . It will not be your favorite album by the band , not by a longshot , but you will find 12 decent songs that will entertain you by a band that you like . To people who are not familiar with the band , DO NOT START HERE . Start with Lost and Gone Forever and Keep it Together.I hate writing a review like this . Guster is the band that got me into music , and they finally slipped . 4 year gap between albums and not one standout track ? It just does n't make sense . Guster seems to have always been trying to find their `` sound '' , and this is the album where they honed in on what they considered their best assets . Problem is , Guster 's definitive sound turns out to be when they have no idea what they want to sound like . This is not a great album . This is not a horrible album . It 's somewhere in between , to the point where it 's hard to figure out what you think of it . That ca n't be a good thing .	-1
It would be a travesty for this album to be your introduction to Guster . While it harkens back to the classic sounds of Lost and Gone Forever more than their last couple more polished releases , it falls flat on it 's face in trying to capture the listener with any really memorable tunes . Something Guster has usually had no trouble doing ! I 've played the cd at least 10 times now trying my best to like it and I almost always forget it 's even playing . Guster puts their best foot forward on the first two tracks and then wanders aimlessly around the airwaves thereafter resulting in an album where very little makes you want to sing along or even tune in . One reviewer thought because they mention Jesus and allude to religious themes on a few songs Guster `` found Jesus . '' I think that only proves the point that it 's easy to tune this disc out . The `` religious '' tunes drip with sarcasm and disdain for religion if you can actually force yourself to pay attention to the lyrics . I suppose , on the good side , they do head back sonically in the direction of their earlier work . Maybe this is just what happens when you 're on the way back to the good old days but just not there yet . Let 's hope they make it soon .	-1
It 's no use in damning Belle and Sebastian for all-but-abandoning their most twee saccharine stylings of `` If You 're Feeling Sinister '' because the past ten years or so for the group have been sparkling . They 've found a way to keep their sound , while at the same time , updating it for the more casual listener or fan . Albums such as `` The Life Pursuit '' and `` Dear Catastrophe Waitress '' scream B & S ; , but are much more lively , fun and often even a little more interesting than their older fare . Knowing of the lapse since their previous album , I was hoping `` Write About Love '' would continue in that trend of catchy goodness they 've taken a liking for.Boy , was I wrong.This album is a downright boring trip through what could almost pass as a second-rate b-sides compilation from `` Tigermilk '' or even `` The Boy With the Arab Strap . '' It 's a shame because it starts off with the climbing-and-soaring `` I Did n't See It Coming . '' After that , it drifts off as quickly as it builds . It 's not to say the music is bad , it 's just really , really bland music coming from a band that had ( as I had assumed ) found its way.Could this be a beginning of a return to the old days ? ..before the departure of Isobel Campbell and the reinvention of their sound ? I certainly hope not . Stuart Murdoch seems to be a subtle visionary , a brilliant one , too , but `` Write About Love '' does n't support that at all . It 's a grand step back in time and I do n't think that 's what B & S ; should really be doing at this point in their existence .	-1
not a fan , I got this song for downloading the amazon downloader app , there 's no way I 'd buy this song - sorry , just not my style .	-1
It 's a little rough unless you enjoy hard rock and heavy metal on a regular basis , good song any way .	-1
I only like one song on this album . Well , Well , Well.It was such a disappointment because her first album was quite fantastic.I would n't spend the money on the full album , maybe an Mp3 or two . Or on sale .	-1
Dear Duffy , I recall almost three years ago listening to samples from Rockferry and being very much impressed with what I heard , I proceeded to purchase the CD . Giving it a few listens was like real music coming back again compare what is going on in commercial music today . Along with a hand full of other artist who have ignored the current trends and just going back to making music the old fashion way with good lyrics , skillful musicians actually playing instruments , melodies that stay in your head long after the music stops playing and a vocalist who sang with a passion and had a certain uniqueness in the voice , Rockferry was like the great music of yester year done in a modern fashion . In some aspects , the songs from Rockferry felt like songs that were broadcast on the radio back in the 60s but somehow that got stuck in the upper atmosphere then suddenly release and now making their way to our radios . Best of all a new artist was emerging who was compared to other great singers of the past and to have a lot of class compare to the freak show that today 's pop tart put on these days.Now it is 2010 fall and you have released your follow up to Rockferry called Endlessly . I saw you perform the title song on the Jools Holland show and I was blown away . Well , Well , Well was a serviceable follow up to Mercy then I thought Ok , off to a good start . Then I started to read some of the early review of the CD and heard sample . That is when I went into oh no phase . You wanted to branch out , change producers and such but what has happened is that you did not take into consideration of why your fans liked Rocferry in proceeding with a follow-up . You lead the followers of Rockferry south then all suddenly we are being lead north . You 're taking in too many commercial considerations on your multiplatinum follow up . Duffy , the buyers of Rockferry liked the fact that that CD did not follow the current trends . I think a lot of your fans will be very disappointed with this follow-up as already seen by the three star reviews , not moving up the amazion.com sales chart and having a very bad billboard preview . Even worse is there are two Madonna retreads on this record , a rewrite of Poppa Do n't Preach in Keeping My Baby and Like A Virgin in Girl . Some reviewer have gave positive remarks to the song Too Hurt To Dance but this just sound like a rehash of a lot of slow heart break ballads of the late 1950s/60s.In conclusion , Rockferry was a record that I recommended to a lot of people and received positive feedback . In fact there was a lady I saw in a store checking out Rockferry CD , I walked over to her and let her listen to some samples I had on my IPOD . Needless to say she left the store with the CD . I would be embarrassed to recommend Endlessly to anyone . I might just end buying a few songs on line from the CD and just hope for the best next time . Duffy , please change course to where you were with Rockferry , while we did not want you to make a Rockferry II but to gradually move in new directions instead of a sudden shift to a place where your fans do n't want to go so quickly . The girls on the cover of Rockferry who appeared broken hearted at the train station were handing out music of substance . The pretty girl on the cover of Endlessly by way of cheesy arrangements and lackluster material is handing out cotton candy . I hope her career can survive this.I wilcome comments from people on my review .	-1
What the heck happened to the most promising new singer in years ? Duffy 's debut was a revelation , the product of a young woman who grew up in Wales listening to her parents ' ( or grandparents ) record collection from the British Invasion of the sixties . That record evoked the chilly cool and emotional warmth of Cilla Black , Lulu and , at times , Dusty Springfield . Listening to that record was like hearing the coolest songs coming out of the UK during that era , and it was one of the years ' best . Now , unfortunately , we have this mess . The up-tempo songs could be on any current pop diva 's record and seem cultivated for the living room dance floor of an audience too young or unsophisticated to appreciate the nuanced music that was such a marvelous showcase for Duffy 's voice . The ballads here are lifeless . And , speaking of Duffy 's voice , it sounds like a very poor choice was made to put her with a vocal coach that brought out an annoyingly over-the-top uber-vibrato to everything she sings here . Come back Duffy - we can all just try to forget about this record !	-1
Success has been a bittersweet thing for Aimee Ann Duffy . She had immediate success , but was lumped in as an Amy Winehouse clone . Her debut single `` Mercy '' was an immediate smash , but was quickly pegged as a one-hit wonder before she even released a second single from her debut album `` Rockferry '' . By the time she released the dreary but successful second single `` Warwick Avenue '' , she was written off as a fake by fellow musicians- the most scathing of remarks coming from fellow British singer Estelle . She went back into the studio in early 2010 to record a new album , and did a bit of cleaning house in the process . She got rid of her manager , sacked `` Rockferry '' producers Bernard Butler and Jimmy Hogarth and changed virtually all of the session musicians . She replaced the previous session musicians with the hip hop band The Roots and hired the legendary British singer-songwriter Albert Hammond to handle the production of her sophomore album `` Endlessly '' .After listening to her second release , it seems as if her desire to have more creative input was rather questionable . The album suffers from too much creative control- lyrically , the songs are borderline juvenile and the musical arrangements are bland and uninspired . Look no further than the lead off track `` My Boy '' , which sounds a little too close to Rod Stewart 's disco hit `` Do Ya Think I 'm Sexy '' - and that 's not a good thing . On the ballads `` Too Hurt To Dance '' , `` Do n't Forsake Me '' and the title track `` Endlessly '' her vocals are a little grating on the nerves the first time around . She sounds as if she may have knocked back a few shortly before she started recording . She sings a little out of key on the first single `` Well Well Well '' and gets upstaged by The Roots in the process . `` Lovestruck '' suffers from a terrible vocal performance , while `` Girl '' is overwrought with cringe-worthy songwriting . While Duffy meant well on this album , she fails miserably in trying to do things her way . In her case , maybe she should have stuck to the formula on her first album a little longer .	-1
I really dislike what I 've heard thus far . Duffy either tries to hard on this album or she 's not suited for up-tempo tunes . Rockferry was a great record but this is a painful album to sit through . Come back brighter , eh ?	-1
Great voice and decent songwriting but the whole plays out like breakup album way to many down tempo songs which is necessarily a bad thing but they all run together with only one break in between them . The singles off the album where great `` Far Away '' midtempo and heart warming the very upbeat `` I Hope She Cheats on You With a Basketball Play '' very upbeat and a bad representation of the album . Another track of notice is the midtempo closing song `` Butterflies '' which is a cover of the song that she wrote for Michael Jackson 's Invincible album .	-1
I was n't too impressed with this full album . I do n't recommend buying it -- snagging it from another friend , sure ... .buying it ? Nah ... .	-1
Bruno Mars ' `` Lazy Song '' is the WORST thing to happen to reggae since the Red , Red Whine ofUb40It 's bad enough that we have the pseudo-reggae of The Police & Blondie ; ? ? ? `` Lazy Song '' has annoying lyrics ... AND whistling . The whistling cancels out any virtues this song might have had . This song best exemplifies the passivity/Quietism that Leo Tolstoy extols inWar and Peace ( Vintage Classics ) . This song is about laziness ... and it IS lazy . Bruno Mars can do better .	-1
How many minutes will the `` casual fan '' take before realizing that `` The Hits '' has left off `` Just the Way You Are '' and `` Uptown Girl '' ? Or `` An Innocent Man '' and `` She 's Always a Woman '' ? Or `` Honesty '' and `` Modern Woman '' ... oh wait , EVERY BJ hits disc has left off `` Modern Woman . `` There is one devious little drawing card here ... this seems to be the first collection to include the live , hit version of `` Say Goodbye To Hollywood '' without the applause tracking into the next song as it does on `` Songs in the Attic . '' I am also curious as to whether this version of `` The Entertainer '' is actually the 3:05 single edit still unavailable on CD ... both because the lyrics actually ( and cleverly ) cite 3:05 as the timing of the song ( kind of ) and because the single leaves the ( kind of ) tacky lyric `` I 've laid all kinds of girls . `` I do n't blame Billy Joel . I 'm not even sure I blame Sony . But I ca n't say the world needs this odd , half-assed grouping of Joelsongs either . Wow .	-1
There is no reason for this . It 's actually insulting when you factor in his other hits collections . He has 3 volumes , so why is it compressed to one disc ? You know how many hits are missing . A lot . The remastering is nice though , but still , this is not necessary . He deserves a 3 disc best of . Nothing less	-1
Normally , I would say that this compilation is a good , cheap , single disc primer for the uninitiated . And it is . If you 've never heard of Billy Joel before , this is n't a bad place to start . Theoretically.The problem is , I 've lost count of how many `` best of '' compilations Columbia/Sony has put out there ... most of them more comprehensive than this . The 2-disc `` The Essential ... '' is only $ 1.50 more than this here on Amazon . `` Essential 3.0 ... '' ( even more comprehensive ) , is just another $ 5 more.Old fans already have everything here , and new fans are better served by other compilations that are only slightly more expensive . So the point of this new `` Hits '' compilation is ... . ? What Sony should be doing is putting out QUALITY remasters of Billy 's back catalog ( the 30th anniversary `` The Stranger '' does NOT qualify as `` quality '' ; WAY too loud ) . Credit must be given that the last round of remasters from the late 90 's were done well ( excluding the annoying tiny video clips ) , but technology has moved on since then and the discography is in dire need of a good update . This the fans would probably appreciate.Or Billy should just get off his duff and start writing songs again and put out a new album . For a man who has `` retired '' , he sure tours with the old workhorses a lot.Still , if you MUST own ONLY a single disc compilation ... if you 're `` merely curious '' and do n't want to dive in ... I guess this is a good as any . There 's nothing but quality music here . But it is a sorely incomplete picture of his career ( as any single disc would be ) , and you can get better for just a little bit more . And you 'll want more ; trust me on that . Your money is best spent elsewhere .	-1
I think this was a free song I down loaded to get the full version . Once I down loaded it I did n't really care the full version .	-1
I listen to some Toledo stations on the radio , and they play a version of `` Holy Toledo '' that is n't the one on this album . It is softer and gives Crystal 's voice more of the spotlight . It does n't have as much instrumentation , and it is a lot better . I was disappointed by this CD because it 's not as soulful as I thought it would be . It 's just your typical female rock CD .	-1
I do n't know whether her first name or the last name are the joke , or both , or just the result of a questionable decision at the end of a bottle of rye whiskey from a hot Summer night in Kentucky . The voice is at best irritating , at worst , a deliberate act of war and a weapon of mass suicide . The music is plain old vanilla formula driven . It 's a pity Simon Cowell , professional British a $ $ hole and only among the many imported English masters we in America so submissively provide them with billion dollar contracts , belittling ourselves and denying equally or better skilled AMERICAN show hosts , the opportunity to earn money and keep it at home . Why is this country so fascinated by England , the country that sucked the original Americans ' lives dry , and denied them the same rights they granted horses , dogs , and other similar bute beasts ? Have we learned nothing from that worthless nation with world domination ambitions ? Has not the mass genocide of Americans and Indians taught us nothing about the real face of Britain ? I guess not . We keep hiring them and giving them million dollar contracts by the droves , while we starve at home and keep Americans from getting these greatly coveted US jobs . Britain is the # 1 recipient of US welfare , not Israel or Egypt . And in return , we get crap music from talentless junior high school trailer trash drop outs . CRY , AMERICA !	-1
The Smiths are poised to become a media empire ... and I do n't meanThe Smiths , with their proto-emo vegetarian Irish front man Morrissey . Their son Jaden has starred in a remake ofThe Karate Kid . Jada Pinkett Smith has been inThe Matrix Collection : 4 Film Favorites , and Will-he 's been Mohammad Ali , fought aliens on Independence Day , been inspiring inThe Pursuit of Happyness ( Widescreen Edition ) , been one of theMen in Black ( Deluxe Edition ) , and fought albino zombies inI Am Legend [ Blu-ray ] . If Will and Jada Smith star in a Barack and Michelle Obama biopic , I would n't be surprised.Willow Smith has now made her debut in `` Whip my hair . '' It 's okay G-rated fare . It 's not objectionable hip hop , so it gets 2 stars instead of 1 . Still , it 's very generic . Are Jaden and Willow poised to become stars like their parents ? Willow Smith does n't exactly have the advantage of a Hannah Montana with her own TV show ; she 's not a former Disney star like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears . `` Whip my hair '' is generic pop . Not great , not awful . `` Whip My Hair '' washes out easily , it 's that boring .	-1
Just because the song does not have any foul language does NOT mean its any good . This has got to be one of the most annoying `` songs '' ever written . Garbage .	-1
When it has came down to children of famous singers , they just have n't been able to strike out on their own musically . Very very few acts have been able to drive that point home . For Willow Smith , the daughter of actor / rapper Will Smith . That honestly has n't shown that strong , even compared to the days Will Smith still showed the world he was jiggy with it . Willow 's debut single , Whip My Hair , is n't close to the catchyness and clever appeal that Will was able to master his rhymes in the songs . I really did n't feel the drive that Willow had showcased in her rhymes at all . I really did n't find the song to be catchy . I think Willow should find a better identity intould n't try and follow the trend Will had dominated so graciously in the scene . She really needs to for her songs , and not something about whipping hair or pulling teeth to call her own voice.Song : D+	-1
For Ke $ ha , she just has n't been able to deliver solid music , yet let enough alone really show she is able to sing . For her latest single We R Who We R , the leading single from her album Cannibal , it really is just another waste upon the ears . I really was n't very impressed with the song . It really was just absolutely awful . I think Ke $ ha should really try and take her time for finding better material to call upon her own , than wasting her time to find another Tik Tok in her words . It really shows that she has absolutely not as much growth in her music . Hopefully , if she does try harder , she can come out with something that makes a bit more sense , just like her voice.Song : D-	-1
2nd album from Kentucky band of energetic , noisy , angular & edgy indie guitar rock , where chaoticpost-punk leanings mix with aggressive blasts of screamo terror melody ; and tongue-in-cheek , ultra-hip lyrics fly from the lips with a bile-coated slacker sneer . The bright , over-the-top produc-tion lends an air of homogenized , faux-hipster rebellion to the erratic rhythmic clatter , tainting thealbum with a sense of manufactured , major label `` cool '' . Still , there are moments of pop clarity '' Right Before My Eyes '' ) , hypnotic allure ( `` Flow '' ) and jagged rock ( `` Aberdeen '' -- although it 's atotal Pixies rip-off ) that shine through the sheen of pretension . Reminiscent of the Pixies , Yuck , Pavement , the Fratellis , Poison Control Center , Mr. Dream .	-1
I Liked cage the elephants first album . It was pretty good , but not great , ( nothing special here ) . Even though i was n't horribly impressed with their first album , I decided to give their second a go . I thought that it might be different or that they might be exploring some more interesting sounds and trying to change it up . they did not . This album is even more boring than their first . There 's nothing that this band is doing that 's interesting or original at all . It 's very bland , even the singles barely offer anything good .	-1
To echo another reviewer on Amazon ( who gave this album five stars ) , the `` King is Dead '' reminds me why I loved the last two Decemberists releases so much . Why ? Because I love ten minute songs that some would dare call suites . I love convoluted concept albums about talking deer and evil Queens and the ghost of dead children haunting a rakish villain . I love 18th century references and eastern myths turned into three part epics and hearing words I would never hear in any other song from any other band . I love bands that indulge their every whim and deliver the album they want to make , darn the consequences.Listening to this , I do n't hear any of the above . Yes , the lyrics are still some of the smartest around , but in this case , the intelligence is a by-product of the lyricist 's vocabulary , not an intentional swing for the literary bleachers . If I had to describe this album , I would call it `` folk country with a slightly mythical tinge '' , which really means nothing other than the fact that it 's mostly acoustic , mostly mid-tempo , and mostly about melancholy days and melancholy love . Even the potentially intriguing `` Calamity Song '' - ooh , what calamity ? - is about a dream . Sigh.This album never comes close to rocking , and I must admit , I love when the Decemberists rock out . Every time the Queen showed up on `` Hazards of Love '' ? I got chills ; and I get giddy when I hear their King-Crimson slosh stomp on `` The Island '' .This album calmed me , soothed me , put me to sleep . For what it is- acoustic folk pop songs- it is good . That is not what I wanted from this band at this point , however , so I am disappointed . You may love it , I do n't know . Be warned , however , if you are expecting anything similar to the last two albums .	-1
Reverse this purchase-never ordered it- waste of time for me this morning . Take it off . I will never recommend Amazon Kindle to anyone .	-1
Never heard of Nicki Minaj until I heard this song.Getting overplayed and become an opening act for britney spears femme fatale tour.You wo n't get pass the first 30 seconds of the song . Completely Unlistenable	-1
If you are looking for extremely UNINSPIRED , GENERIC , PAINT BY NUMBERS music this is the release for you ! As you listen to it you 'll be saying to yourself `` Gee do n't these songs sound like somebody else 's songs that I 've heard before ? '' Of course they do because all he has done is taken a stock format and regurgitated it once again ! Check out the stock verses with the same meter & rhyme structure . Check out the same generic country twang vocals . Check out the backing tracks which could come out of a `` How to play country rock like your favorite past originators '' teach yourself music book.Those who are happy with mediocrity will enjoy this one to no end ! Those who desire some musical compositions on a more creative , original , melodic , adventurous bend will probably be using the fast forward button repeatedly with a final result of dropping this disk into the nearest trash receptacle . Or , perhaps it might be adequate for use as a coaster if you can remove from your thoughts there is digital audio data contained on this round piece of plastic .	-1
I 've tried to love this record , but Drive-by Truckers have honestly lost their edge on this record . I hope they do n't keep going this direction with future releases , since Go-Go Boots is obviously a big disapointment .	-1
Look , I am not not going to bemoan the fact that the band has not been the same since Jason Isbell left . The band was capable of great music before Jason got there . But I think Jason took such a dominant role in the short time he was there , that the band changed , the dynamics that is . I do n't think they have recovered from it yet . I do n't have a problem with Patterson , never have . However , sometimes Cooley 's stuff tends to sound very pedestrian .	-1
This is very folksy , and clearly distinctly Christian-sacred in its tone . It sounds quite amateurish -- like something that you might here at a college chapel service during praise and worship .	-1
I love female vocalists ... .. my favorites include Britney Spears , Lady Gaga , that girl from Garbage , Jessica Simpson , and last but not least the ever so popular Paris Hilton ! But I was amazed that someone could actually OUTDO all those artists combined ... and she is Adele from Australia . Ever since I heard `` Someone like you '' 5 million times this past week i INSTANTLY knew she was legendary.What more could you ask for ? Adele 's music has it all ! - Generic piano loops- Depressing Lyrics about ex boyfriends- Annoying vocals- Music videos of her walking and singingGenius . That 's the only word you can use to describe this amazing Australian singer.I did have to take away 4 stars because Adele did n't have any songs about eating a BigMac at McDonalds ; she also does n't have any sex tapes out yet .	-1
This is a nice little album , but there is nothing extraordinary about it . What is amazing is how the British Marketing people have managed to get Adele , Duffy , Amy Whinehouse and Florence and the Machine all over the radio in the states . Not only that , they have managed to get Susan Boyle in the minds of the world . You have to hand it to the British . They know how to play the game .	-1
Adele is a respected musician in pop music lately , especially since pop music is crap nowadays . There are a boatload of reviews of this CD that have a positive rating . However , I am not one of those people . Adele is praised for working hard and not just popping out of the blue and making a garbagy song and peaking it at # 1 like ridiculously garbagy artists like Katy Perry , Lady Gaga , Ke $ ha , Justin Bieber , ETC. , but I think this album is just whiny vocals ( one thing in music I try to avoid ) and misplaced lyrics . I also try to avoid seeing the ridiculously creepy album cover which shows a majority of her face . Rolling in the Deep is one of the worst songs ever . Overall , I do n't like Adele 's music , but she is praised by me for not being a complete gullible mess in the music industry .	-1
cd arrived with a broken and busted case . i can see why it was wrapped so tightly in plastic now . once i pulled off the sticky plastic wrapping , the case fell apart in my hands , and the cd slid right out of the broken holster in the center . this was supposed to be a new cd that i purchased at the full price . i 've bought used cds in far more better conditions . i will never buy from this buyer again .	-1
Sounds like the early 90 's . Catherine Wheel , Ride , Lush , Slowdive , Chapterhouse , Spacemen 3 , Husker Du , and of course Jesus and Mary Chain , with bits of The Cranberries and all that sort of thing . It 's the same stuff . The Big Roar ? It 's more like the big bore . This is just lazy writing , copy-cat stuff to make a quick buck . So many musicians in the world now , and thanks to the internet , the wannabes and lazy copycats can make a decent living and this is a perfect example of it . Bleh .	-1
Why , oh why Sam Beam ? I think Our Endless Numbered Days is a gorgeous record . The Shepherd 's Dog is wonderful at times funky stuff and perhaps the signal of a new direction for Iron and Wine . Kiss Each Other Clean is pure , utter garbage . I love Sam Beam the sensitive , literate folky but this `` music '' is so dull and uninspired . There is n't a decent tune to be found on Kiss Each Other Clean . The spare percussion used throughout should be replaced with a metronome as that would be most appropriate for this sleep-inducing effort . As for those who chose to give this 5 stars , what are you listening to ? It ca n't possibly be Kiss Each Other Clean . Good grief ! I want my money back ! !	-1
This is my first Iron And Wine album . Based on the strength of the track `` Tree By The River '' I ordered this ( a free song download the week before ) . Plus I often heard the name of the band and wanted to educate myself . After about ten plays I 'm left a little disappointed . It 's not bad , I 'll even say I like it , I just expected more hearing `` Tree By The River '' . It 's easily the prettiest song here , to my ears . The opener is good too , but the majority of the album just does n't wow me . I 've read a few reviews that praise their/his earlier stuff . Every band has those fans , but maybe I 'll try something older . Overall `` Kiss Each Other Clean '' is decent , but maybe I should 've gone with that Destroyer album instead .	-1
Huge Sam Beam fan . Own all his stuff that I know of . Have forced myself to listen to the album almost 20 times . Still absolutely hate it . It 's as if he decided to vomit out all the crappy , sappy , god-forsaken 70 's genre music he 's ever heard while singing his own poetry . Not only is the music nauseating ( other than `` Me and Lazurus '' and `` Big Burned Hand '' which I can stomach for some reason even with the lame appearance of saxophone on the latter and the so-so opener `` Walking far from home '' ) , Beam 's lyrics come across as less inspired than usual . To be fair , it could just be the music that kills any punch his words would otherwise have . If this is your first exposure to Iron and Wine/Sam Beam , PUH-LEASE do n't hold it against Beam . His other stuff is stellar and much of it ageless . Check it out ! But I think you 'll find this album 's a tragic waste of time .	-1
I am of Paul Simon 's generation - have loved him since the days of S & G . Graceland was his best release as a single artist . His most recent release ( So Beautiful or So What ) was purchased with much anticipation . It left me sad . The songs all sound the same , and Paul seems to just talk-sing through most of them . Yes , it 's kind of Paul 's `` thing '' , but just not that good of a CD . I would recommend purchasing the one song , `` So Beautiful or So What '' , because that is one worth listening to . The others ? I recommend that you pass .	-1
I do n't think Paul Simon has ever made , or at-least released , a beautiful album . He 's made plenty of beautiful songs though , which made for a steady stream of albums that were at-least good . That was until a little over a decade ago when , after the release of Songs From The Capeman , perhaps his most melodic set , the quality of his music suddenly declined . He 's been stuck in an artistic rut ever since . This new album , only his third in all that time , is no return to form.The first song ; a Christmas anthem , oddly enough ; suggests it might be . It 's better than every song on his last album and most of the songs on the One before it . But So Beautiful Or So What is a wonderless mess from there ; all the way to the title song , which is barely good enough . Most of this set , all but the first and last song , is a drag . The poetry and storytelling is vintage Paul Simon , but the vocal melodies , an element the artist used to master , are boring and bland.Brian Eno is replaced by the long-awaited return of Phil Ramone as producer , but his work offers little help . What these songs needed were to be scrapped for better songs , `` simple '' ones , as Paul Simon himself described during a Barnes And Noble interview in 2008 . He played demo versions of Love And Hard Times and Questions For The Angels that day , music he described as `` complex '' , before strumming an experimental groove he described as going back to something `` simple '' .That groove was loopy , bouncy and instantly catchy . It did n't need drums or even vocals to sound marvelous and I hoped he 'd make a full song out of it for this album , but it 's nowhere to be found . In its place are songs it takes repeated listens to even grasp the forgettable melodies of . The whiny guitar riffs on Love And Blessings are funky , yes , but it 's not nearly enough . I want a beautiful Paul Simon album , or at-least another good one , before he 's dead and gone.marcellee.com	-1
The Head and the Heart are n't bad indie rock , but having seen them in concert and spent a lot of time listening to this album , I ca n't say that I am still as impressed as I initially was .	-1
Id heard about this band and thought wow they must be gooood . Everyone 's saying such sweet things about em ... I need my own cd ! Didnt even bother youtubing to see if their good , went straight for the cd gold . Cd arrives today and guess what ? Actually , has a very bland sound to it . Cd flatlined and stayed there song after song . Music is an artform all its own but we dont all appreciate the styles & tempos out there . This one wasnt bad but it didnt appeal to me eitheir .	-1
The Srokes 'debuted ' their new album at a free concert during SXSW . Most of the 'fans ' were too wasted to really know if the music was any good ( hey we 're talking Austin , TX during a major music industry event when everyone in the entertainment biz comes to get high , with music and movies as a backdrop ) .After SXSW , the album came out . And it is n't much , without the psychotropic chemical enhancements.When the guitarist ( Nick Valensi ) tells the press in an interview that that `` I feel like we have a better album in us '' , you have to wonder `` why should anyone bother buying this one ? '' OK Nick , go record the `` better album '' you have , and come back when it 's finished.Seriously , The Strokes have been going no-place , spinning their wheels for the last decade . Their first album 'Is This It ' remains their only real seller , and only the few songs they played from that album got any audience reaction at the SXSW free concert . Of the estimated 9000 people at the show , probably fewer than 100 ever heard or bought any subsequent releases from The Strokes ( and even fewer could name any songs from the later albums ) .As for this album , it demolishes The Strokes ' hype about them being something 'new ' : every song sounds like it 's derivative of something that 's been done before by someone else , and there is no musical coherence in evidence . The Strokes seem to be searching for a sound and style -- unfortunately , nothing here really works . 'Games ' - sounds like early 1980 's electro-pop . Someone please tell The Strokes that the 1980 's ended over 20 years ago ... 'Machu Picchu ' - sounds like pop-Reggae ( not real reggae , more like 10-CC or other Brit-pop acts doing reggae tinged top-40 ) . Do n't expect this song to burn up any Billboard charts . 'Under Cover of Darkness ' sounds like the bid for radio ariplay , , and might be the main single . I 'm not sure if comemrcial radio wants to take a chance with a song that will drive away listeners with incomes and jobs . But 'Under Cover ... ' might do OK on college radio . 'Life is Simple in the Moonlight ' might have been a pop hit in the MTV era , but without a strong video to plug it , it seems destined to languish . It 's also at the END of the album , which makes it seem like a song the band is not enthusiastic about . 'Gratisfaction ' and 'Metabolism ' , which precede 'Life is Simple ... ' will probably turn off listeners , and seem to be pure filler.Well I hope THE STROKES record that 'better album ' some day soon , before the world writes them off completely . In the mean time , forget this one .	-1
With `` Is This It ? '' the Strokes made one of the best records of the new century . Following albums were good but got gradually worse . After a long hiatus `` Angles '' came out and unfortunately it fits neatly into that line.Opener ` Machu Picchu ' can only endear in the chorus , but the empty 80 's pop sound is annoying . This hollow sound is continued in ` Two Kinds of Happiness ' and basically throughout the albumIt 's not all bad . The single ` Under Cover of Darkness ' makes up a lot . It 's a vintage Strokes song with both strong verses and chorus and where every instrument sounds great . ` Taken for a Fool ' has a great chorus as well but these are sparse highlight on a disappointing album .	-1
Metabolism immediately brings to mind the futuristic sounds of First Impressions of Earth , with tracks like Vision of Division . You know.. that progression to a more glossy anthemic sound as opposed to the intimate washed out melodies of 'Is this it ' . With Muse-esque guitaring and 8-bit technodrome basslines that are reminiscent of old Nintendo games.It really makes it difficult to get a handle on what this album is . As a record , it is constantly morphing from old school Strokes , 80s synth ( 'two kinds of happiness ' and 'Games ' ) to first Impressions.Gratisfaction sounds like something out of a 'Spoon ' album with a Queen like transition between verses.Im not sure what to make of it . Its a bouncy track but the core melodies are so generic and boring . Maybe its because the melodies in general dont have the lyrical punch that the first two albums had . Do you remember Casablanca 's dynamic sarcasm and sincerity ... well now he either moans in the vain of the horrible `` ask me anything '' , muffles meaningless harmonies or incites cheesy sing along moments instead.You 're So Right could be mistaken for a radiohead song at first . `` tell me what happen -- Tell me what happen '' but then somewhere along the track it transcends into some sort of 'Pet Shop Boys ' showdown.Under Cover of Darkness is old school Strokes , reminds me of 'Someday ' with its melancholy . Its fresh and still true to the sound of the Strokes . `` Life is Simple in the Moonlight '' further helps instill the core beauty of the Strokes , and its almost sad to see this final track really nail what I had hoped to hear the entire time . That being angular layers of catchy melodies that dont hide behind a wall of pretentious sounds , which brings me to my final thought . `` Angles '' feels like every member in the band needs to be heard . Its not a team game here . This is a bunch of hotshot individuals , all with their side-project credentials wanting to make their sound , bouncy basslines , guitar solos and drum beats all playing to their own set of tunes ... The backbone is missing . Strokes at work 'Machu Picchu ' is a good example . And that maybe fine for larger than life bands like Kiss or Van Halen that strive on big sounds and lots of attitude but the core mechanics of this group relied on a more effortless , cool bunch of nobodies ... you know like 'the outsiders ' . Blood brothers forever right ? And then we come to my objection before the accusation . That somehow because the band sounds different , we owe them praise . But that doesnt automatically make this a great album . Is it fresh ? I dont even think that . The strokes are branching out trying to be everything . At least First Impressions had a deliberate thematic approach , this new album is a little bit of this and and a little bit of that . It has not evolved into a cohesive project , and they know this . Thats why its called 'Angles ' its a cop out as if to say they purposely meant it to be this way . A mish mash of all sorts.They should have decided on an angle to begin with .	-1
If i could give this album zero stars , i would . This album is sooooooo uninspired and directionless . The whole album has a 1980 's vibe about it and her lyrics are so literal . There is n't any mystery in the songs , or the message of the songs . An 80 's flare is cool , but she does n't seem to be able to deliver on the majority of the tracks . If her old fans are looking for theatrical over the top pop songs , this album does n't offer that . What her fans have become accustom to is nowhere to be found on this CD . I guess that 's why she delayed the release.She was a normal artist on her first CD and then she let her own 'fabulosity ' get to her . She fell into her own 'hype ' and just tries to hard to shock people . The Fame Monster was a coomplete departure , image wise , from her first release . For 'Born This Way ' , she has literally flown off the handle . The girl has run out of steam . On top of that , she does n't have any 'charisma ' . She is not aesthetically pleasing to look at . Her Italian Catholic-Edie Falco-nose looks cute on Stanley Tucci , but not her . She has as much charm as a plastic mannequin . Her semi-tomboyish lesbian allure does n't do a thing for me and most of her songs on this album are just a major disappointment . Not cohesive at all . On top of that , she tries to sell the audience her bizzare sex appeal ( Which once again , is as interesting as a plastic mannequin ) .I hope she can deliver on her fourth album.Do n't be a drag just be a queen . Do n't be a drag just be a queen . **I cringe every time she sings those lines**	-1
I have listened to this album over and over again to try and appreciate it and for it to grow on me.Because after the 1st listen I was not impressed.The album seemed like 1 long track to me with very few intermissions of great songs.I have now realized that the album did n't grow on me and that it is kind of a disappointment.After `` The Fame '' which I mostly loved ( bar a few filler tracks ) and `` The Fame Monster '' which in my mind was a fantastic album bordering on the accessible and avant-garde but just poppy enough to be a radio staple . `` Born This Way '' does n't continue this trend . You can tell Gaga tried to make power choruses and be radio friendly but it gets washed in with the heavy production which seems very lethargic and just TOO much to me.The album starts relatively strong with `` Marry The Night '' , the mega over played smash `` Born This Way '' , the intriguing and the very dark `` Government Hooker '' .Then comes `` Judas '' which I thought had potential to be a really amazing song but is ruined by the Dance-Dance-Revolutionish chorus . `` Americano '' is really over the top and ridiculous . `` Schei & szlig ; e '' is probably one of my favourite tracks . It again borders on mainstream accessibility and complete darkness which is interesting to listen to . `` You & I '' is hands down the best thing on this album . Its a fantastic song and highly recommended . It doesnt really fit in the context of the album but its a welcome surprise after the huge filler gap of tracks 8-15 '' The Edge of Glory '' is the 3rd single and a great closer.Unfortunately for me , the tracks in between these songs are major filler in my honest opinion . They go on about 2 minutes too long and dont really give you a reason to stick around and listen to it.It doesnt pack the accessibility punch nor the dark avant garde punch.Its just below average background music and was very dissapointing after multiple listens.The only tracks in my mind worth RAVING about are Government Hooker , Schei & szlig ; e , You & I and The Edge of Glory.Luckily for Gaga , the public and her Little Monsters eat everything she does up even if the product is inferior and this will lead to huge sales . ( That and her hawking the album for 99c on Amazon and giving it away with every phone purchase at Best Buy..which is really not an admirable thing to do as an artist in my opinion ) I honestly cant see any of these singles taking off and being a # 1 worldwide smash like she did with `` The Fame '' and `` The Fame Monster '' and they probably wont.But I 'll give her credit where credits due and that is with the few songs I mentioned which are superior to a lot of songs on the radio right now .	-1
By all accounts , `` The Fame '' was the perfect debut album for a superstar . It had all kinds of dance music , with crafty beats and tight production . When comparing Gaga 's debut against those of Rihanna , Katy Perry , Pink , Britney Spears , Ke $ ha , and all her contemporaries , Gaga 's album was by far the best of the bunch . There had not been a true debut album by a female pop star that was so excellent probably dating back to Cyndi Lauper 's `` She 's So Unusual '' in 1983 , which became the first female debut to ever spawn 5 singles in the top 10 . And not since 1988 ( Paula Abdul ) has a female pop star had multiple number one singles on both the Hot 100 and the dance charts.So , Gaga had much to live up to here , and there is no way possible to please everybody . The attempt to do so can be heard in the overproduction , which has WAY too much reverb , and some of the tracks run too long . But the biggest problem is the quality of the songs . This is a clear example of what happens when an artist is given too much musical freedom too soon , and the songwriters who wrote all of your earlier hits ( RedOne ) ca n't come up with songs quite as good the second time around . Witness the high-pitched screeches in `` Government Hooker '' in which , after repeating the phrase `` I am your hooker '' over and over , she yelps through autotune a long , extended `` hoooooookaaahhhhhh . '' And what happened to Gaga 's tendency to be Avant-Garde ? That has now been replaced with phrases like `` I 'm as free as my hair '' and `` It does n't matter if you love him , or capital H-I-M. '' As the album closes , there is a country ballad ( `` You and I ) which is a total clunker of a song , and a horrible electro-pop track called `` Electric Chapel '' which is more reverb and auto-tune , on a continuous loop.It will be interesting to watch sales for the album during it 's second week . `` Edge of Glory '' dropped from # 3 to # 19 on the Billboard chart in one week ; a week in which Gaga was on American Idol , The View , and SNL . Not since Michael Jackson 's `` HiStory '' has a musical album release been this hyped . But unlike Jacko , Gaga got weird too soon , and does not have classic albums like `` Thriller '' and `` Bad '' to fall back on . She is starting to look more like a fading fascination each passing day . Serves her right for trying to `` reinvent '' herself before even really establishing herself . Ego will do that I guess .	-1
Heard of Lady Gaga ? She 's this loopy pop singer with weird hair and clothes , and most people either love her or hate her . Well , my personal opinion of Lady Gaga 's persona wo n't come into this -- it 's all about her new album , `` Born This Way . '' Well , brace yourself : It 's a bloated mess that rambles on far too long , with too many songs , too much noise , and no unifying style . `` Born This Way '' presents itself as a gay anthem , and it does this by thumping you over the head with obvious shout-outs like `` Do n't be a drag/just be a queen '' and `` No matter gay , straight or bi/Lesbian , transgendered life . '' But all Madonna comparisons aside , this song is a mess -- the producers heaped so many layers of sound that it sometimes sounds like Gaga is being smothered.Then there 's `` Judas , '' the second single of this album . This suffers from the same choking overproduction as `` Born This Way , '' with Gaga 's voice being smushed down under a thick fog of synthpop . Then again , she spends half the song squawking , `` Juda-JUDA-AW ! '' like an epileptic goose , so that might be a good thing.But what of the other songs ? Well , the album actually starts quite strong with the dark , glittering `` Marry the Night , '' and the bleakly desperate sex-with-presidents thumper `` Government Hooker . '' But things start going off the rails with the goopy romanticism of the Spanish-flavored `` Americano , '' the vaguely Germanic club melody `` Scheibe , '' and the cheesy `` Hair . `` After that , Gaga just ... seems to stop trying , and lets the following songs decay into a soggy mess of mediocre club pop . Some of the songs barely have melodies ( `` Black Jesus - Amen Fashion , '' `` Highway Unicorn ( Road to Love ) '' ) , and some are just so bland that it 's hard to remember them ( `` The Queen '' ) . I like `` Electric Chapel , '' but most of these songs could have been cut without anyone noticing.She does rouse herself enough to give distinctive sounds to the last couple songs ... but they 're AWFUL sounds : `` You And I '' sounds like a country singer wandered into a dance club and just started singing , and `` The Edge of Glory '' is a horrendously cheesy power ballad , complete with SAXOPHONES.In a nutshell , `` Born This Way '' is a huge bloated mess , bogged down with excess and collapsing under its own weight . It feels like Lady Gaga is trying to do EVERYTHING in this album . More sound ! More musical genres ! More random references to fashion , nightclubs , sex and gay people ! More dance songs that nobody can remember when they 're over ! As for Gaga 's lyrics , they have some interesting elements , like the strong undercurrent of Catholic/religious symbolism and the idea that `` bad kids '' are just fine because they were `` born that way . '' But her writing also tends to be insanely clumsy ( `` You 're black , white , beige , chola descent/You 're Lebanese , you 're Orient '' ) , and her symbolism is so obvious that it leaves bruises between your eyes.And her voice ? It 's the strongest part of any song where she tries , but too often it falls by the wayside in this album . In some songs , it 's swamped by all those electronic layers , and in some songs she just sort of croons without putting any effort into it.If they had trimmed off the B-sides and the extra production , `` Born This Way '' could have been a pretty decent pop album . But instead , it feels like a collapsing monument to pop excess .	-1
I 'm shocked that the woman who could come up with so much amazing music fell totally flat on her face with this album . It 's nothing but dissonance , and I ca n't really say I enjoy listening to screeching noises , something akin to the sound Jim Carrey made in the car next to the Hitchhiker in Dumb 'n ' Dumber . My god , Lady Gaga ... ... this album totally blows . I was so excited for it because Born this Way was amazing . and then every other song is just GOD AWFUL . I ca n't even pretend to write an eloquent or reasoned review of this . wow . Thank God it only cost me ninety nine cents . FAIL .	-1
I 'm a very open minded man when it comes to music , yes I even tried Lady damn Gaga due to all the hype surrounding it , and well , she delivers yet again another boring generic disc full of monstrosities ( no pun intended ) . It 's becoming quite apparent that her novelty is wearing off , as even some of her most devoted fans are one starring this cd . One ca n't help but laugh at the cover . It 's quite frankly the stupidest thing I 've ever seen . She 's just trying too hard now to be `` unique '' and `` different '' . Sorry Lady Gaga , but it 's downhill from now on . Your crappy generic I 'm so different pop nonsense novelty is wearing off.UPDATEHere 's an article from yahoonews.Lady Gaga 's Born This Way set another record this week , but not one that Gaga 's team will be happy about . Sales of the album dropped off by 84 % from its sizzling ( but discount-inflated ) opening week . That 's the the steepest drop-off in sales , expressed in a percentage basis , of any of the 17 albums that sold 1 million units in a week in Nielsen SoundScan history.Gaga 's album sold 174,000 copies this week , down from 1,108,000 last week , when sales were goosed by a two-day , 99-cent sale at Amazon.The old record for the steepest drop-off following a million-unit week was held by *NSYNC 's 2001 album Celebrity . Sales dropped by 76 % in the week following its 1,880,000 debut . Two recent albums were tied for second place in the steepest drop-off column . Sales of Lil Wayne 's 2008 hit Tha Carter III and Taylor Swift 's 2010 smash Speak Now both dropped off by 69 % in the week following their debuts of 1,006,000 and 1,047,000 , respectively.A big drop-off was to be expected . But the fact that Gaga 's drop-off was steeper than any of the other follow-ups to albums that had a million-unit week is troublesome . It seems obvious that the opening week tally for Born This Way was generated not only by hard-core fans , but also by casual fans who just did n't want to pass up such a deal . Last week 's near giveaway worked in the short term ( by giving Gaga the biggest one-week sales total since 2005 ) , but it may have also served to devalue albums in general and Gaga 's brand in particular .	-1
Honestly , none of the songs are very memorable but it sounds slick and well-produced and ready for summertime playing . It 's not going to sustain me through the whole summer though .	-1
What began as a failed military project , Weyland-Yutani Corporation 's LGG ( or `` Lady GaGa '' as it is called ) `` Scorched Earth '' weapons platform became one of the company 's big sellers at the 2011 International Cybernetics Convention ( ICC ) this past month.How did Andrew Weyland turn this multi-billion dollar debacle into a hot seller ? I had an opportunity to ask Mr. Weyland during the convention : `` After the infamous 'meat-suit ' disaster ( The Mark 9 LGG malfunctioned during a routine systems test - deafening 10 technicians , killing three and covering itself with their remains ) , we thought that it was a total wash . But we had some very brilliant people work on a new , more powerful sound generating platform , a better targeting system and a more radical bio-covering . We then re-packaged the Mark 10 , aiming at a younger , less sophisticated market and priced it to move . `` And `` move '' it did . Sales for the Mark 10 Ga-Ga have soared . Recent tests continue to be very promising . Ga-Ga 's Nagouchi MX34 sound generation system combined with the standard auto-tune hardware can cut through a three inch block of steel in less than 3 seconds ! Surprisingly , playback of the sound is almost as effective ; causing small animals to literally explode . Also , the bio-covering alone is enough to break the morale of an attacking force , truly frightening.Although some critics have called the Mark 10 LGG a `` cheap , tawdry , pointless and lacking any real value '' and `` the ugliest sounding thing around '' , sales continue to be very good for this item . But Weyland-Yutani is not content to rest on their laurels . Their new press release indicates that the LGG Mark 11 will be debuting sometime next year . There seems to be no stopping this sales juggernaut .	-1
I loved the Fame Monster release and listen to it quite frequently.To hear that Lady Gaga was coming out with a new album was a very exciting day . Even more exciting when I got it for a mere $ 0.99.But even at $ 0.99 , I felt that I deserved a lot more than the very pedestrian effort that this album received . `` Born This Way '' was an excruciating cliched positive message that has been beaten wafer thin by so many artists that it rendered this song listless on arrival . And it only gets worse from there , especially with the somewhat obsequious use of `` gaga '' here , there , and everywhere . Ok , we know who you are ... can you please get back to writing music worthy of `` Paparazzi '' , `` Bad Romance , '' or `` Poker Face ? `` What perhaps is more shameless is the apparent attempt to rake in enough sales in what could only be an attempt at saying that she sold xxx , xxx copies within the first week ... not on artistic merit , mind you , but on the basis of it being offered as cheap as it was on Day One . I ca n't ascribe any other reason than this and it 's purely an opinion on my part as there is the fact that Amazon is touting its Cloud network as well ... but it still does n't excuse the rather poor and abhorrent music that was released . This is n't the same Lady Gaga who impressed me so much with her debut release , is it ? Apparently not . I will be listening with caution with every subsequent release at best and reserve my purchase for the purely extraordinary . Because this album is n't .	-1
My wife got it as a gift ( from a co-worker ) and she 's already calling Gaga pass & eacute ; , after just a fortnight.Personally , I enjoyed a few tracks , but I 'm just fine with her letting it go .	-1
straight up Ga Ga has musical chops , she can play , can sing and understands melody and Groove , however alot of this album as with some of her other material at times comes off as Karoke style Madonna leftovers and feels contrived and when her imagery takes center stage you are stuck with a well skilled artist who is polished in the manipulation of selling a image , which leaves the music at hand cold and calculated . she has real talent , however the gimmicks at times tend override and if she keeps putting out half baked songs which just are rethreads of madonna and countless other acts then she will be done before she has a chance to truly shine . she got a chance to really be something as a artist if she works on real songs .	-1
If I could give this -10 stars , I would.What do we have here ? The same old generic beats , same old , same old.In the hard rock/heavy metal world , most people still listen to and talk about Black Sabbath 's debut album in reverential tones . It was released FORTY ONE YEARS AGO . Why do we talk about it ? Because it was an honest , uncompromising work of unparalleled power and originality . It stands as a relevant moment in music history.The same goes for the jazz masters . The body of work left behind by Ellington , Monk , Coltrane , Jaco , and Miles ( to name but a few ) is as fresh and relevant today as when they were active.Can the same be said of this repetitive , derivative pile of bubblegum ? Hardly.The clock is ticking , Ms. Germanotta . Your 15 minutes are almost up . You WILL fade away soon .	-1
I figured I 'd wait until nearly a year had passed tosit down and give this album a full , proper listen . I thought if the dust had settled , I 'd be able to give it a serious listen , and yes , I have made it this far without listening to front to back . Usually the comparison I make when I listen to albums , I compare them to a conversation . And this conversation ? Well , it rambled and wandered off ... but I listened , alright.Look , I will admit I am a tad biased toward Gaga , I 'll admit I hated her at first but i quickly got into The Fame album , and the Fame Monsters EP . however , I was n't pleased when I heard the lead singles off this album- the first was a Madonna ripoff and Judas sounds like something too crappy to make it onto Dance Dance Revolution.The biggest problem with this album is it 's too long , and it rambles too much . There 's 14 tracks and there do n't need to be 14 tracks- at least 25 % of the songs feel like b-sides . Not even good enough for that- I 'd call them Z-sides . All the songs sound exactly the same ! ! ! All of them have the same thump thump thump beat and while it may sound fun the first few tracks , for the rest of them it just sounds boring.There 's only a handful of tracks I really like on this disc . `` Bloody Mary '' , mainly because it reminds me of early Garbage material , and Lady Gaga sounds a lot like Shirley Manson on it . Her voice is so beautiful on it , its insane . `` Heavy Metal Lover '' is fun and quirky , delightfully naughty and just an enjoyable track all around . I also really like `` Scheisse '' , it 's funny and surprisingly has a good message too.That 's about it . `` Marry the Night '' is boring and whiny crap . We already know how much I hate the eponymous track and Judas . Government Hooker is BLAND . Hair is cheesy and awful . Actually , we already know what I 'm about to say ... If you want a good disc by a female artist , I suggest you invest in `` Blonde '' by Coeur de Pirate , `` Born to Die '' by Lana Del Rey or even the new Madonna disc . But by all means , avoid this disc . It 's boring and bland , and enough to put anyone off Gaga .	-1
the worst music from the WORST copycat in musical history . black jesus+amen fashion ? LMAO The FASHION of his love ? lmao HAIR ? LMAO SCHIBE ? old techno sounding stuff she ripped off from Human Resource . she does n't use autotune ? yeah right.. hahahaha this is TOTAL junk . crappy cover as well . ugly music from an ugly singer . do not buy . save your money . total waste .	-1
Unlike most of the reviews of `` Born This Way '' ( and many other new releases ) , this was written after sitting with the album for nearly a year . Most of the noise , both pro and con , concerning Lady Gaga currently exists in the form of hastily ejaculated , poorly punctuated ranting . I write this for people who are truly curious about this album 's sound , more specifically its place in the wider music world.Lady Gaga 's been enjoying immense success and popularity recently , building a reputation among the mostly uncritical press as a daring and original multimedia `` artiste . '' I thought Poker Face was a smart and sassy pop song , and am still impressed with the theatrical sound of Bad Romance , but I 've largely been underwhelmed with Lady Gaga 's output . Generally , her stuff falls into one of two categories : 1 ) `` not bad , but it does n't really stand out , '' or 2 ) `` this sounds WAY too much like ( past pop hit ) for my comfort ! '' She 's loads better than Katy Perry , and no worse than someone like Christina Aguilera , but I 've never understood where the fanatical obsession came from . Perhaps this is simply reflective of contemporary music culture , specifically of listeners who have abandoned earlier generations ' standards of greatness in performance , yet are still drawn like moths to the flame to worship anyone who happens to be in the spotlight , as if they were the next ( past legend ) . Whatever it may be , the fact remains that `` Born This Way '' is a largely homogeneous , forgettable affair . Many of the cuts likely sizzle in the clubs , but staying power is not the order of the day.The album 's strongest song is the opener , Marry the Night . The stomping beats and sleazy , buzzing synths make it a perfect club anthem . The problem is that , save for the modern production , it 's just a by-the-numbers Eurodance anthem from the early '90s . It 's practically begging to have a corny rap interlude ( eg : `` gon na marry the night , cuz it feels so right ; when I drive in my car , I look up at the stars , '' etc ) . It 's fun , but I 've largely heard it before ... From there , it 's more familiar territory . The title track is a shameless rip of Madonna 's Express Yourself ( Madonna herself called it `` reductive '' ) , Edge of Glory sounds a hundred other Cher-styled disco stompers , Government Hooker is a lesser version of Britney 's Gim me More , and Judas just `` sounds WAY too much like ( Bad Romance ) for my comfort . '' Most of the other songs are embarrassing exercises in style ( Americano , You & I ) , rehashes of other songs on the album ( Bloody Mary ) , or just nondescript dancefloor filler . Scheisse is kind of fun , but I doubt I 'll ever think to play it a few years from now.The production is well done , but over the course of the entire album , it feels very samey , with almost no contrast or breathing room available . The net result is a competent , effervescent pop experience that , while great for the dancefloor , is wearisome and not likely to endure the test of time.It 's obvious that Gaga has some talent , but this album shows no growth from her debut , only amplification . There may eventually be an album in her career that finally pulls me into her orbit of adoring moths , but this one is n't it .	-1
ARTPOP is still her best work of all times.Nice moments on Title Tracc , & Blacc J + A Fashion , but the rest is no good.Fly front cover thou .	-1
Madonna redux but with less interesting music . I downloaded this for 99 cents and well , that 's about how much it 's worth in my music rotation . Gaga uses the term disenfranchised a lot . Right . She is a franchise . She needs to enjoy it and capitalize on it as best she can . If she continues this derivative , mediocre club music for the masses sound , she will fizzle a bit faster than Madonna and Brittany did .	-1
I hate most of todays pop music , but every once and then there are a few songs or artist that come along with some catchy songs and grab my attention . I am not a big Ga-Ga fan , in fact I am not very familar with most of her material , but I have heard some of her other releases , and some of it is pretty good . Some is over the top cheese for me , but she has a good voice and uses some interesting samples and grooves that are very catchy . I downloaded this release thinking that I could always just dump some of the songs I didnt want , but I wound up dumping all but ONE song . Folks , this is a very bad effort . I dont know what she was thinking , but this all seems `` Rushed '' Every single track seems to use the same beat or sample , and the vocal seems like it it 10x oversampled , with the I just ran my great voice through a vocal processor so know it sounds like almost everyone else that does it in the world of todays pop . With a huge fan base , and albums that fly off the shelves , why this ? Why does this seem like its dumbed down and sounds like most of todays garbage . I guess everyone is entitled to have bad albums . Some greats have had some duds like Led Zeppelin and the Who , but..at least you could get some good songs off the bad albums , this is just B.A.D ... and I am hoping that Lady doesnt decide to go with this style for her next albums . She 's got some talent , no doubt , but thsi is just wasted..Avoid this , your not missing anything here at all .	-1
Gaga 's attempt to do something `` different '' is basically a mess of cliche done before songs that are mediocre at best . It 's kind of like a Cyndi Lauper on crack CD .	-1
Sorry , but other than one or two good tracks , I just ca n't get into this album . Had Amazon not put this for sale , I would have never purchased it .	-1
I do n't so much care or mind that Gaga wants to make a darker kind of pop than what she did on The Fame and The Fame Monster , more power to her . The problem with this record , however , is that it is so busy , overblown , overhyped , and self-indulgent that it borderlines on parody . She 's not breaking new musical territory , she 's just producing a lot of 80 's techno noise and techno beats and trying to sprinkle in religion and `` controversial '' political/religious topics to `` shock '' the listeners , which is not only boring , but irrelevant and trite . It 's very difficult to tell one song from another , because they all sound the same , especially with the repetitive `` baby '' and `` Gaga-a-a-a-a '' crutch that she constantly has to use in her songs . Her lyrics are just laughable and incomprehensible . Her album is more of a production than it is a record . Even though the Fame/Fame Monster still had a lot of filler amongst the infectious hit tunes , at least there was more to like than what we 're seeing on Born This Way . The Fame/Fame Monster was fun , but it was also quirky , different , clever , and creative without trying so hard . Born This Way is a sad attempt at trying too hard with too much noise and hype . It 's disappointing , especially from an artist who is talented enough , and famous enough , that she does n't have to try so hard to be `` different '' and `` edgy . '' Sadly , with all the talent that Lady Gaga has , she focuses more on the image/gimmick than she does on the music . Not to mention , these days she tries way too hard to force a `` message '' in her songs ( ex : Hair , Bad Kids , Born This Way ) . It 's not sincere , it 's completely self-indulgent and corny . She 's focused on producing hit singles than she is at actually writing good music . The only track that was worth more than one listen is `` You and I '' ( which to me sounds a little too much like Speechless , but at least it showcases the style of music that Gaga SHOULD be doing , showcasing those vocals , the piano skills , and the human side of Gaga ) . I hope in the future Gaga could settle with a more laid back album that displays her true musical talents than this overblow , overhyped , outdated disco/80 's nonsense . Lady Gaga DOES have talent , she CAN sing , and is a phenomenal live performer , the problem is that she chooses to create a show around her gimmick , image , and `` controversial '' statements than on her vocals and her talent .	-1
The problem with this album is Lady Gaga does n't want to lose her pop music fans but she wants to be alternative and original at the same time . So everything gets messed up . She wants to give everything in one box . But the box does n't carry as much as she wants so things drop out : techno , rock , dance , electronic music .. she wants to be perfect it seems , every track was worked with effort . Gaga wants everybody listens to her music , she tries to take attention of all music listeners . She wants to be a legend , you can understand it with this effort.But it does n't work ; There are so many `` stolen '' melodies from 80 's and 90 's . In some songs pop arrangements are very powerful but they are simple and ordinary , there 's nothing new in it . The album makes you tired and full of hard techno ryhtms almost same in every song . You get excited with `` marry the night '' at the begining but you lose this excitement after ; even if you do n't want to . Gaga also wants to give social messages but this is not a concept album at the same time . It 's like `` i want to tell you this this this , do this this this '' , with `` born this way '' , `` hair '' , `` bad kids '' .. and when it 's done ; `` well lets forget it and back to have fun again '' , with `` government hooker '' , `` heavy metal lover '' etc.. every song is different from each other so you can not get what Gaga really wants to tell.Also , the album is too long when it does n't need to be . Because there is no special instrumantation . Acoustic instruments lost their way in songs because of the hard techno , they can not flow together . Rock songs and electro guitar solo arrangements do n't sound fresh . The guitar solo melodies are like they were written in 1980 's . so where 's the originality ? her debut and then the fame monster were presenting more clear and certain sound and they had a concept . but btw does not have that clear presentation although it has more messages and although the changes she had through.I like Lady Gaga . She is a great artist . Born This Way is a very good pop album especially comparing with other pop albums of current time . But we need to be honest , this is not ground breaking album and definitely `` not '' the album of decade . The most successful albums in history are generally `` concept '' albums and the albums that have great instrumantation . But Born This Way is a product of scatter , confused mind .	-1
This album is very chart pop friendly and safe , but lacking that musicianship and songwriting that Duran had even when they were top of the charts with Rio.A song by song analysis has been done to death in many places and this album does n't deserve that . There 's nothing here that has n't been done and heard before . Ronson is an inexperienced media darling sensation and has contributed nothing to Duran Duran . He merely uses Duran as a vehicle to indulge in his ongoing 80s and personal childhood obsession . And Duran were seduced by his enthusiasm as they were by Timbaland 's hype.Fans of good music would do well to ignore the overwhelming number of positive reviews which are posted by Duran 's core fanbase , who are more into Duran 's importance and place in music and chart history for their own egoistic reasons than in Duran 's quality which has n't been seen in more than a decade.Buy Rio , Notorious , Big Thing and the debut . Ignore this unless you love modern day chart pap and everything American idol/boyband/sitcom soundtracks and lame .	-1
Let me start by saying i like him as an artist . However , wTF WTF , How many more cd 's can he make that sound like stuff from the 60 's . I like when he makes more funky type of music . HE still sings , and plays good . It 's hard to get into this , it 's like Ce-lo but down a few levels , and we know he can do better . I listen to this 3 times and just can not get in to it . Now i like Beastie boys new CD , but can not get into this at all . Sorry , I still think he has talent .	-1
Raphael Saadiq is cool and I love his style/voice . Tony Toni Tone is classic material and I also loved his Lucy Pearl release and his banger solo releases `` Instant Vintage '' and `` The Way I See It '' . I would love Raphael Saadiq to move on and start to do good ol Neo Soul again . This guy is a genius and should n't be stuck in the 60s . Do n't get me wrong , `` Go To Hell '' an `` Movin ' Down The Line '' are cool , but Raphael Saadiq has done his Throwback album with `` The Way I See It '' and there is no need to do it again .	-1
Fleet Foxes on `` Helplessness Blues '' channels a sunshine-pop sound spawned by the likes of the Mamas & the Papas and Beach Boys , and injects its own vibrant personality , fragile and haunting on the lovelorn `` Lorelai '' ; wild and wispy as `` Harvest Moon '' -era Neil Young on the title track ; stark and fierce as a mountaintop blizzard on `` Sim Sala Bim , '' a bluesy tune that conjures the mournful side of Led Zeppelin.I 'm kidding , of course ... Because when I attempted to listen to these Lady Gagas of stoner folk after I had run out of weed , and sensation flowed back into my brain cells , I lost that spirit of kismet with Kermit the Frog . That lime-green glove had been mocking me from the TV screen the whole time . I know what you 're thinking , but it 's not smoking marijuana that makes me paranoid , it 's the constant fretting over where my next high is going to be coming from that gives me The Fear.Anyway , the more I listened to these bearded Johnny Appleseeds , the more I felt like some pteromechanophobic John Denver strapped to the back of Falkor the luckdragon on a fetid journey above a `` What Dreams May Come '' land of unicorns pooping rainbows . Dear Gandalf , keep these spiders from spinning their splintery cocoons inside my eyeballs , I thought-screamed , as I was force-fed toe-jam cotton candy by my `` nurses. '' P.S . : I 'm actually hip enough to realize that stuck in the middle of this Elfquest soundtrack is a gem of a song called `` The Shrine/An Argument , '' but since life is black and white and never gray , it still gets the one star . Sorry , nobody ever said it was going to be easy .	-1
I 've been reading the glowing reviews of this latest Fleet Foxes recording and I was very intrigued . I must be the only person in the world who has n't heard the first album . Helplessness Blues is my introduction to the band and I really wanted to like it . The recording is lush and beautifully produced . The harmony singing and certain instrumental passages can be quite captivating at times . The Cascades is a really pretty , short instrumental piece . Blue Spotted-Tail is wonderful , mostly because of the simplicity of the acoustic guitar and melody line . But the problem for me , despite the clear effort that 's gone into this disc , is that it just does n't hang together very well as an album . Fleet Foxes have assembled a veritable pastiche of sounds that remind one -- too obviously at times -- of Crosby , Stills and Nash , the Beach Boys , even Simon and Garfunkel . There 's too much of a grand statement trying too grandly to be made . Also , Robin Pecknold 's voice is fine when it is surrounded by others in harmony , but is a bit too keening on its own . Anyway , I guess this is n't exactly my cup of tea , but I appreciate what Fleet Foxes are trying to do . I would encourage folks who are drawn to this type of music to check out the album Wake Up by indie Ottawa band Dry River Caravan . That one 's really worth seeking out !	-1
I 've been following Fleet Foxes since their debut came out , and I could n't get into really liking them . It 's no different in this case , though I did give it time to grow on me . Their sound is reminiscent of The Eagles , Crosby Stills Nash & Young , among others , none of which I care about too much . So , I have to be honest , and say I would n't even give it 3 stars . If you happen to love the above stated bands , you might disagree with me ( and that 's okay ) .	-1
The continuum here is from Beach Boys ( Phil Spector ) production to Paul Simon 's vocal delivery . Only , we 're stuck with songs where the singer asks why the earth revolves around the sun . Stuck in prog 's past , you wish there was some fresh idea outside of the failed free jazz experiment of `` The Shrine/An Argument . '' Pretentious song titles aside , why has no one written about the outright theft of Bob Dylan 's `` Fourth Time Around '' which magically appears , guitar melody and all , in `` Lorelai . '' Maybe they 'll settle out of court or at least give Bob the songwriting credit it deserves . In the end , the Crosby , Stills , and Nash albums are not very good either . Musically , this seems as uninteresting as their first . Then again , I did n't care for The Association 's `` Windy '' or `` Cherish '' either .	-1
I loved The Sounds ' other albums . This is a huge disappointment , the sound of a band so desperate to `` make it '' in the states that they will jump on any bandwagon . The songwriting is awful ( literally 2 out of the first 3 songs are those `` 4 chords '' that everyone parodies and commercial advertisement use to sell things on TV ) . I heard that they broke up after this one -- just as well .	-1
It 's not that I 'm against The White Stripes , I just do n't prefer that kind of sound from The Kills . I very much loved Midnight Boom , but this one does n't work for me at all , so it 's a disapointment .	-1
To pull the minimalist thing off you need either to have the vox to carry the day , or the riffs -- or even , a sense of tune -- to make one want more . Lyically , not much happening here , to little surprise . The percussive additions make this less interesting than it requires -- see the XX . The result is something much less than the White Stripes , or even the Black Keys . I ca n't help thinking the guitarist could use a few lessons from Dan Auerbach , or at least take a vacation in Mississippi Delta ( like Auerbach did ) to improve his chops . But hey , they did it for one song on the last album . Still , too few moments here : `` Baby Says . ''	-1
I 'm not sure how RADIOHEAD manages to keep up the facade that they 're the new 'PINK FLOYD ' . Over the past several releases they 've managed to become a joke -- no hit wonders who make outrageous claims about themselves . This album continues that 'tradition ' and perpetuates RADIOHEAD 's reputation for silly hype . PINK FLOYD were highly experimental , but built and retained an audience by channeling their creativity into actual songs -- a display of genius which RADIOHEAD only hinted at with ( on OK Computer , nearly 20 years ago ) .There are no memorable or even intriguing 'songs ' here , just a collection of odd and unusual sounding radio-unfriendly musical compositions that go no place ( and also seem to last forever even though they 're only a few minutes long ) .Some people call this sort of unlistenable music with no catchy or memorable lyrics 'experimental ' and 'progressive ' ( they 're the same bunch who call spashed-paint-on-canvas 'cutting edge art ' or random assemblages of stuff-found-in-a-junkyard 'modern scultpure ' ) . Terms like 'progressive ' and 'experimental ' have little meaning in the context of RADIOHEAD , who have been repeating a formula and pattern for nearly 15 years : there is no evidence of experimentation or progression . If RADIOHEAD wants to really be radically experimental and progressive , perhaps they could try and write an actual song some day ( you know , with a melody , rhthym , lyrics , and all those other things that used to be called music ) .As long as acts like RADIOHEAD are what the music industry relies on to stimulate cash flows , they can look forward to future declines in sales as audience-seeking media shun contemporary music because it turns away customers .	-1
Let 's get real . Radiohead WAS one of the most promising rock bands to come along in a very long time and then they just dropped the ball . We all know their music is faux-artsy crap now , right ? C'mon , people , just admit it.These guys are not gods . Just open your eyes and see them for what they are . Faulty humans who could n't live up to their potential so they just decided to go the `` we 're so creative and genius-like that we dare you to follow us into our murky world of nothing-ness and mumbly , blippy , gaget-y , computer world of non-music '' route . They 're like an indie movie that thinks it 's soooooo arty and cool and you try to keep up and understand what 's going on but you know that the reason it does n't make sense to you is because it does n't make sense at all , but you 're too afraid to admit that because you do n't want anyone to think you 're not cool so you bob your head and agree like a lemming who might as well be a fan of the next big budget pile of crap Hollywood pumps out weekly because you are no more original in thought than the average joe who consumes whatever is force fed to him/her anyway.Radiohead 's last few albums have all had the same crappy , crunchy , lo-fi plodding drums , melancholic `` melodies '' , same isolated post-apocalyptic lyrics which are mumbled and jumbled and meaningless.Maybe Radiohead is saying that rock music is meaningless . Who gives a flying ... ck.The Bends , OK Computer , some of Kid A and Amnesiac were GREAT . Then they just started believing in their own `` myth '' whatever that is . In my HUMBLE OPINION , the myth is that their music does n't suck . It sucks . Simple as that . Rock music should n't be this boring . Sorry , Boring with a capital B .	-1
As a Radiohead fan , one ca n't help but make allowances for the band 's ever-changing sound ; it 's become Radiohead 's defining attribute . `` In Rainbows '' was a fantastic outing beyond its pay-what-you-want approach ; it was a well-grounded , relaxed , heavily-textured album , possibly their best since `` Kid A '' , but `` King of Limbs '' is not much to write home about . That 's saying a lot too ; even `` Amnesiac '' was something to write home about.In the album 's defense , I think Stanley Donwood ( the band 's artist ) put it best when he compared `` KOL '' to a transitional snapshot ... because that 's exactly what it is . However , it 's one of the band 's most forgettable snapshots . Not a whole lot stands out , even when the record is on a loop . Granted , there are at least 3 good songs featured : `` Lotus Flower '' and the back-to-back nature-centric tracks `` Codex '' and `` Give Up the Ghost '' , but the remaining songs are just meandering , minimalist collages of chopped up beats and fleeting guitar riffs . It 's not like we have n't heard this kind of stuff before either , but not with this much frequency . This would n't be much of an issue if it did n't take up more than half of the record 's 38 minute runtime and bury the aforementioned songs.As with all of Radiohead 's releases , I 've played the whole thing several times because I wanted to give the record a chance to reveal itself . It took me several listens to fully appreciate `` Amnesiac '' , which is the closest thing I can compare `` KOL '' to . While that record had the benefit of being a companion piece to `` Kid A '' , this record unfortunately comes off as an afterthought . If anything , `` KOL '' is basically Radiohead at the crossroads , and it was probably never meant to be taken for more than what it is -- a record to simply bridge the gap . There 's no telling where they 'll go after this , but the next proper LP ( or EP ? ) will most likely be an improvement .	-1
If Thom Yorke stuck his head in an oh so deep mud puddle and blew real hard into the murky depths would the resultant recorded sound be considered brilliant music by the Radiohead faithful ? I suspect so . And that my dears is the problem with Radiohead in 2011 and the new album The King of Limbs . Clocking in at under 38 minutes and with a scant 8 tracks this would have been a nice book-end companion to Yorke 's failed solo album The Eraser . At this stage in their career Radiohead can put out just about anything and it will be gobbled up by the faithful like mother 's milk . So , I 'll confess , I 'm an OK Computer Radiohead guy . I love that album . Give me some more guitar fellas , and leave out all the incessant crackling , blipping , and noodling . Much ado about nothing , I say . But let 's get down to a track by track assessment to be fair . Bloom starts things off not badly , except for the annoying crackling and popping nonsense built into the percussive effects . A bit of almost classical piano , horns and a trancey feel to this tune . It 's OK . Morning Mr. Magpie is more interesting , funky and the guitars chime . I think the way Yorke sings in a cooing way is rather fetching . I quite enjoy the lines `` You Stole it , give it back '' -- or something like that . Further along `` You know you should , but you do n't '' is sung in an out there way that is appealing on a number of levels . The birds chirping at the end -- if those are real birds -- beats computerized bleeps and beeps any day . The next track Little by Little also has guitar , which is encouraging . I like the trippy vibe on this one . Feral is , well , feral . Actually this `` song '' is really brutal and epitomizes what 's wrong with Radiohead these days . Repetitive nonsense and noise . Press skip and move on . Lotus Flower , which I guess is the single , shows the album moving in a better direction . The reverb-drenched chorus is cool . But this track does meander a bit musically and lyrically . Codex is suberb ! The piano is lovely , as are the strings . The song is a slow burner . Yorke intones fairly sweetly on Codex : `` Glide on ... jump off the edge into a cool lake . '' Indeed ; more please ! At this point the album has me hooked-in again , briefly . Give Up the Ghost is a wondrous thing . There 's acoustic guitar on this song . Like Codex this one just seems to evolve as it goes . The layering of the vocals is particularly effective on this tune and it has an almost , dare I say it , pastoral feel . Separator , the album closer , is a return to the same rather ordinary beats . Not bad , I guess . So 9 albums in Radiohead seems to have found itself in a deep rut and it 's one that they may never get out of . You know I ca n't understand why a band like Radiohead -- with such a thin catalogue of really good music -- can still sell millions of albums while a truly great band like Australia 's The Church languishes in relative obscurity . Folks , if you are reading this review and you like guitar-based alternative rock check out The Church 's brilliant 23 studio albums . Now , there 's a band with legs and enduring greatness .	-1
I 've been a Radiohead fan since the `` Amnesiac '' era , ever since I was given a disc with a medley of songs from OK Computer , Kid A , and the `` new one '' , Amnesiac . I wore that CD-R out and I went out and bought OK Computer - I instantly fell in love . I soon bought every Radiohead CD available.They have been experimenting and expanding their catalog of sounds and structures ever since then , and I have respected them for that.When In Rainbows came out , I was floored . I loved it . I read the reviews for King Of Limbs on here and I thought , `` Could it really be that bad ? `` I bought the disc regardless and have listened to it a few times , enough to get used to it . Here are my thoughts.You are NOT going to like it if :1 ) You are expecting hooks to draw you in ; like a bursting chorus line , melodic verses , or addictive guitar lines.2 ) You are in love with Radiohead 's last release `` In Rainbows '' , and are expecting this album to provide similar results.3 ) You do not like electronica.You ARE going to like it if :1 ) You like electronica.2 ) You are a huge fan of Thom Yorke 's `` Eraser '' 3 ) You are a sold-out Radiohead fan that will like what they put out no matter what.I belong in the former camp . I was not impressed and I was actually , if I dare say it , bored with the record . Call me narrowminded , call me tasteless , call me un-artful . I did n't like it . There was nothing catchy enough to keep my attention , and nothing for my ears or emotions to hold on to . I do n't mind the beats and the blurps - but please , they have to be catchy.To me , this record sounded like static , a ghostly megaphone , and a snare loop stuck on repeat.Every song sounds like a variant of `` The Gloaming '' from Hail To The Theif ( with the exception of `` Codex '' and `` Give Up The Ghost '' ) . It was my least favorite song from the band , and since this record sounds like several of them , it is my least favorite record .	-1
I get that nobody criticizes Radiohead . I get that their fans regard them as little rock gods who can do no wrong . I get it . Yes , I do . And if I ever get tired of life and slide into a permanent suicidal slump I , too , will jump on the Radiohead Melancholy Bus before it eventually drives over the cliff and lands in hell . There . I said it . Sue me . It should be illegal to create cacophony this stupid and call it music .	-1
Now that Radiohead have put out more albums of casio keyboard styled low-fi laptop pop music than they have of the thought provoking british rock I fell in love with ... I guess I 'm just not a fan anymore . I respect these guys for doing things on their own terms ... but I just do n't get anything out of this style . For that , maybe it 's not fair for me to review this album . But as a fan that was clinging to the hope that these guys would put down the computers in favor of guitars or that Thom Yorke would actually really sing again , frankly I 'm once again disappointed . And I 'm just not sure I 'll waste my time on the next album . Maybe Radiohead is still good and I just do n't get this style . I really do n't know . But speaking on behalf of those that loved Pablo Honey , The Bends and Ok Computer ... this is just another album that does n't deserve to be part of that same catalog . If you 're a fan of the albums that followed Ok Computer , and you 're looking for more of the same ... well , here ya go .	-1
There comes a time in every artists ' career when they run out of ideas . Similar to an athlete on our favorite team , it 's difficult to believe that there may a limit to the talent of those we cheer on . Radiohead had two incredible albums , and two good ones , but it appears as though they 're done . This album provides evidence that they ca n't come up with incredible and inventive songs anymore within the traditional song structure , and they 've been moving in this direction in the last couple of albums ( I write to those that respond that it 's just one album . ) Kurt Cobain said , `` Pro Tools and studio effects can enhance a song , and there 's nothing wrong with using them for that , as long as you can play those same songs without the enhancement . '' Radiohead will get four stars from critics and fans alike , no matter what they do , but can anyone say that the songs on this album could be played without enhancement ? They 're done . They 've overstayed . It 's time to move on .	-1
KING OF LIMBS IS RADIOHEAD 'S NEW ALBUM AUTOMATICALLY I GET EXCITED FOR A NEW RELEASE FROM MY FAVORITE BANDS , AND RADIOHEAD BEING ONE OF COURSE I HAD TO GET IT . FROM THE FIRST LISTEN YOUR NOT SURE IF YOUR GON NA LIKE THIS ALBUM THE QUIET GLOOMY SOUND OF THE RECORD IS SOMETHING YOU LOVE ABOUT LATER RADIOHEAD BUT IN THIS ALBUM RADIOHEAD DOES N'T QUITE DO THAT INSTEAD IT LET ME DOWN WONDERING IF ITS 10 DIFFERENT SONGS OR ONE LONG SONG WHICH IS HOW KING OF LIMBS SOUNDS LIKE . THE ONLY SONG THAT GAVE IT SOME LIFE IS THE SINGLE `` LOTUS FLOWER '' THE REST IS JUST BLAH .	-1
I long for the days when a new radiohead record would be a mindblowing experience ( think the bends , ok computer or kid a . ) In rainbows was an unqualified masterpiece that required patience . It revealed itself slowly ; its subtle brilliance blossoming like a slow coloured sunrise . King of limbs may eventually reward the listener like in rainbows but I doubt it.TKOL 's first half has a kid a synth , purcussive feel to it . It sounds stale and boring when compared to the alpha kid . They 've been there and done that . The second half morphs into a more flowing and beautiful sound . Codex is brilliant . In rainbows contained a half dozen songs as good.I do n't think The king of limbs is a bad record . At this point of their career , Radiohead is incapable of making lousy music . They just have n't made anything innovative and truly exciting in years . Radiohead 's 2 stars would be 4 stars for anyone else . That 's the problem with the standard they have set : A listener expects to see plenty of stars in the black canvas/sky of radiohead 's brilliance .	-1
*phone ringing*Thom : Hello ? Studio Execs : Yo , Thom we have an idea for you guys ' next albumThom : What ? SE : Some guy who plays around with a music software sent us these boring Electro tracks and you should sing over them.Thom : But what about the other guys ? SE : Oh do n't worry , this 'll sell millions of records and get praise , especially from Pitchfork ! ! ! Thom : ... art ... Pitchfork Media ... sure , I 'll do it .	-1
Sounds like an EP of B-sides ... only 8 songs , all of them under-developed and uninteresting . I love Radiohead , but this is as bad as Amnesiac . If you liked Amnesiac , you 'll still feel ripped-off if you buy this ! What a let down after In Rainbows .	-1
A programmed Casio organ , a drum machine , and a singer droning on with a high pitched voice , that 's about it . I am not a Radiohead novice , have heard all of their albums and I just have never shined to the course they took after their first three albums . The music is not complex , is not entertaining , is just not that good . I know their fans are fanatics and see everything they do as great , so I suppose I am not a real fan .	-1
Come on Radiohead - give us some pop like OK Computer and The Bends ! I think we 've all had just about enough of your experimental stuff now . One or 2 experimental albums are fine , but it 's starting to get ridiculous . Your latest album is hardly listenable.Frankly , we are all ready for some pop again .	-1
It 's over . I do n't know if it was because of Benjamin Orr not being in this album or if it just that the guys have gone out of `` creativity fuel '' but this is one of the worst comeback albums I have heard . Even when they were not at their peak , the album Door to Door was a great one and had quite a few ( like 5 ) great and distinctive songs . This album got none . Their tracks are not even B-side of filler material . Uninspired songs , generic hooks and boring and predictable choruses . `` Sad Song '' and `` Free '' are barely good tracks but not the kind of stuff you should expect for such a great , catchy and innovative group The Cars were . If this album was made by a unknown group waiting for it 's debut no one would even have cared about . I highly respect The Cars and Rik Ocasek is still one of my 80 's musical hero so this album to me is like it never existed . It better be .	-1
I initially loved this song . But it got way too over-played on the radio and I believe has become over-rated entirely . She 's a great artist and has an amazing voice but is beginning to annoy me with each of her singles being way too over-played .	-1
Death Cab 's newest album Codes And Keys is a disappointment if you are a fan of Plans , Narrow Stairs and The Open Door EP like me -- this album is plain and boring in comparison . With a serious lack of enjoyable acoustic rhythm guitar , original lyrics and a shift toward uninteresting , piano driven droning , Codes is a depressing and vapid listen . Death Cab 's use of ambient sound and darker themes in albums past worked well because of the band 's ability to craft melody and depth into their tracks , like with `` Summer Skin '' and `` I Will Possess Your Heart . '' The construction of this album is much darker and missing the likable guitar hooks of songs like `` Crooked Teeth '' and `` Cath . '' Ben Gibbard 's lyrics and delivery fit snuggly into the mold that he has created over the band 's last 3 releases , but this album lacks the originality needed to leave the listener feeling like this release is a worth-while addition to the DCFC collection.While this album is Death Cab 's worst in recent years , the songs `` Codes and Keys '' and `` Your Are a Tourist '' are worth downloading .	-1
