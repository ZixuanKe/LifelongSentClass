This show has made me realize what our fire dept . does for us . It has a good story line and very interesting characters .	1
Like the parlay between various characters . The action is very stimulating and keeps your interest . Hope this show keeps on going .	1
I will watch Jesse Spencer and Taylor Kinney in anything . I was n't sure what their chemistry would be together but they have made & # 34 ; Chicago Fire & # 34 ; into a most loved new show for me . The whole cast is wonderful and each character has their own storyline weaved beautifully into a modern day firehouse and all that happens on and off the job . I have n't met anyone who watches weekly who does n't love it .	1
greatest fire station show ever ! ! ! ! hope they never cancel it ... amazing , amazing , amazing . cant say enough good things about it . very family friendly ! ! !	1
I am still relatively young into this new series , but what I have seen I am impressed . I only gave it four stars because I have't seenenough yet to be really critical . I find the action accurate , the cast very good ( especially the women ) and it holds my interest fromstart to finish . I like especially the occasional connection with CHICAGO PD and the inter relationships between the two depts.I am a little disturbed by some political correctness is the emphasis of women as firemen ; something I am against for physical as wellas psychological reasons . Still , the cast is very good and I like everyone I have seen on both shows . And the women do their jobswell . I need to see more to judge more critically but I think I am going to like these shows . FIRE is a good change of pace fromall the other ( some mediocre ) crime and action shows . My other favorites are CASTLE , BONES & THE MENTALIST . But please , no more Dr Sweets ! ! As one who was born in Illinois and started out in Chicago , I am glad to see more shows set in the Big Town ; Indeed , it is My Kind of Town . Of course I love NY where I live too . Everything I get I buy from Amazon .	1
Season 2 picks up with an arsonist who is targeting the firehouse . Meanwhile , Lt. Matthew Casey ( Jesse Spencer ) becomes the temporary guardian of the two young sons of fallen firefighter Andy Darden after their mother is arrested for DUI-related manslaughter.Mouch ( Christian Stolte ) runs for union president , while Christopher Herrmann ( David Eigenberg ) , Gabriela Dawson ( Monica Raymund ) and Otis ( Yuri Sardarov ) struggle to keep Molly 's afloat while a mobster threatens the bar . Lt. Kelly Severide ( Taylor Kinney ) meets a relative he never knew existed , and Dawson decides to take the firefighter 's test -- among many other storylines ! One thing is for certain - no matter what , the lives of the team at 51 are always action-packed , both personally and on the job . Together with Chicago PD , the first-season show that developed this season and now crosses over frequently with Chicago Fire , you 're guaranteed to be hooked and waiting to see what happens next .	1
I love the show . It is an excitingly mastered script . I hope it continues for a long time . The writers never let it get dull .	1
Another great television fire series I like the cast and I think acting is great . I think it 's better than rescue Me . And I also like the way the show combines with Chicago PD . I hope that they get a number of seasons out of this one .	1
Realistic situations - you start to & # 34 ; love & # 34 ; the quirks of each character.So happy to see a solid dramatic series on TV	1
Parallel plots make this an engaging show to watch . Gives one a great deal of respect for those who risk their own safety on the public 's behalf .	1
Just over all great stories and characters . True to life and adventure . Looking forward to next season . Check it out .	1
Story is okwatch it every time it is onMy tv lets me tape anything and as much as I want so I do not miss my shows	1
The characters are well drawn . Great acting . The fire and rescue scenes are very realistic and sometimes gut wrenching . Intense .	1
Superb acting -- I especially like Taylor Kinney , believable , taut storylines . As an observant Jew , I find the homosexual storyline explicit and distasteful . In general , the promiscuity portrayed is troublesome . The drama , the courage the firefighters exhibit , the sacrifices they make are inspiring .	1
This is a show I never get tired of watching . It has a great storyline with plenty of twists and turns . You fall in love with the characters and you look forward to the next episode !	1
A great escape ! Really glad this show is making it . Similar to the days of ER , it 's just good , enjoyable TV .	1
I have enjoyed watching this show , but have waited forever for Casey and Dawson to get together . Amazon Prime lets me buy the selected episodes I am interested in watching without having to pay for the other ones that do n't interest me .	1
I fell in love with this show immediately . I had missed several shows so it was great to have access to the entire season on Amazon .	1
Every week keeps getting better and it was already great to begin with ! ! Hate that the show ends each week ... ca n't wait til the next show ! !	1
It 's getting better and better than the last season . Keep it coming . But I 'm at little mad that my captain is leaving .	1
Silence of the Lambs anyone ? What a ride this one was . I was on the edge of my sofa until the end . Social media steered me wrong , now what ? William Lewis are you gone or will you reappear in another episode , somehow , somewhere . Great acting job on Pablo Schreiber . He 's been on this show and other Law and Order , but never quite this scary . What will happen to Olivia ? ? ? ? So many questions . Still surprising me after all these years .	1
As always great ! ! This is the perfect way to watch what I have missed for a small fee . Just to stay current on this program .	1
Love this show . Ca n't get enough of it . I want Olivia and Nick to get together . Still wish Stabler was on it but it still an excellent show even without him . Love all the crime and drama .	1
This has always been a favorite series and remains so even in it 's 15th season . Lots of loves and laughs .	1
Needs more Cassidy ! Love this show . Could use a little less Rollins , a lot less Amaro . More Tutaruo and Cassidy !	1
I 'm always been in love with this show from the beginning and even more now . I love the way the twist and turns that make the show more interesting to watch . I thank the writers for the vision that given to you . Keep it coming	1
I 'd typically say this is a 5-star show but as with last season i 've only rated it 4. it 's still a great show , with fantastic writing but it does seem clear that they are at a tipping point and the show could go one way or another . there are some interesting plot twists ocurring that give me reason to feel like the show will get back to their greatness . If you 've watched the show before you 'll like this season , if you have n't seen the show before I 'd recommend starting from season 1	1
The Parks and Recreation Department employees in the fictional mid-western town of Pawnee manage to get themselves into and out of ridiculous situations every week . This is usually due to the whacky logic and misplaced enthusiasm of the Deputy Director as played by the talented Amy Pohelr . This show is consistently amusing , but seldom laugh out loud funny . The leads are usually good although the departure of Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe created a gap that has yet to be successfully filled . The supporting cast is also good and the production values are low budget but OK . However , the writing seldom rises to the level of shows like & # 34 ; The Office & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Big Bang Theory & # 34 ; . All that said , it still remains notably above the level of most TV comedy .	1
Pretty damn funny show . my favorite is Ron Swanson for sure . with his extreme libertarian ways , Definitely still funny into their 6th season . probably still have a few more in them i would guess .	1
The best sitcom ever . Not only is it laugh out loud hilarious but the thing I love the most is how hopeful it is . These people truly care about each other and their community . It is great example of how much better government works the smaller it is and the closer it is to the people . If every government worker was like Leslie Knope , we would LITERALLY be so much better off as communities , cities , states and as a country .	1
Love this show . It always keeps me laughing . I love all the characters , which is n't easy to do . I also love the progression of the story line . Just an all around great show .	1
Who does n't love humor ? If you do n't then go away and be a sourpuss alone . The rest of us will be laughing our butts off .	1
Sharp does n't describe the wit and humor . I know actors are leaving the show but I hope this one goes on for a long time ...	1
This episode was sweeter than Leslie Knope 's favorite waffles . Mmmm , wafffffles ! It was fun to see the cast go somewhere new & try different things . There is an awkward Heidi Klum cameo , but it 's still kind of funny . Ben & Andy meet this British philanthropist and that was one of my favorite parts ! Ron Swanson has some adventures & ... ca n't reveal ! & # 60 ; & # 60 ; SPOILER & # 62 ; & # 62 ; I wo n't ruin it for you . : ) ) ) It 's just a great episode where a lot of important life-changes happen to the gang , and it 's hilarious as usual . I could have used more of & # 34 ; Treat Yo ' Self & # 34 ; day , though . I can always enjoy more of that , and Tommy Fresh Cologne .	1
You 'll have to watch it to understand the title.Often Bones ( specifically the character of Dr. Brennen ) irritates me because she can be so arrogant and ignorant of others feelings . I had considered giving up the show for this reason . Not only is it irritating , it 's a really bad depiction of highly intelligent people who are often very humble.However , in this episode , we get to see a different much more caring side of Bones . Booth is the jerk this time . The character development is excellent and as always , the science is fairly solid . I 'd recommend it ... .	1
eagerly anticipated this season to see what happened with the marriage proposal situation . good stuff , enjoyed the following episodes -this time we actually bought the online episodes when we usually just wait until the full season comes out	1
This is the best season SO FAR . On some shows when the sexual tension Is released or goes on too long between the main characters the show gets stupid or stale . The fact that there could be life , and one of their best seasons ( been a devoted fan since season 1 episode 1 ) after marriage indicates that this is a true murder mystery show and that the other characters are much more than mere sidekicks .	1
i alway love the show and it just a great story line and it alway something new and never got bored with this show !	1
Each season of Bones just gets better and better . Ca n't wait to see what the writers come up with in the next seasons of the show .	1
I really lone this series . I have noticed that Booth is much more protective if Temperance since the baby was born . I was thrilled by her taking a high hand , and getting her needs and wishes attended to in both getting things done at the barn ( for birthing ) NOW ! I love the whole series and 9 is not an exception . I look forward to more seasons . The characters have grown in their capabilities and relationships . It is somewhat rare that people in the work place grow at the same pace , much less continue bonding closer as their individual lives become Moore complex . Am very much looking forward to Dr. Sweets evolving into a stronger persona as he has aged . He 's very astute , and it would be pleasing if he were to receive meatier parts that try all the characters indifferent ways .	1
Bones is a great show very entertaining and a multitude of different relationships going on throughout the show . It is a very entertaining weekly drama with a nice back story to it . It shares circumstances that have happen over the prior seasons . A great show to watch . The first few minutes tend to be kind of graphic so I suggest not watching while eating .	1
I was afraid that this show had finally jumped the shark with season 8 , but it seems like it has revived itself for season 9 ! They finally decided to end the recurring episodes featuring the evil computer hacker , which were seriously lame . Yay ! ! !	1
So far , we are enjoying this season more than the past season or so . Occasionally , the episodes still get a little silly/trivial . But mostly , we really enjoy the show .	1
It is one of the best seasons so far and I would recommend it to everyone I know . Thank you .	1
Started watching this season and I sm hook . What s great show . I love all the characters . They are all funny .	1
Some folks might think this show has gotten a bit stale , but I still f=very much enjoy the interactions of the characters . The stories are still quite well written and thought out .	1
Without giving away this episode 's make-up , I am glad that a case has finally been wrapped up and that movement forward in the world of the team can be now focused on . I do hope that the series keeps up with the action and drama that it has been famous for ... ..ahh yes and including the pundits and humor that they have developed over the years . Can not wait to see what is next in store for the team and wish all the actors , writers , directors , producers , and the individuals who are behind the scenes of this series ( camera men/women , sound developers , gaffs and all the others ) a great big thanks for finding new ways to keep this series appealing to the many of us fans who seek to follow the fictional lives of this show .	1
And it just keeps getting better . Finally , putting Bones and Booth together has made it even more fun to watch . They are absolutely perfect for each other .	1
We like that there is a complete story in each episode versus the soap opera approach . There is continuity of the situation- relationships etc . but the crime has a beginning and a solution . The technology may be bit in the future for some of the modeling but it is fascinating and the range of roles and situations are intriguing . the personalities keep you interested .	1
Loving this show ! ! ! ! This show has not gotten boring or played out . I enjoy every show and season nine is just as good as season one .	1
I really enjoy season 9 , the characters are well developed and the story lines more realistic . Good acting , good fun !	1
David Boreanaz is great in his role , as well as the supporting cast . The gal who plays 'bones ' I applaud for really doing her character well - a whole lot of scientific jargon and she delivers as easily as Sheldon Cooper . I just could never get over how an Anthropologist -even a Forensic one- could be so totally clueless about interacting with other humans . Even in a basic anthropology class you learn how important how people interacted with each other in order to form the most accurate representation of how a society or culture functioned . In Bones ' case , she admitted that her interest in humanity stopped before the industrial age . I just do n't get the level of ignorance in someone so brilliant . Any-who . Great entertainment if you can look past the gory bits . Binge-watched every season through current and loved all the episodes .	1
I really enjoy the interaction of the characters in this show . So much I wanted to purchase this series to enjoy much later like Sunday movie day !	1
As an avid television watcher , I find that this show compels me to return . Not only do I watch it when it airs , but I return to watch it several times on Amazon .	1
And more forensics , which is why I tune in to the show . It 's the mystery and it 's the science coming together that I enjoy the most . I just wish the writers would have less personal drama going on -- it 's just a distraction ! The characters do n't just have the usual ups and downs of life , they have big-time crises and agonizing emotional experiences , which can be so painful to watch that sometimes I just fast-forward past these tangents and get back to the case their working on . Whenever I tune in , I 'm a little tense , wondering what kind of bomb is going to dropped on one of the regulars , or their guest stars , this time . Ugh ! Less soap opera and more engaging forensic science , please !	1
The only two television shows that I watch religiously are DWTS and Bones . The plots are always imaginatively written with attention holding drama and enough humor thrown in to keep the characters interesting . The cast has become like an extended family . The writers ' have created the nine or so assistants to Brennan with the same depth as the other characters . I would like to see more of Caroline Julian and my favorite assistant & # 34 ; squint & # 34 ; is Abernathy Finn . Dr. Sweet 's needs a love interest ; someone to challenge his never ending character analysis . I would like to see Hodgins retrieve his fortune in a unusual and challenging method with a bit of humor added and not happen in just one episode ; over 3-4 episodes for the intrigue aspect .	1
I LOVE BOOTH AND BRENNAN . I love the changes Dr. Brennan has gone through in her demeanor since the first season and yet she still remains essentially herself . I mean just look at the last episode . lol	1
another great season , hope they never cancel it , it could go on and on forever and i will always buy the seasons , amazing amazing amazing ! this season is the best season yet . i dont think Pilant is dead i think he will resurface at the wedding as promised when he knows bones will never be his . I cant wait for each episode	1
I have been waiting on pins and needles for the new season . And I was not disappointed . I was glad to see Booth sort explain to Brennan that hestill wants to marry her and will ask her at the proper time . If course Pelant must have been listening or watching from the clock mounted under thecabinets . It is odd that since Booth knows Pelant is a electronics wizard and can hack into just about any video system and watch people , that Boothnever had the FBI come and run a electronic screening of his house . He knew from previous episodes that Pelant his been in his house ; he changed theclock in Booths bedroom presumably with one with a bug or a bomb in it . Anyhow you can depend on this nut job to retaliate sometime and hopefully Booth will kill him . If I was Booth and caught him , by the time I got thru with him I would make RED JOHN look like a sissy.Note to the producers : you do a great job with photography , sets , special effects and especially with the terrific acting of most of the cast . ButI think you are running too many stories that distract from the main characters . I do n't know why we have to watch Camille run around with the Iranianwho does n't look like and Iranian : I mean who cares ? I love Camille but it does n't fit in with the main premise of the series . And why to they keepbringing Daisy back ; she is as obnoxious as they come . Let her marry Sweets and they can run off to Afganistan for a honeymoon and never come back.Sweets is another character that makes no sense ; besides being obnoxious and following Booth and Bones around like a kitten following its mother aroundfor a milk snack he is simply annoying . And he does n't know a damn thing about psychology ! ! And he 's a mooch : living in Bones & Booths house for months . I think the producers should trim the cast a bit : send the loony intern back to the hospital , send Edison the the Natural History museum inChicago where he can stare at the Breasts of the dinosaurs and BRING BACK ZACH ! ! I also like Wendel and Opie and the guy who eats cheese strips.Note that BONES has tough completion from two partner series : CASTLE and THE MENTALIST . I watch both , and have all the DVDs from those series alongwith the BONES DVDs all of which I got from AMAZON . a slightly simpler format might work better , but I still will love the show.I would like to see sister Zooey make more appearances on the show ; she does work a FOX too . She and Emily in my opinion have the most beautifuleyes I have ever seen . And I think they are among the most beautiful women in the world as well as being terrific actresses .	1
As usual , this season of Bones does not disappoint ! I All the seasons of this show are just what I am looking for in a crime show ! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys shows like Murder , She Wrote , The Closer , and all the Law and Ordres	1
a great balancing of 'plot ' solving and character relationship interactions ... . i watch bones ... . major crimes ... . and ncis ... .. plus a couple of home shows ... ...	1
Bones Season 9Fox .. Absolutely love love this show . Very happy it was renewed for a tenth season and that it 's coming back to Monday Night .	1
Loved the wedding . This has always been the best crime show on TV . However , there has always been too much sex . Children and teens should not be allowed to watch it .	1
Audio and video quality for this season was fine , as usual.Plot was not as well-written as previous seasons and glaring errors are just overlooked . Still a fun show but it seems to be running out of fresh material for drama . And there is almost no sign of Booth 's son , Parker , which is annoying but understandable as the young actor 's aging really puts a timeframe on the series .	1
I enjoy watching bones . And while we are waiting for a new seasons to start , I have gone back and watched the seasons from the beginning as well . We hope to see bones continue for many more seasons to come . The series continues to present and build character interactions between each member of the bones deductive crime solving team they do a good job of making the events seem real and to entertain as the show presents the various crimes . The victims are presented showing how bones team of investigators perceived the victim lived before they were killed and to help you to identify with the person that was killed as well as victims relationships good and bad.The series answers questions about characters and relationships that you hope will turn out , devious characters that you want to get caught but for some reason or another seem to be smart enough to get away , but in the end they eventually slip up somewhere and get caught.All things seem to work out for the better for each character and so this series seems to be a good show to watch we hope to see many more bones episodes .	1
I love the interaction of all the ensemble characters and the beautiful stars . I love the writing , the weirdness and the uncompromising scientific lingo . I love the comedic relief and all the plot lines . I love the story line and how it 's unfolded . I am hooked .	1
What can I say , I still love this show . I now enjoy after waiting so long watching Booth & Bones living together and openly loving each other . And of course they eventually get married this season . YAY ! That was an enjoyable episode . I hope they can continue to come up with fresh material and give us another season , season 10 . I loved this show from the start , that first episode , and I still wait with impatience for Monday to come around for my next unseen episode . And of course if I happen to miss it I get to watch it here on Tuesday , yay Amazon !	1
I have watched this series since it started . I love it . The interaction between the characters make one wish that they were working with the characters in the series every day .	1
I have watched Bones from day one and have eagerly waited for the coming of each new season . I was happy when I learn there was to be a season nine.At this time all I can say is that something seems to be missing . In addition , too much back story has been woven in which I believe detracts from the main theme . Could it be that the writers can not address the shows main theme ? I am still viewing each episode , however if the spark does not return within the next two weeks , I will cancel my purchase.The writers eliminated by disappointment ( concern ) and happiness reigns supreme at the Jeffersonian . The wedding was excellently handled . Papa Max being looking out for his daughter since the beginning . I wonder where the writers are planning to lead Cam ?	1
I have loved bones since it first aired . In season 8 it started to lag and I was n't happy , but with the return of the show in season 9 , they have kicked the story line back into gear and they 're deepening some of the main characters ' back stories . Love it !	1
Last good program on on fox . I love it when smart people use there brain to solve problems the characters all relate well to each other and there are interesting twist and turns to the plot . However it appears that Christine has disappeared from the program as well as the baby had by Angela and hodgins .	1
While on the lighter side of the detective genre , it 's good for a work night ; very entertaining . Am a regular subscriber .	1
Enjoyed the plot and how the characters are developing and becoming deeper in their thought processes of life decisions , not just work .	1
Love AIL the Characters and watching Brennen grow ... emotionally ... ca n't wait for the Wedding ... Bones and the rest make it a complete show ... Again love all the characters .	1
We have watched from the beginning and it is worth going to and starting at the beginning ! Very interesting cast and you have to love Brennan and Booth are super together !	1
This is a great series & # 34 ; who-done-it & # 34 ; that combines the FBI working in conjunction with forensic anthropologists to figure out how a murder happens each episode . It also mixes in the private lives of several of the FBI and anthropologists which is very entertaining . This is another series I am completely hooked on . Give this series a try ; you will love it !	1
I have always enjoy watching Bones for many years and hope because they are married now that they do n't take this show off the air . Think this show has very good values for all ages , I have watch Booth from Buffy to Angel to Bones , always enjoy the entertainment he has given to his fans .	1
Love this show ! ! It has it all Forensics , crime & laughs . A clean show for the family . Refreshing ! ! Watch it ! !	1
I stared with the Kathy Reichs books , but the characters on the show are even more fun than those in print .	1
This show has made a great transition from the leads dancing around being a couple and actually being a couple . Booth and Bones are a couple that has problems and I like that about this show . Most shows get the couple together and then they are happy and never have problems . I enjoy that they are together and are trying to navigate there relationship like a normal couple that fights and loves .	1
This show is also consistently entertaining . Each week revolves around a different murder that Bones ( Temperence Brennen-the forensic antropologist ) and the FBI agent Booth . Bones has a very different & tactless personality which Booth tames . These two were finaly married in Season 9 . So there is a strange pairing of the two at the center of the story . Highly recommended !	1
I love wherre this series has been going . Having them together has not diminished the fun or excitement of the episodes at all . This should be the best season yet -- I am so looking forward to the next episodes ! Toni and Roxie were always my favorite undercover characters and having them back for Episode 2 promises to be classic Bones and Booth repartee ! And the wedding coming up should be a total delight -- we 've been waiting almost 9 years for this moment . I know it will be an episode I watch over and over !	1
My wife and I both love this show , we have watched from episode 1 season 1 . Has a very interesting cast of charters .	1
This was a neat first show with it 's little twists and suspense . I 'm also glad about the the Booth/Bones relationship and I 'll say no more as it would be a spoiler . Good show and I 'm looking forward to the rest of season 9 . I see Pulant ( sp ) sticking his ugly little head up in one of the next two episodes . I sleep a lot so before I know it I 'll be watching episode 2 .	1
I like watching bones it is a great program . I have watch every season and can not wait till the ten season .	1
My favorite TV show on today . Great characters , the writing took a dip for a couple of seasons but seems to be back on track this season .	1
I recommend watching Bones even though it has almost achieved a position in my viewing habits as a & # 34 ; guilty pleasure. & # 34 ; The stories tend to be striped down morality plays with a touch of fun for comic relief . The actors have played their roles for so long that they are completely wired and excellence is the average result.I really enjoy it though the mysteries are no longer mysterious and there is n't any suspense to speak of , Bones is bones is bones and a pleasant way to spend an hour.Scott Combs	1
I enjoy the interaction of my favorite characters . The story line is really entertaining , and they have become like a family that I feel comfortable with . I enjoy the cases they work on , and would recommend this series to anyone .	1
NEVER DISAPPOINTS ! THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT ! YOU KNOW IT WILL BE ENTERTAINING TO WATCH EBERY EPISODE . TE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE COMMERCIAL FOR OTHER SHOWS THRY ARE PUSHING ARE ALSO INCLUDED . WHEN YOU PURCHASE A SHOW TO WATCH YOU EXPECT IT TO BE COMMERCIAL FREE AND BE ABLE TO WATCH THE SHOW WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME ON STUFF YOU DONT WANT TO SEE , YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU PAID FOR AND THATS IT ! I HOPE THEY FIX THIS	1
This is a great show ; love the science behind the investigations ; the whole team at the Jeffersonian and in particular the chemistry and conversations between Booth and Brennan ... .An intelligently written series..	1
They have managed to keep the story fresh and moving and the bonds between the characters have grown and developed so there is a real time line here . I have all the seasons and current episodes and this is where I go when I need to lose myself in a story for a little while .	1
IF YOU LIKE MYSTERY AND MURDER AND SCIENCE THEN THIS IS FOR YOU IT IS GREAT SHOW TO WATCH BUT NOT WHEN YOUR EATING	1
I really like Bones and I 've seen every episode , but the undercover episodes are getting more and more silly . Season 9 just started and already they 're undercover doing fake accents and acting like idiots . I wish they would stick with letting them be Booth and Bones and that 's that . I would rate it 5 stars if not for these episodes .	1
The cast is exceptional and the story unbelievable . The cast includes Michaela Conlin , Tamara Taylor , David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel , as well as many others of considerable talent . Of course it is hard not to love Emily Deschanel whose portrayal of Dr. Temperance Brennen , a brilliant forensic anthropologist whose prosidy portrays her character as one with Asperger 's syndrome , combining intellectual brilliance with the grace of a social pygmy who manages to not see the difference between truth and insult . She does n't want to be mean , but she is oblivious to the meanness within her own & # 34 ; truthful & # 34 ; observations , at least truth as she sees it . As a scientist she is a hard-nosed empiricist who in her abrupt fashion eschews the intellectual worth both of value judgements and faith . However , she gradually comes to indulge , even appreciate , adherence to these inclinations in her friends , especially her character 's eventual husband FBI agent Seeley Booth played by David Boreanaz . The tale inspires one to both laugh and do your homework .	1
a very good action show with out all the cussing silly sex that has nothing to do with the show	1
This is a simple tale that could easily be an episode of the twilight zone . It deserves to be seen for what it is ; innovative , fresh and obviously made on a low budget . If I compare to the typical movie made by the syfy channel this , by comparison , is Oscar material . Yes , I do n't think much of the Syfy channel films ! Anyhow the story is self consistent , the people behave naturally , and the story is efficiently told . Great ? No , but so much better than the majority of made-for-tv fodder we have to endure . So I 'm marking the film high because compared to nonsense like the big budget & # 34 ; Pacific Rim & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Wolverine & # 34 ; this is a satisfying piece of sci-fi storytelling for the enthusiast .	1
After a tragic event on the GENESIS deep-space transport ship , we are taken aboard to see what happened . The GENESIS is a large ship w/ a small crew . They find themselves transporting a very dangerous alien criminal . Said criminal has already killed 200 people ! She arrives chained , and is locked into a holding cell w/ two armed guards posted outside . The overconfident Captain believes that everything will be routine . Of course , he 's absolutely wrong ! The alien escapes , and apparently lives up to her lethal reputation . ENIGMA is a well-made , low-budget , short ( 43 min . ) sci-fi / thriller that boasts exceptional CGI-fx , a decent storyline , and a genuinely formidable alien nemesis ! A nice twist at the end brings everything into clear , conspiratorial focus . Recommended ...	1
This is one of those movies that they film on a just a few sets ( inside a spaceship ) . It has that beta-cam look to it . The special effects are good , maybe better than expected . The story has a twist ending , though I ca n't say I full understood it . The acting was ok . It was a fast , tight script . They probably filmed the whole movie in a hurry ( a week ) on a small budget , and that effects what the actors can do . Do n't expect long ( costly ) empty scenes of nothing but sunsets . I gave it 4 stars because it 's not that bad if you understand the kind of movie it is . A cheap B-one .	1
Kind of silly and low budget , but watchable with a twist at the end that saves the entire show from being a bust . Only it leaves to many unanswered questions , but then again I think that was the idea .	1
That does n't mean it was bad . It was just that everything was just a notch under what would be on the big screen.I gave it four stars because visuals are not always what makes the movie.The plot was good ; the acting was decent ; the dialogue was very good , I thought.In the end , I was entertained . To me , that 's worth 3 stars and it was just a bit better than that .	1
I gave it four stars for high-quality TV production value , interesting fight sequence , and unexpected plot twist . Will not drop spoilers here . If you are looking for something different and amusing , this will do the trick . It is very much like a TV production though , not a major motion picture . I say that because I do not watch TV movies , as a rule . This turns out to be quite the little sci-fi piece though , so I grant it an exception . Definitely worth seeing FREE ( AMAZON PRIME ) or if you rent it for $ 1.99 ... .maybe ... I would not have paid for a 43 minute video though.Hey , what have you got to lose ... but 43 minutes ... ..	1
The plot had a good twist that was not revealed until the last 15 minutes of the movie . Well executed .	1
This movie is 43 minutes people . It you love movies esp sci-fi , you have sat through a lot worse for much longer : ) It flows more like an episode than a completed movie and I would really like to see where this crew could go with a few million allotted to them ; probably a great series or a strong box office movie.Most indie sci-fi nowadays has got to be really tough to do . You will not see much better indie in this genre . The scenes flow pretty smoothly , the Alien is totally believable and her look is very effective . General Rothman is fairly unlikeable and everyone else does an okay job in the acting department .	1
The League is a great series . This is especially true if you are probably in your mid 30 's or early 40 's and have a fairly juvenile sense of humor . Of course , it should go without saying that if you are easily offended ... you will probably find many instances in any given episode offensive.We 're still pretty early in the season , so far however it maintains all the key elements that have kept us entertained for the past 4 seasons . The only one we found a little lacking was the Rafi/Dirty Randy episode.This is one of those shows that I had to have , despite cutting the cable with satellite/cable providers . We love the Amazon streaming option , despite the brief commercial for FX shows ( usually Sunny in Phily ) at the beginning , it 's still more than worth the price of admission . Plus you can always come back and watch your favorite episodes again and again on PC , phone , or tablet .	1
This is one of the funniest shows on TV . If you were a fan of Sports Night , Entourage , or play any fantasy sport you will enjoy this show . Top notch comedy !	1
I love this show , the humor just gets to me . Rafi just gets better and better every season , laughed out loud several times .	1
One of the funniest shows ever , but warning ... it is BIY funny your wife will hate it/not get it , watch it with your bros	1
I was a HUGE fan of The League in the beginning , but this season is getting old . Some shows run their course and I think The League is starting to run it 's course . The last episode of Rafi and Dirty Randy ... . WTF was that ? Try a little even if you do n't get picked back up next season .	1
Lets be clear this season started out weak . I would say the first 4 episodes of Season 5 are some of the worst ever . But Season 5 does come around , episodes 6 - 13 are all funny . Either way I still hope to see The League Season 6 .	1
Even if ur liked and no nothing about fantasy football , this show is hiiiiiiilarious and I 've rewatched the entire series on Netflix more than once . Absolutely love the League !	1
I 've loved this show since season 1 . Now with the addition of the other out of town member introduced . Ca n't wait to see what this season brings !	1
If your the type that is easily offended , I would encourage you to not watch this series and get some psychiatric help to learn how to take a joke ! I read some reviews , some people just do n't like toilet humor . I 'm a man , so I do n't do the & # 34 ; sensitive thing ! & # 34 ; I laugh the whole time I watch this . LOL .	1
I 've loved this show for years and am excited for this season . the first two episodes have n't disappointed with the gang up to their usual tricks.update:5 episodes in ... This season is moving along great . The gang seems refocused this year and I find myself cracking up for the 25 minutes , sad when the show ends and excited for next week .	1
Love , love this show . It is really funny especially like the gang tries to win an award and mac day .	1
This show may just be the best show ever ! ! this season it does feel like the gang is running out of show ideas a bit but it is still funny as hell . i have to say i would be totally willing to watch this show way past its prime : - ) lol	1
This series tackle some controversial topics but with dark humor ! I been watching this series over and over even while I am doing work it is playing in the background ! Very comfortable series and able to let my just made teenage nephew and nieces watch it . They , of course , are exposed to much blatant verses in school than this series can muster.Anyway , awaiting Season 10 . This series is second to Archer though . Hopefully FX will not interfere with both of their great offerings and support them thoroughly.Thanks Amazon again ! To all - have a Great Holiday Season ! ! !	1
And weirder . Yeah some stuff feels sort of acted but as a viewer since the first season it 's amazing how far the characters have fallen in 9 seasons . Still worth watching .	1
This show never disappoints me . My favorite episode so far is & # 34 ; the gang tries to win an award & # 34 ; . Best non-animated comedy series ever .	1
I fell in love with this show at the reccomendation of a friend , the characters are all hot messes and their interactions and dealings with things terribly , yet hilarious.a good watch for people who love cynical humor	1
Last season was kind of disappointing , but this episode brought it back to its roots ! Good to see it back !	1
This is by far the best season yet ! I really dont know how this show stays fresh , I really have to respect the writing .	1
This show is always funny . It does n't let up on the crazy . After all the seasons , its funny how the characters just grow on you . I think its actually getting better .	1
After seasons of great humor , this new season works hard to stay fresh and funny and succeeds where most shows do n't !	1
Love the show . Interesting take on Ghost Hunting . Love how they are not just investigating the Mine but how they are trying to find the initial cause of the haunting . Love the miners personalities .	1
I suppose the simplicity of it draws my attention . I for one would never have thought to investigate in a mine shaft although I am sure many lives were lost there.Good show and genuine folks .	1
There are a few drama moments . Patrick thinks everything 's paranormal . They 're out in the woods and a stick breaks and he 's like , `` That 's paranormal . '' It 's a stick . There were several moments when I was with Kristen.But ! OMW ! The rest of the show ? Creepy and awesome ! I love the fact that they 're on the scene throughout the entire mining process , that they have cameras set up everywhere . It really makes for a great investigation . There are things you just ca n't catch otherwise.I hope the season gets longer . I love this show .	1
I like this series because of the people . The miners are real salt of the earth type guys who are n't afraid to show who they really are . I do n't see any fake type individuals except maybe , and i say maybe Jamal . He 's a bit cartoonish , maybe even a bit over the top , but like him I am of shorter stature than most and it always seems you have to prove yourself to the big guys . Anyway , as for the ghost hunters Kristen is HOT ! Not only is she pretty , but smart , sensitive and an all around nice girl . I will be careful to stay in Amazons guidelines but come on guys , who has n't noticed her ! Well , if you 've watched it , you 've noticed her ! I think I 'm in love ! As for Patrick and Kristen , they seem accomplished ghost hunters with a never ending push to get to the truth ! They 've brought in some awesome equipment and if you 're new to Ghost Mine , give it a chance , it will grab ahold of you ! I am amazed at just how far reaching the history goes and the atrocities that were committed in the early days of mining and America ! It never ceases to amaze me what will occur next , or what direction Patrick and Kristen will go to bring evidence to the miners . It does seem that they will eventually piece together some pretty solid evidence to what is happening and maybe , just maybe help the miners appease the spirit , or expel what I think might be a demon ! Now c'mon , do n't tell me you were n't thinking demon , the thing growls ! Keep watching , I know I will , unless they lose Kristen . If you could n't tell , she 's my favorite , lol ! I like papa smurf too ! He 's a cool customer ! He 's the type of person I would like to be around ! Actually I could hang with the whole bunch , I like 'em all ! Plus at the end of every day they build a fire and sit around chewing the fat ! One of my favorite things to do ! Do I recommend the shoe , heck yeah !	1
Interesting program , not sure if it is all true or not ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..it seems the focus is off of finding gold and more on finding ghosts .	1
When I first watched the first season , I was hooked on ghosts in a mine . Their have been investigations of other mines on other ghost investigating shows but not a show focused totally on it . I think it was clear from season one that this mine has some dark secrets that are being uncovered . Somebody years ago wanted to keep it a secret by closing it off . Every week of season 2 I wonder what will they uncover next ?	1
My entire family is hooked on this show ! They could produce 15 episodes a day & I think we would stop sleeping just to fit them all in our day . If you think you have any interest in this show at all , I think you will enjoy it .	1
Far better than you would think . Very fun plot twists and a fun cast to watch . Keep on digging boys !	1
Spooky , I hope it goes on with more shows . You can really get into to it then it 's over . : - & # 62 ;	1
I enjoyed watching this paranormal , historical , modern day gold mine show . I am learning a lot historically and paranormal activity too.I watch paranormal shows but did n't think I would have been interested in the mines . I live in Eureka California and I believe the history of Oregon is probably somewhat similar . I am really enjoying this which I did n't think I would . Everyone involved from the minors to Patrick and Chris or ( Red ) are entertaining and keep it interesting .	1
Still love the second season although it appeared over produced . You begin sensing a camera crew not represented on film.But never the less this still rocked !	1
I love this show , it keeps you engrossed and to watch the work that the miners do as well as the paranormal investigators do to help the miners do their job is great !	1
It 's a simple premise but very addictive . Following on from season one , the crew return to the Crescent Mine in Oregon to open up a new and promising seam of gold . There efforts are hampered at times by strange incidents that are investigated by two paranormal investigators , who have had some compelling evidence during the first season and in this second.The people involved are likeable and the evidence has been very interesting and like I say it just becomes addictive.I do hope they will continue on with a season three .	1
i would really like to go there and see the place . I think the history involved is very interesting and glad for all the research being done . This is great story .	1
The reason I like this show , the 2 people who do the ghost investigations are not trying to put on a show they are n't playing to the camera . The other ghost investigator shows get on my last nerve when they say stupid things like & # 34 ; Do n't be afraid , we wo n't hurt you & # 34 ; are you kidding me . Thats me , my opinion , plus I 'm hoping the miners find gold . : )	1
Freda was a pleasant surprise . I thought a knew all about the Beatles . I guess not . Most of the movie was during their early years with their manager Eppy . I also learned a lot about Liverpool and the cavern during their early years . This movie was worth watching .	1
Viewing the 2013 documentary GOOD OL ' FREDA , I realized Freda Kelly probably had the most to gain and least to lose had she chosen to betray the Beatles by publishing a tell-all about her years with them . It was n't as if this woman made a ton of money , working for the Beatles ' management and running their fan club from 1963 to 1972 . But , just like Pete Best , who kept any dirt to himself despite being fired as the band 's drummer just as they got a recording contract and went on to unmatched success , Kelly resisted the payday of saying what the Beatles would n't want said . That Kelly started working for their management at age 17 and eleven years later stepped down to start a family impresses me that much more . There must have been tempting offers to blab but despite having children to worry about , this woman , still younger than 30 years of age , said no to the money.On one of the Beatles fan club Christmas records the band gives Kelly what today is known as a shout out , thanking her for running their fan club . `` Good ol ' Freda , '' one or more yell . It was as if they knew she would prove loyal.Fifty years after she started working for the Beatles , who knew anyone would think Freda Kelly would make for a fine documentary subject ? See GOOD 'OL FREDA . And this is no lame cable television channel-type piece . The makers of GOOD OL ' FREDA do a first-rate job . Of note , the opening song to support the action is `` Anna '' but not the Beatles ' version ; rather , it is the original , by Arthur Alexander . The same goes for `` Chains '' by the Cookies , `` Honey , Do n't '' by Carl Perkins and a number of others the band covered that we hear throughout the movie . Beatles songs such as `` I Will '' are included , too , no small feat when you consider it is rare for a Beatles recording to be used in a movie soundtrack.The most telling GOOD OL ' FREDA passage : Freda Kelly reminisces about the Beatles while seated alongside boxes of memorabilia in her attic . That 's right ; she does not have all that stuff on display in her home . It 's in storage . While she has n't thrown away souvenirs from her years with the greatest musical act in history , Kelly knows their place is in her past . GOOD OL ' FREDA conducts that interview in the attic where she 's stored those collectables , as if to make sure we understand there is more to this woman than the stories she could tell about John , Paul , George , and Ringo.Oddly , longtime Beatles assistant Mal Evans is missing from the list of those that were lost in Freda Kelly 's life , which starts with Brian Epstein , continues through John Lennon and George Harrison , and wraps up with Neil Aspinall and Derek Taylor.When Freda Kelly could have picked up a nice paycheck , she said nothing . Five decades later - and what must be many years since the last time anyone approached her about a tell-all book - with two of the Beatles gone and , I 'd guess , not many fans who wonder what became of that `` Freda '' the Beatles mentioned in that Christmas record , GOOD OL ' FREDA finally tells what Kelly is willing to say . It was worth the wait .	1
For the millions who are still fascinated by their phenomenon , this secretary constantly had them autograph items and dictate official fanclub letters from 1962 until 1974 . The sincerity of her smile and the warmth of her eyes both in old photos and new interviews suggest an intimate friendship with all four Beatles and many of their parents . Ringo even videotapes a personal thanks to Freda for being so loyal . There are n't many new facts , but you get a unique insider 's perspective on how close the band members were to each other in the early years and how far they had drifted apart by the time their manager died . It 's definitely a humanistic observation rather than a musical one .	1
No idea who this woman was or is as she 's still alive and well and still doing secretarial work . Just a very interesting story of one woman who was the one and only secretary the Beatles ever had which George Harrison mentions in one of those Beatles Christmas fan appreciation recordings they used to produce back in the early days .	1
A new perspective on the most documented band in the world . Freda showed a lot of integrity in not capitalizing from her story all these years . A charming documentary from one of the few people who experienced Beatlemania from the inside .	1
First , an important caution when reading reviews of this product . Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film ( theater , Amazon Instant DVD , BD ) together . As I submit this review there are already 23 reviews posted , only one of which is of the DVD or Bluray . So , I always suggest to look to see which product is being reviewed and to look for the date of the review . That will guide you best . Now on to my review of the Bluray.Of the thousands of reviews I & # 8217 ; ve written for Amazon I & # 8217 ; ve rarely & # 8211 ; if ever & # 8211 ; felt that there was another review of a product that covered practically everything one could say about it . But after reading David Kusumoto & # 8217 ; s review of the Bluray/DVD release of this film , I have to send you there for a thorough and well-written review . I & # 8217 ; ll try to add a few more facts and my take on the film and the package. & # 8220 ; Good Ol & # 8217 ; Freda & # 8221 ; started making the film festival circuit in early 2013 and played at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia in April 2013 . I missed that one shot chance to catch it , but heard great things from friends and was anxious for the home video release . Magnolia films has been making a name for itself in releasing music related documentaries ( & # 8220 ; Muscle Shoals & # 8221 ; was also at the April WXPN festival & # 8211 ; and I did catch it and it & # 8217 ; s great & # 8211 ; and Magnolia will be releasing it in January ( hopefully with lots of bonuses ) . But back to Freda.As David pointed out in his review , there is a wonderful commentary track that reveals more stories than are shone in the film . But , remember that Freda was a loyal dedicated secretary for 11 years ( one year LONGER than the Beatles were together as a band ) and no real secrets are revealed . But , when she discusses the parents of the & # 8220 ; boys & # 8221 ; & # 8211 ; especially weekly teas with Ringo & # 8217 ; s mom ( she only refers to Ringo as & # 8220 ; Ringo & # 8221 ; in the Q & A ; at at Beatlefest - included as a bonus ; in the film he is always called & # 8220 ; Richie & # 8221 ; and Brian Epstein is called & # 8220 ; Eppie & # 8221 ; - you get a deeper feeling for the family life of the Fab Four.In one of the bonus interviews with the Director of the film , we learn that he shot 50 hours of film and says that he hopes that much of it would be on the DVD release . But there are only five scenes totaling just 12 minutes . ( I & # 8217 ; m not complaining & # 8211 ; just commenting ) .As noted by others & # 8211 ; four Beatles songs are included in the soundtrack , along with a bunch of classic songs that the Beatles covered ( by Arthurs Alexander , The Chiffons , Marvelettes ) including the most expensive to license : Ketty Lester & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; Love Letters & # 8221 ; . Oddly enough the Lester recording was not remastered and has lots of & # 8220 ; crackle & # 8221 ; . Surely they could have found a better copy to use . ( again , a comment , not a complaint.So , in summary , all Beatles fans will want this Bluray , even if you have seen the film at a festival . And , even if you are a casual music listener who grew up with their music , you & # 8217 ; ll find the 87-minute film and its bonuses , worth watching.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm & # 8220 ; Anything Phonographic & # 8221 ;	1
This is a story of Freda Kelly , who was the official fan club leader and secretary of the Beatles . In 1962 she was recruited by the Beatles manager Brian Epstein to work for the band when she was a 17-year-old Liverpool typist and a regular audience at the Cavern Club , and continued to be in office until 1972 . In the documentary she recalls the early days of her eventful life with the world & # 8217 ; s most famous band.In fact , most probably avid Beatles fans ( including me ) might have heard what she has to say somewhere before . The personalities of the Fab Four she describes ( George is the quiet Beatle , etc . ) are nothing surprising , but episodes about the family members of the group are interesting , especially when recounted by the very person who personally knew them.Other interviewees include Tony Barrow ( Beatles press officer ) , Billy Kinsley of The Merseybeats ( and director Ryan White & # 8217 ; s nephew ) , Billy Hatton and Joey Bower of The Fourmost , and Angie McCartney . What they say has more to do with Freda than the Beatles , so don & # 8217 ; t expect much.It is a bit surprising that the filmmakers are allowed to use four original Beatle songs for the movie . Though Paul McCartney only appears in archive footage , Ringo Starr himself shows up before the camera , giving a brief message to Freda and fans , which proves that she has been a trusted friend of the group.Though & # 8220 ; Good Ol ' Freda & # 8221 ; does not offer new things very much , it gives a new viewpoint for us to watch the history of the band .	1
First a disclaimer : if you 've led a sheltered existence or believe that some ancient text originating from a tribe of goat herders in a remote desert millennia ago contains everything you need to know about life , you might not want to watch this film . Why ? Because it 's about real life . There 's no rubbishy faux emotions , nonsense plot , huge CGI effects , or endless car chases and gun battles . It 's a real movie about real people . The direction and camerawork are all put to the service of the story and the acting , which places this movie in the same category as The Lives of Others and House of Sand and Fog . You need an attention span to watch this film . You need to let it carry you along at its own pace , devoid of snappy jump-cuts and mindless action scenes.Some reviewers seem to have had problems dealing with the subject , which is simply that the teenage sons of two life-long friends fall in love , each with the mother of the other . Apparently this scenario is n't covered in the Big Hollywood/Disney Book of Life . Fortunately the film makers were n't overly concerned with limited conceptions of human feeling , and this movie gracefully explores - without gloss or varnish - the joys and the pains of what follows in consequence . Any middle-aged person who 's ever felt the stirrings of attraction for a younger person will sympathize with the magnetic pull of this dynamic , and any young person who 's ever felt attracted to a more mature person will likewise know the feeling of wanting to & # 34 ; own & # 34 ; that person and monopolize their attention.And anyone who 's ever experienced any kind of affair will know about the tribulations that can result , due to the expectations and attitudes of others.What 's lovely about this movie is that it explores all the avenues - the women 's insecurities about their age , overlaying their knowledge that what they have , though marvelous , is necessarily fleeting . The young men unconsciously playing at being older than their years . The reactions of outsiders . The unintentional cruelties of love and obsession . It 's all explored delicately but without flinching.The acting is very good . The initial hesitation that ultimately gives way to uncontrolled passion is very well done . The insecurities , jealousies , and inevitable pain is also beautifully rendered , always understated . There 's no intrusive & # 34 ; mood music & # 34 ; to tell us what to feel . There 's just a balanced character study that unfolds ineluctably , always watchable and always poignant.If you want to learn about human nature - real human nature , not the paper nonsense of DisneyWood - this is a great little movie . Plus the scenery is stunning and should make almost everyone want to pack up and move to Australia .	1
I watched this film on Saturday and it is now Wednesday and I am stilling thinking about it . This is an Australian film , so the pace of the story is somewhat different ... the crescendos are quieter but the sentinel events are clear . The film explores the boundaries of a friendship and what liberties are accepted and why . Both Naomi Watts and Robin Wright give performances which ring true and are compelling . The young male leads are also quite strong . It 's good and surprising story telling .	1
Look I 'd give it five stars on the acting alone but the topic and taboo subject matter makes me give it four stars . I really liked the movie , I confess it.. even if I sort of felt kind of icky watching it . Two moms fall in love with each others son ... yep icky right . But it was well acted and you want to understand how it could happen and take sides ... but all along your like.. no thats just crossing the line . It was so icky and so crossing the line that I watched it twice : )	1
Great acting , unusual story line for a change , well made . Enjoyed the movie , it 's about life and what it can bring .	1
{ 4.33 stars } ADORE could have turned out really cheesy , but the very real characters , along with a nice blend of funny and sad moods , fitting soundtrack , and pretty Australian beach scenery keep it from becoming so . Fine performances by all the major players : Though more character and conflict development may seem needed at times , we get to know everyone and everything gradually , and the fact that they are all just fairly `` normal '' ( whatever that is ) people is pivotal . Not the greatest script , but it 's nothing if not realistic.Regarding the plot : The way the quadrangle develops is pretty convincing . Even if what 's happening here is nothing illegal , it 's obviously weird if not downright perverse . Yet , I was surprised to find myself rooting for both couples as ADORE proceeded , wanting them all to be happy together . The way the two women bear a superficial resemblance to each other , causing us to occasionally forget who 's whose mum and who 's whose lover , is another interesting effect . Finally , the isolated cove with its stationary sun-raft is a fitting and well-chosen symbol.Though it 's obviously not a `` family film '' or one for younger children , there is no gore , serious nudity ( just a couple of brief booty-shots of Robin Wright and Xavier Samuel ) , or other flinchable elements ( unless you count the multiple unexplicit sex scenes ) .ADORE is one of the strongest , most satisfying films to come out in recent years , and I enjoyed it immensely .	1
They carry this thing as far as it can be carried . You could write the screenplay in 10 minutes , perhaps struggling a bit to hold back on the sex scenes so that you can keep your lead actors . Ie , nothing new here . Just a vehicle for 2 of my favorite actresses .	1
In rural New South Wales , childhood friends and now mothers Roz ( RobinWright ) and Lil ( Naomi Watts ) live a secluded existence . Their lifeseems idyllic : Roz runs an art-gallery , while Lil apparently does notwork but manages quite well to pursue a good life as a widow . As thefilm develops , however , so both women fall for the other woman 's sons : Roz falls in love with Lil 's son Tom ( James Frechville ) , and Lil fallsin love with Roz 's son Ian ( Xavier Samuel ) . Both women try to end theirrespective affairs - in the belief that they are somehow wrong - butfind themselves incapable of doing so , leading to heartache and loss.There are several reasons for watching TWO MOTHERS : the first being thestunning photography of a rural seaside landscape ( by ChristopheBeaucarne ) , full of sandy beaches and azure-blue seas . It 's hardlysurprising that none of the four protagonists really want to leave theplace , even though Tom moves briefly to urban Sydney to pursue a careeras a theater director . TWO MOTHERS also boasts four excellentperformances : Watts and Wright are quite outstanding as the twomothers , their faces beginning to show the signs of middle age , yetretaining much of their youthful vigor . Director Anne Fontaine 's camerascrutinizes their features as they ponder the morality of what they aredoing , and desperately decide what to do for the best , while remainingtrue to their instincts . At the end of the film , when they considerwhat they have done , they do not say much , but the sequence comesacross as incredibly poignant : Wright in the foreground , and Watts inthe background trying to explain why she did what she did . The thirdmain reason for watching the film is the sparse script - by Fontaineand Christopher Hampton after a work by Doris Lessing . The film makesno judgment on the characters ' behavior ' ; rather it encourages us toreflect on how human emotions work , often in defiance of moralconcerns . Perhaps the film is a touch too long - the ending tends todrag a little - but the final image of the four protagonists sittingsunbathing on a wooden raft , the camera placed directly above them , isa memorable one .	1
Man , this movie keeps you guessing , builds great tension , and has some of the best moments I 've seen all year . There is no nudity and nearly no violence , but that does n't stop it from being an absolute thrill ride . America made movies like this once upon a time , but at least Australia and other foreign countries can still produce good , edgy , thoughtful drama .	1
If any woman believes that sex to a young boy is the same as having sex with a young girl , should watch this movie . It is not the same . Two best friends grow up , get married , and have boys . One looses her husband to death , the other by divorces . But they are left in this idealistic beach setting . The two woman still beautiful , and coming into their prime sexual age . It is by accident that the relationships begin , but they find them so enjoyable , they ca n't stop . But what is missed is that both boys go on and find young women their own age and soon father their own children . What is never explored is what did the boys learn from their tutors . They were good husbands , despite their trysts with the older women . A young man needs an older woman to teach him how to satisfy a woman . We do n't know anything , and understand less , and by the time we learn how to do it correctly , we are too old to do it right . This is not the same with a young girl . I was saddened by the ending but not surprised . I was a good movie .	1
The audience is polarized in response to this astonishingly refreshing and brilliant little film : some are completely disgusted with the theme of ` aberrant love ' while other are awash in the courageous work by director Anne Fontaine , Fontaine and Christopher Hampton 's adaptation of Doris Lessing 's short story ` The Grandmothers ' , and the acting by two of our finest actresses on the screen . Knowing that it is both loved and hated depending on the degree of appreciation for experimental film should be the driving force as to whether or not to take advantage witnessing this brave new film.In New South Wales , Roz ( Robin Wright ) , her husband Harold ( Ben Mendelsohn ) and their son Tom ( James Frecheville ) live near the beach . Lil , ( Naomi Watts ) who is a widow , lives nearby with her son Ian ( Xavier Samuel ) . Roz and Lil are best friends , and so are Tom and Ian . Harold applies for and is offered a job in Sydney without telling Roz . He expects Roz to move to Sydney with him , however , she hesitates . After a night of drinking quite unexpectedly on the surface Ian and Roz start a sexual relationship . Tom discovers this and takes revenge by initiating a sexual relationship with Lil . Now Roz has even more reason to stay , and later Roz and Harold divorce . Two years of these two mothers/best friend 's sons affairs pass but not without the inference that Roz and Lil are lesbians - a way for Lil to avoid the approach of a suitor Saul ( Gary Sweet ) . Harold returns from Sydney and his new highly enviable job in the theater department and discovers the affairs and summarily absents himself from the situation and from Roz . There are hesitations , but these do not last long and the secret relationships continue . Eventually Tom goes to Sydney for a promising job interview in the theater . His visit to Sydney changes everything for four of them - the nasty truth has its way to come out and alter everybody 's happy lives . The rest of the film is a rapidly moving progression of changing affinities and eventual strange resolutions.The nuanced performances by Robin Wright and Naomi Watts are brilliant and very equally balanced with the sensuous and realistic portrayals By Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville . The chemistry is extraordinary and credible and makes what could have been a strained story work meticulously well . The cinematography by Christophe Beaucarne and the musical score by Christopher Gordon enhance the liquid flow of this stunning film . The story and the film itself require an emotionally mature audience able to accept variations on the themes of love and lust , but given there are mores to overcome , this is a brilliant art piece .

Ok , so I would n't sleep with my best friends teenage son but I love that this movie goes into a world that is only visited by men in the past . Our society does n't even think twice when actions as those taken in this movie are taken by men . When ladies do it , look out . It was interesting to see what the boys found interesting in the mother BFF 's and vice versa . It is definitely a chick flick as my hubby would probably not watch it . Have a few glasses of wine with your girl friends and take this all in . It certainly does cross the line but call this one ... ... your guilty pleasure watch .	1
I liked this Australian-French 2013 drama , although I found it also disturbing - in some parts even more than disturbing ... Below , more of my impressions , with some very limited SPOILERS.Roz ( Robin Wright ) and Lil ( Naomi Watts ) are best friends since their childhood . Even after they married , they managed to stay close and even live not far one from another . They both had a good life , even if Roz lost her husband to an accident . Now they are both in their 40s and their sons , Ian and Tom , are no more boys , but very handsome young men . And this is when all the trouble and also this story really begin ... Adapted from the short story & # 34 ; Grandmothers & # 34 ; by Doris Lessing this thing was then transformed into a scenario by being re-written and & # 34 ; upgraded & # 34 ; by French director Anne Fontaine , who specialises in quite peculiar and sometimes also slightly erotic films , like 2003 & # 34 ; Nathalie & # 34 ; ( re-made for Anglo-Saxon public in 2009 as & # 34 ; Chloe & # 34 ; - see my review of this film ) .The film is slow and calm , using a rather minimalistic approach of acting , with quite a lot of nice shots of sea and sandy beaches - and it actually is one of the best things in it , as I found it strangely soothing , notwithstanding anything else what happens on the screen . In many other films ( especially French ones ) this kind of approach produces just boredom - but here it actually felt just right ... Without entering into details let 's just say that this story is quite steamy and kinky , describing an unusual social and sexual situation - which is quite disturbing . To make the things clear , it is NOT the relationship between a young man and an older woman that disturbed me in this film but the serious collateral damage caused by it to some completely innocent women and children , who just happened to be secondary characters ... Still , with all that , I actually liked this film and I was absolutely impressed by the performance of both main actresses . An unusual , funny tasting treat - but definitely worth seeing . Enjoy - if you dare ...	1
Lured in by the trailer with the floating pier and sparse dialogue , I saw this film for the seascapes , which are scorchingly beautiful.The film is not as scandalous as you might imagine . You see the deepening of friendship at the expense of others . Was part of sleeping with each others sons a way to greater intimacy between the women ? You see , it would n't have worked unless both women/sons were doing it . It would have ignited jealousy between the sons , for one would be losing his mother to his friend . It would have bred resentment between the women , for one would be losing her son to her friend . Because the creation of intimacy is to the exclusion of others , the solution was for none or all four to dive in . But , of course , this is at the expense of those outside the group . It is also , eventually , at the expense of those inside the group . It is as if the intimacy ran away with them , becoming the end , rather the means.Not to discount the attraction within the couples . One of the couples have thick chemistry and you can not help but fall a little in love with both the woman and young man . The other couple are less charismatic , maybe even a little pathetic.One husband accuses his wife of loving their house more than him . I confess I love the scenery more than the characters . Would the story be as acceptable to us in a different setting ? In the drowning beauty , we can see how they can be entrenched in their surroundings , a little too in love with each other . We can blame the sea .	1
I only stopped once when watching it . I went back to it . That is not always the case these days . Movies are plentiful , but there arenot many that I watch to the end . Controversial subject , maybe uncomfortable for some to watch .	1
'Adore ' is a quiet little film that seems to have missed the theaters because of the topic . It is a lush , descriptive film of love , the wrong kind for these characters . It was sometimes difficulty viewing because of the graphic material . The acting is outstanding , and the surroundings glorious.Naomi Watts , plays Lil and Robin Wright , plays Roz . They have been best friends sincechildhood . They both live in beautiful homes near the ocean in Australia . They both have families , Lil 's husband died in an accident . The sons , of Lil and Roz , Ian and Tom have grown up together and are best friends . Roz 's husband has taken a new position in Sydney and is rarely home . Both women are in their forties , facing the downside of life , and somehow they ca n't seem to find the right man.Their sons are now men of about 20 . They all hang out together , and one thing leads to another . Roz stops the affair , and Lil tries to do the same . Both men marry and have children . And , then , all H*** breaks loose , and lives are upset and , the now grandmothers find themselves in the same boat . This is a film of loneliness and searching , mistakes and love , and messes that change people 's lives.The script came from a book by Doris Lessing , called 'The Grandmothers ' . This is a chancey film that hits the right notes , but it seems the subject matter turned people off . A brave film that is perfect for discussion . Robin Wright and Naomi Watts are perfection in these roles . A Gould film if the mood suits you.Recommended . prisrob 12-14-13	1
I really enjoyed this movie , the acting especially by the boys was great . In addition , Naomi was excellent in her portrayal . Though a little unconventional ; love in all forms knows no boundaries and this was an excellent depiction of that . The cinematography in particular was superlative	1
Two women , friends since childhood , fall in love with each other 's grown sons . As one might imagine , this leads to all kinds of conflicts and relationship disasters which I will not reveal . I would have given it another star if not for the frequent scenes of the ocean , surfing , swimming , eating , drinking , lying in the sun , ocean , eat , drink , surf , etc . Nice scenery in Australia though .	1
We bought the first season , because friends told us it was really good . We are glad we bought both and will buy the next season also . It is a lot nicer to watch several shows in a row . There are a lot of twist and turns and we like not having to wait until the next week for the next show . We are retired and do not have a lot to do , so we order full series of a show instead of watching them once a week . We can watch as much as we want , when we want . Good deal .	1
I had to wait about nine months for this , but it was well worth it . Season Two is every bit as suspenseful as season one . I recommend it .	1
I like it . But I am hoping that season 3 get 's us off into a new concept . This could happen since a lot of people whose acting seemed insincere or ridiculous got snuffed .	1
I do n't have TV and with my schedule I have to watch shows at a time that is convenient for me -- -I am soooo happy amazon.com has Homeland Season 2 and of course the Final of BreakingBad ... .I would n't be able to see it otherwise ! Thanks amazon.com ! ! !	1
Am I missing something ? Is Amazon not going to run it ? My other shows often show each episode the day or week after it airs . If somebody knows what 's up , kindly let me know . Thanks !	1
I actually like season 2 better than season 3 . The quality seems to be decreasing as it gets further along . This season is excellent though . Highly recommend .	1
Extremely well acted . Wonderful character studies . People change , people grow and nothing is predictable until the split second you see it coming . It 's intense , thought provoking , edgy . It is anything but cliche , but if cliche is what you seek & # 34 ; this show rocks ! & # 34 ; . ,	1
kept me hooked ... some of the developments seemed so ridiculous that even in the grimmest of them I laughed out loud ... still , the acting is excellent and I enjoyed the complex relationships ... .	1
Interesting and a decent script with good acting . I can watch it commercial free and when I feel like it .	1
Homeland is the Best series on TV , Walking Dead is # 2 with 4.5 stars . It keeps you guessing all the time a thrilling show . Acting is fantastic . Ca n't wait for season 3 .	1
One of the best written shows on TV . Great dialogue makes for great characters whose believability makes some of the fantastic plot lines credible .	1
This is a very quick review of the entire series , `` Homeland '' , not just this particular episode . Without spoiling the plot for those who have yet to watch it ; let me just say that you will not be disappointed . The writing is superb , the acting is incredible , and the storyline is among the most intriguing and suspenseful of any TV series I 've ever watched . The show has some amazing twists and will leave you in a state of awe after every well scripted episode . If you have the least bit of interest in books or movies that deal with the betrayal of a trust or confidence ; you 'll be totally mesmerized by this series . `` Homeland , '' brings quality television to a whole new level . Do n't miss this one !	1
VERY ENTERTAINING//SUPERB WRITING//A REAL GOOD SPY-ON-SPY EPIC//CLARE DANES CAN NOT BE TOUCHED , SHE IS SO GOOD AND YES , EVEN FANTASTIC IN THIS ROLE///	1
tension from the first season , that things should have ended then . I was wrong . The same great performances , tight wire writing , twists and turns , and psycological thrills . I was hooked in from start to finish .	1
Flawless , suspenseful , challenging , intriguing , all good things to say about this program . I especially like the integration , figuratively and literally , of mental illness either from genetics or through trauma and the compassion and , also , judgment that surrounds it . There are no prat falls here : good and evil are equally smart , stealthy , each trying to outwit the other . Homeland is addictive in the best sense : not only as entertainment but as a lesson in the foibles of human kind .	1
Very good- see this one	1
Exciting storyline , well acted Claire Danes worthy of her awards , loved it . Cant wait for the next series . would like the option of paying for all the episodes for one price .	1
I think that Season 1 was the strongest . Still , every character ( specially for me Carrie and Saul but not only ) , and the twists of the plot are fantastic . Looking forward to season 3 .	1
I started watching 'Homeland ' with GREAT reservation because I have n't seen much good programming on US television in the last 20 years , but after I got addicted to 'The Good Wife ' - which was on for 5 seasons before I decided to tune in - I thought I 'd give 'Homeland ' a chance , too , because it had received such great reviews . MAN ! It 's so VERY good ! Well written , excellent cast ... and although I have never been a big fan of Claire Danes I can honestly say 'Mea culpa ' ! ! ! She 's SUPERB ! ( and I have a developed a good old fashioned middle-aged crush on Mandy Patinkin ! )	1
did not find season 2 as good as first season and gets a bit overkill in the endless fierce panic ... ... .	1
I thought I would enjoy this show because I am a huge Claire Danes fan . I did n't know I would be thinking of it between shows and hardly able to wait for the next episode ! Love that it exploits the idea we have all expected about politics and our government ... .TRUST NO ONE ! at least in politics and gmt . lol	1
Very well written and excellent cast . Have already recommended to all our friends . Just wish it was available without charge to members .	1
This series will keep you on edge episode after episode . It 's won several awards and will win more in the coming seasons . This is entertainment at its best !	1
Honestly , I think Clara Danes is beautiful . My wife died about 6 years ago and Clara looks like her . Pathetic I know , but in a weird way it 's like having her back for 60 minutes . The storyline is excellent , I 'm ex military and find it somewhat insulting at times . Things are n't what the TV says , it ai n't like that . They freaking hate us with a passion I have never seen before . So I 'm on our side .	1
So happy to get Season 2 before Season 3 begins . This is a wonderful , interesting series . I recommend it highly .	1
Season 2 just as good as Season 1 ... ..ca n't wait for Season 3.Highly recommend this series.Here are 4 more words .	1
So many good things in Season 2 as in Season 1 . Great writing and relevant to our times . Superb acting . Suspenseful . Clare Danes is perfect for the part and ably supported by the rest of the cast . All good things come to an end so I am enjoying it while it 's here .	1
This show is so addicting . It 's one of those shows that you ca n't wait to see what happens next and when the season ends you pray there 's another .	1
Awesome , awesome , just a fantastic movie . While it can still be improved from around the edges to be more 'realistic ' , it 's still a fantastic movie . It is cheesy in some parts of the movie , but it 's so really hilarious . No dumb humor , no or no real repeating tiresome jokes . Sure some moments in the movie are repeating like in countless other movies and yet , still it all manages to be funny . I loved the Mexican actor and the fat guy Alex was quite an interesting character himself . I am actually kind of pleased that there were no flirt between him and the doctor at the hospital . It 's just great all the way through . I especially enjoyed the intro or the opening scene . Fantastically done . And the soundtrack , while not huge , has a few very nice songs , worth hunting for . Awesome stuff ! I was close to avoiding it , but heck.. here I am , reviewing my new favorite comedy = D	1
Pure awesomeness ! Rarely will you find a film , particularly a comedy , which combines near-perfect writing with near-perfect direction with near-perfect acting . But `` Big Ass Spider '' ( BAS ) seems to be the perfect storm . But in a very good way.I did something that I rarely do : buy a movie . But I wanted to see BAS -- the reviews were really high from the critics , and I had seen a promo that looked really good -- and so when I went to rent this , I realized that for about twice the price , I could own this bad boy . And if you think about it , if you go to a movie theater -- something that I have n't done in about four years , as it seems to be more dangerous than the spider in this film , what with people getting shot for doing minor things such as texting -- and there are at least two of you , it costs , what ? like 12 bucks ? And that would be a matinee without any goodies . For $ 9.99 I can burn a hole in my Comcast monthly download maximum as many times as I want watching this laugh-fest . At least up to my 250 gigs.So , while sitting in the safety of my own home , not having to worry about some other theater-goer going all postal on me . . . I got to sit back and see all of the awesomeness . Sure , the spider is pretty Bad Ass , and said spider is pretty big , but I 'm assuming that , unlike the film `` The Ring '' as an example , that same spider ca n't come through the screen and eat my face like that mean little girl with unresolved mommy issues . But I can sit back , eat some popcorn , and watch that spider eat other peoples ' faces , and I can laugh.And you 'll laugh plenty here too , just like I did , if you rent this film . Better yet : why not buy it ? It 's only twice as much , and you 'll get to witness pure awesomeness . Over and over .	1
Keep making this kind of funny SciFi an you will have plenty of success . Now I have enjoyed a great many of the more serious SyFy movies but this is a notch above the others with great casting , acting , and script . I am glad to see they not only upped the effects but the tongue in cheek comedy is better as well . If you like SyFy B movies you will probably love this latest release.CA Luster	1
This is just a fun over the top giant spider movie aka government secret project . I 'm a huge fan of all types if horror and the animal films from the 80s is all I thought about while what hong this flick . The spider in this actually has a kind of personality to him and sets up traps for people as it continues to get big , bigger , and then BIG ASS SPIDER MODE , like I always say I do n't give spoilers so if u have nothing to do and u are able to stream this little gem then by all means check it out .	1
This is a very fun movie . The actors were great and there was some creative filming . I 'm beginning to think that the low budget films are WAY better than the CGI big bill features .	1
It 's a movie called & # 34 ; Big Ass Spider ! & # 34 ; Guess what it 's about . You get three guesses , and the first two guesses do n't count.And yes , I had to watch it . With a title like & # 34 ; Big Ass Spider ! , & # 34 ; who could possibly resist ? It 's pretty much exactly the movie that that amazing title promises -- a modern B-movie creature feature , centering on a monstrous spider that just keeps getting bigger and bigger . And while you might initially suspect that it 's a SyFy-style disaster , it 's also a very well-made film.It opens in the middle of a scene you 'd expect of such a movie -- a blimp-sized spider destroying a skyscraper , while helicopters buzz around helplessly . Exterminator Alex Mathis ( Greg Grunberg ) watches helplessly , while Storm Large 's hauntingly pretty cover of & # 34 ; Where Is My Mind ? & # 34 ; plays.Skip back to a day before . In the middle of an autopsy , a rat-sized spider crawls out of a corpse and attacks the mortician . Alex happens to be there getting a spider-bite treated , so he 's willing to handle the giant spider if they drop his bill . Along with security guard Jose ( Lombardo Boyar ) , he ventures into the depths of the hospital ... only to find that the spider has gotten much , much bigger . Also , it can melt off your face.Then a Special Forces unit shows up to take over the hospital , trying to find and lock down the spider before it can get any bigger . Big shock : they fail , and the spider becomes larger and larger , killing countless people as it goes . It falls to Alex , with his encyclopedic knowledge of spiders and their ways , to find a way to take it down before it has a bunch of spider babies ! & # 34 ; Big Ass Spider ! & # 34 ; basically wants to be a modern version of those 1950s creature movies with giant bugs and spiders . In that way , it succeeds -- it avoids being campy or overly silly , but still sticks earnestly to the & # 34 ; giant spider destroys everything & # 34 ; plotline that is so hard to pull off . Admittedly it could have been a bit more self-aware of its goofy storyline , but it 's pretty fun.But there is plenty of quick clever dialogue ( & # 34 ; Your Spanglish is pressuring me ! & # 34 ; ) and some tongue-in-cheek humor ( Alex decides to ram the spider with his pickup truck ) , keeping the pace going between action scenes . And yes , there are plenty of scenes of people being squished , melted and swarmed by the acid-spewing , hyper-webbing Big Ass Spider.It should also be noted that this is a pretty low-budget movie ; director Mike Mendez could n't afford a casting director , so he actually cast people from his Facebook friends list . Considering that budget , the special effects are pretty decent -- the spider is no Shelob , but it 's good for what it is , and it has a certain Harryhausen charm . Plus , it 's fun to see it repeatedly stabbing people with its spearlike legs.The actors all do a pretty decent job -- Grunberg is a fairly nice everyman hero , as the only one who knows enough about spiders to track the Big Ass Spider ! down . Lin Shaye is a bit wooden at times ( & # 34 ; I 'm stuck & # 34 ; ) but is a serviceable hard-nosed love interest , while Boyar manages to be comic relief without being ridiculous . Perennial cult star Ray Wise ( you know , the devil from & # 34 ; Reaper & # 34 ; ) also gives us a nice performance as the harried Special Forces general.In other words , if the SyFy Channel 's slapdash careless approach to creature features annoys you , this may be a welcome break . A fun , unpretentious B-movie that gives you what you want : a big ass spider !	1
Liking this movie will depend entirely on whether or not you can accept Greg Grunberg as a comedic/action star . His character is not unlike John Goodman 's exterminator in Arachnophobia . Grunberg just is n't as funny or credible in a lead role that requires a lot of heroism and comedy . Every scene he 's not in , soars . Every scene he is in , plummets . Loved the spider , could n't stand him . On the other hand , his unofficial sidekick ( Lombardo Boyar ) was funny and knew exactly how not to overplay his lines . The problem with this film is half of it was way too serious , while the other half tried too hard to be a crazy with humor . It lacked balance . But the spider was cool . And all the requisite fright was delivered with the use of jump-scares ( they 're cheap shots but they do the job ) . The FX was fantastic . As a fan of creature features , I did like this movie . I just do n't love it . But I am keeping it to watch again .	1
Delightful B-Movie Sports Accomplished Camp Sensibilities : Fun For the Whole Family ! Confession : I love B movies when ( and usually only when ) they & # 8217 ; re well made . What that means to me is that all of the particulars associated to said B movie & # 8211 ; the writer , the cast , the crew & # 8211 ; are & # 8220 ; in & # 8221 ; on it . From the outset , they realize that their movie may not have the chance to legitimately compete with the latest Michael Bay gloss-fest , the next effects-laden miracle from Peter Jackson , or anything Steven Spielberg chooses to put his name on ( even when he & # 8217 ; s phoning it in ) . Well-made B movies are genius : they & # 8217 ; re a celebration of exactly what film could be when everyone in it decides to just & # 8216 ; have fun with it. & # 8217 ; It doesn & # 8217 ; t mean that the material gets disrespected ; rather , it means that the various players realize their only shot at greatest is breaking through the glass ceiling of critics in favor of finding that soft , soft place in the hearts of movie fans everywhere.With a name like BIG ASS SPIDER ! , one really should know what one & # 8217 ; s getting into right away . Thankfully , it delivers almost everything it could : a celebration of things that go bump in the night with a handful of laughs along the way . ( NOTE : The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters . If you & # 8217 ; re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free , then I & # 8217 ; d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment . If , however , you & # 8217 ; re accepting of a few modest hints at & # 8216 ; things to come , & # 8217 ; then read on & # 8230 ; ) L.A. & # 8211 ; aka Los Angeles & # 8211 ; is about to face its most dire challenge yet . No , it isn & # 8217 ; t an earthquake . It isn & # 8217 ; t a tsunami . It isn & # 8217 ; t the Obama Administration . Rather , a secret government project has somehow been outsmarted ( why does that always happen ? ) , and a giant , hungry spider is roaming the streets . When all else fails & # 8211 ; when our government can & # 8217 ; t even begin to get things back under control & # 8211 ; mankind & # 8217 ; s only hope takes the shape of Alex Mathis ( played to near-perfection by a goofy Greg Grunberg ) , a crack exterminator , and his wise-cracking sidekick Jose Ramos , an armed hospital security guard . Together , they & # 8217 ; ll do what the United States military can & # 8217 ; t & # 8230 ; or they & # 8217 ; ll die trying ! Look . I & # 8217 ; m not going to try to convince you otherwise . As I said , the name of the flick & # 8211 ; BIG ASS SPIDER ! & # 8211 ; really should tell you everything about this motion picture that you need to know . It & # 8217 ; s all wry , sly , and witty from start to finish . The special effects ? Well , they & # 8217 ; re not STAR WARS quality , but they work just fine for what they were intended to do . They & # 8217 ; re good CGI , not grand . The story ? Oh , of course , it isn & # 8217 ; t perfect , but it & # 8217 ; s probably fairly close to what scribe Gregory Gieras intended with some modest ad-libs by everyone on the set.But the experience ? Anyone who celebrates B movies should recognize a quality effort , and that & # 8217 ; s what SPIDER is : hands down , it & # 8217 ; s probably some of the most fun that a cast , crew , and audience had together . Grunberg & # 8211 ; who & # 8217 ; s had solid cameo works in more than a handful of major productions & # 8211 ; is clearly the ringleader here , and he attacks it all with a kinda/sorta chunky Bill Murray quality . He manages to lift every scene he & # 8217 ; s in to a level higher probably because of his goofiness . And Boyar & # 8211 ; as his quick-witted partner & # 8211 ; only lets a few good opportunities escape a witticism from him . And veteran character actor Ray Wise as Major Braxton Tanner & # 8211 ; ultimately the man responsible for both letting the spider get away as well as marshaling the effort to see it stopped & # 8211 ; is about as brilliant as casting work one could expect from B movie greatness.All in all , this is a wonderful time at the movies . It & # 8217 ; s the kind of flick that isn & # 8217 ; t too long ( 80 minutes ) and is best served with a bowl of popcorn and a couple of beers . Leave your brain at the door . You & # 8217 ; re not going to need it.BIG ASS SPIDER ! ( 2013 ) is produced by Epic Pictures Group , Wittgenstein Entertainment , Film Entertainment Services , ICE Animations , and Snowfort Pictures . DVD distribution is being handled by Epic Pictures . As for the technical specifications , I & # 8217 ; m going to be perfectly honest : this is a B movie , and , as such , you can expect for very high quality B movie sights and sounds to dictate your experience & # 8211 ; there were some minor instances of audio varying on the dialogue track that became a bit distracting in the first half , but it did seem to work itself out in the latter . ( It could & # 8217 ; ve used a better mixer . ) And & # 8211 ; say it isn & # 8217 ; t so ! & # 8211 ; there & # 8217 ; s actually an assortment of special features including cast interviews , TV spots , trailers , a SXSW featurette , and something resembling a commentary track.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . B-movie patrons and makers could all benefit from a quick study : watch BIG ASS SPIDER ! and take its sensibilities to heart . Clearly , everyone associated with this film ( the screenwriter , the director , the cast and crew , etc . ) knew precisely what they were doing , understood precisely what they wanted to achieve , and then delivered on their collective promise to deliver exactly the kind of movie that a network like SyFy Channel would benefit from following . Everything is tongue-in-cheek , from the established movie science right down to the winning performances by Greg Grunberg and Lombardo Boyar . There & # 8217 ; s no doubt in my mind all associated with this had a blast making it ; it & # 8217 ; s the kind of satisfying experience lesser movies should strive for ! Bravo , director Mendez , for bringing it all together ! Now & # 8230 ; let & # 8217 ; s see a sequel ! In the interests of fairness , I & # 8217 ; m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Epic Pictures provided me with an advance DVD copy of BIG ASS SPIDER ! by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review .	1
As a child born in the mid-1950 's , I 've watched ( continue to watch and purchase ) more than my fair share of black and white horror flicks with all kinds of creepy bugs , insects , and lizards taking up the size of the screen . I will admit that I was skeptical about BAS , thinking that just like so many other movies , the trailer showed it all ; but I gave BAS a chance , and I am glad I did.Watch the trailer . Simply put : If you do n't like the trailer , you will not like the movie . On the other hand , if you are entertained by the trailer or enjoy the Big Bug movies from the 50s and 60s ( Them , Beginning of the End , Praying Mantis ) , give BAS a try as I do n't think you 'll be disappointed in this movie that reminds me of those movies I watched way back when I lived in Vailsburg , NJ .	1
Nine Things about the Movie & # 8220 ; Big Ass Spider ! & # 8221 ; 1 . This enjoyable , ultra-low budget Z-movie is kind of like those movies made for the SyFy Channel , except better.2 . It & # 8217 ; s about , well , a big ass spider.3 . A spider eats it & # 8217 ; s way out of a dead body at a hospital , and goes on a rampage , growing really fast , making webs , and spitting acid on people.4 . A goofy exterminator named Alex and a Mexican security guard named Jose find themselves competing with the military to find and kill the spider.5 . The movie clearly wasn & # 8217 ; t trying to take itself serious . It knows exactly what it is , and revels in it . As proof that the director knows what he was making , Lloyd Kaufman has a cameo ( if you don & # 8217 ; t know who Lloyd Kaufman is , don & # 8217 ; t worry about it . It would take too long to explain ) .6 . The budget is so low that apparently the director actually cast the film from his Facebook friends . The special effects are pretty bad , except for the spider . I think all the money went to making the spider . It looks pretty cool.7 . It & # 8217 ; s also really funny . The main characters , Alex and Jose , have a great chemistry and comic timing.8 . It & # 8217 ; s an homage to other monster movies , and you can find references to many other films here.9 . If you are expecting an actual horror monster movie , you will hate this . But if you & # 8217 ; re in the mood for a stupid-smart , good-natured monster comedy , then this is something you & # 8217 ; ll want to check out .	1
This movie was a lot better than I expected . It was well made for a direct-to-video movie . It was funny , cheesy , corny and that 's what made it so awesome . Alex the exterminator is about to have a bad day when he must go head-to-head with an enormous black widow spider who eats and kills anyone that gets in her way . Alex teams up with a Mexican security guard and together they try to kill the spider by any means necessary . I highly recommend BIG ASS SPIDER ! ! !	1
Did you see snakes on a plane ? Same thing different creature and location . First let me say I am terrified of spiders and there were some parts I could not look at , but this movie being FUNNY , yep , funny , helped me to watch it . The 2 leads the exterminator and the security guard ( Jose , love him , so funny ) were terrific . Definitely recommend this for some fun viewing . Who would have thought . Big Ass Spider , it certainly is !	1
love it funny and movie is good nicely kept like new dvd thanks gohasting for keeping your dvd well kept and your movies are great	1
Now by contrast , BIG ASS SPIDER ! is how you do a comedy monster movie ! ! Starring Greg Grunberg and Lombardo Boyar ( who is freaking brilliant , and funny as hell , in this film ) , the story is simple : an alien species the government has been studying , for possible future use as a weapon , gets away and runs amok in Los Angeles . A normal-sized spider that grows massively huge the more it kills , the arachnid - while still small - comes under the watchful gaze of Alex Mathis ( Grunberg ) , an exterminator specializing in the habits and toxicology of arachnids , who tries killing it before realizing just what he has on its hands . But soon is becomes so huge , so unstoppable , that even when a crack military team sent by the U.S. government ca n't stop it , it falls to Alex and a security guard named Jose ( Boyar ) to save downtown Los Angeles . This film is HILARIOUS , nearly every line that comes out of Boyar 's mouth alone a gem , and with perfect grade-B special effects and just the right amount of blood and gore , BIG ASS SPIDER ! is one of the best ways to laugh and jump scare through a couple of hours that I 've come across in a long time .	1
JUST HAD TO GET THIS MOVIE . WATCHED IT IMMEDIATELY AND LOVED IT . I THINK IT WAS BETTER THAN SNAKES ON THE PLANE	1
Exterminator Alex Mathis ( Greg Grunberg ) likes women and loathes fruitcake . Through a series of improbable circumstances he gets to fight an aggressive BA spider along side of the US military with a Mexican sidekick.In a number of scenes Grunberg reminded me of Kevin James and I had a few John Goodman flashbacks . The film had blood and cheesy props ( notice the thanks to Lloyd Kaufman in the credits ) . The & # 34 ; horror & # 34 ; aspect simply did n't exist . Overly accomplished , relatively unknown Clare Kramer provided the love interest.Great for cheese lovers.Parental Guide : No f-bombs , sex , or nudity . Bikini girls being chased by BS spider .	1
If you 're looking for 'Citizen Kane ' , move along.If you want 'Gone with the Wind ' , move along.If you want 'Plan 9 From Outer Space ' , move along.As I tell everyone I know , you get what you pay for.I did.This is comparatively high art when held up against anything currently ( or otherwise ) being presented on the ScyFy channel.Cartoon Network ? Meh.The `` Gon na ' Kill Some Spiders '' bossa nova/rap in the elevator stands out as a highlight , for me.This is how to take a sublimely ridiculous subject and turn it into entertainment as opposed to the usual dry , dusty farts ScyFy keeps churning out.If you 're gon na ' go low brow , make it fun.I thought Greg Grunberg was killed by Tom Cruise during filming of MI 3 ... .. no ? Not really leading man material , in my opinion , and , getting the girl at the end ? Please , sugar ... ..And what a terrible waste of a scantily clad bunch of female volleyball players ... .. cheeks and everything ! Lotsa ' fun , do n't expect a religious awakening .	1
I have always had a soft spot for those old , giant bug films like Them , and Tarantula . Those schlocky sci-fi/horrors of the 1950s were often unintentionally funny but always entertaining . Big Ass Spider is a throwback to those films but with a Tremors style brand of humor . Greg Gunberg ( Heroes ) stars as Alex Mathis , an exterminator who specializes in & # 8220 ; getting into the heads of spiders & # 8221 ; . Mathis ends up at a hospital after being bit by one of his prey . The military arrives on the scene with Ray Wise as Major Tanner and Clare Kramer ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) as Lieutenant Brant , looking for a body that was delivered to the morgue in error.The body was home to a spider , genetically manipulated with microbes found in Martian soil which cause the spider to grow exponentially . Mathis , and hospital security guard Jose ( Boyar ) team-up to hunt down the arachnid , unaware of its true nature . The spider grows from the size of a small dog , to the size of a man , to that of a large dinosaur as it wreaks destruction in downtown Los Angeles . As the military fails to control the giant spider , it is up to Alex and Jose to kill the beast before it can lay its eggs.Big Ass Spider is heavily influenced by both Arachnophobia and Tremors , both of which are superior films . Its special effects are strictly Sy-Fy Channel quality and this would be the type of film you would expect to find on that network were it not for the quality of the cast . Grundberg and Boyer are the most enjoyable monster-hunting team to come along since Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon joined forces for Tremors in 1990 . They share playing straight man and comic foil equally and deliver more laughs than the film has a right.Ray Wise and his electric smile never fail to entertain . While he might not be believable as a military commander he still commands every scene he is in . The always wacky Lin Shaye has bit role as Alex & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; favorite & # 8221 ; customer . Legendary cult film Producer/director/actor , and founder of Troma Studios , Lloyd Kaufman , has a cameo as a jogger who runs afoul of the giant arachnid.Big Ass Spider isn & # 8217 ; t a film you want to sit down and over analyze as there are plot points you can drive holes through and sub-par CGI . The first 20 minutes are far too similar to Arachnophobia before it finally finds its own legs . This is the type of film you just sit back and enjoy the ride and move on . The film had a limited theatrical release and will be available on blu-ray and DVD on January 7.Blu-Ray ExtrasBig Ass Spider Premiere ( 5:07 ) & # 8211 ; The Director and cast meet fans at the films premiere at SXSW in Austin , Texas as Director Mike Mendez introduces the film to an eager audience.Interviews with the Cast ( 1:30 ) & # 8211 ; At a mere minute and a half these are not interviews but rather just a few short comments from Grunberg , Kramer , and Boyar about the film .	1
05/17/2014LOVE THIS SHOW ... CAN NOT WAIT TIL IT COMES BACK ON.IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER ! ! ! WAS HE NOT ON THEMOVIE & # 34 ; STARGATE & # 34 ; ? I AM WATCHING IT NOW.PLEASE DO NOT WAIT TOOOO LONG TO COME BACK ON LIKE ALLTHE OTHER SHOWS ARE DOING ... .WE ALL WILL WAIT ...	1
The Blacklist is one of the best shows I have seen in a while . James Spader is excellent . Definately recommend	1
Ca n't get enough of this tv show ! ! ! ! Hooked from the pilot and every episode since ! ! ! Ca n't wait to see what happens next ! ! ! LOVE that amazon had it available too ... .such a time saver !	1
Dark , pretty violent even by today 's standards.Basically someone on the top of the FBI 's most wanted list , uber criminal type with a global organization of & # 34 ; friends & # 34 ; that know how to do things for him decides to turn himself in.BUT , only on the day that a new FBI agent ( female ) joins the fold , and he 'll only talk to her.Idea is on the surface that 's he 's trading immunity for turning in a list of people that he 's accumulated over the years ( his & # 34 ; blacklist & # 34 ; and yeah he makes fun of that himself , so there 's that . ) Each week , another & # 34 ; number & # 34 ; from the list is investigated / eliminated.Mid-season there 's a two parter that puts him off on his own private agenda for a couple of episodes . But he 's still there , and interacting with the cast.All in hold , very good characterizations , a lot of violence , but really it 's needed to move the plot going forward.Spader is likeable , and has a moral center ... . It 's just everything around that center is not what you 'd expect from a & # 34 ; hero & # 34 ; .Someone torques him off , like as not is going to wind up buried by the end of the episode.A point shaved off just because of the shark jumping done in some of the plot devices , and coincidence factor .	1
Great concept , interesting writing , perfect balance of action , adventure , intrigue , loss , mystery , well ... it has it all and I mean it all . Black List has James Spader ! I watched this show to see James Spader . Even if it had not been the excellent show that it is I would still have watched the show to see James Spader ! He could have carried the Teletubbies to prime time .	1
I think it was the hat that made me shrug off the thought of watching The Blacklist at first . But I had a little time over a weekend and decided to take in a show . Then another . And so on.I was thoroughly entertained . Lock away the need to analyze plot for 48 minutes , and you may find The Blacklist -- and James Spader -- fun to watch .	1
James Spader is a very unique and talented actor . He is able to mold his personality into the role he plays . From Boston Legal to Blacklist , he is quite different . I have watched two of the episodes so far and am looking forward to seeing more .	1
The Blacklist Rocks ! Original , unique . Always new creatively-developed characters , plots , and approaches . Never a dull moment . The Blacklist Rocks ! They totally Rock ! Yay !	1
After getting sick with the flu last month I bought three pilots of three different TV shows and gave them all a chance to draw me in . The three were The Bridge , Dracula , and The Blacklist . I had seen trailers to all but the blacklist and was looking forward to all of them but was disappointed when I actually watched the pilot ... except the blacklist . I love the chemistry between the two leads and the plot of the show is great , even the writing is very good . The show is anything but predictable and I 'm quite entertained by the whole story . I think the Blacklist is a step above most shows on TV right now and would highly recommend it to fans of The Bourne Identity films , and other spy movies/tv .	1
James Spader is at the center of this interesting story about a man who comes forward with a list of names of people who need to be captured by law enforcement for various wrong doing.The one condition he has is that he requests that only one particular agent takes on his cases..As the series progresses we meet various villains who prove to be at times great challenges to reach and to capture.By the end of the first season one is left with the distinct impression that the agent requested might be the protagonists daughter . The mystery continues into season two despite some denials from the protagonist that the agent is not his daughter . Although sometimes dark and sometimes violent there are moments of pathos and humor to balance out the series and makes for good tv !	1
Friends have been talking about this show but I just started on Season One and am hooked ! James Spader is excellent as always- he plays the bad guy so well ! A must see if you like suspense and cop shows .	1
By now most people have been watching the show so going into specifics would bore you , and if you have not seen it , I might spoil it for you . So I 'll keep it short . I have always thought James Spader was a great actor . I think you give him any role and this guy can elevate it . I cant imagine anyone else for this role . For those who have not seen any of it yet , I would say watch the first three shows , if your not hooked by then ? It just may not be for you . You have the FBI , And the CIA involved so you get a lot of action scenes , you have Spaders character and another character Lizzy who is a government official , and the show revolves around these two characters . I am telling you , look at other reviews , you have mystery , plots that twist and turn , tons of questions that just keep you guessing and wanting more , and the week does not go fast enough so you can watch what happens next . You have an all star cast , But Spader really is a powerful character in this show , and I would say he even holds back a little , meaning his presence could be so powerful that the other characters could get swallowed up by him . But the writers and Spader leave plenty of room for you to connect with the other characters . If you love mystery novels or shows , DRAMA for sure , absolutely perfect writing , and there is no one particular story line . There are so many different story 's , so many twists , you never know which road your on until they want you to know , and you know they are just leading you on this roller coaster of emotions during the telling of this mystery of a story . There are so many parts , and eventually most likely at the end of the series , everything will be tied up before they call it quits . But the ride to get there is going to be one of the most entertaining and on the edge of your seat rides you will be on while you watch this show . I say give this a chance . Watch it through 3 episodes and see what you think . If you look , you will see most people love this show . I watch the Following , and I am a loyal fan of that show . And I am a huge fan of Kevin Bacon 's movies , but the Blacklist is just number 1 in my book . You find out what the Blacklist is very early on , as in the first or second episode . Start from the beginning , and Most will not be able to stop . You will either catch up with season 1 which has ended , on Amazon or you will order the DVD . This is a show that does not come along very often . Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue , Friends , Cheers , Seinfeld , Mash , and I can go on . This show is one of those . Just different material . You would be missing out on something really special with this show . Give it a shot . You wont be sorry . I guess you can call it a crime Drama , with a ton of mystery that you only find out a little at a time . Enjoy ... ..	1
I was very surprised about this program . I thought it would be very violent , but it is not . It is very witty and entertaining . I have always been a James Spader fan and I am enjoying his role immensely .	1
Gave 5 stars due to suspense , excellent acting and character development and consistent story line . I would recommend the show to any one seeking intelligent entertainment . Are there items that do n't add up , realities that would n't happen , yes . However , most oddities are parts which do n't effect the balance of the story . The center episode characters are often pretty terrible people so if you are n't interested in this you may wish to pass . Have found that between Grimm and this my weekends are sparked up when I have time to watch ! Give the series a try I think you will enjoy if you 've read this far .	1
There is no better lead actor for this series than James Spader . I found him repugnant in every thing he 's ever done until now . His brilliance is his smarmy and classy portraiture of a spy reminiscent of the Cold War era such as Tinker Taylor except he of course is the bad guy , or is he ? The revelation he is either the father of our agent Keene or her rescuer from the flames of her childhood home is something to keep us hooked . It 's too obvious for me to believe Berlin is her father . But , the passing moments of restrained humanity on Spader 's face in the later episodes is relief and redemption not only for the character he plays but for his skill as an actor . The storyline is engaging but not so overdone with detritus you must watch it caffeinated to keep track nor is it formulaic and predictable . However I ca n't be the only one suspicious of the.double agent husband or Red 's fatherly attachment to Keene in episode 1 . A worthy way to pass 45 minutes .	1
Give it chance , but do n't watch it out of order or it wo n't make any sense ... If you like movies like Spy Games , Nikita , and even 24 or Alias - you will love this series .	1
Off beat , well written , surprising and James Spader - winner right there then add a good supporting cast and it is more then just watchable	1
I do n't know how the rest of the shows will play out but the pilot was excellent and intriguing . The acting was excellent and it is the best pilot for any new TV show I have seen so far . I will enjoy watching more but I will be willing to watch on Amazon to avoid the annoying and awful commercials of regular TV shows .	1
I love this show ! The script must have been written for James Spader , as he is perfect in it . He and Lizzie are terrific , but the rest of the cast is average . This is a mystery thriller that focuses on capturing a different bad guy each week , which you know will happen , but there are lots of questions that remain to be answered over the course of the season . Who are these characters , really ? Are they as good as they seem , or actually evil themselves ? What are their relationships ? What mysteries from the past will be revealed ? Tune in and find out !	1
I love James Spader he is hilarious and plays an incredible part in this tv series . This show so far has captured different content to capture my interest . I look forward to season 2 I think this show is going to be a hit for many years . I love James Spader 's humor he is great in this drama and still very entertaining with his sense of humor .	1
Very Interesting Plots , and James S is just amazing as the Nemesis/Hero ! Would love to have this ... ... ... ... ... ... ..picked up for many seasons !	1
Promising new show . It does remind me of & # 34 ; Person of Interest , & # 34 ; but with a little more sinister influence . I find myself waiting for the next episode to show up ... so that 's got ta be a good thing ...	1
James Spader is an amazing actor . I was enamored with Spader in Stargate 20 years ago . He has an amazing movie/TV screen presence that makes you just & # 34 ; pay attention. & # 34 ; I found his sense of humor initially in & # 34 ; The Practice & # 34 ; and subsequently & # 34 ; Boston Legal & # 34 ; as charming as well as hysterical . I so enjoyed the scenes of his with William Shatner . Spader 's breadth of character bloomed in his role as Alan Shore from humility to arrogance in significantly effectual scenes . I was thrilled to know he had another TV series . Initially , I felt that it was a dark , deep , moody international drama show . And well it is dark , deep , and moody ! It is not my & # 34 ; Mother 's & # 34 ; kind of drama . But is definitely mine ! -The Blacklist- incorporates interesting new characters every episode . Megan Boone is difficult for me to warm up too . I think they are going to let her show some guts and time and time again it seems that she wimps out somehow . I would really like to see if she does & # 34 ; have the right stuff. & # 34 ; She needs a little bit of Buffy 's strength of character . The peripheral weekly-characters are also weak-minded . Who is the old lady that is managing this scenario ? If they want her to be a hated bitch , they have achieved their goal . Normally , I love to hate the bad guys , but for this character I just hate her , YUCK ! James Spader as Raymond & # 34 ; Red & # 34 ; Reddington has an outstanding performance and when anyone is in his scene , they shine as well . Spader 's strength of presence attaches somehow to everyone around him and you just like them all just because they are part of something memorable . I recall scenes of Spader and Shatner on the balcony on Boston Legal . Shatner was such a heavy hitter but James Spader was ready to meet the challenge . Today , watching The Blacklist on Amazon without commercials - It is my favorite show . It is dark , it is deep and it is moody ! My kinda show ! You just got to love Red Reddington !	1
This series has captivated me from the & # 34 ; get-go & # 34 ; . It has all the elements of a great show : it is suspenseful , unpredictable , action-packed and well-written .	1
I 'm a big James Spader fan , so I have to watch . I think he is one of those actors that wo n't do mediocre shows .	1
I love it . It has a lot of action and drama in it . I would recommend it to everyone I know . Thanks	1
We love this series . This is one of many interesting episodes . It is great to see James Spader in a role he is well suited to do . He can be good and bad and show a complicated man with the best of them . This episode showing a vigilante bent on torturing parents that beat their children added another facet while seeing Spader tracking down the mole in the agency and exacting justice made it one of the best . I love the fact they add & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; music to the series , this episode has Johnny Cash & # 34 ; The Man Comes Around & # 34 ; and Junip & # 34 ; Line of Fire & # 34 ; .CA Luster	1
Hannibal Lector with a moral backbone who does not eat people 's brains with beans and fine wine . So where do we draw the line between right and wrong , good and evil ? James Spader plays a criminal superhero !	1
i have n't followed james spader 's tv career although i did follow his early movie career . he , of course , looks much different from those days when he was the handsome young man starring in SEX , LIES AND VIDEOTAPE . i can now see it was a mistake not to see him on tv because he is simply terrific . he is an older man , a master at spycraft and warfare . one day he shows up at the FBI building in washington DC . he tells them that he is crossing over to them with only one condition , a new young woman agent who is reporting to work that day as her first day as a profiler -- -he will only work with her . he is on their most wanted list BUT what he knows about every criminal in the world is infinitely more valuable.frankly , i thought we needed one more fbi show like the proverbial hole in the head but i was wrong . i can hardly wait for episode 2 .	1
I am hooked on Blacklist . All the characters are interesting , but Spader is the master . By turns scary , sweet , amusing , cynical , he has this role .	1
While he does n't eat body parts he does enjoy a good Chianti . An arch criminal tutoring a naif-savant graduate profiler in the most spectacular crimes we never imagined . James Spader snaps right into the role of genius amoral master criminal . His unique more- erudite -than- thou precise speech mannerisms make the character mesmerizingly repellant . He really delivers this role . Well written , well acted but he is both icing and cake . Balanced by the achingly ethical straight out of school FBI profiler and her relationship with her feminist husband/ it 's marathon material folks	1
This episode cleared up a very big question every fan of the show had . It too was intriguing , and interesting , and fun to watch . I thoroughly enjoyed it .	1
on that I bother to watch . I HATE the so called & # 34 ; reality & # 34 ; shows , the & # 34 ; contest & # 34 ; shows , and the unfunny & # 34 ; comedy & # 34 ; shows on tv the past several years . I do n't bother with cable tv or the rest because what is on any of the 100s of channels is n't worth 2 cents much less the outrageous amounts any of the pay tv places charge . Now , that being said-there are a few drama shows I absolutely love-Blacklist is one of them and I buy each and every episode offered here so I can enjoy it annoyance free . James Spader has always been one of the very talented actors I enjoy watching . The entire cast is excellent and the writing superb . I love the fact I can purchase the season for a very good price and watch the episodes any ole time I wish once the episode has aired on tv . I will also purchase the dvd once it becomes available . If you have never watched Blacklist-do yourself a favor and watch an episode . You wo n't be sorry .	1
so so so so woweeee good wowowow wow wow good i love it but i cant say how much i love it	1
This show is super intense ! I love it . In some ways it is a typical FBI type show but it has a drama twist that makes it unique .	1
This television series is really interesting and intellectually stimulating . I watched it because I love James Spader , back all the way to Stargate . I have n't seen him in any other of his shows , and I was sorry to miss the one he did with James T. Kirk , but we did n't have HBO at the time . James Spader is a bright , talented actor , and I enjoy his style . The only reason I did n't give this five stars is because the plot , though fascinating , is somewhat questionable . My disbelief has not been wholly suspended . People who sell out to heinous criminal activity , rarely turn around unless they have had major epiphanies or traumatic life-changing events . It has n't been revealed yet , but I am curious to see how it all falls out.Otherwise , the drama and storyline are well done .	1
If you are fond of above average TV spy thrillers with an excellent cast and great plots , look no further . You have found your show and no need to leave your living room . James Spader does a wonderful job as our so called bad guy turned helper of the government so he can be near his daughter . And of course know one is aware of their relationship but him . And it just keeps getting better . Turn in for more .	1
The story line is great . The series is very enjoyable . The two leading actors are excellent at portraying their characters .	1
entertaining , gripping , acting is superb , each show has its own story and yet there are threads of questions and mystery throughout . Well done .	1
Watching the `` Blacklist '' , it was like watching a complete alternate version of the `` Silence of the Lamb . '' Upon the characters first meeting one another - Raymond & Liz , I swear it was like watching Agt . Starling meeting Hannibal for the first time , but alternates . Just like Hannibal attacked Starling 's bag and shoes , Raymond attacks Liz 's past . Alternate I tell ya ; Liz [ Character ] has shown that she can wear her emotions on her sleeve while Raymond [ Character ] is totally refined , like the finer things in life : pricey hotels , good food , good wine.Overall , I thought introducing the first Pilot `` Chosen One '' was pretty good . The Blacklist is really about an overly brilliant , egotistical criminal who 's fascinated with an up & coming FBI Profiler . Perhaps their fates were connected in the past in an all too predictable ending . I 'll willing to purchase a couple more episodes to see where the series leads . I like the chemistry between the two lead characters , plus -- - seems like things are definitely not what they appear to be.I recommend this series ... even though it does remind me of SOTL , it 's still worth watching if you 're into intrigue , mystery , etc .	1
Do n't know if they can sustain such a smart and intense storyline but the pilot episode was pretty awesome for an action-drama thriller . Thought provoking , complex , and fast-paced with a lot of mysterious plot points and characters . Let 's hope they build from here and not taper off to hum-drum land . The pilot ep is a must-watch .	1
This is the best series out today . On the intelligence level of Leverage . I like shows that do n't treat me like I 'm some mindless drone and challenge me with plots and intrigue . I hope it gets many years to run .	1
I had big expectations because I love English TV , in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring . It did n't appeal to me at all .	-1
This one is a real snoozer . Do n't believe anything you read or hear , it 's awful . I had no idea what the title means . Neither will you .	-1
he 's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations .	-1
This show is plain dumb and not funny . It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated . Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld , Cheers , Frasier , Everybody loves Raymond , Tool time etc . And they are replaces with shows like this one , with 2 dimensional stupid characters , bad acting and idiotic writing , where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny . It is not ! ! ! The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality ; all unlikeable , dumb , juvenile , infantile , sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities , and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme ; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands ( referred to as `` banging '' ) or getting quick cash without effort . And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything ; `` banging '' the other guy 's mom , selling alcohol to minors , threatening people with Jihad terror attacks , cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends , but all they ever do is screw each other over . With friends like these , who need enemies ? YUK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
maybe i just dont get it ... but crude not funny and irritating most of the time ... .guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV	-1
It was a disappointment . I gave it a few episodes to get into it , but it did n't get any better .	-1
hope they start changing the plot a little faster , never seen so many pole changes in one show in one week	-1
Ugh , I ca n't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ? ! The first lady clinically insane . Then making you think it 's the vice pres , then it turns out to be the president himself . Uhhh , yeah , right . I thought at first at least they did n't do another mole in CTU ( which they had done every single stinkin season ) ... ... .then , turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans ' orders ! But he 'thought ' he was doing the right thing . Either way , STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES . And they still have everyone respond to anything with `` I understand '' . Choose a different line once in awhile ! I give this 1 star , no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars . This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I 've watched . It 's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one . Feel free to skip this season , I wish I had .	-1
I used to watch this as a kid . We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm . They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows . It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made .	-1
Could n't even finish & # 34 ; Sky City & # 34 ; - it just feels like a sales pitch . Just get to the extreme engineering people .	-1
My 18 month old grand daughter loves it ! I guess she understands what Blue says when she 'speaks ' , I sure 'whoof , whoof ' do n't ! ! I just love that she loves it !	-1
When I was little , I used to despise watching this program , and I only hate it more now . Every episode , of course , is repetitive ( I know it is a nursery schoolers ' television cartoon , but there are more educational , entertaining series out there , such as `` Little Bear '' or `` Little Bill '' , that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously ) and predictable , even for a three-year-old child . When I was a small child , I understood that , whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character 's questions or not , they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway , and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring , repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode . I know that many little children do n't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her , but I did and hated to watch her . I also thought that the characters were ugly . I mean , Dora did teach me some Spanish , but most of the time she bored me out of my mind .	-1
I found this dull and unexciting . The graphics are very 90s ish and the soundtrack is so-so . She 's no Diego that 's for sure . Then again , she 's probably in the country legally ...	-1
What a morose way to end such a fun series . I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously , it would come to a bad end , and I was right . It 's like , we 're ending the season with no sense of humor . In fact , we 're gon na off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we 're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc . This show succeeded through its sense of humor ( why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English ? Duh ! ) . Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment . What a shame . Maybe that 's why this season is going for $ 29 ! I 'd rather buy two copies of Season 1 ! How do I pick zero stars ?	-1
Example : scientist walks into the bar where there is only 1 patron & the bartender . That patron , the pilot who shot down the UFO asks the scientist to his table & in his second sentence , he 's hitting on her . Unexplainable given he had just been on the phone with his girl friend begging her not to break up with him.Example : scientist shows credential at the gate to a secure military base holding the UFO . Guard does n't have it verified . Really ? Then , scientist does n't or ca n't go into the hanger & examine the UFO with the other scientists . Why does n't she verify what 's she 's seeing ? Then when she & the pilot go to the hospital , they are admitted without it being verified they can have access . Hunh ?	-1
The show is done in the 1990 's , but it looks older than that . I did n't relate to the characters and I do n't like to gross alien testing . I like my invasion stories to have characters I care about and watch them grow .	-1
I watched this because the Brits usually do a good job with good production values , casting and story lines . However , in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours . The writers , directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits . Important things happen with no apparent reason and the watcher is left scratching his/her head wondering what was the point . The American general is miscast and not believable . Lots of clicking of computer keyboards for solutions that never seem to work out . The ending stinks !	-1
ordinarily I love British comedy but there was really nothing funny that I could find in this sitcom . . .	-1
The first season of `` The Outer Limits '' was the best . Sure the second season had some classic episodes ( among them `` Solider '' and `` Demon with a Glass Hand '' which inspired James Cameron to come up with `` The Terminator '' . I 'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue . Why ? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time . They have n't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras . I 'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Do n't get me wrong -- the first season was terrific for the most part . This set ( like the first season set ) features the moving `` The Man Who Was Never Born '' with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world . Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere ( among his best ) , this was `` The Outer Limits '' as its best . Also we get `` The Galaxy Being '' with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death . David McCallum in `` The Sixth Finger '' about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how , in the process , we lose the essence of what makes us human . `` The Zanti Misfits '' like much of Stefano 's work provides a neat allegory about human nature . We also get `` The Borderlands '' and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like `` Human Factor '' but almost everything here is terrific even if we 're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on `` The Outer Limits '' ? Because MGM is convinced that you 'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they 've split them up . Heck , the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs . Nope . These are dual sided as well.So what do you get ? 16 episodes -- half the first season of the series . In August you can get the second half of the first season . I 'm at a loss here -- why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package ? The only reason is so that retailers ( such as Best Buy ) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again . If you 're going to do this at least give us some extras ( a featurette on the visual effects , vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens , commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony/MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue . Get this instead.The Outer Limits - The Original Series , Season 1	-1
Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work was n't that great either .	-1
Very slow moving story ... not very enticing ... sound quality not great . We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest . Unusual experience at best .	-1
It pains me to trash this show on Amazon , because seasons 1,2 , and 5 are truly great . This season feels like a made for basic cable action show that would air every Sunday at 2 AM . Every plot device , formula , etc. , is recycled here from the other seasons , almost to the point where they feel literally cut and pasted .	-1
Man , things were going great for the most violent prime time TV show ever ( less the killing of Curtis - one of those moments where clearly the writers simply wants to shock the audience or need to get rid of the actor for some reason ) . Things went downhill ( in my humble opinion ) after the Fayed plot was solved . By `` downhill '' I do n't mean disater , because a show of this magnitude , where each episode has so many differnt scenarios , shot on locatiosns cenes , special effects , etc , rarely is mediocre . You get the feel that the everyone involved is giving their best.What I mean by downhil is the above mentioned people ( cast , producers , technical guys , writers ) giving their best for a flawed premise . The Chinese / Russian plot was so farfetched , so forced , so unplausible . After all , the advantage of obtaining some secret technologie about your enemy is useful since he does not know that you possess his defense technology ! Also , to see Audrey Raines appears only briefly and as a `` zombie '' was a bad call.Well , that 's it . Anyway , I think the show still did not jump the shark , but this will happen soon .	-1
Just finished watching season 6 on DVD . ( I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already ) Dumbest ideas ever in 24 . Fox should definetely fire the writers ! There got to be more qualified people out there ? Don ` t buy it . Rather buy season 5 ( which was great )	-1
Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here , I do n't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is . So , I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3 . There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who are n't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV , not a single one , that my wife and I do n't flock to week to week , other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception . As the 3rd season played out , we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season , all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger . A serial rapist . A murder on campus . All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then , when the show started back up , all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes . The following episodes were , for lack of better words , UNEVENTFUL . All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending . What did they do ? What happened ? Did the writers lose interest ? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes ? This is what I think . Personally , I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them . So , they in turn , gave up on the CW.All speculation aside , VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season . The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact , but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it 's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts . The ratings that they 're suffering are n't because of quality of show , but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies ... like the big boys do ... cause we 're watching ... and unfortunately , we 're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore .	-1
Wait , Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U ! Not being a fan of the original Veronica Mars series , I found this one hard to swallow and even harder to engage in . Maybe old fanboys and girls will enjoy seeing their favorite characters & # 34 ; aged & # 34 ; for this new series , but as a newcomer I found little to like or engage me .	-1
This is a first : An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award ( Oscars ) nominated movies put together ( TOTAL ) . Also , interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star ( or less ) . Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a : 0 out of 25 ; 0 out of 14 ; 0 out of 13 ; 0 out of 12 , 0 out of 11 . I 'm just happy they 're not all from Salem.The reason : A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie : Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer . Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind ; back and tediously back and forth . Scenes composed of 95 % dumbed down dialogue . Other 5 % of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to appear current e.g . tablets , internet video , Samsung product placement phones . Lot of formula characters e.g . dumb act cool cops ; surfer dude ; party people ; lawyer cutouts ; etc.Baddd : How bad ? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed . Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People ! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie ; if you want to see quality acting , storyline , sets , props and actually have to think , then watch `` The Best Offer '' . It may cleanse you of the effects of this film 's shallow banality . As far as the `` fanatic-obsessives '' I hope that VM series was n't a representation of lives ( un ) productively lived . Let me know .	-1
Great to see the gang again , sad to see them together in this . I 'm not sure which makes me feel worse , that I watched this or that I paid for it ( okay rented ) . It started well I 'll give it that , but that lasted maybe 5 minutes and then let the shlock begin ! The only thing that could have made it worse would have been having Harry Hamlin show up for a cameo .	-1
You know the plot . Trashy kids being trashy . The & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; ones are the & # 34 ; poor & # 34 ; ones . The rich trashy kids are just & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; . Another movie to help the retarded careers of this TV show 's actors . They are all old and washed out . But they still try to be hip and cool with their texting and foul mouths , sex videos . Sorry if you ca n't route for the heroine of the movie it clearly is n't worth watching .	-1
There 's a scene in Misery where the author writes what he thinks his nurse/tormentor wants to read and suffers for his presumption . Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive , but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience . Instead of writing something that he could be proud of , he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted . In many ways , the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue . In the third season of Veronica Mars , Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that did n't tie into the arcs . Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans , Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school . The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be . Buffy recovered from the same setback , but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate & # 34 ; LOVE ME & # 34 ; vibe that wrecked the last season . A little fan service is nice . It 's cool to see Mac and Wallace again . Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine . It 's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children 's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet , a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating . Do we really need to get Piz again ? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores . Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later ? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law . Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2 . The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1 . When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates , you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service , the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story . It 's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get . Unfortunately , as you are referring to the Wiki , you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the & # 34 ; really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role & # 34 ; pattern.This is n't a bad movie . It just is n't a very good movie .	-1
Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING ... . and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free ... . do n't support these writers ...	-1
Ok , here 's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I do n't know whyit 's a disappointment but it is..it 's got all this gold and for some reasonit 's been cast in lead . Bummer man , because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once .	-1
This show is nonsense . The people being conned are too stupid to be believed and the main characters are n't much better - really , it 's almost painful to watch . The show gives no credit to its audience . I only made it through the first long long episode . Insipid best describes .	-1
I found these people to be liars , crooks , backstabbers and cons , yet they are portrayed as heroes , that just does not compute getreal they are crooks plain and simple .	-1
I tried three times to watch this series , but I can not get past the first episode , where the main characters ( who remember , we are all supposed to be able to relate to ) lie , cheat , steal , assault , bilk , pilfer , pickpocket , participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich . No , they all should have just been caught , arrested , tried and thrown in prison , end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor , but this series simply crosses my ethical lines ; you do not make heroes out of villains , you just do n't send that message to the world , unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life . Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element , that does not forgive them for their actions , which they never have to face , that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone , take over their life , impersonate them , and go about your business as if nothing evil happened , or that it was n't your fault.So I 'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away , while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things .	-1
This was at one time a free download . I downloaded it , but never had the chance to watch it . On the 31st , some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer . The unbox player had to be re-downloaded . None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded , but they began to come back - over 90 % of them . The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD . When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode , I discovered it listed but not for sale . Why ? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable . ? ? ? ? I can not even seem to delete the useless episode . Que pasa ? I give it 1 star because you ca n't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff .	-1
not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show .	-1
Do n't waste your time with season two . She could be fun if she was n't so hateful inside . Not good . Yuck .	-1
This programme surprised me as not veryy funny in lots of ways . By trying to be as offending and gross as possible , Sarah Silverman actually achieves the opposite : she bores us to death at times . There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety .	-1
A soap opera . Stupid script , bad acting , glaring tech flaws . It promises a lot and delivers a lot of boring stupidity .	-1
I love this genre but just could not get into this series.Girl leaves town with no gas in the tank , bar full of people ignoring the firetruck as it blasts out a warning that the radioactive mushroom cloud is coming in 45 minutes , the only two cars on the road within 10 miles and they run head on into each other ? Who writes this stuff ?	-1
I think Jericho has some great actors . Unfortunately the story really is n't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed , and yet , more often than not , the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town , and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed , setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough . There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else . Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There 's some nice twists from some of the main characters , but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything , and understanding what 's going on can be a difficult enough task . Still , it 's not a bad show , but it 's not the best , and it 's kind of overrated .	-1
Yet another & # 34 ; apocolypse & # 34 ; show written by & # 34 ; big city dwellers & # 34 ; who have a total & # 34 ; city centered & # 34 ; view of EVERYTHING.Let me start by sayiing that the premise of the shows & # 34 ; disaster & # 34 ; is not too bad . We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path . The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies . with the exception of one or two & # 34 ; farms , & # 34 ; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits . A character is either & # 34 ; of the town & # 34 ; or an & # 34 ; outsider & # 34 ; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world , outside of a big city . Rural America does not work like this . Small towns blur . The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompass surrounding rural areas . This is not europe and the local twons here are not , and never were , the local strongholds , complete with castle.No , while the initial premise of this series is well thought out , the mechanics of it are way out of touch with the reality of life in rural America . It lost my interest in the middle of the first season and I can readily see why it died so quickly . Big city dwellers would have no interest , whatsoever , and real rural citizens are just going to take one look and turn it off . It could have been done much better .	-1
The Jericho premise is fresh and interesting . But I just finished watching the pilot and I find that the story line is weighed down by the poorly developed characters and a lot of cliches about small town America . It is entirely peopled by `` aw shucks '' `` salt-of-the-earth '' folks . The kind of people you will never meet in the real world , not even in Kansas . Maybe the writers should visit fly over country to get a better sense of what they 're writing about .	-1
I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him , is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him , his brother is furious with him , his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody ( actors , seem to have a clear line on who they 're supposed to be ) .So far , after 7 episodes , for the first Season , I do n't know who , or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store , just a stone beetch ? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch ? There is so much good TV . I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across . In my opinion , they had a dart board in their office , and threw darts at it , to see which ones stayed.I 'm definately , not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program .	-1
This could have been an interesting series if not for the turgid script and the banal soap operish love triangles .	-1
I started off liking the show , but it soon lost my interest . I found much of it to be rather maudlin . The series is just not very well written .	-1
I see now why TV is considered a wasteland . This TV show is stupid . These TV producers have a formula , then the produce a TV show , like Jericho . And where do these immature male leading characters come from ? The guy is 32 . He acts like he is 12 . Sad .	-1
I only watched one episode . It had too much nudity and sex in it . The story line was good but did n't enjoy the rest .	-1
If your into history you 'll love this ! ! ! ***** for all seasons ! ! It 's a must see . Not for younger children ! ! ! I love to see how people lived in the 1700 's .	-1
What show are the rest of these reviewers watching ? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews , but barely made it through the first two hours . Incredibly boring , like a lavish network soap with all that implies . The history is sketchy ; if you 're going to twist history , at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time . Then again , I do n't watch tv , only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good . Guess that 's not the best way either ! Oh well , I found The Office ( the funny version ) and Arrested Development that way , so it ca n't be all bad . Did n't work this time , though.Pass .	-1
Yea , this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends ... Yea , this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends ... there is that enough words ? Edit : Bad acting - oh my god ca n't they find an actor that can actually sit a horse ? Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle . I 'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother 's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote .	-1
Season 6 is a slap in the face for those who faithfully followed this series for 5 years.Something happens to screenwriters when they have to write those last 3 episodes -- they stop being creative and want to simply take the money and run . They write crap.This ending is even worse than The Sopranos ending -- would you believe it ? They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used , at a great price , and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons , and the characters , do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6 . They are stealing money from you under false pretenses .	-1
This was the worst show on tv . A bunch of cardboard characters , wooden acting , stupid cases and vulgar and tasteless jokes . This was totally repulsive garbage and the fact that TNT kept it on seven seasons shows they are a stupid network .	-1
This was one of the most mind numbing movies I have ever seen . Cary Grant did the best he could with this plot and his costar ... do n't waste your time or money !	-1
I watched this long after I should have quit hoping it would become redeming in some way but it kept getting worse . I would not recommend it .	-1
I do n't care for this version of BG . First , Boomer and Starbuck are women they should have made them men . Do n't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue , jealousy , and who 's sleeping with who this week . Secondly , they use bullets instead of lasers . My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects . Third , the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they have n't even cured cancer . A society enlightend and advanced as this ( at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth ) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it . Almost every actor was a drinker , smoker or both . I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series . They also would have cured cancer and almost every other disease . It looks like they were practicing 1940 's medicine .	-1
Season 2 through the first few episodes of season 3 which I consider part of the season 1-2 story line were great . Season 3 the writers missed the mark by a large margin . I just finished forcing myself to watch season 3 . The first two seasons I could n't believe I had missed this show when it was on , after season 3 I 'm speechless at the waste of time it was . All sorts of character development which should have been woven into the first two seasons , and only warranted being short flashbacks and segments of the better shows to fill in some blanks as to why certain characters where the way they were , but to waste a season on it ? The whole farce of a story around the man who allowed the original attack and became president only to have him walk free ? I 've wanted to personally put him out an airlock since episode 2 of season 1 and they finally get his butt on trial and let him walk ? Its not a letdown , it is maddening that I wasted the time . I understand Season 4 picks up and gets back on track thank god . Bottom line is except for the freeing from New Caprica the rest of season 3 was not worth watching . All the background on the Admirals marriage , and the character background should have been boiled down to 10 % of the first two seasons , not stretched through an entire season 3 . Oh , and let 's just have a season where the enemy just goes away and focus on labor unions and peoples dysfunctional childhoods . Frak them all .	-1
so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar ... truly awesome , military sci/fi show , insane sets , great plot , good acting and those Cylons . all great ... .the end of season two had some difficulties . alot ALOT less action and more crying . lots of crying . lots of drama . lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust ... .i truly cant take Starbuck anymore , whiny brat ... could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons ... ..which , lets be honest ... is the best thing about the show.it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic ' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi ' alltogether.terrible mistake ... . i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar ... .you had a AMAZING thing going .	-1
This is nasty pure trash . Humans should not treat others this way . It is thoroughly not enjoyable . please trash it .	-1
We only watched a few of the episodes because though we like what Glenn Close has done in the past , we found this series very difficult to follow with the confusing flashbacks and the subject content was not to our taste .	-1
Very depressing the entire time , yes it 's suspenseful and has a great cast , but there was n't a silver lining or even the smallest joke .	-1
This show has too much blood and killing ! I do n't like the fact that the show is always going back to the past which creates confusion at times .	-1
stupid show , stupid plots , some actors made it fun , sort of.who bought this thing for the network ? Are they still employed ?	-1
Based on all the 5-star reviews , I bought Season 1 . Watched it and holy bejemus was I shocked ! This show is horrible , people ! ! ! ! What the heck show are you watching ? ? ? First , the story is way way way over-the-top unbelievable . Chuck becomes a national security asset and CIA and NSA agents just randomly take up minimum wage jobs near him to , what , protect him ? And why would n't the CIA girl , Sarah , take a job INSIDE the Buy More ? Why is she all the way across the parking lot at a stupid hot dog shop where she ca n't even see him ? You take a job to protect someone you ca n't see ? ? ? ? And then Chuck just totally randomly `` flashes '' on people and things that he just randomly runs across and that randomly starts each super retarded and super lame random `` adventure '' ? ? ? ? The actors ( and characters ) are horrible across the board , all of them boring , unfunny and uninteresting . The show is not funny in the least . I mean Big Bang Theory , yeah , that 's a 5-star show -- great characters , great actors , funny as heck , witty , solid stories . Chuck by comparison has none of those things and is truly a bottom-of-the barrel 1-star show .	-1
I love Damien Lewis ; he was awesome in Band of Brothers . But everything else I 've seen him in since , has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like . His character ( who gets out of prison for a murder he did n't do after 12 years , ) is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day . Either you like the main characters 'quirky ' personality and will get into the show ; or you wo n't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly ; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome 's Wife ( Jennifer Siebold ) both good actors , play very unlikable characters . In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien 's ex-con financial advisor , is 'normal ' and enjoyable to watch here . A big disappointment as a summer replacement show ; get `` Burn Notice '' instead -- it 's great ! l	-1
I felt that the new show & # 34 ; Life & # 34 ; was interesting . The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime . He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department . He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted . His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict . She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still , I found that the show was not compelling . I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little . Everyone loves a good mystery ! Dani Reese 's ( the woman agent ) emotional responses were confusing . On one hand , she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode , protecting him . She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others . She is a recovering addict . I would have disclosed Dani Reese 's addiction history maybe a bit later . The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well , if he was going for the quirky Zen guy . But , the way he speaks ( an attempt by the writers to make him interesting ) is not that compelling . He has no censor and that 's ok . But , the writer 's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews ( the main character played by Lewis ) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress , why they would recast her is beyond me .	-1
If Katie Sackhoff had been hired to play Jamie Summers and if the writers had all been fired and replaced by people capable of actually writing good stories , intelligent characters and compelling stories this might have been a great show . But she was n't , they were n't and it most certainly was not . I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part . Very disappointing .	-1
All the parts were there for a truly fine series . Good actors awesome budget ... well ok maybe not all the parts . The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just did n't do justice to the show . What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes . Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new `` strength '' . In the fight scenes she could n't fight here way out of a wet paper bag . One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise , no broken bones nothing . When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing . She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season . I really doubt that . I would not purchase a second season .	-1
With so much real quality television around , I suppose it 's inevitable that some just do n't quite make the grade . And in an age when writing on television on TV is reaching such high standards , it 's a shame that in the end it 's the writing that lets this down.It 's also worth remembering that if you plan to purchase this , it is only EIGHT episodes - yes , that includes the pilot . So Jaime Sommers is in a car accident , gets her limbs , eye and ear replaced with superior bionic parts by a covert group who go around saving the world each week . Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life , and later , a boyfriend . And for character development , well , in 8 episodes , that 's all we have time for , folks . Think of it as Alias , with added bionics , minus any of the charisma.Acting is fine - Michelle Ryan hits the required notes of all American woman , and woman who you believe can throw a punch , but somehow never quite convinces of having the superior IQ of the character - again , mostly the writing and not her fault . Miguel Ferrer is the boss , to add Hollywood clout . Let 's face it though , If Miguel Ferrer is who you turn to to add clout.. well . Need I say more . One of the highlights is a story arc with Isaiah Washington who turns out to be the most believable character in the series , and a delicious cameo over several episodes with Katee Sackhoff , from Battlestar Galactica . Since the producer of this series also brought that series to the screen , it is especially disappointing that it is on story and writing that this series stumbles.So we have a fairly hum drum series which relies completely on its high concept , and lacks pazazz . All the same , it 's worth remembering that 10 years ago this would have been a welcome addition to the TV schedule ... it 's not a bad series - it just has such strong competition these days , that why wade through sloppy scripting and lazy character exposition ?	-1
PLEASE make the stupid laugh tracks STOP ! Every other word ... ah hahahaha . Unwatchable . Glad I only wasted my money on the first episode .	-1
TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about . After hearing all this great stuff , I thought I should jump in ! On a day off , I caught a marathon on TBS . I watched about 4 episodes , did n't find them funny , so I decided it was n't for me . Recently I won a season in my office 's white elephant . I thought I would maybe give it another try , because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch . I popped this disk in , I watched all 7 episodes on that disk , and I did n't laugh once . The problem I have with this show , is that it does n't really make you think , unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development , Parks and Rec , and Community you do n't have to think . The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes ' and none of the jokes & # 34 ; come out of the charecters. & # 34 ; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha , but the charecters just do n't really feel real. , How they portray Asperger 's is unbelievably off , they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone . I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is . If you wan na see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community . and how & # 34 ; geeky & # 34 ; they are . The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show , and the acting is just awful . I know some of you probably disagree with me , and that 's OK . This is just my opinion .	-1
this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate . one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom . the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one , people need to be fired .	-1
Where 's the humor ? I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me . I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole . HUMOR : D minus ; STORY/PLOTTING : C plus ; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE : C plus ; OVERALL GRADE : D plus to C minus ; WHEN WATCHED : 02/08/2011 .	-1
The only `` bang '' in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust . My bad , I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal , Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL does n't make him funny . ( His casting as the weirdo , brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange , too . ) Are people finding this `` cute '' ? `` Smart '' ? All I can say if I am over 50 % similar to you , do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch . This will having you banging your head against the wall .	-1
Wow what a terrible show ... I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with `` unfunny '' .It 's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way ... just in a bad way . Bad acting , casting , scripting and on and on .	-1
If `` House '' had an actor of lesser talent than Hugh Laurie , it would have been off the air after season 2 . By season 3 , the shows were becoming formulaic and themes were being recycled . Unfortunately , the solution was not to fire the writers but to back-burner the primary actors.If the writers and producers had a bit more imagination and courage , they 've got great characters and situations they could mine more deeply ; instead , they chicken-out , content to skim the surface.Season 4 pushes the viewer 's willing suspension of disbelief past the breaking point . Chase , an intensivist , becomes a skilled surgeon and Cameron , an immunologist , becomes a senior ER attending ? Really ? And they still want to work at the same hospital as House ? Really ? And then there 's the ridiculous `` reality TV '' style interviews to replace House 's team . Sure , it fits with House 's love of games , but really ? And , finally , while House nearly lost his friends , job , and freedom for Vicodin in Season 3 , his Vicodin addiction seems to have virtually disappeared in Season 4 . Really ? Vote this season of House off the island . It deserves NO IMMUNITY .	-1
The shows selected would stop and go with my system ; PC-DSL . LO is the show for me and why you might asked ? I once wore a & # 34 ; Badge & # 34 ; , I served with honor and respect and proud to have served .	-1
The best thing to happen to season 2 was the writer 's strike , it put the season out of its misery ! With that the producers decided to cancel the rest of the season and try again next year.The cliffhanger from season 1 was not even delt with until most viewers stopped watching.Oh , this second season was PAINFUL to watch ! My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes . I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through , hoping it would get back on track . It never did , I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great , never to be equaled by season 2 . Maybe season 3 will be better , if anyone is still watching . It is sad to see the hottest show of 2006 go down in flames in 2007 .	-1
First off , I 've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades , and they 've all had some things in common , and they 've all had some differences . Most of them steal from the original ( Bram Stoker ) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources ( such as Anne Rice ) because vampire canon , such as it is , was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice . I loved , loved , LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer ( the TV show , not the movie ) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show , as was its spin-off Angel.That said , I disagree with most reviewers who 've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel . It is not . The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires , not the pantheon of assorted trolls , demons , and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated . Also , the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight , the short-lived ( 3 seasons ) CBS `` Crime Time After Prime Time '' early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto . Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight , in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the `` monster '' he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development , plot devices , and historical flashbacks/backstory . Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman , with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger , death , or some other terrible outcome ( the human being `` turned '' vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath ) ; thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other 's lives ( plot device ) , and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same , er , species ( living or undead ) ( also plot devices ) . And , like Nick Knight , Mick St. John prefers not to drink ( eat ) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood , Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood . Moonlight , in those respects , is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight . ( After this point , there are SPOILERS , so you may want to stop reading now ... ) However , there are some clever differences : Forever Knight 's big , bad sire vampire LaCroix , who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his `` gift '' of eternal life ( and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship ) has been replaced by Coraline . Coraline is Mick St. John 's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who 'd lived some 500 years , sired Mick ( made him a vampire ) on their wedding night ( in 1952 ) , and enmeshed him in an obsessive , addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually could n't . He never wanted to be a vampire -- he did n't even know she was one when they married . She made him a vampire against his will , without asking him or getting his permission . Now , of course , he has `` trust issues . '' She , from her perspective , gave him a `` gift '' of eternal life -- freedom from death ( sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight ! ) .Coraline crossed a fatal line , however , when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little `` family '' ( sounds familiar , eh ? rather like Lestat , Louis , and Claudia in Anne Rice 's Interview With The Vampire ) . Mick , by this time ( 1982 ) , was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective ( it is implied , though not directly stated , that he `` does good '' as a PI because he feels guilty about the `` bad '' he 's done as a vampire ) . It was in this capacity that the girl 's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes do n't kill vampires , they just paralyze them . Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe . Mick , in his PI role in the first episode , finds the distraught mother 's little girl , rescues her , stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her , and sets the place on fire before locking her in . The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family . Thus begins Mick 's distant `` relationship '' with Beth Turner , who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire , a mostly online magazine that 's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox 's character Lucy edits on FX 's show Dirt , except it 's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism . Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight , `` No Such Thing as Vampires , '' Beth , now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions ( but news-whore tendencies ) , winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers . Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA ( with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef , a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring , formerly on Veronica Mars ) .I did n't watch this episode on CBS . In fact , I did n't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS ' web site of full video , Innertube . I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin 's eye-candy good looks , I 've always loved the vampire genre , and I dearly loved Jason Dohring 's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars , so I knew I wanted to catch the show . But I was n't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing . The first episode was as predicted : stilted dialogue , cliche-ish plot devices , utterly predictable plot and twists.However , what keeps me watching the show are several things : ( 1 ) the show has a beautiful , SoCal corrupt clarity about it , a noir look that is dark , decadent , sexy , and shiny ; ( 2 ) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he 's on it because he 's got screen presence and , despite the poor material , seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills , including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language , which communicate volumes ; ( 3 ) Jason Dohring , who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen , and plays his amoral , jaded vampire role to the hilt , practically eating up the scenery , and ( 4 ) Sophia Myles , who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight ( in the first Underworld movie ) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion , and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin . She also is n't your typical stick-thin , anorexic-looking TV actress ; the girl 's got a little meat on her bones . So , unlike many of the women on TV , she actually occasionally looks like a `` real '' woman . Finally , ( 5 ) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it 's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode , however , was straight out of B-movie ( or is that B-TV ) hell . I thought , `` Eh , that was was pretty ; I 'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better . '' I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back , too . But I was n't expecting much from the show based on the first episode . I figured it would be my guilty pleasure , something I 'd watch as `` webisodes '' and not much else.Surprisingly , it 's getting really good . This has a lot to do with improved writing , developing backstory , intersecting relationship triangles , and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick 's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline . It 's still eye candy , but I do n't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV . I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox . I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this . But the most recent episodes ( we 're up to episode 9 now ) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick , while also increasing the tension between Mick 's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef ( Jason Dohring ) and the unhappy , secretly self-hating Mick , who longs for a cure for his vampirism , some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline ( Shannyn Sossamon ) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick `` went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster '' has only improved the show 's `` grab '' factor . The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn , but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon . And there 's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well . There are some very sexy ( though still network-TV-permissible ) scenes on later eps and I 'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake : like Angel , Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them , as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight , and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires . It 's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human , and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two ( or three or four ) evils , or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making . They 're still vampire shows , and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not `` serious '' literature . But as Battlestar Galactica fans know , it 's not the genre that defines the shows , it 's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they 're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective , this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all , and neither is the second . But the show is coming along , it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode , `` No Such Thing As Vampires , '' and the second Moonlight episode , as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following ( more entertaining and less contrived ) episodes .	-1
While the first two seasons were very successful , the third season is awful . THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut . The problem is that the show was really very good . Until , at first Earls goes to prison , during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse , a lot worse . Also , while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really .	-1
The reboot of Battlestar Galactica was ultimately a failure . It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there . The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout . The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed , characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense . Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced ? -- behavior expected . I would n't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer , much less command a ship . His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command , a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin . While a better leader than Bill Adama , she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust . So , too , was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff . Ultimately , I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care . And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately did n't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons . The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration . I said in another review of the series -- season 3 ? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away . Ultimately , I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall , I liked the Cylons more than the humans . I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable . It sadly just was n't executed well . When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode , you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades . There is a good story to be told . It just was n't this one .	-1
Good title , great cast with a sick story to tell . After reading several of the reviews , decided to watch this and evaluateSPOILER ALERT- If young male rape and its consequences is what you seek - then this is your movie ! Perhaps if I read more reviews I may have picked up on that . Shoulda passed on this one .	-1
It has a lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it 's not funny . It 's like a cheap soft porn . The dialogues are over the top .	-1
I gave this series two stars to be kind . It has very little if any redeeming value to it . Those that like to see borderline pornography may enjoy he series but I am not one of those people . I am surprised that David Ducovny , who has played good roles would even consider this series . Well if I say any more I would cease to be kind.Knight68	-1
This weekend my wife and I tried watching First Season DVDs for 2 shows we missed out on when they first broadcast on TV -- -- - Californicaton and Mad Men.While Mad Men ended up being very impressive both in style and writing , Californication seemed to be nothing more than an attempt to get laughs and reactions thru shots of nudity , foul language and body function jokes.After 3 episodes it did not seem to get any better from our perspective , so we hit the EJECT button .	-1
To much nudity and sex with a kid involved . Story lines are weak at best . You know he 's going to lay the girl as soon as they meet no surprise there . The girls are pretty and built but a woman would n't really let her daughter be subjected to such a life . If you want T and A and lots of it watch the series . Other wise there are much better series to watch .	-1
not good for your children to watch too much sex and bad words and bad plot it has no learning of any good habits	-1
My mom who is 79 years old , loves this show and so does the rest of my family . It makes me depressed . I think the differene is , that my mom has always lived in the cozyness of the middle class so all this is new to her and frankly very far removed from reality as she knows it . I have on the other hand lived in poor neighborhoods most of my adult life . I have seen metheads , crackheads , tweakers , junkies , you name it and dealers on daily basis , the havoc it rages on whole communities . I have lived with this violence and seen it with a completely sober mind.When you live in a place like that , the saying goes `` that these people are quite the characters , but have no character '' . When you live with this you develope a strange mixed feeling of empathy and disgust for people in the drug culture . Sometimes you just become num . I remember one time , walking on my way home an involuntary thought struck my mind as I passed some crackheads smoking , to my shame it was `` human garbage '' . I was instantly horrified of how desensitized I had become toward my fellow human beings . The hard part is , that you get to know these people personally the longer you live among them so they are not just some strangers anymore . You run into them all the time . The dealers are not without a respect altogether , because when a new one comes around they say `` No she 's not like that , leave her alone '' . Sometimes they laugh cuz the new guy mistook a `` strait '' person for a customer . However you always have to let them know you are cool so it 's a better choise to let them know you a little , that you do n't judge them , so they will trust you and leave you alone . Neighborhoods like that are very dangerous and you do n't want enemies.I know all the scum bags , the little guys that are trying to make a buck selling dope , the corrupt cops , or more like the cops who are so sick of it , they do n't want to deal with it . Sometimes they ca n't do anything because the jails are full . Seriously . The sadness and ramifications meth brings are horrific . The ignored children . I have seen it all and some of the people in the show are quite real to me . I know all of these characters . I know for example , its supposed to be funny that they are cooking meth in the basement while the realtor is showing the house , but to me it 's not funny at all because it 's too linked to what I have seen in reality and its anything but funny . I think the 1st season was more than enough addition to my reality . I highly doubt that I will watch any more of it . Sorry mom , you and my niece can keep talking about it , I am not interested.I guess if I was a straight laced and pampered in a way where I 've never lived with this kind of reality I would find this funny and interesting . But I have n't and I do n't .	-1
I never got into this series . I was n't sure if this was a parody or a drama so I gave up on it .	-1
As promised , the acting , cinematography , and general production values are top notch . But like the Sopranos , I find the content toxic and depressing . There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape . This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life . But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he 's destroying even as his own body is wasting away . I 'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers .	-1
AMC 's - what is this ? is a no sense or no nothing show ? this is fun ? i do n't understand , people do you like this ? no more words .	-1
I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the `` hype '' surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media . This show is another one of those `` con '' jobs . Sorry , folks , but this show is just plain lousy . It 's depressing . It goes nowhere . The characters constantly bicker and fight . Almost all the characters are a-holes , jerky , uninteresting , unlikable , unsympathetic . In short , this show was torture to watch . And still believing the hype , I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3 , hoping , praying , the show would somehow get better . It does n't . The premise is good . It could have been a good show . But it is just written so poorly -- unlikeable protagonists , cliched bad guys , a story that does not evolve -- so the promising premise is never developed into anything good . Even Bryan Cranston ( who is a truly outstanding actor ) seems bad in this . His character has two notes , he 's either bitter or angry . The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show .	-1
Season 2 just ends in the middle of the season leaving the viewer with a HBO Soprano 's ending . Purchased a prime membership so the family could have a movie night . Thinking about going to Netflix it is only 1 cent more and has CC for the hearing disabled . Like many Amazon rebroadcast television seasons are not CC or have a few of the episodes that are CC and the rest are not in the same series . So if a member of your family can not hear or has trouble hearing Netflix or Hulu might be a better option since Amazon carries little selection for the hearing disabled . Called Amazon customer support about CC their programming : i.e . Jericho , Falling sky , etc. , waste of time .	-1
In the not too distant future where George Bush has somehow fluked his way into another term as president , a chemo-virus has broken out in a small town . The Z-Squad is sent in to eliminate the problem , but a member of the squad gets infected and flees . He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club , which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future . The soldier takes a turn for the worse and finds himself a member of the undead only to take the club 's biggest star as his first victim . She continues to dance and the odd thing is ... the customers love it . Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal . As the money piles up , so do the victims . Will the chemo-virus continue to spread and if so ... how will it be contained ? First of all , do n't be confused . This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever . I almost turned it off several times and I honestly ca n't tell you why I 'm reviewing this thing . The sad thing is it 's like a trainwreck in slow motion . You ca n't look away from it once you start watching and you have to see not only how it 's going to end , but who 's going to make it out alive . Not that you really care , but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck . It is ludicrous , ridiculous , and absurd ... but it 's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it ? Let 's see ... strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers , zombies being sexy , having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor ... ever , the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund , special effects you 'd find in Xena : Warrior Princess , a Christian stripping for her nanna , Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her ... well ... I 'll let you see that for yourself , angry dragons , and foamy chewbaccas ... the list goes on and on . I 'm sure I missed so many more . The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is , there 's still a few good things buried under the cheese . It 's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese . All the cheap stuff is on the outside , but there 's some good stuff on the inside . The most obvious being that there 's a lot of nudity in this , which is good because it 'll probably be one of the only things that 'll keep anyone watching . Robert Englund 's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable . Also , the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times . The special effects are horrid , but the make-up is actually better than you think it 'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this , I ca n't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark . The thing is though if you stick with it , it 's actually enjoyable because it 's so bad . It 's cheesy , it 's amusing , the acting is so bad that you 'll be quoting it for days , the plot is pointless , and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending ! My point is that it 's a bad film and I 'm not defending it , but if you manage to sit through the whole thing ... you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating : 4/10 ( most people will probably rate it a 1/10 ... if that )	-1
Jenna Jameson has no looks left and has n't for years , and ca n't spell the word `` act '' much less do any of it , and it shows beyond doubt in this movie made for teenage boys . Anything at all to stay in the public 's eye up to and including marrying a violent , egotistical drug head , so I guess it is true that birds of a feather stick together.NOTHING worth while in a movie my neighbor started watching , and we both agreed to shut it off after 5 whole minutes it was so bad..SAVE your time and god knows please do n't waste your money .	-1
the story is ok. only thing bad is all of the dialog . all of it . and the girls . not hot , but good for stripper quality i guess .	-1
Zombie Strippers ( released April/08 ) stars one of my fave actors , Robert Englund ( forever Freddie Krueger in my heart ) , as the only real star amongst this company of amateurs and up and comers.It has been my misfortune of late , if you have seen any of my recent reviews , to be watching movies lately with less than stellar value , shall we say.Add yet another one to that list . *sigh* What I thought would be a low budget indie film , with some real kick to it , turns out to just ... .a low budget indie film.The jokes and situations are totally lame , old and stereotypical.To give you an idea and a good example of the latter , a Mexican janitor is loading up his gun and with each bullet he carefully puts in the chamber he utters '' Pancho Villa ... .Montezuma ... Caesar Chavez ... Cinco de Mayo ... guacamole ... '' .Yeah , funny , funny stuff , right ? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club , who is deathly afraid of catching `` something '' off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the `` comic relief '' , such as it is , comes in the form of the opening act , the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs , even if they had tried ... oh yeah , they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job , but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window ( great security ) .That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer/stripper infects another dancer/stripper , and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected , as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes , the strippers , after their dances , each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains , either heads , bodies without heads , bodies with heads , etc. , usually re-animate and they lock them in jail-like cells in the basement.Does n't every strip club you know have jail cells ? Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening , but before you can say `` bite me '' , he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line , the Marine major/leader finds out about the zombies at the club ( he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside ! ) .Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a-wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock ( ? ) .He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there 's alot of money to be had in `` working for the man '' .The Marines leave going to do ... whatever they usually do , and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film , the special effects ( heads being blown off , ripped apart , etc . ) are on the whole not too shabby , as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon , another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18-25 yrs. , because there is ALOT of T & A ; throughout the film , graphic at that ( I think they called it nudity , once upon a time ) .It is this group that would probably love this film , for that alone.Males of ages before , should n't be viewing this at all and those after , will , for the most part , see the film for what it is ... .bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit & eacute ; as the Russian Blavatski , who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top , but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually did n't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes , deleted scenes & commentary.All in all , despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project , it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it 's satire , send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job , as do the strippers ( for the most part ) and their handler Levite ' , but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pass .	-1
Rented on whim . Wished I had n't . Expected `` camp '' , funny , b-grade SYFY but what I got was just terrible . Nothing good about this piece of crap .	-1
Pay close attention to the film 's title . It is `` Zombie Strippers , '' not `` Zombies vs . Strippers . '' Silly as it is , `` Zombie Strippers '' is the title of the film starring Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund because here strip dancers become zombies and they dance on stage before the crowd of cheering males in a strip club . I mean it . It is a one-joke movie , of which joke could have been turned into something much funnier than as it is , by someone like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright , creator team of `` Shaun of the Dead . '' I only wish that they have directed the film.Jenna Jameson plays Kat , a strip dancer . Robert Englund is a greedy owner of the club , who is more than happy to see the audiences excited over the un-dead dancers ( whose dancing gets sexier as the film goes on ) even though some of the `` lucky '' males have n't returned from the backstage.The situation is absurd , but I think it is exactly the point . Unfortunately we need someone who can turn absurdity into comedy here . `` Zombie Strippers '' suffers slack direction , especially its earlier part where Robert Englund does not appear . Clearly Robert Englund is having a good time , and watching him as the sleazy ( and cowardly ) owner is fun , but the film is only sporadically funny with too scanty supply of jokes or ideas . `` Zombie Strippers '' is a comedy in which Robert Englund 's club owner is named `` Ian Essko '' and his club `` Rhino . '' I confess I did n't at first get the joke playing on the name of the playwright Ionesco and one of his plays , and I still do n't know why it has to be named like that . I was impressed more with `` ping-pong tricks . '' I want more of them .	-1
This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make . False advertising . They have the DVD cover and title in English ... but to watch the movie , you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning . It is a sham to use false advertising to sell to unsuspecting shoppers . They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies . This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me . I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English ... because he 's used up any trust we may have had . So when his career goes in the dumper in the US ... do n't blame the economy . Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English . If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with , we would n't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place . I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish . In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I do n't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly do n't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pass it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French ... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They would n't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English . If a movie is in Spanish , then the Title should also be in Spanish . And since this is an English website ... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only ! And as an added note : This director does cheesy , immature camera effects . Near the end , he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character ... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning . It got so monotonous I had to fast forward just to get away from it . This is something a 16 year old would do shooting a movie in his garage for a school project.And let 's not forget that the kid with the sack over his head was a cheap takeoff on Jason from the `` Friday the 13th '' movie series.Avoid this director and producer like the plague ! ! !	-1
There should have been some indication that the movie is in Spanish . ..very hard to follow . Hate subtitles . It 's tough trying to read and watch a movie at the same time . Did n't like it at all .	-1
Mindless show . Truly wasting your time . Not funny and nothing to learn from . Do n't let your kids watch this show .	-1
I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original `` Texas Chain Saw Massacre '' and `` Poltergeist '' but this episode does not live up to his reputation . The story is blurry , unoriginal and not scary at all . It is a tale that has been told many times before . An angry demon of the earth , this time oil under the earth , enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother . Now years later it 's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son 's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in . The story has no real clarity , and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer . It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute . If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper 's Season 1 contribution called `` Dance of the Dead '' and save yourself some time and money here .	-1
Half an hour into the series I was bored out of my mind . The premise of the show revolves around 2 U.S. Marshalls that work for the Witness Protection Program . The dialogue is forced , the voiceover is annoying , the domestic squabbles are comedic at best . Marshall Mann has zero personality . Bobby D ( Todd Williams ) is probably the best and only good thing in this show .	-1
Offensive , and I am not easily offended -- would be O.K . if not a prime time show . Main character coarse and vulgar .	-1
Really cheesy with really bad acting . Reminded me of one those terrible B- movies that play late night on cable Tv .	-1
honestly the costume is really cook looking for the time period this was made in.The flash is one of my favorite super hero 's ever since my nickname was Flash when I did track , so learning a little bit about him was cool but I really could n't sit for so long through these episodes like 40-60mins each ? the only way to watch this and stay sane is to skip threw a lot of parts , there is just too much story , if they re-made this into a tv series now a days and made it like the arrow , I would prolly love it if they made it , if they re-make this now a days I would love to watch it even at 2 hours an episode lolafter seeing how awesome arrow was , I never knew arrow before but once I started watching the tv show wow he is actually awesome , the story behind how he got accuracy and everything is awesome and he 's not one of my favorite , im even thinking about buying some green arrow comic books just to see more about how cool he is now . Flash I already got a lot of comics of him lol . but really looking forward to seeing a re-make of this in years to come	-1
I give the actors , makeup , & effects 5 stars . The writers get a zero ! ! ! Just another completely implausible scenario . Science fiction is one thing , unbelievable fantasy is another . The back to life and transformation cards are played way to often in Atlantis , probably why it died on the vine . Every episode was the same old blah , blah , blah ... ..	-1
I bought this season used and the second disc was actually the 2nd disc from season 5 , not season 4 . So , in other words the wrong disc was in the case . SUCKS ! ! Plus , the discs skip sometimes . So badly it 'll freeze up and you 'll have to either fast forward or totally skip the episode . Pissed me off ! ! ! I gave this 2 stars based off of that , not because of the quality of the show .	-1
Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good . I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with , but I will suffice with a complaint list.1 . The plethora of plot twists . Even M. Night Shayamalan would 've said enough 's enough.2 . Bringing people back to life . I know that they were never confirmed dead , but they were dead enough . I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3 . The various coalitions . How many bad guys can you work with just because `` you need them. '' 4 . The sloppiness of The Company . Whereas the General would n't even say a word in season 2 , by season 4 he was a chatty kathy . He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5 . The slipperiness of T-Bag . T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing : if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag . He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6 . The Scofield boyscout act . In season 1 and 2 Scofield 's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality . It made you realize that he was no real criminal , he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother . By season 4 I was sick of the `` I wo n't kill '' act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger . Ultimately , that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people ( i.e . the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull ) . The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger ... surprise the gun was n't loaded . Heck , Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7 . The resilient bodies . I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast . I do n't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking , but as in their abilities to heal so quickly . Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief : manhole covers that weigh five pounds , concrete that easily crumbles , abilities to run long distances at top speed , etc . But , I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified . From the beatings , stabbings , shootings and other abuse Scofield , Burrows , T-Bag , Bellick and Sucre took , they should still be hospitalized . Scofield did n't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed . Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8 . My indifference . In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat . I was holding my breath with every close call . I was exhaling with every escape . I was enthralled by Scofield 's detailed planning . I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair . All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4 . I was no longer at the edge of my seat , I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph . And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4 . Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster . There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality . It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing . As the writing got sloppier , so did Scofield and The Company . It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did . Even the ending was anti-climactic . The show would have been better off ending at episode 12 . But , being honest about the entire show : how sustainable can a show called `` Prison Break '' be ?	-1
I was shocked . Didn ` t even finish it.It was mind-blowingly shallow and infantile.Only FOX could ruin something as great as the original PB.Never in TV history have I witnessed a descent like thisfrom excellence with Season One to foolishness in Season Four.Only watch season one and forget they ever made 2,3 & especially 4	-1
The third season of `` Heroes '' was a complete mess . The season started off in a fairly strong manner , with the heroes targeted by the government and having to work together to escape . However , this compelling idea was abandoned after a few episodes , with the heroes once again scattering all over the globe with separate ( and uninspiring ) plotlines . What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together , and not in the same predictable pairings ( Ando & Hiro , Peter & Nathan , etc. ) . By the end of the season , I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it . `` Heroes '' started as a fresh , clever series filled with interesting characters , and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale . Unfortunately , the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season , stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes , long past their expiration date . Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian ; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak . Instead of introducing new heroes , each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored . One week Noah and Sylar are working together , then they 're enemies ; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited , then they 're enemies ; shampoo , rinse , and repeat . Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome . Likewise , all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a `` shocking '' conclusion.I 'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of `` Heroes , '' as I feel a certain obligation given the time I 've already invested in the series . Also , I do still care a bit about a few of the characters , despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series . However , I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers , which is something I did prior to this season .	-1
I am baffled by 30 Rock . I bought Seasons 1-3 at a second hand DVD & CD store and it has been an utter pain to sit through every single episode of all three seasons . It 's like torture . I ca n't believe I wasted my time and suffered through them . This show just is not funny in the least . It 's hammy , stupid , utterly unrealistic in any possible way , the writing is bad , the acting is horrible . There are other similar `` loopy and unrealistic '' TV shows , such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs , that work ( I love both those shows ) . But 30 Rock is just bad . It does n't work . It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time . The show 's `` stars '' Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan are just not funny at all . Alec Bladwin is good and kind of funny , but it 's almost like you feel bad for him that he 's surrounded by such bad actors and given such bad scripts . And in Season 3 they resort to these super hokey `` guest star '' appearances by people like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey that are just super hammy and so painful to watch . Like I said , I 'm just mystified at how bad this show is and how it 's lasted so long .	-1
The life has really gone out of this show by the second season . Typical cop drama by the second season , even the Zen angle for the main character is gone .	-1
The stories are all still great , but they added a love interest for the partner and he killed any and all momentum the show had . He had to have known someone to get the part because he did n't fit in in anyway with the flow of the show or the rest of the cast .	-1
The first series was average with some interest however the second year the characters seem to degrade . The writer seemed to loose his direction and the stories became more unbelievable .	-1
If you like fake tough guys , moronic story lines and dialogue that could have been written by a chimp , then this is your show .	-1
I thought the premise of the series was ridiculous . These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers . The script throws in glimpses of male bonding , emotional depth , and odd paradoxical integrity , which comes off as absurd given that they 're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens . If the storyline did n't attempt to be taken seriously , it could have been a good comic satire .	-1
Too much talking with irrelevant dialog . Not my kind of show . Did not see a point to the episode I watched.Will not watch agaian	-1
Casting for main character all wrong . Mediocre writing , very off base cop to gang relationship . It seems as if they cast MR. Rogers to be the bad ass , almost impossable to believer .	-1
This could have been a great show . But its not . What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America . They get to be `` bad '' guys , but bad guys within real strict limits . Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs . To undermine the premise even further they create real `` bad guys '' in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the `` good '' Bikers ca n't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos . We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money . Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something . He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang . But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire . The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works . Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey . When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble . But in Sons of Anarchy , Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk , it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters . There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this . And there were some things that I did really like . But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy .	-1
the plot is implausible , the characters unlikable , and the acting terrible . I 've tried to watch this show , but it ai n't no Breaking Bad nor is it the Sopranos . I think the viewer is supposed to be rooting for the SOA , but actually I just want all of them to go to jail for a very long time and take Gemma , the doctor , and all the other girlfriends and wives with them . Every episode repeats itself . The SOA do something wrong , the police suspect they are involved , it looks they are going to get caught , but then the police do something stupid and the SOA do something clever , and in the end they get away with whatever heinous criminal act they 've committed . It is the same for the next episode and the next and the next . Oh and often there is a shoot out between the SOA and another biker group , but every time no one from the SOA gets away unscathed and someone from the other group gets killed . Wow ! The police and the FBI/ATF are so incompetent or corrupt that it sometimes feels like I 'm watching a comedy . I 've made it over halfway through the first season and really questioning whether I should continue . Does this show actually get better ? Why all the rave reviews ?	-1
Not all that realistic . Loaded with profanity - well of course they are depicting 1 % ers . Everyone knows if you ride a Harley your a member of some outlaw gang even if your 70 years old and wear color coordinated nylon riding suits .	-1
soap opera ... like anyone needs that ? I didnt care for soaps when my sister was glued to them and I had to watch . I dont care what you put the people in , a leather jacket and motorcycles even cant make that cool . Katy is always awesome though so she save me from giving it a one star !	-1
This season stinks . It is preachy with no punchline . It seems tired and worn . I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5 . The increased appearances by Melvin Palmer does n't help either . That character is best in really small doses . Seeing Jerry all the time is a bit annoying as well.All in all ... I 'd kinda like a refund . Maybe Alan Shore will take my case : - )	-1
Despite John Thaw 's acclaimed qualities as an actor , I find that he was only convincing when he played a character who was very close to himself . So , which ever of his later characters you take , you are really just left with John Thaw . Morse is very much John and , to me , the best part of the show was the views of Oxford University . The plots are incredibly complex which does not really produce a compelling detective story ; the viewer , or reader , really needs some chance of being able to solve the riddle . The character of Lewis is equally poor and boredom is never far from my mind . John had a British RADA accent overlaying his boyhood Manchester brogue and it often slips quite badly which is embarrassing .	-1
Why is it that no comedy show can go a half an hour with out making fun of Jesus or Christians ? American Dad started out great but now it seems they will take the road most traveled . All jokes revolve around Christians . This episode was no different . It started out really funny and I almost said `` see you do not need to bash Christians , but I interrupted by the show bashing on Christians . I have quit watching Family Guy and The Simpsons because of this . The only shows that I really like to watch any more on FOX was Futurama and it was canceled and then there was King of the Hill and it is being canceled . Oh well , after I stop watching American Dad I will stop watching FOX altogether . Which is not such a bad thing ? Almost all shows on FOX are garbage anyways .	-1
Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch . The `` motion comic '' concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak . Apparently they only have one narrator . Multiple narrators would make this much better .	-1
There were actors from the first season that suddenly were not there and actors that were replaced with other actors - Super confusing AND much worse than the first season .	-1
Season 1 was not a master piece by any means , but it was entertaining enough . I could see why they decided to make a season 2 . However , they switched one of the main actors which was really weird . It also appears as they switched the writers as well . The story lines were just terrible , and the actors did not seem to believe in them either . I fast forwarded through each episode .	-1
To easy for others to use and children to get . Got credit and they told me how to block when gaming .	-1
come on people these are for kids ... I do n't care that Diego is & # 34 ; suave. & # 34 ; he needs to do something with his hands other than putting them all over Dora ... Is he in this country legally by the way ? i do n't want my 3 yr old exposed to an illegal immigrant or whatever they 're calling them these days ... enough .	-1
This is perhaps the worst Batman cartoon of all time . Whoever put this on TV should be beaten with a sock full of pennies .	-1
I love good caper shows , but the casting is almost a total disaster . Timothy Hutton , the black guy and the blond girl are not terribly engaging , likeable or compelling . The black guy , in particular , is utterly unconvincing as the stereotypical black computer superwhiz , and utterly annoying and bland otherwise , sleepwalking through the series . Timothy Hutton has a grandma vibe . But the tough guy is a good pick.I realize dissenting reviews of TV series are the kiss of death for a reviewer , but I have to be honest .	-1
Actuallly did n't finish watching it . Was not engaging enough . Slow moving and the romantic appeal was not evident well into the movie .	-1
i have contacted amazon at least three times now . the sound in this movie sucks . every fifteen seconds or so , there is a 'break ' in the soundtrack , making it impossible to watch .	-1
Buy the first 4 seasons , rent the 5th season . Not very good -- terrible scripts .	-1
I like Tim Roth as an actor but in this series his character is not as engaging as it should be for someone of his talents . There is nothing to connect on the human level - no warmth or even cold humor .	-1
Am I missing something here ? An entire season on one ( 1 ) disc and a running time of 60 minutes.No thanks , especially at $ 31.89	-1
and I find it irksome when a program , which deals with lying , begins it 's TV life , as it were , with lies . Intentional or not , it 's sad that most of Hollywood , if not all , portray Jehovah 's Witnesses as a bunch of frothing fanatics . This program would be case-in-point . It seems to me that the 'writers ' would and should make , at the very least , an attempt to get facts straight before portraying the beliefs of nearly 8 Million people . Clearly this was n't done , shame on them , and since they in fact DID lie to everyone the program looses any credibility it hoped to gain with me and many others .	-1
I 've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works . That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved . But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it 's hard on the eyes .	-1
Stopped 15 minutes into the movie . This movie was n't so bad as it was irratating . The quips from the Satellite of Love crew did n't make up for it . There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment .	-1
Mystery Science Theater 3000 is always great for a laugh , but in this case the underlying film & # 34 ; Laserblast & # 34 ; is neither good , nor & # 34 ; so bad it 's worth a watch. & # 34 ;	-1
Not the worst movie , But it is very slow and boring . Lena Headey is a great actress , too bad the movie was boring and slow . You figure out the movie way to early . OK video and audio .	-1
Plot : woman is seen with her coworkers , family , and bf while creepy eery music is played . Everything kinda appears in black and white actually . . . although it may be the gray rainy London backdrop . Anyway , she sees a woman driving off that looks like her . She follows her . She has a car accident . More creepy eery music and people.Comments : This movie tries to heighten the suspense and horror aspect of it with cheap things like music and people showing up only to startle someone . But then the gore starts . Not much but some . You get to see a dead man . You get to see dead woman who has been suffocated with a plastic bag and bludgeoned to death . You get to see another woman in a shower brutally murdered by another woman ramming her fist down the first woman 's throat and all this blood pouring everywhere . So there is gore and weird music . Pretty much sums this movie up . I think it is an art flick trying to be cute with a simple morale message . But I do n't know . They did n't quiet achieve that . Maybe I am giving it too much credit . . . maybe it is just some stupid horror movie . Anyway it is a waste of 1.99 and your time .	-1
Loser . Expected something better from Whedon . Big fan of Firefly , the best tv series ever . Think he is desperate or strung out on drugs . Do n't waste your time and money here .	-1
I was a fan of Buffy , Angel , and Firefly , so I had high hopes for this.Well , we 've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women , no chemistry between characters , no endearing characters , and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl . Nothing like delving into a parent 's worst nightmare with characters we do n't care about . Oh well , that 's that .	-1
First , Eliza Dushku is not , by any standards , a very good actress ( although gorgeous ) . Her appearances in the Buffy and Angel universe , playing a great character ( Fatih ) , was always a little bit embarassing when she was confronted with the better actors around her ( Sarah Michelle , Boreanaz , James Masters , Anthony Stewart Head , Alyson Hannigan ) .Then , the show itself . Whedon fans will think everything he does is marvellous . But simply it is not . In this first season , there are some episodes that border on unwatchable ( my favorite `` worst '' is episode number 7 , `` Echoes '' . Its 49 minutes seemes like two hours ) . The concept of the show itself is strange : basically , all characters are despicable . Even Echo 's handler is evil . Why ? Because everyone in his right mine must be intrinsically evil to work in a comapny like the Dollhouse . Heck , the Dollhouse business makes even Wolfram & Hart seem like children playing ... The genius guy , Topher , the handlers , Adelle ( who coldly puts people in the Attic ) , everybody is obnoxious just for working for that kind of corporation . And that 's exactly what FBI agent Paul Ballard , theoretically the strongest moral person of the show , believes but , tcham tcham tcham ! ! For the sake of shocking plot twist , and nothing more than that , he begins to work for the Dollhouse ath the end of the season ... Also , we have all the usual Whedon trademark talking , trademark alternative rock songs at the end of each episode , trademark photography , etc.. After some time , this gets boring.How this show survived its first season is a miracle .	-1
Saw this on the 'Tube , pretty boring and usual envrionwhacko conspiracy type plot and bad corporation , good citizen defending the `` wetlands '' and nature.Conservationists ironically can only conserve Nature and nothing else in Human Form , The rights of The plants and animals trump Humans.Shame that Roberts and Denzel both good actors were in it .	-1
I was extremely disappointed by `` The Great Buck Howard '' .The Great Buck Howard ( John Malkovich ) is a stage performer way past his prime . A mentalist , he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading , hypnotism and other mental games . The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience , while still very enthusiastic , is aging and dwindling . In his heyday , he appeared on `` The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson '' sixty three times , a fact he mentions repeatedly , and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard , a title he has determinedly kept ever since . Preparing for his big comeback , his business manager ( Ricky Jay ) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager . Troy Gable ( Colin Hanks , son of Tom ) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer . But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills , so he interviews to work with Buck . He gets the job and heads out with the performer , making sure Buck 's every request is filled , that the venues have everything set up , stagehands are ready to go , and the like . The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such . Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new `` The Tonight Show '' and plans a big stunt , guaranteed to kick-start his comeback . He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist . Valerie Brennan ( Emily Blunt , `` Sunshine Cleaning '' , `` The Devil Wears Prada '' ) shows up and begins to set everything in place . But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly , `` The Great Buck Howard '' misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable . It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory . Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts , `` I love this town , '' and he really seems to mean it . He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience . But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show . Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we ca n't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny . We have seen this type of character before . Many times . And many of these performances have been more insightful , more daring and more interesting.For `` Buck Howard '' to work , we need to realize the character knows his career is fading . He does n't seem to . He enjoys the shows so much , you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun . In fact , much of the time , he seems to be trying to make Troy 's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great ' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware . If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing , are we supposed to either laugh at or with , or feel empathy towards him ? He is n't desperate enough and enjoys what he does , even on a smaller scale , too much.Colin Hanks is OK , but he spends most of the time standing to one side , observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression . The only clues we seem to get come from his narration . And his narration never seems to stop , rambling on and on . Film is a visual medium , a visual art form , so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading . Narration is useful and necessary in some instances . It is n't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen , when we ca n't tell this visually . At least it should n't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film , both bad . In `` Vicky Cristina Barcelona '' , Woody Allen uses an omniscient ( and ever present ) narrator to tell us the feelings , thoughts , likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen . It quickly grates on the viewer 's nerves . Worse , the narrator is n't even a character in the story . It 's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes . The narration in `` Buck Howard '' seems designed for a different purpose . In many low budget , independent films , a narrator provides a useful tool . They tell us about things , bridging the gap in the stories , saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed . I generally overlook this , because it is n't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film . In `` Buck Howard '' , I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons , to help show things they could n't afford to film , but Hank 's descriptions go beyond this . They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling , thinking , want to do and accomplish . Why are n't we seeing this in the characters themselves ? Why do we have to be told this ? Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film . He stands to the side a lot , observing , watching , rarely speaking . When he does , he always seems kind of flat , as though he ca n't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions . I ca n't help but think how much different his father 's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt 's Valeria shows up , Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship . Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air . Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation . From New York , it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world . She moves faster , registers faster , reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town . As soon as she meets Troy , she begins to flirt with him ( she must see something we do n't ) and he picks up on it , relishing the new relationship . At one point , Valerie ca n't help but laugh at one of Buck 's statements , providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck 's official hosts in Cincinnati . It is an amusing idea , but the roles do n't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei ( Mr. Sulu on `` Star Trek ) . But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat . It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect `` The Great Buck Howard '' will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity , much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy .	-1
You 'll hear the phrase `` Total Package '' so many times that you 'll become immune to it . The fact that it 's being used in relation to a child does n't seem to bother either the parents or the pageant coordinators.From the get go , it 's obvious to everyone but the parents that the pageants are a scam . Everyone `` wins '' or `` places . '' The crowning system is some bizarre set of rules where no one really goes home a loser but where the `` Queen '' of each `` division '' is also not a winner . There 's a set of `` supreme '' crowns and a grouping of `` Ultimate '' crowns which is the `` winner '' of the entire pageant . Oh , whatever . It sounds like a set of prizes a couple of five year olds made up.You ca n't really compete in a full `` Glitz '' pageant unless you have a `` cupcake '' dress , the proper hair pieces , full make up , a fake spray on tan , glamour and retouched photos and other accouterments but your total prize will more than likely be only $ 1000 . Never mind that the cost of preparing for a pageant will more than likely run you more than $ 5000 and lots of prep time.The pageants reward and judge on beauty as it 's the only area that can not be dropped . Beauty is finite and transitory . The parents are both turning their children into monsters and leaving their children with no usable skills once their children 's beauty ages out . The most appalling thing here is hearing the parents justify the waste of time and excuse the emphasis on `` beauty . `` Furthermore , the `` modeling '' routines these children are taught are both cartoonish and ghoulish . It 's a sick , incestuous training wherein coaches teach them the same ridiculous poses they used as children that in turn make the children look almost clownish on stage and no one stops it . The judges who I can only assume are idiots reward them for it . I mean , who puts both their fists under their chin and shakes their head like an idiot and thinks it looks cute ? Or worse , draws a heart around their face ? No one and yet - every child does it.And then there 's the age inappropriate clothing . The less said here the better but these mothers really need to be hit upside the head with a large batch of common sense.And yet ... you keep watching because just when you think you 're going to stop watching , something worse comes along ...	-1
Surprisingly enough this show did not hold the attention of my two little ones . If a show is dull they move on within 5 minutes ... and that 's what they did . I however love this show !	-1
Wonderful show if you are an adolescent . If not then find something else to watch . The concept is funny but the show is not .	-1
Up until this episode I had not seen any of season 13 of South Park . To be honest I had kind of changed my perspective of South Park and apart from the odd chuckle , I was beginning to find the show less and less funny . I watched this episode with the hope that it would re-ignite my liking of the show and convince me to check out the full 12th season and what exists currently of season 13 . Unfortunately , the episode titled `` Pinewood Derby '' simply did n't allow for that re-ignition of my liking and I 'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for ; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist . This episode focuses around Randy 's passion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it 's run . In order to win , Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car . They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys . I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character . He 's good for a part in an episode , but it 's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply does n't work . The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways . The humour did n't really get me and I only really laughed at the news report showing Randy stealing the part of the super collider , dressed as Princess Leia .	-1
An Austrailian import , it is a 'Splash ' for tween girls . In comparision , it makes power rangers look like high drama . Do n't waist your time or money here .	-1
I love southern gothic ( like Cormac McCarthy 's `` Suttree '' ) but this film is missing it 's only crucial ingredient ... truth . The symbolism is very clumsy and the adults hopelessly stereotyped . Like Bjork 's `` Dancer In The Dark '' it had me and then it lost me in an ocean of self-indulgent bitterness .	-1
Not since MONSTER 'S BALL have I seen a movie that made we want to conduct a nuclear strike on the Deep South and then hang myself.Since I 've been to the south , I wonder if anyting coming out of Hollywood ( or Sundance ) can be trusted . To filmmakers , the south is n't a region or a people or culture , but a genre that can only be pushed and mutated into exercises in human depravity and despair . I 'm sure there are people who live horrible lives ... but that 's everywhere . And I really do n't think another film about addictions , poor white trash , and rape is necessary . Just me.The acting is good . The film looks very professional . The writing ... well ... life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood .	-1
I have n't really watched it very much , just enough to make sure it was appropriate for my 7 year old granddaughter . She likes it very much and has watched other episodes on her mom 's account .	-1
Needlessly confusing and characters I did n't care about so the DVD was shredded after the first fifteen minutes . Next time have a better opening , movie creators . That is all.Rotten Tomatoes gave this film a low rating . Maybe you should , too.Based on a roleplaying game of the same name.The budget for this film was a bit over $ 25M and it made a bit over $ 2M at the Box Office . The prosecution rests its case.OVERALL GRADE : D minus to D ; WHEN WATCHED : April 2012 .	-1
It seems every year Hollywood dumps out a movie that is some combination of zombies , alien invasion , gory violence , gunplay and swordfighting all rolled into one . For 2008 , this was Mutant Chronicles , a movie about an ancient alien device that is re-awakened by WWIII and starts to turn mankind into zombies . An international crew of soldiers , both guys and gals , are teamed up to destroy , or at least turn of , the alien device . The movie has nothing special about its plot , dialogue , or even special effects . All in all , a waste of almost 2 hours .	-1
`` The Mutant Chronicles '' plays like a bad SyFy movie original film . In the 28th century the world is ruled by four corporate entities and nations no longer exist . When two warring factions face off and accidently destroy the seal that keeps The Machine a device that `` creates '' mutant soldiers that feel no pain and only live to attack and kill , these mutant soldiers start overrunning the Earth forcing people to flee the planet . Brother Samuel ( Ron Perlman ) recruits war veterans Major `` Mitch '' Hunter ( Thomas Jane ) along with a team of other veterans to delivery a explosive device to the heart of The Machine . The only problem is that Hunter and his team must find the key that activates the ancient bomb which is located somewhere within The Machine itself.A low budget for a movie would n't matter if it were inspired unfortunately `` The Mutant Chronicles '' written by Philip Eisner and directed by Simon Hunter , the script and direction are amateurish at best . While the cast is fairly solid it 's pretty clear to me that John Malkovich took his brief role in the film for the money ( as I suspect everyone did along with the idea of shooting almost an entire movie without real sets ) . It seems like everyone here had good intentions but they were undermined by a poorly written script , direction that focuses on the look and feel of the movie but not the performances or even assembling capable action sequences.Perhaps the element of camp and the stilted dialogue was intentional or this is meant to be a corny backstep to a 1950 's style of filmmaking . If that 's the case , you might enjoy it . I didn't.The image quality pretty good.I 'd suggest renting before buying to see if this appeals to you .	-1
I thought the plots were weak and the & # 34 ; humor & # 34 ; was not very funny . The actors did a good job but it did n't seem that they had much to work with .	-1
I was an elected official of a small , local government . This series & # 34 ; nails & # 34 ; it ! That 's why I hate it so much , it 's too real . Not fun ... very uncomfortable .	-1
I tried a few episodes . Nothing that interests me , Had the feel of the office , but in a worse way . Maybe I just did n't give it enough time , but I did n't want to waste any more time on it !	-1
Like many people , I can have my interest spiked by advertising and such was the case with this show . The advertising generated sufficient interest to get me to watch the `` pilot '' program , however , having done that , I will not be watching any of the other episodes ( despite one review which indicates that the second season `` gets better '' ) .In my opinion , the `` pilot '' should set the scene for what is to come . It should generate sufficient interest to induce you to watch another episode and another and so on . As it did not do this for me there is no logic in watching further episodes .	-1
This is a very strange movie . It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget , the characters are ultra quirky marginals , and there 's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not , and what is really wrong with the 'woman ' , why ca n't she be in love ? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film . And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century . Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director , writer , and lead female is Marianna Palka . Jason Ritter ( John Ritter 's son ) is the lead male actor . The film meanders back and forth between Marianna 's apartment , the video store where Jason works , and Jason 's car where he lives . In the opening montage , Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section . She quickly chooses four movies . Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one , and she should not take that movie . He leaves off renting her the fourth movie , she leaves with the three films . Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic , the apartment is small , Jason over stays his welcome , the two end up just too close to eachother , the car where he sleeps is tiny . The only place that is somewhat open is the video store . Both of these characters have strange habits . She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD 's , she hates to have her hair washed , she collects trash in her apartment , and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason . Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch , he has a regular job but ca n't afford a place to live , he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains , and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters . It was as if the director / screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange , like outcasts , outsiders ; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood . And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna 's distaste for genitals , male and female . The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother , well that was reasonable.Technically , there were some problems . The audio was absolutely awful , the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded . This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters , sadly the dialog was frequently muddy . This was a simple shoot , very few locations or sets ; the video store , the car , the apartment complex entrance , and the apartment . The director did not use framing to her advantage at all , Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story ; but yet she ends up in random frame positions . There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt . Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming , butted up against a jump cut to a much later time . The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm . One moment the camera is in the apartment , the next in Jason 's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers , oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included . A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I 've ever heard . This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes , the movie is a bit long . The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard . The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers . Oddly , there is virtually no nudity in the film . Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film ; write , direct , star in , and over play a not so bad love story . Just not a very well made film .	-1
Very stupid , i just did n't get it , maybe I 'm old school and epected something romantic to follow . 2 co-dependant people with issues , hard to grasps !	-1
We ejected this movie after 30 minutes when we first tried to watch it.Then we saw the mostly favorable reviews here on AMAZON.comSo we tried to watch it again.We lasted until about 60 minutes the second time trying to watch it and finally gave up.I think my wife 's exact words were ... `` OK , enough already . You have to put something else in to watch . This is stupid and I do n't care what happens to these losers '' .	-1
113 people on Amazon rate this show a 5 star , .. people PLEASE ! This show is so lame , .. I ca n't believe it is not on Prime.I am sorry I even paid for one season.Pathetic !	-1
I found this series opener full of the usual American empty characters and gratuitous emotion . No substantive plot . Plus , it was constantly interrupted by the Amazon downloading . I did not finish it .	-1
This is one of those shows that needs to grow on you . So far it has n't found any arable land here . I 'm being patient and maybe somebody will sprinkle me with fertilizer in the future .	-1
This series is just alright . The acting is good and the characters are good but it is just alright . It isnt overly funny and it is n't real serious- it is sort of in the middle . I mildly enjoyed to pass the time but I would n't pay more than the membership to watch it .	-1
I do n't know quite what I was expecting , but this first episode was ok , but not particularly entertaining . It was n't really bad , so maybe others will like it more than I did .	-1
This show is weird . They just get off on blowing things up and crashing vehicles . Thousands of dollars in every crash are being wasted that could be used for a good purpose .	-1
I love the high school kids , I love the music . . . so much I found my eyes misting up . Ya . . . and I want them to win the Glee Club competition sooooo much.I 've fallen in love . . .Hey . . . I 'm a vet , I love military history , The Alien Trilogy , The Terminator Trilogy and Battlestar Galactica . I want to see the wall pasted with the bad guys.Can this really be happening . . . : ) Note : At this moment I am pretty disappointed . I cancelled my subscription to Glee . . . the pilot was definitely a 4 star in my book . But the following series went downhill , IMO . The music changed , the plot seemed to get muddled and uninteresting . But especially the music . . . totally different . Mostly an obscure collection of semi-modern lyrical . Just disappointing	-1
Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before , the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind . The plots are awfully dull , even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times . The performers are fantastic at singing and I enjoy many of the songs that they have covered , but the plots of the episodes are awfully bland to me . Other people might think differently , but that is just my opinion . I like the singing ; just not the series itself .	-1
I do n't like this show . I tried it but not worth my time . I know a lot of people love it but its jaunt not my thing .	-1
This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens . These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch . Her comedy is a raw , edgy , intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol , Disney teeny bopper shows , and show tunes , watch this . If not , run for the hills ! Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID .	-1
I love the Terminator Series . And it is FUN to have a bit more of the story to think about and enjoy . However , there is so little story , and so much video game action , that you really can never stop thinking that you are in a video game , and not `` watching a movie with a story and a plot . '' To be clear , this is NOT a video game . It is a fan-fiction type of story that was made with animation software that you would see in video gaming software . Everything caries that jerky animation quality common to older video games . Still , this is an actual story of several chapters and it is fun in the respect that you are engaged once again in the Terminator Saga.I would give it a C- for a grade for the story . : ( Slow , boring in places ... and it is hard to do that with an action film . The graphics are really not so good . Machima is NOT ready for Movie making in my opinion . The technology is n't there yet . So , graphic images fall flat.Still , it is fun to see more of the classic Terminator series ! ( even if there was no real story , and less visual interest.JJ	-1
Cheap video game quality animation even in HD format . The purchase of this series was a waste of money and time !	-1
I am just not a fan , and think of this along with many other & # 34 ; popular & # 34 ; shows like Sponge Bob as toilet humor tv . Mindless , check . Ridiculously irritating , check . Perfect for the dumb masses , check !	-1
Not real impressed with a cartoon that has an udder on a male bovine . Typical uninteresting and dull cartoon : snooze	-1
I stopped watching Royal Pains ; plots predictable , character development not forthcoming and sidekick brother too 'not bright ' and smarmy . It 's a pretty and shiny series with not much meat . Went back to watching `` Law and Order '' reruns and the new `` Chicago Fire '' . I like genuine characters -- who risk their lives protecting people , who grapple with serious ethical and moral conflicts . I like real heroes .	-1
I just discovered this little gem . I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now , however , I had not taken the time to watch . Today , I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw . I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven ( though not to deep ) type of show . The stories are simple yet realistically believable . There is a certain continuity as well . The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father . I wo n't go into details of the story-lines , however , I will say this show is worth the time , if not the money . However , not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer . There are only 12 - 13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season . It 's the same with all of their shows . The shows are great , but the price is ridiculous . That is not to say that I wo n't purchase the sets , just not at this price . I will wait for a sale or get them used . I refuse to pay more than $ 10 - $ 13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes . The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales . So , if you can wait , it 's well worth your time and investment to own this show.wasitchuRead all my reviews here at Amazon.com , just look for wasitchu .	-1
Everyone was excited Futurama came back , but when the crew went through the black hole they lost all the wit that kept the show interesting before , and I ca n't get the crew 's corpses out of my head because this is what this season represents to me now , a defiled corpse . Really it 's just plain embarrassing to watch now from how stupid and forgettable the entire season is.Like the episode where Leela and Zapp were stuck in the middle of the woods naked , they literally do nothing but sit around naked . When I say Fan , you say Service ! FAN , SERVICE ! FAN , SERVICE ! I guess that 's supposed to substitute for jokes now . Anyone else noticing the sheer amount of cartoon nudity stuffed in each episode ? It 's like they think the reason people love watching the show is to see the characters naked , which is maybe for some of the people who gave this abysmal season 5 stars , but I liked Futurama for the storyline and jokes , which this season is severly lacking in . Instead of story , we get political campaigns ! There 's also the prop infinity episode which is nothing more than the writers getting on their soapbox and telling everyone what to think about Prop 8 . Thanks Futurama , I forgot you were synonymous with political rallies . I mean FFS I 'm not watching Milk here , I 'm watching Futurama ! I do n't CARE about the writer 's political opinions , especially when they have nothing more to say then their opinion on Prop 8 , shut up and get back to being a good show ! Oh and my personal favorite episode the season finale which is probably titled 'mutant pride ' , is an episode where it 's literally just Leela with a microphone yelling `` MUTANT PRIDE , MUTANT PRIDE ! '' . Then the mayor or whoever that 's against mutant pride turns out to be a mutant . Wow , real subtle , I could never connect the dots , thanks Futurama . I swear I 'll go out and vote for whatever you want me to as long as you shut up with the politics and get back to your good old self.What happened to Futurama , when did it go from space adventure comedy to some soft core porn/gay pride rally ? I 'm not against Prop 8 or gays , but LEAVE IT OUT OF THE DAMN SHOW BECAUSE I DO N'T CARE ! Or if you 're going to bring it up do it quick and with subtlety and do n't center episodes after episodes around it . What was once a well written love letter to old sci-fi shows is now nothing more than a corpse , taped together with Prop 8 bumper stickers and shambling around a strip pole trying to be sexy for it 's fans .	-1
i just could not get into this movie . I wonder why it was ever made . Do not bother watching it .	-1
Looking for an edgy TV police show , found a very slick , poorly written and acted show . Lots of potential , none of it realized .	-1
Boring dialog , bad acting , flat characters , and extremely tedious story line do n't add up to anything . I lost interest in the first few minutes , but I kept watching and hoping for something to happen . I was disappointed . It 's definitely beneath Dylan McDermott and Kyle Secor 's talent . I 'm surprised it lasted 2 seasons .	-1
After watching the first episode I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode . I made it through about 15 minutes and knew this was not for me . It seems to be a dark mafia type show . Some people may enjoy all the & # 34 ; shoot them up & # 34 ; but after watching The Glades and Justified Dar Blue just does n't measure up . I would not recommend it .	-1
Not a fun series to watch . Too much heavy drama . I guess there are no good people left in the world and these deeply undercover cops are the only blue line left .	-1
I have never watched this , but I know it eats dirt . How ? Cause I read every 5 and 4 and 3 star review . Is n't it sad how we are manipulated ? Ok. Say it is given 5 stars and you get all excited and and watch 2 hours and realize its a dog . Who gains ? ? Does Amazon pay something each time anyone watches anyepisode ? mmmmm ? I really do n't know but I suspect and so should you .	-1
It could n't keep my kids ages 3-14 entertained , it was a waste of time . watched different apposed and it was the same . it 's not like the old one	-1
Seeing as SpongeBob SquarePants has still remained so overwhelmingly popular after all of these years , I know I may receive a few negative votes from customers for my negative critique . But , before you press that unhelpful voting button ( which , please , do n't do until you have read my entire review ) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series . At the beginning of its lengthy run , it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you , and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes . Sadly , that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years , the program has underwent a deterioration in quality ( I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants ) . The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced ( stupidity , greed ) as pointed out by many other people , and the episodes and specials have a `` rushed '' feel to them . They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons ( which , albeit they may not bother many other people , enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series ) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid . The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny , and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart . If you want to watch SpongeBob SquarePants episodes , watch the earliest seasons if you want to be truly entertained . I genuinely apologize to anyone who may have been offended , but it 's just the way I feel . I 'm very sorry and hope I did not insult anyone .	-1
I hate it and I think its a horrible show . Makes me want to hurt the writers and the creators .	-1
I personally think there are better family and educational cartoon shows out there for young children . This is n't a program that is watched very often at our house .	-1
I usually love Robin Williams , which is why we started watching it . But it was so depressing that we turned it off about 15 minutes into the movie . It may say hilarious , but the whole time we saw it , there was not one funny line .	-1
I think this is the lowest rating I 've ever given a Robin Williams movie . Sorry , but I really did not like much of anything about it except Robin.Lance Clayton ( Robin Williams ) is a writer who has never been published , and an English teacher at the same school his douchebag of a son attends . The pejorative is Lance 's , and it is deserved . Kyle ( Daryl Sabara ) is a spoiled , foul-mouthed , scheming , brat who is obsessed with all sorts of sexual kinks , among them hanging himself while masturbating . I know there 's a technical term for it , and I lost a friend to the thing . It 's of course very dangerous , because one can accidentally kill himself.And that 's exactly what Kyle did . His father walked in on him doing this almost-hanging thing once , and was shocked , and told him how dangerous it was . Kyle blew off his father 's advice just like he blew off everything his father said . But one day he did indeed accidentally kill himself.So Lance arranged the body as if it was a real suicide instead of an accidental one , and wrote a suicide note for Kyle , so that no one would have to know how perverted the kid was . Then one of the students ( or was it one of the teachers ? ) discovered the suicide note in the police records and published it . They had all hated Kyle , but now it turns out he was a gifted writer and a tortured kid . He had only one friend , who was as much afraid of him as everyone else , was not doing well in school , disgusted all the girls , and had a serious case of the hots for his father 's girlfriend , the art teacher ( Alexie Gilmore ) .Inspired , Lance wrote an entire journal for Kyle , full of teenage angst , which Claire ( the art teacher ) encouraged him to publish . They did , and passed it around the school , and made a sensation , and Lance was invited onto a TV show to talk about it , and . . .Oh , I 'm giving too much away . It 's listed as a comedy , and I suppose it is in a dark sort of way , but I did n't find it all that funny . Robin Williams does his best , but I do n't think anyone could have given this film a focus that would hold up to the seriousness of the topics . Yes , troubled teens are a major problem , and everyone wants to try to keep them from committing suicide , but I 'm not sure this is the way .	-1
I do n't know why this movie was made . If you are expecting some funny Robin Williams bits , FORGET IT . The movie deals with teen suicide . The victim is Robin 's son . Robin is a father with zero parenting skills . While the son is a suicide victim , when you see how obnoxious he is , you would hope he becomes a murder victim . What a terrible waste of film . Do n't bother watching this one .	-1
Why did they make this movie ? It 's vulgar and not funny . The story is sickening and pointless . Promoting this movie as `` Hilarious '' is disgusting and highly deceptive . Avoid like a plague .	-1
( 1 . ) Dumb ; not a comedy no matter how bombastically distorted the characters were. ( 2 . ) No lesson or message to be learned in these absurd caricatures. ( 3 . ) Only the genetic abnormalities found in the world of Hollywood and it 's hanger-oners would find the perversions of romance a fascinating story .	-1
No , I did n't give this a low rating because I want to see Mork and Mindy . No , not because it has auto-erotica . No , not because I do n't like dark humor . I gave it a low score because ... well ... because it just was n't & # 34 ; hilarious & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; wonderful & # 34 ; , or & # 34 ; bold & # 34 ; . I gave it 2 stars because I 'm feeling generous , but if I go on much longer I will change my mind .	-1
The son of Williams in this film is so troubled and so rediculous he hates everyone and everything in life including himself . But the anti-homophobic [ ... ] he uses in the first 30 minutes of the film is nearly 30 times . It seemed to me it was a film about hating everyone and a kid so far out of control there was no help ... Williams must have needed the paycheck to pay for his heart surgery ... this film is a bottomless pit of insult and a whacked out kid who mistreats everyone including his dad ... and the dad seems to be caught up in his own selfish rediculous life ... . is this the way Americans are ? ? Sure seems it . What a let down . What an insult for an actor to take a role than try to tell us how genuis it was for a homophobic film to be put out ... would we say the same if the word [ ... ] was used instead of the fag word ... ? As a gay male this is something the Catholics would love to see and bigots are sure to give a great review . For me an open minded free thinker ... this is a waste of life and time . I gave it two stars for the acting BUT ... ( and butts come in all sizes ) I doubt Amazon will post it .	-1
It amazes me that such an amazing actor can star in such crap sometimes . This and the one where he works in the photo shop ... .crap ! ! !	-1
Robin Williams is good in this role , and it 's not the first time he has balanced a bit of humor with a serious subject . But , since I ca n't give it 0 stars , I give it what it deserves , because even though there is a laugh or two , in reality it is a HEAVY drama with tragic story lines . So do n't watch this expecting laughs like I did , and maybe you wo n't be disappointed . It is extremely depressing , and if I had watched this while depressed , this movie would have made it much worse.And , by the way , to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie does n't live up to expectations , I say this : It is described as a COMEDY . Not dark humor . Not black comedy . Not even `` intelligent humor '' as another reviewer said . If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing , with ONLY a laugh or two , I would n't have been expecting one of Robin Williams ' comedies . I 'm fully aware of his amazing ability to do comedy as well as drama , but I do n't like to see a `` comedy '' movie about suicide , accidental or otherwise . ( and BTW who knows for SURE it was accidental anyway ? ? ? ) There is NOTHING funny about suicide . Chances are pretty good that I would have passed it by had I known it was so dark . And that may just be the point , right ? ? ? Make people think they are getting one of Robin Williams ' comedies , which are gems , and are MUCH harder to act than the dramas .	-1
Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver-screen , but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy , that 's very hit or miss . In World 's Greatest Dad , Williams plays an English Teacher , who covers up his son 's bizarre and embarrassing death . The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper , making his loser son , an overnight sensation . Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this , but even he ca n't save this one . The story is just ridiculous , his son ( Daryl Sabara ) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead . No one would all of a sudden care , just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note . It 's also extremely unrealistic , since his son was as stupid as they come . That being said , with the exception of newcomer , Eric Martin , the rest of the supporting cast was awful , making the film that much more unrealistic . World 's Greatest Dad may have landed it 's star , but it 's a sloppy movie , that really does n't make a whole lot of sense . It 's an hour and a half of pure torture , with the occasional funny scene that 's all Robin Williams . This is one film that just starts out slow , never gets going and is anything but the `` hilarious '' , `` wonderful '' film that I was expecting .	-1
I rated the movie a one . I love Bobcat and Williams is an excellent actor . But , I saw no value in the movie except for maybe the last minute and a half . It is not a dark comedy , I adore dark comedy . I rented the movie `` This must be the Place '' and that was a good movie with dark comedy . There was also plenty of depth . This movie was about the human condition . Exaggerated maybe , but rotten kids are sometimes just a fact of reality . The actions of the father were pretty much unforgiveable so he was just as horrible in his own way . People can read what they want to into the movie to justify recommending it , but there was really nothing beneath the surface and there was nothing worth laughing at ; even in sarcasm . As a matter of fact , they were two people I 'd rather not know , and that includes the hour plus minutes I spent staring at them via the computer monitor .	-1
I generally enjoy `` north of the border '' movies and am generally generous with my stars . The antagonist has potential as an actor so keep going fella . The movie started well and had a good story going for the most part . For me , it all took a nose dive during that last third of the movie and never recovered . It was n't insulting so give it a rainy day watch and post your comments to calibrate mine one way or another ...	-1
I spent the whole time waiting for a point . There was none . Some of the acting was okay , but ultimately something was lacking . It just did n't make much sense and was not interesting . The whole concept had potential , so it was disappointing that it did n't deliver . It dragged on so much that I had the feeling that the story could have been better told in half an hour rather than an hour and a half . I 'm glad it was free to watch .	-1
While overall I found the series to be mostly entertaining there were a few characters who really grated me with their apparent lack of importance to the series story or their characters personalities in the show itself , mostly with the apparent uselessness of Claire and the conniving mother of the Petrelli brothers who you really wished the character Sylar would kill ruthlessly but which never happened . This season like with the third tried to give us a new foil to match the villain Sylar with dubious results but much better then the third season second villain who at the end was pathetically killed off easily , the fourth season new villain could have been better written but all in all was n't truly horrible . If you have the seasons 1-3 I would actually say just stick with those as while you can add on the fourth overall the episodes were pretty bland and though you 'll get some more heroes episodes to watch you 'll still probably feel a little cheated regardless .	-1
Just continues to go down hill . I can see why the network did not renew . A disappointing finish to a show with a great potential .	-1
They should have released this as a animated movie and not a motion comic . The story deserves that . I bought thinking it was a movie I had missed .	-1
I ordered this before I realized it is a video comic . I am not a fan of video/digital comics and this is the reason for the low rating . I did not finish watching it when I realized what it is .	-1
99 cents for 10 minutes or less , interesting concept `` what if superman 's ship had landed in Russia and he grew up under that type of totalitarian regime '' -- but you only get a few minutes of story and the rest in screen credits , not worth 99 cents	-1
episodes are only $ 1 but its pretty slow kinda hard to watch ... and for being only like 10mins it def is not worth it at all	-1
Welcome to the ADD format . The `` episodes '' are about three minutes long ; two per download . Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over . Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row . An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format .	-1
After watching this soapy , relationship-entangled space opera for five endless hours , I happened to glance at my watch to notice that only five minutes had passed.Award yourself the `` Purple Heart For Patience '' if ( like myself ) you somehow manage to stick with this turkey to its distant , disapopinting conclusion , for the purpose of finally discovering the nature of its ... '' UNIMAGINABLE MYSTERY , '' which the creators of the series -- from one grueling episode to another -- keep dangling enticingly before you.Perhaps the one and only redeeming feature about DEFYING GRAVITY is the immense sense of gratification and relief -- and `` lightness '' -- you 're likely to experience after recommending it to ( i.e. , inflicting it on ) your worst enemy .	-1
Other reviewers who have called this series 'Melrose Space ' have labeled it exactly as I would . I wanted to like the show ; the actors and set production on the space ship are really attractive to look at but ... its an empty shell when your all finished with the show . I like Ron Livinston from Band of Brothers and he 's fine here as is his narration that accompanies each episode . But these astronauts spend most of their time on earth pursuing the opposite sex and acting like stupid college kids when they go to the 'astronaut bar ' every night after work . I 'm just an 'average ' sci-fi fan so my view is when its good -- like Battle Star Galactica , its good . And when its not -- like Defying Gravity , its not . And one more thing , in sci-fi above all else , you have to get the `` alien '' whatever that is or looks like , you have to get it 'right ' , it has to scare you or blow your mind in some way . And in Defying Gravity when we finally get to the 'alien ' , the threat to the crew , its a 'dud ' , its about as 'scary ' as a piece of almond rocca candy , only in this case the candy is the most powerful thing in the Universe -- yawn . Get the first season of `` SGU '' ( stargate universe ) with Robert Carlyle -- I did , and it was WAY better than Defying Gravity and probably why its second season is showing on TV now !	-1
Same plot over and over again . My husband watches it but it seems very boring to me . Needs more plot variety .	-1
Boring , boring and boring . The script look like a recreation of a classic mexican movie but is not . This movie is worst .	-1
Even a bad movie can be good but this is n't even bad good . Not worth the bother no redeeming cheesiness .	-1
Trying to address mental illness is very tough in any context and I applaud the effort . The shortcomings ( in my opinion only ) are that not all mental health patients should disregard medications that may make them less stressful on the caretakers . I understand the husband agreeing to the absence of medication but I am not sure I like the idea of the children ( who were not asked their opinion before birth ) having to find coping mechanisms for dealing with a parent who is so obviously ill ; I speak from personal experience on the subject . If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults ( and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time ) should have been paid . It is very complex situation and hardly fair to try to cover it in a one hour tv show but at least it brings the conversation forward and , as I said I applaud the effort . Thank you .	-1
Season One of Lie to Me was promising . The premise was interesting , the plots engaging and Tim Roth is a wonderful actor . However , by Season Two , the flaws that are inherent in a show about someone who ALWAYS knows when people are lying started to wreak havoc . ( Hey , why bother with a judicial system ? Just have Lightman ask , `` Did you do it ? `` ) The main problem with Lie to Me is that Cal Lightman is the only character who is interesting . I mean , what do the rest of them actually DO ? There are twenty or so people running around a fancy office suite that is called the `` Lightman Group '' but where 's the group ? They 've got an intern , Eli Loker , whose job it is to look scruffy . Although , later he gets promoted to `` vice-president '' after a year of being an UNPAID intern . ( I should only be so lucky . And who 's president anyway ? Who 's on first ? ) Torres is obviously window dressing . ( She does n't even have any training in psychology -- let alone acting . ) And Lightman 's partner , Foster , is there to say `` I feel your pain '' and stumble around on 6-inch stilettos . ( To be fair , all the women in the show wear 6-inch stilettos . And do n't get me started on the collagenized lips . ) And because Lightman is the only person with brains , the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do ( i.e . almost kissing , nearly kissing , finally kissing ) which did n't require any . Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two , it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing . First , Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state . ( That NEVER happens in real life . With joint custody , neither parent can move the child out of state . Did n't these people watch Boston Legal ? ) Having paid off his wife , his business is about to collapse . ( What is his business anyway ? Why does he need all those people ? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they 're thinking , why does he need all that equipment ? ) So , he gets involved with Clara , who has scads of money but is dumb as a post . ( They eventually get rid of Clara because she really , really ca n't act . She just has these enormous LIPS , which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT . ) Then , Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians ( who were n't from Peru , by the way . They were home-grown Latinos . You could tell by the accents , and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years , give or take a decade . ) Now Lightman 's afraid of losing custody of his daughter ( When did he get custody ? I thought his ex had custody ) . So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group ( doing what exactly ? ) breaks the law not just once , but several times , so Lightman can keep his daughter . ( Although , frankly , I 'd give her up . She 's an airhead , and that `` deer caught in headlights '' look wears thin after awhile . And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father 's office ? Does n't she go to school ? ) But the agent does n't get fired , because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer , withholding evidence , obstructing justice ... you know , all those little things you 'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies , logic errors and contrivances , the plots got increasingly incoherent , until NOBODY could follow what was going on . Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place . Even if you think you know what the stories are about , you really do n't , because nothing the characters do makes any sense ... not in this world or the next . ( Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone . Why not just go and talk to her ? ) And when you have n't got a decent story , the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character ( all you Buffy fans know what that word means ) . Now he 's a psychologist , now he 's a former criminal , now he 's Rambo , now he 's a gambling addict , now he 's an overprotective father , now he 's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs , terrorists , and psychokillers until , you hope , the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop , because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth . ( sigh )	-1
This show is terrible , shoddy acting , unbelievable storylines , the montages with awful cover songs , etc etc.1 . The supposed `` good guys '' are gun brokers to gangs and murderers in their own right , I could care less about them . That 's one of the main things that makes a series good is that you actually care about the characters but these guys are such scumbags all around it 's actually painful to watch . I 'm glad they lost overall at the end of this season . I was hoping for a better second season but this was worse than the first one and that 's saying a lot . I wo n't be wasting time on this series anymore . Glad I only borrowed it.2 . It 's a sad thing to see the cops in the back pockets of these gangsters . It 's embarrassing to see the Chief of Police following them around and even taking part in their crimes , a little todie . He even rats out his own `` brothers '' the FBI and ATF to this gang , endangering not just the informers lives but the lives of fellow law enforcement officers , awful . This is supposedly to protect some town from the real world ? As long as they kill outside of city limits its OK with the police ? I 'd be afraid to live in a town like this , who knows what 's next with the corrupt police and this biker gang . The cops even look the other way when someone is about to be killed ? Even if Sobel is a bad guy what self respecting police officer would do that ? The process of the law is one thing among others that makes us a society but this show seems to think it 's all OK if one set of bad guys kills another or you 're `` protecting '' a town , ugh ! Murder is wrong no matter who does it and who it is done to.3 . The constant song montages are so cheesy and overdone , ugh ! ! The covers are awful as well . Just a filler so everybody can LOOK so deep in emotion and to be pitied , etc . Weak minded people love this stuff.4 . Trying to make criminals into family men and righteous vigilantes etc is so terrible . I was sickened by all the hugs and love yous between criminal killers I wanted to gag ! This show is so embarrassing to watch . I 'm just sorry I gave this POS another seasons worth of my time.5 . A doctor turns into a helper for a criminal gang and even assaults and threatens hospital staff when she 's reprimanded for it ? Please . She needs to take that stick out of her a.. as well I 've never seen a character so constipated before ! The shallowness of it is so obvious , the characters are wooden ( Clay ) or miscast ( Jacks ) . Genna , mother Sons , is such a lowlife it 's another layer of BS that makes me dislike this show so much.If you want a realistic and well done drama you need to go to the premium channels . Boardwalk Empire , Game of Thrones , etc . For a decent but not great regular cable drama I like Justified . But this is just tripe.It 's sad to see so many weak minded lovers of this tripe , good maybe it keeps you busy watching the tube so you do n't do more damage to society by your idiocy .	-1
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW IT 'S SO UPROARIOUSLY GUT-BUSTINGLY KNEE-SLAPPINGLY GOOD ! I ALSO LOVE DAVE 'N BUSTERS , THEIR FOOD IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE STEAK ESPECIALLY FROM DAVE AND BUSTERS ; DAVE AND BUSTERS IS GREAT LIKE THIS SHOW ! I ALWAYS ORDER THE COORS LIGHT FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS , IT TASTES SO REFRESHING DOWN MY THROAT AFTER I ORDER A DELICIOUS STEAK FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS ! I 'M NOT SURE WHY BUT EVERYTIME I WATCH SEASON 5 OF IT 'S ALWAYS SUNNY I CA N'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS DAVE 'N BUSTERS IS AS WELL AS COORS LIGHT ! BTW GO TO DAVE 'N BUSTERS AND ORDER THE STEAK AND A COORS LIGHT , YOU WO N'T REGRET IT !	-1
This used to be hilarious . Now it is simply obnoxious . The series is no longer funny at all . This is mainly due to Danny De Vito . This is a sad development for a series that was extremely funny .	-1
We live in Philadelphia and also like Danny DeVito . We do n't watch network t.v . comedies . SO I do n't know if this is what is considered good , funny t.v . these days . But this just seemed like going through the motions . There were a few laughs . But mostly it was just annoying to watch .	-1
Wow ... I ca n't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series ... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $ 20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn .	-1
started watching this and just did n't feel like finishing . What could have been an interesting storyline was very disjointed , jumping back and forth in time , pretty graphic sex scences that do n't add anything to the story ...	-1
This is the second time I 've started watching this . I could n't watch it , too much suffering and sadness . Nothing that I would recommend .	-1
I guess if you like suffering and in dept turmoil you might like this movie . I thought it was very simplistic and shallow . How others thought it was deep is beyond me . I might have missed something , but from what I saw it was n't well scripted or thought out . More action and explicit explanations might have helped . I know these things happen it 's just the movie wants to wallow in the morass of confusion instead of anything deeper .	-1
Great cast - great acting , but ? ? ? ? ? ? Maybe after watching it another time it will make more sense and all the jumping around wo n't bug me as much the first time ?	-1
Movie lasts less than 2 hours . Seemed like 3 hours . Characters and script generally not believable . This is directorial debut of a screenwriter . Lack of directorial experience shows . Excellent cast wasted .	-1
Could not figure out what the story line was . Movie hopped around the lives of several different women and different time lines . I could not follow it and turned it and off after about 30 minutes .	-1
Started out decent . Timothy Hutton really loses his acting ability in this one . He delivers lines like he just read them or someone is holding cue cards off screen . Obviously just made this one for the pay check . Many of the supporting actors seem to have no acting ability either . However , Miguel & Aacute ; ngel Silvestre is very good . The dialog lets him down at times but have to give him a well done on his acting . Not familiar with his other movies but will definitely find more of his films .	-1
We stopped watching after the protagonist , played by Benedict Cumberbatch , and his brother 's spiky widow , with whom he had been edgily squabbling for a long time , and to whom he had whinged about feeling rejected , suddenly embraced each other passionately and lunged into bed .	-1
I read some of the other reviews before watching this and although they warned about the later parts of the series , I found even the beginning unclear and poorly developed . We watched the first episode only and could n't be bothered to follow up any further . It simply was not entertaining and that is all we wanted it to be .	-1
Not sure what is the point of putting things like this on the internet . Spend your time staring into the sun . You will have find it more fulfilling .	-1
I was looking for more of a sneak peak and not so much of an interview with the actors . Not what I wanted .	-1
This is clearly a Thai film ! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired ! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line . Mainly at the end . It 's like Rambo without the guns . Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses . The costumes were fantastic though . I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa 's previous movie `` The Protector '' ! Now that was amazing . This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers . Perhaps 12-18 years of age ? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony ! That 's gon na be good ! ...	-1
Sorry , I like `` Californication '' , but something happened in this season , the whole thing was a like a bad parody of itself . Where it 's possible it might have been able to suspend one 's disbelief about this show before ... it is not possible any more , you just have to watch this season and try to enjoy it for the cartoon it is.Speaking of cartoons ... . I bought this factory sealed and new from Amazon , and the video is absolutely horrible . I thought I was watching this series on You-Tube ... back a few years . The resolution was terrible and the pixelation was unendurable . I checked the disks and they looked fine physically , so this must have been a mastering job done by a complete incompetent . Can anyone else comment on this ... I just really could not believe a brand new DVD set just out this year could be done so poorly.If you have to see this I do n't know what to tell you , all I can do is relate my experience . Very sorry I spent the money .	-1
If they take out the swearing and sex , there would be no show - thin , thin story line . I would not watch another episode for FREE !	-1
A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle . I 'll pass . I do n't need this crap entertainment .	-1
It 's not you , it 's me ... The first two seasons were intriguing and a curiosity but as of season three , I am over it .	-1
This is about a father who is into substance abuse who seems to think it is ok to pass these traits to his kid . It shows how irresponsible the left coast is . We can say what a wonderful performance . Does n't anyone look at the substance of the show . If you try to live by the golden rule these folks live by the it 's all about me . If this is the real world.God help America .	-1
I have very mixed emotions over this latest entry into the long-running and much-beloved Stargate franchise . I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination . As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me . And yes , we even liked `` Atlantis '' .The Syfy channel promoted this show as an `` edgier '' Stargate . I found that this did not work for me . The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention . Stories that were once fun , adventurous , full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier , darker , gloomier , smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully . What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling `` Atlantis '' . And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was `` edgier '' . `` Edgy '' can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate . `` Edgy '' can mean daring , provocative , and/or avant-garde . But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant . And much of this `` Universe '' seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example : One early entry went something like this . `` OK , we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore '' ... `` Oh look , its one of those Ancient 's Chairs , I wonder where this will lead ? '' We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian , a fist fight over infidelity , and `` Oh snot , my girlfriend is a stripper '' .As the second-season cancellation decisively proved , this new and `` improved '' model was not the way to have gone . Yes , this was not `` your grandfather 's Stargate '' but as it turned out it was n't my teenage sons Stargate either . Those of us who wanted `` edgy '' adult science fiction got it from `` Battlestar Galactica '' . Sometimes it is possible to `` break the mold '' and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that 's a shame . First off , because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique , interesting and fun . It should never have ended so suddenly . Lastly , the second season of `` Universe '' seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise . It was just unfortunate that it could n't survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like `` Ark of the Truth '' and `` Continuum '' to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up . Though promised , I fear we will never see these . In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note : You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by `` Amazon 's Verified Purchase '' notation . I confess . I love the Stargate franchise so much , and even though these two seasons are woefully inferior , there were cameos that forever connect it and therefore makes it necessary to have in the collection . I just waited till Amazon had a crazy sale to buy them .	-1
This series has none of the draw of the two previous , mostly because the characters have absolutely no depth , nor does there seem much of a chance that any will be developed . There 's simply nothing to connect with . There 's not a single figure who is likeable , funny , worthy of loathing ... nothing . I gave it five episodes , and that 's it . Too bad ; `` Stargate '' and `` Stargate Atlantis '' ranks as two of my favorite TV shows of all time . This stunk .	-1
This is the soap opera of sci fi . One reviewer said it was Battlestar Gallactica mixed with Stargate : I think this was supposed to be Deep Space Nine . The first episodes were somewhat interesting , yet full of pretty speculative assertions and at least one enormous assumption . Yeah , the Air Force has put some kind of a puzzle into your video game and if you solve it , they just might kidnap you . Pretty sure that is n't happening , so put the controller down and get out into the sunshine kiddo . They also put all kinds of tired liberal clich & eacute ; s into the writing . The guy who beats his kid because of his Desert Storm experience ? Well , they do n't know much about actual abuse stats , but that is sort of the way an out of touch Hollywood writer type sees the world . And by the way , not all black soldiers are abusive , unless we 're talking Hollywood . The worst problem was bringing back O'Neill as some kind of serious bureaucratic jerk . I wish I could just wash this out of my brain .	-1
I really enjoyed the various incarnations of Stargate-until SGU . I hate to say it but SGU is just plain boring . The plots are sadly lacking and there is just no chemistry . The actors do a good job with what they have to work with but it is just not enough . I watched eight episodes hoping it would get interesting before I gave up . I would n't buy this series in any form no matter how cheap they offered it .	-1
I really liked SG-1 and I liked Atlantis even more . And after watching Atlantis for the second time I decided to go ahead and try to watch universe . I agree it is somewhat like BG although honestly I loved that series . This is almost work to watch . It complicated and annoying and dark . BG was dark too but it moved right along . Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy . I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it . SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it 's not fun at all . I 'll try to keep going but if they do n't get off that ship soon I 'll have to quit . I 'm up to episode `` Life '' and so far overall the series sucks . Half way through the season , there is no one moment of joy so far . I 'm going to skip to the last episode of season one and then hope season 2 is better .	-1
